The #1 argument iv seen is &quot;Omfg I hate going against premades, this system is broken!&quot;.** So i did some researching and looked through 6 of my friends match histories, going through 5 ranked games per account (30 total) and found that only 6 games showed 3+ premades, in all of these 4 cases my friends had either a duo of their own or, 3+ players queued up with them. This leads me to believe that premades are being matches against other premades, and shows that a solo player has a very small chance to play against anything more than a duo. These results obviously don&#039;t mean that everyone on league will have the same results, but it does open my eyes to something that seems very clear.  \n\nIt seems to me like the people who just happen to be on loss streaks, lose promotions or stay stuck in the same rank, all Coincidently enough get premades matched against them. This leads me to believe that they may have run into a duo or 3 man and from there on they convinced themself each loss must be because they have a 5 man premade. I think this is a scape goat for players to fall back when they don&#039;t perform at a level that progresses their rank/mmr.\n\n\n**Second most used argument iv seen is &quot;Dynamic Queue makes it so Solo players have less of an impact on the game&quot;**\n\nLeague of legends is a game that i believe is really hard to define if its based more on teamwork or solo play. On one hand, the game is obviously meant to be teamwork orianted, but putting 5 players who have never met in a grueling 20-60 minute match clearly shows how poorly that teamwork aspect works out in reality. People constantly get at eachothers throats, calling names and even putting other players down to the point where they lose convidence in themselves completely.  Seems to me like the full teamwork aspect is only really captured in the lcs. I believe when your playing ranked that you almost constantly need to have a large solo impact on the game to truly climb the ranks and it&#039;s really always been this way. However i don&#039;t think having a large solo impact is the actual point...  It&#039;s about working together with other players to rotate and take objectives, devise a stratagy on how you plan to beat the other team and finally excute that plan. No one player should shine that much above everyone else, because your only as strong as your weakest link.\n\n\n\n**Now what is actually valid throughout this Dynamic Queue hate? **Well boosting is definitly an issue and anyone could clearly see how a system like this does nothing but promote it. However i would like to point out that a large majority of games have boosting involved with them and their will ALWAYS be a way around any rules a company attempts to make to stop the boosters, none the less it should still be tweaked.  \n\n\n\nConclusion:  Dynamic Queue does have issues, but do these issues really expand to the extent that people coincidently have constant premade games? The answer is pretty unlikely.  Solo Queue doesn&#039;t seem like a horrible idea, but does it really fix the core issues this game has? I think no... the problem with this game is how toxic this community has gotten and how little everyone cares about their fellow teammate. You don&#039;t see others working together, giving friendly constructive criticizim and trying to boost eachothers moral, what you actually see if 5 players who have made eachother more of the enemy than the ACTUAL enemy. League of legends puts us in these long matches where tensions do nothing but build up until another player completely goes off on someone, whether they did something wrong or not.  I feel like the ranked experiance would be a lot better if this community got its shit together :/","replies":[]}
