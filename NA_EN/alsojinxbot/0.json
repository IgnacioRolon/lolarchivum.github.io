Usually, when people are lagging, the game stops for a moment, ping goes super high and then suddenly its speeds back up. My ping stays at 60 which isn't bad at all and my fps also at 60. Everything around me gameplay wise keeps going with no issues, i just can't control my characters abilities or movement. I can however move the camera and watch others while i wait for it to stop.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-24T23:00:22.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though your ping might look okay, you can still have major packet loss which can cause input delays like what you're seeing.
