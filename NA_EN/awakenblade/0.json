However, you cannot do it on the boards as it's against [the rules](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/4LgZ2EwM-universal-rules). I would recommend removing the screenshots so that you don't get in-trouble for doing the right thing. This is for privacy reasons and to stop public witch hunting.\n\nJust so you are aware, Riot does track people who have an abnormal amount of people dodge the queue while they are in it. So eventually, if they do that enough they'll get punished for it.\n\nIf you want to bring this to Riot's attention, please [submit a support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and attach the screenshots to it.\n\nHope you don't experience that any time in the near future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AwakenBlade","date":"2015-11-10T00:35:03.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, so I guess dodging was the best choice then since I rather sacrifice 3 LP so that it saves our team from losing freely. Him being last pick and unwilling to comply makes it really difficult for us to play around him. \n\nThanks for answering!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-10T00:26:10.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey AwakenBlade, \n\nWe have all been through this and none of us appreciate a troll, unfortunately there is no way to report them outside of game. The best thing to do, in my experience, is to work with the rest of your team to make a good strategy around the troll. Then at the end of the game after doing the best you can report them at the end of the game. \n\nI know it's not the best answer, but there is no reason any troll should go unpunished. \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[]}]}
