The best way to recover your standing with the system is by playing without leaving.  Your specific issue could be happening for a few reasons, like hardware.  I suggest swapping your mouse to see if it works to rule out the possibility of your mouse being faulty or broken.  \n\nYour config file may also be corrupt, which can also happen if modifications are attempted.  Resetting your config could get this fixed up:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nHope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"pikachu322","date":"2017-03-26T21:19:41.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pls help me for right click !","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gandhi Cakes","date":"2016-10-18T20:53:33.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wasn't just once, it messed up a few times before it gave me the leaverbuster, my mouse works everywhere else in every game other than League, I uninstalled and reinstalled and it is still having issues, I deleted the config folder as you suggested and I am still having issues, I hooked up a seperate mouse and it is still having issues.","replies":[]}]}
