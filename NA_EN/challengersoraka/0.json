Not only does Zhonya's barely negate any damage Zed does, but he can ult you over three times now in the timespan that the active is down (120 seconds, used to be 90 before you Zed mains complained about it) and if he goes full CDR build. Also, he's able to kill you even after you Zhonya, even WITHOUT his ult, so I don't think Zhonya's is really a \"counter\" anymore.\n\nAlso, are you for real? Zed, just like other assassins, **are not meant to be good mid to late game**. They are early champions for a reason. \n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"LetMeCarry1983","date":"2018-10-01T19:11:32.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well this is new....","replies":[]}]}
