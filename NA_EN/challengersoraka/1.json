I know this isn't what she needs but that's something I just remembered.\n\nAnyway getting back to the point yeah I agree, as someone who's been playing her for a long while to have enough experience, I can say that the reason why she's doing badly right now is because of her overall theme design and the current meta. \n\n{{champion:16}} is primarily designed to be a Healer. So let's explore problems...\n\n>* Point 1 - 60% of her kit is all about healing (Q: 20%, W: 20%, R: 20%) which means that more than half of her kit's power can be countered by a set of items \n(Bramble Vest & Thornmail, Executioner's Calling & Mortal Reminder, and Morellonomicon).\n\n>* Point 2 - I know that the counterplay to her healing power was that she had to sacrifice 10% of her Max Health but also having a 70 Mana cost at the highest rank is a bit too much for an ability who's power effectiveness can be shread by 40% overall.\n\nIf she had any other ways of sustaining herself better, then the current % Max Health cost with a high Mana cost on top of that would be more than reasonable. But now when all she has is Wish or Redemption, she can barely save herself or her allies in this case because of this damage meta that has developed over the years.\n\nThe other option would be to remove some of the healing that she has and give her something else but that would be removing parts of what make Soraka, Soraka.
