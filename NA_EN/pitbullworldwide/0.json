I have been wanting to try out the new reworks as well as the new champion select but I do not want to play a game without being able to buy any of these xhampions or at least have runes for the free champions. I have restarted my client several times but still have not received them, what can I do to get these points.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-04T23:22:59.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Pitbullworldwide,\n\nYou'll receive your starter IP/RP after you complete your first match on the PBE.
