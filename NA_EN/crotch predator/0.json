It tells your computer where to go when browsing or gaming online. Sometimes these settings can get borked causing lag in game and patching issues.. This video will show you how to properly configure these settings for League of Legends.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5T95g-sju8","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l5T95g-sju8/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been playing LoL on and off since season 2. Over the years I have experienced several bugs that affect the patcher/launcher and make logging in difficult. They are basically expected every 6 months-ish at this point. For the most part they are fixable with varying degrees of difficulty, and I feel like they mostly fix themselves on their own after a while. (I'm fairly patient when it comes to League's bugs).\r\n\r\nAnyways, ill keep the rest short.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I cannot connect to PVP after entering my username/password. I waited for the next patch to release. I repaired/reinstalled, followed the instructional video, tried other suggestions from people with the same issue. I DID have minor success following the \"ipconfig  /release > ipconfig /renew > ipconfig /flushdns\" method. But that only worked one time only and I got 1 day out of it.\r\n\r\nThe league forms are the last place I'm gonna check before I throw in the towel and call it a day with league.\r\n\r\nIf there are any other known fixes that I missed on youtube/google/reddit etc. please list them here.\r\n\r\nThis is the most annoying fucking thing league has thrown at me in like 3 years of playing.\r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Sinserta","date":"2016-09-24T01:00:22.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.
