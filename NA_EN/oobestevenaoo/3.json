Being the best requires one very obvious and important quality.\n\nAn enviable and majestic beard.\n\nIt&#039;s clearly the most important quality to possess for an individual looking to be the best.\n\nWhich brings us to the main point:\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/thumb/1200/_283ef44460d897e11ed8d87457ed1d9d-png.jpg\n\nGranted, this photo is a bit older, but for those who watched the NA LCS today one thing immediately jumped out. And that was the truly majestic Bjeardsen. With TSM&#039;s captain taking his beard game to the next level I think it&#039;s safe to say that the team&#039;s chances of winning a World Championship have improved, at minimum, 500%.\n\nI&#039;m calling it now, Bjeardsen for the win.\n\nEdit: Couldn't find a good photo of current Bjeardsen, but I did find a link to a youtube video that properly displays his new facial features in their full glory. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhANvErXzCc","replies":[]}
