When the new que method was introduced and the new champ select, the ability to do this was taken away. I am not really sure why. I know there have been many times where either I, or another player has made the comment &quot;Darn! I forgot to buy the skin for the champ I was gonna play.&quot;  I know this isn&#039;t a big issue, and could easily be left out, but I liked being able to do this. This may be something that has been brought up before, and if so I am sorry for creating a new thread on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Zimberfly","date":"2016-11-08T18:15:25.190+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed!
