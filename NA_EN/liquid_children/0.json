As a support main I literally just don&#039;t even try to trade when I&#039;m against a Soraka because I know any meaningful play will simply be negated by her super spammable heal. Her sole purpose is to negate any bad play by her teammates or, conversely, and good play by her opposition. If you make a good engagement and win a trade botlane, it simply doesn&#039;t matter, as she will immediatly heal the ADC to full in seconds. Saying &quot;Focus the Soraka&quot; is unrealistic in laning phase, as she can sit half a lane behind her adc and still be able to do her job. On top of that, and ADC would have to be braindead to not be able to capitalize on the enemy team focusing the support. If you cant burst her immediately you lose, end of story. I would even prefer the old Soraka to the current Soraka, because at least her heal had a meaningful cooldown instead of just being spammable. Now she&#039;s just a braindead healbot that only exists to fix her teammates mistakes. Not only is she frustrating to play against, her gameplay is utter garbage. Its an entire game of running around pressing your w while the enemy team tunnelvisions you, because if they dont they simply lose. Not only is this the opposite of fun, its annoying for the team fighting Soraka.  Something needs to be done about her largely negative effect on any game she&#039;s in, be it balancing or even another rework.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2016-02-29T04:15:30.841+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ugh.

In a structured game this would be easily accomplished, but in the catastrophe that is solo queue roaming to different lanes doesn't always yield results. Furthermore, if you don't make significant plays with your roam, you forfeit your lane and your ADC ends up miles behind the enemy ADC. I feel like any champion who's counterplay is to leave the lane is unhealthy. The ability to inherently win (or at least go even) bot lane is incredibly strong.

You don't win trades unless you can 100-0 the Soraka immediately. And with the falling off of ap supports that is harder than it sounds unless the enemy bot lane makes huge mistakes. And roaming isn't the godly solution you make it out to be. Unless you make a significant play with your roam (which isn't guaranteed in solo queue) you're setting yourself up for failure. Leaving an ADC alone bot lane is forfeiting your lane and adding inherent kill pressure simply by them being 2v1. This can be further punished by a dive, which is incredibly easy with Sorakas spammable heal. At that point you will have lost your lane, which is the point I was trying to make. Soraka lacks meaningful and direct counterplay and forces the bot lane in an unhealthy direction balance wise.

Any damage done to sorakas ADC will be healed up, it's not smart or efficient to bother trading against a Soraka comp. It literally turns into a farm lane (Unless you are able to go for an all in with someone like a leona ignite, but you pretty much have to all in the Soraka, not the adc). \n\nSorakas heals are _not_ costly at all. The mana cost is negligible, and the health cost is only 10% of her max health. She has her natural health regen, plus she always starts coin so she gains health for every minion that dies near her, and she is able to start 3 health pots. I play soraka sup anytime I play sup and shes not banned and NEVER have to back even against a bot lane that tries to harass heavily. (Plus her starcall heals her a LOT also, but this does require her to be in range to use it - which is almost never necesary)\n\nTL;DR: The only option against Soraka is to have a pretty boring farm lane. A second option would be an all in comp, but it's risky because if you fail and don't get a kill you will likely have to back and they won't.

They recently nerfed the range on her Q so she has to be pretty darn close to try and land it.\n\nIf she is somehow magically staying super far back all the time, take Blitz and pull her ADC out of her range to do anything.\n\nShe also can't handle burst. Especially vs AA champs since her only CC is a silence. Nothing is more frustrating as a Soraka than a mid-late game Vayne/Yi. Like there is absolutely nothing she can do vs. them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"swordishforce","date":"2016-02-29T15:33:00.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly i don't really ever have an issue with soraka anymore, i'm not sure if that's because i'm in silver right now or what. Every time I see soraka picked I go naut and alternate harass on soraka/adc and when she is around 60-70% health just wait for a catch and gg she dies. Shes extremely squishy and if you focus her she doesn't have much that she can do to stop you. As long as you don't get hit by starcalls you are making her more susceptible to being all in-ed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mayor Stubbs","date":"2016-02-29T04:09:48.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Seriously I hate this champ right now. Honestly, if they just gave her a small cooldown on her heal (example: 4 seconds after CDR) she would be fine.","replies":[]}]}
