Secondary: Marksmen. Additional Roles: Mage. \nStatistics: Attack Power: 3. Defense Power: 4. Ability Power: 7. Difficulty: 8.\n**Place of Origins:** Voodoo Lands.\n**Upon Selection:** Time to test out my craft on the populist.\n\n**Friends:** {{champion:1}}.\n**Enemies:** None.\n\n**Appearance:** Hilda is a 5’ft tall German woman with short brown hair with her bangs covering her left eyes, her right eye is red while her left eye is grey. She wears a black long coat that has minimal light armor gauntlets, greaves & chest plate, she carries a small backpack on her back that has a small dragon’s skull on it & finally she wears a black scarf with red markings on it wrapped around her neck & shoulders. Her only weapon is a double barrel flint-lock pistol.\n\n***Summoner Spells:***\n{{summoner:4}} & {{summoner:3}} or {{summoner:7}}.\n\n***Item Builds:***\n***Starting Items:***\n{{item:2003}}/{{item:3301}}/{{item:2044}}/{{item:3340}}.\n***Essential Items:***\n{{item:3174}}/{{item:3069}}/{{item:2049}}/{{item:3267}}.\n***Offensive Items:***\n{{item:3001}}/{{item:3025}}/{{item:3078}}/{{item:3091}}.\n***Defensive Items:***\n{{item:3050}}/{{item:3110}}/{{item:3102}}/{{item:3026}}.\n\nHealth: 369(+31). Health Regen.: 2.1(+0.38)\nMana: 268(+30). Mana Regen.: 2.0(+0.37)\nRange: 520(Range). Attack Damage: 34(+2.6)\nArmor: 14(+2.1). Magic Res.: 30(+0)\nAttack Speed: 0.630(+2.2%). Move. Speed: 342.\n\n***Passive: Cursed Bullets.***\nHilda’s double barrel flint-lock pistol has 6 Cursed Bullets in its chamber, each Basic Attack she uses will use 1 Cursed Bullet. Each bullet will deal 45(+5pts per Rank)(+5% bonus AP) additional Magic Damage on each Basic Attack that uses 1 Cursed Bullet, when Hilda runs out of bullets she must Reload another chamber of bullets after 4.75 second delay which will not allow Hilda’s Basic Attacks to deal the additional Magic Damage until the reload is complete. If Hilda has no Mana she can use a certain amount of her Cursed Bullets to cast her Q or W Abilities also this Passive is not affected by Cool Down Reduction.\n> now **Cursed Bullets** is mainly a means of allowing Hilda to help deal decent damage with her Basic Attacks so that she can help her ADC widdle down targets & then set them up for an easy kill while she plays as a Support, if she plays as a Hybrid Damage ADC this Passive can allow her deal short term burst damage. now because this Passive can be used to cast 2 of her Abilities it comes down to Hilda not only managing her own Mana but to manage her Cursed Bullets so that she has enough to make the critical plays.\n\n***Q-Ability: Hex Shot.*** \nRange: Self-Cast.\nCool Down: 8.\nCost: 85 Mana -or- 1 Cursed Bullet.\nMagic Damage: 85/95/105/115/125(+50% bonus AP).\n**Activate:** after Hilda has chosen a single enemy Champion or Neutral Monster within this Abilities Casting Range then upon its activation Hilda will fire a cursed bullet from her double barrel flint-lock pistol, after shooting the bullet it will deal Magic Damage while the curse prevents the target from using Basic Attacks & having their Movement Speed Slowed by 40% for 1.5 seconds.\n> **Hex Shot** is Hilda's main form of damage when it comes to her Abilities & is her main means of hindering her enemies so that both her or her allies can deal damage with no counter attacks from the affected targets Auto-Attacks, because of its short Cool Down this Ability can be spammed although i wouldn't recommend it since the damage is not very powerful & that the duration of the hex is not very long.\n\n***W-Ability: Life Sappers Curse.***\nRange: 450.\nCool Down: 19/18.5/18/17.5/17.\nCost: 55/65/75/85/95 Mana -or- 2 Cursed Pullets.\nDrained Health: 2/3/4/5/6%.\nHeal: 25/30/35/40/45(+40% bonus AP).\n**Activate:** after Hilda has chosen either a single enemy Champion, Minion or an allied Champion, Minion or even herself within this Abilities Casting Range then upon its activation Hilda will fire 2 cursed bullets at the desired target, after the bullets hit the target they will force the targets life force to escape their body starting to drain a percentage of the target Max HP every 0.5 seconds for 2.5 seconds. While the targets HP is being drained that target will create a 250-radius aura that will Heal all allied Champions including Hilda every 0.5 seconds while they remain in the aura.\n> by far **Life Sappers Curse** is Hilda's most complex Ability, as it can be used on either enemies or on allies. now obviously using this Ability on an enemy Champion not only deals small percentage damage to the targets HP but if you have any Melee allies they can take advantage of this curse as the affected target creates a healing aura. now the really tricky plays are gonna be the ones where players will use this on allies or even themselves just to create a healing aura for their teammates when allies have low HP, this of course will leave the ally who is being used as a medical station in jeopardy as they will loose their own HP in the process.\n\n***E-Ability: A Witches Contract.*** \nRange: 450.\nCool Down: 21/20.5/20/19.5/19.\nCost: 65/75/85/95/105.\n**Passive:** every 6th Basic Attack that uses 1 Cursed Bullet will create a temporary Bond between Hilda & her target for 1.75 seconds, while the Bond is active any Healing or Mana Restore that the bonded target gets Hilda will be given the same amount of Healing & Mana Restore.\n**Activate:** after Hilda has chosen a single allied Champion within this Abilities Casting Range then upon its activation Hilda will make a contract with the chosen Champion. This contract will give both Hilda & her ally a 12% increase to their Armor, allowing their Basic Attacks to deal 10% increased damage & have a 25% Movement Speed Boost all for 5 seconds.\n> for self-sustain the Passive effect form **A Witches Contract** allows Hilda to keep her Health & Mana nicely full especially if your opponents are ones with their own means of self-sustain or have any other Heal. the activation portion of this Ability is a great way to just give your teammate that extra kick that will allow them to have better success in fights.\n\n***R-Ability: Black-Woods Embrace.*** \nRange: 750.\nCool Down: 170/160/150.\nCost: 110.\nShield: 125/150/175(+30% bonus AP).\nPhysical Damage: 85/95/105(+30% bonus AD).\n**Activate:** after Hilda has either chosen herself or an allied Champion within this Abilities Casting Range then upon its activation Hilda will cast a spell that encases the chosen target in a full body of armor made from Black-Wood, this Armor will give the target a damage blocking Shield for a 3.5 second duration. For the duration of the Ability the affected Champions Movement Speed is Reduced by 15% & every 3rd Basic Attack that the affected Champion makes will have roots erupt from bellow the attacked target dealing Physical Damage.\n> as a last resort defensive Ability **Black-Wood Embrace** is meant to save teammates by providing a decently powerful shield now while it will allow a targets Basic Attacks to deal Physical Damage the Movement Speed Reduction will hinder the target if they try to run for their lives or make them to slow to catch weaken enemies, so try combo your other Abilities with this Ultimate to give your ally the edge they need.","replies":[{"poster":"Aionius","date":"2015-03-11T02:52:30.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good concept, but these abilities are OP as heck. Even with the 2.25 sec CD, you can still do CDR and shorten it. Plus you're getting major lifesteal and high AP hits, along with massive buffing and healing to the team.

You posted yours not to long from my post which is just suspicious in all ways.\n\nHi Pluie,\n\nI have been an active user on these forums for a couple of years and I've seen Jack post many original concepts over the last few months.  I've never seen him(?) steal or even heavily borrow ideas from anyone else.  There are probably over 500 \"gunslinger\" concepts on these forums, and I'd imagine a great deal of them include reloading and other targeted damage abilities.  Common tropes tend to lead to common kits, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  In any case, I stand by Jack and I don't think he in any way knowingly copied or plagiarized anything from you.","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-03-12T04:37:09.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you Lutzburg, this guy was impossible to reason with","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-03-11T22:39:31.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that is a valid point, but trust me i've seen stranger things than this. like this 1 time a girl & i were at McDonalds & we order the same thing at the same time, after we order we kept saying the same thing for 2 min. but in all honesty trust me this is a major coincidence.","replies":[{"poster":"Pluie Battante","date":"2015-03-12T01:34:04.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-03-12T02:36:45.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the point is strange things happen from time to time including these type of coincidence. & this is not plagiarism cause as i have stated our concepts do have similarities but they have different backgrounds, different back stories, different design philosophies &  different source materials. \n\nso please stop accusing me of ripping off your Champion Concept","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pluie Battante","date":"2015-03-11T20:40:08.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-03-11T21:35:57.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes, this is just a coincidence. \n\nthe Gunsliger theme is free for anyone to use & everyone can have their Champion be German. plus my W is not a double shot its a single shot that has 2 effects, look if the German thing is messing with or whatever i'll change her nationality.
