The first enemy Champion that Pha&rsquo;Rex comes in contact with will have him stop & Knock Back the enemy Champion in the remaining length of the path after dealing Physical Damage, if the enemy Champion gets Knocked into a Wall or Tower the target will take 5% of their Max HP as Physical Damage.\n> be it the Passive or the Activation **Chitin Bulldoze** is what allows Pha&#039;Rex to not engage in fights & knock around enemies but it also allows Pha&#039;Rex to tank damage while the Ability is not on Cool Down or help run from a failed engagement or allow him to keep up with fleeing enemies.\n\n**_W-Ability: Land Shaker._**\nRange: Self-Cast.\nCool Down: 18/17.5/17/16.5/16.\nCost: 60/70/80/90/100.\nMagic Damage: 55/85/115/145/175(+40% bonus AD).\nSlow: 20/25/30/35/40%.\n**Activate:** after Pha&rsquo;Rex has activated this Ability Pha&rsquo;Rex will raise his right leg then slams it on the ground, after a 0.25 second delay after the initial activation Pha&rsquo;Rex will create a 350-radius shockwave that will deal Magic Damage to all enemies within the radius then will be Stunned for 0.75 seconds & then all affected enemies Movement Speed will be Slowed by a set percentage for 2 seconds.\n> **Land Shaker** is a great Ability for Pha&#039;Rex to interrupt entire Team Fights or small skirmishes with the mini-stun & powerful Slow that he can apply while also contributing with decent damage, however it does take good positioning for Pha&#039;Rex to take maximum effect.\n\n**_E-Ability: Stone Wall._**\nRange: 450.\nCool Down: 20/19.5/19/18.5/18.\nCost: 55/65/75/85/95.\nMagic Damage: 95/125/155/185/215(+40% bonus AP).\nWall Length: 400/450/500/550/600.\n**Activate:** after Pha&rsquo;Rex has chosen the wall&rsquo;s current length within this Abilities Casting Range then upon its activation Pha&rsquo;Rex will slam both his arms on the ground, the force of the slam will create an Impassable wall perpendicular to Pha&rsquo;Rexs current position. When the wall is created any enemies within the walls length they will be Knocked Up as well as being dealt Magic Damage, depending on which side of the wall the enemy is on upon its creation the enemy will be knocked on either the front or back side of the wall.\n> for either separating the enemy team or disrupting fights **Stone Wall** is not only a great lane or fight control Ability it is also a great source of damage & minimal Crowed Control with its added Knock Up effect, this Ability is a great way for Pha&#039;Rex to set kills for himself when he combos his Q Ability with this Ability.\n\n**_R-Ability: Aggression Rush._**\nRange: Self-Cast.\nCool Down: 150/130/110.\nCost: 110.\nPhysical Damage: 5/6/7%.\nMovement Speed Boost: 25/30/35%.\nIncreased Armor: 60/80/100.\nIncreased Magic Resist: 70/90/110.\n**Activate:** after Pha&rsquo;Rex has activated this Ability he will start pumping adrenaline chemicals throughout his body after a 0.5 second delay, after the brief delay Pha&rsquo;Rex will gain increased Armor & Magic Resist as well as gaining a Movement Speed Boost when moving towards an enemy Champion while also allowing his Basic Attacks to deal a percentage of her current Attack Damage as Physical Damage for 7 seconds.\n> **Aggression Rush** is what makes Pha&#039;Rex a powerful juggernaut not only in means of being able to survive fights but as will as allow him to deal good damage with his auto-attacks & the increased Movement Speed can be used for either engaging on the enemy team or for fleeing bad situations.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-08T22:22:25.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks pretty solid overall, Jack.  For the ult, it might be worth finding a way to ensure the ability can only be used to engage and be a \"juggernaut\" and not just run away like a pansy.  Maybe increase the movement speed gained but only apply it when Phaorex is moving towards enemies?","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-04-08T23:20:11.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mhhh good point, do you see anything else that you have any questions about?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-08T23:50:51.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JellyJackJak22,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=pUok5Gov,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-04-08T23:20:11.711+0000)\n>\n> mhhh good point, do you see anything else that you have any questions about?\n\nNope, everything else looks pretty solid to me.\n\nIf you wouldn't mind, I'm sure there are still quite a few of my old concepts that you haven't gotten to see yet.
