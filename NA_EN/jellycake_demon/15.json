My notes:\n\nThe passive is a really neat idea (perma debuff on enemies) and one that I have been tinkering with myself.  I think you're on the right track but dealing that much bonus damage (true damage, no less) per auto is really, really strong.  If she gets a single kill at bot lane, it's pretty much GG, which then snowballs  into a 2nd and 3rd kill.  This is difficult to balance around, so I have an alternative idea (though it removes the coolest part of the ability as you have it).  What if she got \"body count\" applied to HER whenever she got a kill?  And the buff lasts 60 seconds or so.  It promotes short sequences of action and even some drawn out team fights, but still disappears when there's a lull in the action.  Could make it last 30 seconds on assists, as well.\n\nQ- Very Jinx'esque but I still like it.\n\nW- Seems like a cool effect, but also seems a bit underpowered.  Other champions with vision abilities like this have other passive components attached to it; something you might want to consider.\n\nE- Really neat!  I'm not sure if it makes sense to work on allied champions, though.\n\nR- Very cool duality going on here.  My only concern is that Ults are usually needed in the most clutch of moments and times, and tying it to her 5 second cooldown stance dance will lead to a bad user experience of wanting one ult but being in the other ult's form for too long.  This can be fixed by drastically shortening the toggle time between her gun modes, perhaps at the expense of some power (namely the range and some of the bonus crit).\n\nALSO, I like the idea of one ability being the defensive option and the other being the aggressive.  However, I feel in its current form, the dog is also a defensive option as it can be used to slow and kite divers.  To solidify the attack dog as an aggressive move, instead of him slowing your enemies, what if Natasha got a speed INCREASE when she runs in the direction of her dog?  And the dog has really fast movement speed and tracks down enemy champions and nips at 'em for ~10 seconds.  That way Natasha can chase down the fleeing target because you sicced the dogs on them- literally!","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-06T06:37:09.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for your review you are the best reviewer i have EVER had! i made the Changes to the Abilities you said could use, as for the E since she is a back line right-click (an a spy or thief or whatever job she takes) the E is meant to use anything or anyone to get yourself out of a bad position. like if you have a low-health Support backing away from a fight you can use your E to get away if a wall or Tower is not the best spot to E towards.\n\ni got another old concept i would like you to look at if you want?\n\nJess, the Gunslinger\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/xm1Knc5E-jess-the-gunslinger","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RinChee","date":"2014-11-15T21:12:28.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the q ability is a little bit to op especially the 720 range benefit that even beats Caitlyn.
