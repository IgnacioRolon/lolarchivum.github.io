If you play your AD ratios right, he could make an interesting AD utility mage as a secondary class. He would need one more form of damage for that, though. \n\nOn your E, I think a sarcophagus would fit more thematically than a casket. Just a thought.\n\nOn a last note, I'm not sure I like the idea of people being able to dash out of his Q range. It makes it difficult to use in protecting your carry against assassins or ganks coming out of the jungle. Most of the champs that you want to keep off of your carry have some form of dash or blink to negate it. Maybe instead it could function more like Diana's E and draw people into its center?","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-04-16T01:05:01.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> On your E, I think a sarcophagus would fit more thematically than a casket.

Maybe look at Riot's formatting for ability descriptions. Passive seems a little strong. I'd remove the heal factor or increase viper generation to every 10 seconds, maybe reduce damage to flat amounts, increasing at higher levels. I like other abilities, especially E be of increased non-tower damage","replies":[]}]}
