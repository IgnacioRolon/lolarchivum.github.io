Bringing her from the Freljord creates cool themes such as shamanism, tribal chants, wind instruments (winter's howl, chimes, that sort of stuff) and what have you.\n\nI feel like this woman, despite being an advocate of peace, would actually be best served as a type of warrior.  Maybe she has a war drum that sends shockwaves and rallies her allies, and uses a huge drumstick as a staff/melee weapon.","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-02T08:08:31.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i was gonna have her us a nyckelharpa as a weapon, & because she was gonna be using sound i only pictured her as a ranged Champion, but the drum sounds interesting..........how about this i'll create 2 of concept & u decide which the better?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T08:12:46.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure, but only if you really want to do that much work!  :p","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-02T09:48:13.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have 4 more Concept i would like you to look at if it is not to much trouble? or you could just check out all them in your spare time\nLink: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/JellyJackJak22?content_type=discussion\n\nRundle, the Mechanized Walker\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/WXbqOERL-rundle-the-mechanized-walker\n\nHana, the Hunter of Monsters\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/rt62zMq2-hana-the-hunter-of-monsters\n\nSeele, Vanguard of the Legion\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/x5Uc1TEe-seele-vanguard-of-the-legion\n\nOrlen, Guardian of the High Seas\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/2QflkUvp-orlen-guardian-of-the-high-seas","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
