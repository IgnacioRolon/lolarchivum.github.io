The little fella knocks over a potion that grows the Poro & makes it magically imbued.\n\nPlease leave a Comment, Review any Feed Back or your Thoughts on my Concept please, I look forward to what you have to say.\n\nPrimary: Support.\nSecondary: Fighter.\nAdditional Roles: Tank. \nStatistics: Attack Power: 3.

Boggle wears a custom made helmet, a special platting for his horns & a pair of small boots for his front 2 feet.\n\n**Boggle's Taunt:** he rears up on his stubby back legs then he start swinging his tongue around but he then falls on his back.\n\n**Boggle's Joke:** he hops in place 3 times then on his 4th hop he lands on his tongue while strike 1 of 3 different poses.\n\n**Boggle's Dance:** he curls up & sleeps with little pillows & plush toys of the different Poro's.\n\n***Summoner Spells:***\n{{summoner:4}} & {{summoner:3}}.\n\n***Item Builds:***\n***Starting Items:***\n{{item:2003}}/{{item:3303}}/{{item:3340}}.\n***Essential Items:***\n{{item:3092}}/{{item:2049}}/{{item:3270}}.\n***Offensive Items:***\n{{item:3025}}/{{item:3116}}/{{item:3050}}/{{item:3157}}.\n***Defensive Items:***\n{{item:3065}}/{{item:3068}}/{{item:3083}}/{{item:3026}}.\n\n***Passive: Sweet Licks.***\nEvery Basic Attack that Boggle makes will have him use his big tongue. When Boggle lands a Basic Attack on a target he will apply a stack of a Saliva, Saliva will lower the targets Armor, Attack Damage & Movement Speed by 4% that can stack up 4 times. Each stack of Saliva will last for 3.75 seconds, if Boggle doesn&rsquo;t keep Auto-Attacking an effected enemy he can&rsquo;t Refresh the duration of the Debuff.\n>Boggle's **Sweet Licks** is a good way for Boggle to soften up enemies for his allies to start hammering on or make it easier for even Boggle to fight.\n\n***Q-Ability: Bundle of Fluff.***\nRange: 450.\nCool Down: 18/17.5/17/16.5/16.\nCost: 60/70/80/90/100.\nMagic Damage: 65/85/105/125/145(+30% bonus AP).\n**Passive:** Boggle gains a 6%(+1% per Rank) Damage Reduction from all non-Tower sources.\n**Activate:** after Boggle has chosen a 185-radius location within this Abilities Casting Range then upon its activation Boggle will jump to the target location, after Boggle lands on his target location he will deal Magic Damage & smother any enemy targets in the radius with his fur Rooting all affected enemies for 1.25 seconds.\n>for initiating on enemy Champions & setting them up for either Boggle's combo or get an enemy in position for his allies to get in their & starts blasting the target **Bundle of Fluff** is your Ability, but make sure you have an escape plan in mind just in case Boggle puts himself in a bad spot.\n\n***W-Ability: Poro Snax.***\nRange: 450.\nCool Down: 14/13.5/13/12.5/12.\nCost: 95.\nHeal: 95/135/175/215/255(+40% bonus AP).\nMagic Damage: 20/30/40/50/60(+40% bonus AP).\n**Activate:** after Boggle has chosen a 100-radius within this Abilities Casting Range then upon its activation Boggle will toss out a box of his favorite poro snax to share with his allies, while the box is out it will remain on the Map for 7 seconds & when either Boggle or an allied Champion walks over the box that Champion will be Healed. When Boggle tosses out the box & it reaches its 2 second mark Boggle will start drooling & getting hyped gaining 25% increased Movement Speed & his Basic Attacks will also deal Magic Damage, until the box either gets walked on or its duration has ended Boggle will continue to have this bonus Buff.\n>**Poro Snax** is nice little treat for Boggle to eat himself or share with his allies to give them some good sustain, now the bonus effect from this Ability while it stays on the map can really give Boggle a nice little steroid for him to fight side-by-side with his partner or team.\n\n***E-Ability: Poro Tackle/Trip Roll.***\nRange: 500.\nCool Down: 20/19.5/19/18.5/18.\nCost: 50/60/70/80/90.\nMagic Damage: 75/95/115/135/155(+30% bonus AP).\n**Activate:** after Boggle has chosen a broad path with this Ability then upon its activation Boggle will lunge himself in the chosen direction, when Boggle makes contact with an enemy he will deal Magic Damage & will Slow the targets Movement Speed by 30% for 1.75 seconds.\nRecast: after Boggle has reached the end of the path he can Recast this Ability within a 2 second window, when Boggle has Recasted this Ability he will roll backwards to his original position & enemies that he comes in contact with will take 15% less damage from this Ability.\n>great for closing the distance & setting up enemies, being a means of escaping from very bad fight or for juking around a fight making him hard to hit **Poro Tackle/Trip Roll** is a nice Mobility Ability to have that allows Boggle to make different plays.\n\n***R-Ability: Snowball Pop.***\nRange: 950.\nCool Down: 115/105/95.\nCost: 115.\nMagic Damage: 175/225/275(+40% bonus AP).\nIncreased Armor: 5/7/9%.\nIncreased Magic Resist: 4/6/8%.\nIncreased Attack Damage: 10/12/14%.\n**Activate:** after Boggle has activated this Ability Boggle will jump in place creating a burst of cold air that will deal Magic Damage to all enemies within a 300-radius of him while also applying a 40% Movement Speed Slow for 2.25 seconds, after a 0.5 second delay after the initial activation Boggle will generate a 200-radius aura that will increase both Boggle & allied Champions Armor, Magic Resist & Attack Damage for 4 seconds.\n>saving **Snowball Pop** for the big Team Fights is great way for Boggle to really put the pressure on the enemy team by dealing decent damage & applying a nice little Slow then create an aura that gives both Boggle & allies a very nice Buff to really get into the enemies face.\n\n\n**Boggle's Favorite Ability Combos:**\n\n***Combo #1 - Feed Me:*** while Boggle & his Lane Partner are in the middle of a fight toss out a **W** just in-case things go sideways but while its out Boggle will gain the additional effects to help him weaken the enemy with the additional Magic Damage he will deal with his Auto-Attacks.\n\n***Combo #2 - Hit & Run:*** this will be Boggles go to combo for applying pressure to enemies while also keeping them on their toes & to set up an enemy to get wrecked by your Lane Partner or Jungler. You start by using your **E** to close the distance & apply the Slow & damage then start wailing on the target with a couple of Auto-Attacks to apply your **Passive**, while Boggle is trading blows with the target Recast his **E** to roll back to his original spot then slam down on the target with his **Q**.\n\n***Combo #3 - Stage Dive:*** when a Team Fight breaks out activate your **R** from a safe distance to ensure that you don't get CC then when you land in the middle of the fight start Auto-Attacking to apply you **Passive** & to keep the stag diving flow going use your **Q** to lock down a priority target either to make it easier for enemies to nuke or to take out of the fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-10T18:21:35.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jack, this is easily your best, most mechanically interesting and thematically cohesive kit that you've ever put together.  Bravo!  You're clearly learning and getting better at this as you go along.\n\nI love the passive; makes total sense for a huggable poro!  The hyper mode after placing poro snax is also genius and very interesting from a mechanics and teamwork perspective.  The double rollout effect of Boggle's E is also really nice.  Makes me think of a slower-moving, boulder-like version of LeBlanc's Distortion.\n\nConcerns and Suggestions- \n\n1- A yordle-sized Poro is probably too small, especially for a tank.  It's unfortunate that Sejuani has a poro skin now, but that's essentially the size you'd want Boggle to be.\n\n2- I think the Q should be a \"target area\" AoE spell and not a targeted one.  Otherwise I think it's too easy for Boggle to initiate and close the gap.  Think of champions like Leona, who have to use skillshots from range unless she bum-rushes them with her Q.\n\n3- The Ultimate seems a little bland and too similar to his Q.  It's also a third way of initiating/diving from range, which seems like overkill.  I like the idea of a team-buffing aura, though.  I don't have any particular direction to suggest here; just that the ability doesn't seem to mesh well with the rest of Boggle's highly creative kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-04-10T21:17:07.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanx Lutzburg i thought you might like this 1, it's diffidently 1 of my favorites. i always hoped that Riot would actually make a Poro Champion, & thanx for the complement.\n\n> 1- A yordle-sized Poro is probably too small, especially for a tank.

Great idea, dude! Really, any small and adorable champion concept is just a genius idea in itself! Personally, I freakin love those little poros and i've always wanted them to have a bigger part rather then just being cute little distractions on ARAM games. I really want this to be a thing now considering a poro champion would resonate really well with poro-fans out there but I have a question. Is Boggle more of the Poro King type of body shape, or is he shaped like a yordle's body (Ya'know, midget human body shape.)
