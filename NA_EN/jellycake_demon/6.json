Speed boost start Auto-Attacking, if you get close enough to your target use your **E** to deal damage & land a Stun, then just go gunhoe on your Target with Auto-Attacks & your **Q's** activation.\n> \n> **Combo #2: Slippery Son of a Gun**\n> if an enemy is to close for comfert & your low on HP & you know your Passive won't save you use the **E** to Stun the target while dealing damage  & then use your **W** to get the hell out of Dodge with the dash & the Move. Sp boost.\n> \n> **Combo #3: The Bell Tolls**\n> use your Auto-Attacks for the sustaining damage & use your **Q's** activation to hose down enemies then if your feeling good on winning fights use your **W** to dash in then activate your **R** to start the enemy teams inevitable doom & then BAMM!\n\n-\n\n> ***Gameplay Style:***\n> with his short Auto-Attack range you might think that McGrath is gonna be an easy kill, that might be the case but if played right & have the know how to dodge fatal blows & be able out gun your opponent then McGrath is gonna be a tough cookie to crack. \n> \n> now usually an ADC won't have any form of CC in their kits but since McGrath is a \"close-range\" gunman that 1 CC on his E can mean life or death when he engages on a target or when he tries to escape giving him a window of opportunity to react to what situation, now as for his using his Q its best to use the Passive to widdle down targets then use the Activation quickly to deal a large amount of damage in a short amount time but if your not confident that you can land it right or know that they enemy might have an escape ask your lane partner for some assistance with their own CC or use your E to lock down weaken targets but still as an ADC the E is used as last resort to buy time not a way to just dive someone (that is the general idea but be smart with it). the W is simple enough in that Mcgrath can close the distance to get into his opponents face & pop that nice enhance Auto-Attack or use the dash + the Move. Speed boost to escape from danger.\n> \n> its a good idea to keep your Ultimate on hand when either a large team fight is about to break out or wait to use until the enemy team is weak enough to deal the most damage, it could also be good to use it in 1v1 when an enemy is trying to escape but just can't.\n\n-\n\n> ***McGrath’s Quotes:***\n> **Quotes While Moving:**\n> “I should’ve brought Dust.”\n> “I miss Dust.”\n> “Let’s get a move on.”\n> “I’ll need to get a new pair of boots after this.”\n> “You can run but you can’t hide.”\n> “Rolling, rolling, rolling, Keep moving, moving, moving.”\n> “On the dusty trail we go.”\n> “Always be quick on your feet.”\n> “You need to be quicker than that.”\n> \n> **Quotes While Attacking:**\n> “Gotch you in my sights.”\n> “Can’t outrun a bullet.”\n> “Let’s see you try to run.”\n> “Are you feeling lucky?”\n> “Care to play some Gun Roulette?”\n> “Go ahead try & run.”\n> \n> **Quotes While Attacking Graves:**\n> “I’m not pulling any punches Graves.”\n> “Let’s see who guns down whom first.”\n> “A bigger gun doesn't mean you’ll win.”\n> \n> **Taunts Towards Graves:**\n> “Big gun, big bullets....are you hiding something Graves.”\n> “Let’s see who is the better shot, I’ll even use 1 hand.”\n> \n> **Quotes While Attacking Rek’Sai:**\n> “Let’s end this here & now!”\n> “This is for Dust!”\n> “I’ll get you back for my missing arm.”\n> “Still hungry for more Rek’Sai?”\n> “Want another piece of me?”\n> “Get ready to cough up my arm!”\n> “I would like my other gun back.”\n> \n> **Taunts Towards Rek’Sai:**\n> “Hope that arm of mine you swallowed gives you indigestion.”\n> “With all the bullets I pumped you with how do you not have lead poisoning?”\n\nI've decided to move McGrath's Lore to a new Post so i can work on it a bit more, cause i know it sounds rushed & it kind was.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-10T20:46:07.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Jelly, it's been a while!  Glad to see you're still active here.\n\nThis is a pretty neat concept and I like the thematic ties to Graves.  That said, I worry that their tropes and themes might overlap a little too much.  The short range, gritty nature of McGrath also sounds awfully familiar.  The passive and dash especially remind me of Graves.\n\nMy favorite concept of this kit is the Nidalee-esque execute that he has on his Pistol Whip.  I agree with others who mentioned that the range is too long, but the concept is really cool.  \"Kite and attack from a distance, then close the gap and deliver the killing blow in melee range.\"  That's neat and reminds me of the recently reworked Tristana.  Rather than bonus gold, I'd add some sort of reset or steroid so that McGrath can continue his murder frenzy.  I'd also add an actual execute to the ability and remove that component from the Ult.\n\nI just posted an ADC of my own last night, and would love to hear your feedback when you get the chance!\n\n[Rafa, Guardian of the Flame](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/iYuGdWxF-rafa-guardian-of-the-flame)","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-03-10T23:59:19.707+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"well thank u Lutzburg for your feedback, it has been awhile since i heared from you. i get that both McGrath & Graves sound similer being very close short range nuking ADC with some durability. but i always thought of graves as someone who can go toe-to-toe with someone regardless of range but the main strategy for McGrath is as you stated\n\n\"Kite and attack from a distance, then close the gap and deliver the killing blow in melee range.\"\n\ni might change that Gold Bonus to the reset or steroid. i also made a rough draft of his Lore but i posted on a different Post, i'll leave a link if you want to look over it.\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/lis2UGFo-the-lore-for-mcgrath-the-lone-gunslinger\n\nthank you for your input Lutzburg, i missed you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Flintfall","date":"2015-03-07T01:57:19.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[We should start a one-armed gunslinger club (they could even arm wrestle)!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/A70GGM1y-champion-concept-dane-the-silver-star)\n\nI have a few suggestions in terms of the kit:\n\n* Make the ultimate fire at all enemies that **remain** in his vision for all of the 1.75 seconds. Could be a cool interaction with someone like Graves.\n\n* 450 range is actually really tiny, especially when centered on McGrath. I think 500 is even undershooting it (as reference, Morgana's ultimate binds within 600 range, then tethers the shackles up to 1050 range).\n\n* Tumble functions exactly like Vayne's Tumble. I would remove the AD steroid so that at least they're different on a larger level.\n\n* The Pistol whip has 350 range, which might look a bit weird in game seeing as melee range is 125.\n\nOtherwise, interesting and brief concept. Could use a bit more originality though in terms of the abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-03-07T02:28:33.203+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for your reply i enjoy reading what people Comment about my Concepts. as for his Ability Kit it's actually 1 of 4th different iteration when i was making him.\n\n**at 1st his Q was either gonna be:**\n1st iteration: a simple skill shot that can pierce through enemies. nothing more nothing less.\n2nd iteration: a point click 1 second Channel where he can move around & use other Abilities but he can't Auto-Attack.\n3rd iteration: a simple self-cast steroid increasing Attack speed & Attack Damage.\n\nhis W was actually gonna be where he calls in a horse that he rides, increasing his Movement Speed & be immune to Slows.\n\n**the E was either gonna be:**\n1st iteration: a A.O.E zone where he throws a Molotov that deals a MD D.O.T to enemies who are within, enter or leave the radius.\n2nd iteration: he pulls a whip that is attached to his left arm stub that will act as a narrow skill-shot that Stun the 1st enemy hit.\n\nas for his ult it remains the same, also which Champion has a delayed self-cast A.O.E multi-target Nuke with a chance to Instant Kill enemies?","replies":[{"poster":"Flintfall","date":"2015-03-07T03:48:46.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooh, nice history.\n\nA horse would be interesting, it certainly ties in to the cowboy theme. That would be really hard to figure out though, I can see why it fell through. However, I'm much more interested in the whip. What about an aoe line ability where he cracks the whip, and enemies are knocked to side? Possibly have it so you can angle the whip via double casting (make start and end)? Then change it to a snare?\n\nAs for the ult, I didn't intend to say that was unoriginal. My actual thoughts were along the lines of, *dang that'd look so cool*. I think the rest of the kit could play more on his whip. My current thoughts:\n\n* As before, line knock around (close to Draven though)\n\n* 'trip whip' in that it knocks enemies slightly and snares them afterward\n\n* Tether range, in that the enemy cannot go farther than a certain distance from McGrath. \"Where do you think yer goin'?\"\n\nRight now you have more gunslinger than cowboy, so if that's the direction you want to go with then by all means go for it.
