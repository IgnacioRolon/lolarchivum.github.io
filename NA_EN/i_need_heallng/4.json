I've mained nasus in the past and all he has gotten is buffs. so i'm sure it won't change his feel too much. I get you shut him down early, but honestly this *end before 20 min* mentality of the game and champions like nasus just feel toxic. I believe he's broken, or toxic, because of his kit and the buffs they were forced to make to him. He's unfun to play against, unfair to trade, and just overall a pantheon","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-10-26T22:51:18.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My measure of whether a melee champion is op is whether or not I have fun playing as them. Since I greatly prefer ranged champs, if I am having fun on a melee then they are op. I have fun on Nasus.\n\nI also banned Nasus all the way through my climb this season.\n\nHowever, just because you or I dislike playing against something does not mean it has to be changed. Just play him or ban him like I did.\n\nThe game being on a timer matter is something of a moot point once preseason hits since 4 different runes allow uncapped scaling, so at that point you can play whatever you want and keep up anyway.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PrismalDawn","date":"2017-10-26T05:18:01.995+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because he is a paradox champion. \n\nAnd what I mean by that is, if he is on your team you lose and if he is on the enemy team he carries.\n\nPeople (stupid ass junglers especially) fail to realize that all he has to do is press W and a gank is 100% successful.\nAlso, he needs a competent team to not die every fucking 10 seconds to be useful. \n\nSomehow though, when you play as him or with him on your team, your team thinks, \"oh he is good he will carry just let him stack lol, and let me die 10 times just to be of some help to him.\"\n\nA pushing/pushed  nasus will get ganks if he is on the enemy team but will literally be ignored if he is on your own team.\n\nOther examples of Paradox Champions include:\n\n{{champion:81}} \n{{champion:92}}\n{{champion:157}} \n{{champion:67}} \n{{champion:238}} \n\nMeaning: If they are on the enemy team, they are pros, if they are on yours, they feed and make the game 4v5.","replies":[{"poster":"sit kid","date":"2017-10-26T11:13:46.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Proof or just go away from the boards already if you cant stop spouting nonsense","replies":[{"poster":"I NEED HEALlNG","date":"2017-10-27T20:00:57.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MortenMBK1709,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YxKdvJyM,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2017-10-26T11:13:46.200+0000)\n>\n> Proof or just go away from the boards already if you cant stop spouting nonsense\n\nproof of what? i'm on the boards to ask for help not prove anything? the fuck is wrong with you people that look for arguments 24/7? like a bunch of retarded sheep","replies":[]},{"poster":"PrismalDawn","date":"2017-10-26T22:25:46.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your comment is proof enough :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I NEED HEALlNG","date":"2017-10-26T05:28:13.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"AGREED","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2017-10-27T23:11:31.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I NEED HEALlNG.\n\nI'm going to lock this thread up because it seems you've already posted it before [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/T3FZrPJ2-i-dont-understand-how-nasus-is-not-toxic-or-broken?comment=0000)!\n\nPlease work with us by keeping the same topics on one thread so the Boards don't get too clogged up with the same threads.
