As long as you can continuously poke her she will be forced to back off pretty quickly. The best time to poke her of course is when she's coming in to last hit/heal off of passive.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2018-01-12T22:23:51.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats because her sustain was tied to the damage her spells and mostly her e did on large minion waves pre rework and also by building ap she didnt get damage the same time on her passive now her passive scales harder than ever because both parts of it scale with both ad and ap she has no slow part to the game anymore but because of adcs dps being too high she cant deal with them before they kill her. \nalso her passive doesnt have enough cooldown for counter play. her current kit is much better for counterplay (she still has 3 targeted dashes for engage and  w to survive and excape) her passive and w are her biggest problems either lower w's up time  when cast or increase its cooldown by alot  through cdr","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2018-01-14T07:15:21.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Truth be told old akali just scaled better but was actually bad in early game.

Furthermore her R had higher base damage AND 0.5 AP scaling as opposed to current Akali's 0.35.\n\nAnd though it seems insignificant, lategame her passive added ~150-200 damage to her autos, which adds up. Furthermore she was capable of adding in a few spammed E's to add to the damage to finish off an opponent quickly.
