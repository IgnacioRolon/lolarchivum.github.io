There is a reason that veiwers are so much lower now then back during the lane swap, whole map lit up with wards like a xmas tree pro meta. Its because they are attempting to make the game more fun to watch at the expense of it being actually fun to play. Without realizing that nobody is going to watch a game that they quit because its no longer fun.\n\nI watched Blizzard kill Starcraft 2 the same way, its a bummer Riot is doing it to LoL.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FullmuteAll play","date":"2018-09-15T14:11:27.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh, sometimes I catch myself, that I watch my region, because I like that they are not hyped as much as NA LCS, but skill level can be potentially the same or higher.\nAnd in overall this game wasn't popular in my home region and investors were not interested in this. Now it became more interesting for investos and local Rito started throwing adds into my face right during the game, during the draft. So I will stop watching esports (except worlds), if next season it will be the same.","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-09-15T15:19:43.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">but skill level can be potentially the same or higher.\n\nLiterally any region out of EU, LCK or LPL has a higher lvl than NA","replies":[{"poster":"FullmuteAll play","date":"2018-09-15T15:41:32.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah and none of these mine, btw can be better than EUW as well","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-09-15T16:55:30.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm from EU and I mostly watch LCK, it's about the teams you pick to root for.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2018-09-15T15:43:53.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love watching the LCS.

I mean sure it gets repetitive but so do a lot of other competitive games that have less variability of outcome. I don't tend to let the memes or grievances change my opinion. \n\nWhat I do wonder is if your detail addressed the whole pro play patch that just happened. Yknow the one that **always happens** before Worlds? It's no different from the last 3 years.","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2018-09-15T14:45:38.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to watch just Cloud 9 games and Worlds, and later I slowly got into watching the rest of NA and EU. With my new job, I started watching Korea's playoffs during some down time. The main reason I watch right now is because it helps me learn. From watching LCS, I learned why wards matter instead of just being told they do and not really getting it and that item power spikes were a thing (This was a few years ago when I was bronze). I learned a few things about specific champions too. Kled's Q being able to pull people out of dashes and when he dismounts he drops turret aggro, Pyke's charged Q+E combo, and the existence of Gangplank's triple barrel combo are a few I can think of. Just yesterday I found out that Azir can troll Rift Herald with his turret, and yes it did look kinda funny. I probably would have found some of this stuff out on my own eventually, it just helped to see someone else do it/have the casters explain it.\n\nAnother reason I watch is to keep up with Summoners Rift changes. I haven't enjoyed SR in a while, so watching someone else play it is a good way to remind myself that certain changes happened. I read the patch notes and check Surrender at 20, but the things I read don't always stick. \n\nWith that being said, I can completely understand why it could look boring to other people. There isn't a lot of variety from game to game and there are certain stretches of the game where nothing happens. I don't like those either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-09-15T13:36:00.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd rather play the game myself than watch someone else play.
