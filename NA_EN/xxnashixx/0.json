I do so and it finally lets me reconnect to my game which luckily my team didn't remake so i joined 5 mins into game and everything is fine, untill my whole screen goes black and i cant even get out of the games full screen but i can still hear the game going on behind my black screen. So i am forced to restart my pc to comeback to the game being over and me having a 5 game low priority que.... I had no control of the situation and i get punished with this.... Also my team won the game without me .-.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-19T18:24:26.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like the client could be having problems interacting with your graphics card.
