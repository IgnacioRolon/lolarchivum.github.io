(Because I am getting RP tomorrow, didn't have it yesterday to buy it straight away)\r\n\r\nIf anyone could help, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-19T21:39:08.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh snap, tbh I'm pretty jealous of all of those skins!!\n\nYou're free to buy the new offers you have right now, but if you still want Reaper Soraka just hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). We can still see the old offers, and should be able to make that transaction for you once you have the RP.","replies":[{"poster":"Soraka feet UwU","date":"2017-09-20T11:20:39.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I will!","replies":[]}]}]}
