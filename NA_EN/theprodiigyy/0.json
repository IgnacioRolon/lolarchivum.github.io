They asked me an email with no league accounts associated to it and so I gave them one. I get an email with a reply saying that a new ticket has been made with the new email and that I should reply with the answers to that email. But I didn't get an username or password to reply to that ticket. I tried sending a reply to the email but I am not sure if that's the correct way... I don't know if anyone can help me? I am really not sure on what to do next?\r\n\r\nThanks,","replies":[{"poster":"Postal Twinkie","date":"2017-04-14T20:23:37.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are attempting to recover an account that you no longer have access to the e-mail for Riot will require additional details to verify the information. From what you have said it almost sounds like you attempted to create a new account. \n\nI would reach out directly to Riot via https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us. At the top click ' submit a request' and for the reason select account recovery. Be sure to include your current e-mail address as well as the e-mail address associated with the account you are recovering. Also make sure you check your spam/trash folders in the event the support email is flagged and doesn't land in your inbox. \n\nCS should be able to take it from there with the verification process.","replies":[{"poster":"TheProdiigyy","date":"2017-04-14T20:33:09.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nI already did that. So I'll try and make it clear:\n\nI sent a ticket to Riot asking help.\n\nThey told me to give them another email  as they don't want to use this email as it may be compromised? (I am guessing here, as I am not sure)\n\nI gave them another one and I got an email asking me questions to recover the account.\n\nBut I don't know how to reply to that email. I simply sent an reply via an email but I haven't heard from them since then. (I had to wait 2-3 hours for the first 2 replies but it's been almost 10 hours since I sent the email reply). I just want to know how to reply to them basically....\n\nThanks,","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-14T20:59:19.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe the specialist was asking for more info through an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) to get more information and make sure that the account is being restored to the rightful owner.  You won't be provided with any username or account information until we've verified you're the owner.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"TheProdiigyy","date":"2017-04-15T03:38:52.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nyeah so the specialist told me to reply directly to the email. Thanks a lot!\n\nI see that a lot of people got the same thing as me? Is it normal? I am not sure what I have done wrong or what coud've triggered the security lock?\n\nThanks,","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
