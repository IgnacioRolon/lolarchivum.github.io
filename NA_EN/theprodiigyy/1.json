I win that game and i was super excited. I come out of the game to see that I was permabanned... I get an email saying I violated terms of use... I was very surprised as I know I didn't even get a chat restriction yet.. so I send a ticket and the guy tells me that I need to recover my account. I give all the infos and I was told that I need to give more infos... I gave a lot of infos for the account creation but for the purchase infos, I couldn't remember. It's been such a long time. I kinda rememberd some other India so I submit another ticket using the recovery form Friday. I still haven't received any response. It's kinda frustrating that I get an security lock for no reason it seems as the specialist just ignored my question as to why I received it. Then I can't even game during my small vacation and in all that I am in promos for Gold :( To be fair, i am sure a lot of people don't remember their first 5 purchased champs or on what they used their refund tokens you know...\r\n\r\nI hope someone can help me out... I just want my account back so I can get to playing the game I love...\r\n\r\nThanks,","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-16T20:57:16.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I pulled up your ticket and it looks like one of our Support agents was able to get back with you on your ticket. I know those questions can be a little hard to remember sometimes, but we ask specific questions that only the original account creator might know. You don't need to hit every single one, but do your best to provide as much correct info as possible so that we can help you get back on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"TheProdiigyy","date":"2017-04-17T19:22:41.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nYeah I got an answer but not the one I was looking for. He asked if I could give more infos, I did and he replied saying sorry I can't help you without more informations and I am closing the ticket... It makes me wonder if first of all it's a person or a bot? If it's a person, did he even bother to read my reply? I submitted another ticket with basic answers plus a bunch of extra infos hoping it will be enough this time...\n\nI also asked what my account was in security lock like what happens and I never got an answer... I know it looks like I'm mad and all, it's just that I would like to know why my account got into this mess and why he closed my ticket when I gave him more infos... I just want to know what's going on basically you know? I feel like I am left in the dark and I can't do anything to recover my account... When I am finally getting out of silver too... This is just super frustrating... I am not blaming anyone in general (and obviously now you Broporo :) ), I just hate my luck at the moment -.-\n\n\n Anyways... I am waiting on an answer on my ticket. Hopefully everything works out...","replies":[{"poster":"TheProdiigyy","date":"2017-04-18T13:01:19.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey @Broporo . I know you are quite busy with all those tickets and all... It's just that I am waiting for almost 24 hours on the new ticket and still haven't had a reply... I still haven't got an answer on why my account was on security lock and I asked that question thursday.... I know it's not your fault but I am just trying to understand what is going on and why I feel like it's bot reading my tickets and replies...\n\nHere is how one of the conversation went:\n\nSpecialist: \" I need more infos if I am able to help you\"\n\nMe: \"Ok well here is more infos and my recent purchases with transaction ids\"\n\nSpecialist:  \"Sorry, I can't help you without more infos. I will close the ticket now but contact us again if you have more infos\".\n\n\nThat just feels super weird if you ask me...\n\nAnyways thanks for your help!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
