I've tried messing around with the sound settings and reinstalling, but the problem persists.  I've also attempted to find a solution online (searching forums/googling the problem), but I can't seem to find anyone with the same issue.  I was wondering if anyone else might have a solution because I'd love to hear the voice lines of other forms in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-22T19:10:47.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I had a sound asset not working, a repair resolved it for me.
