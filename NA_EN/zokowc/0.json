The idea behind having a button on the bottom of the screen, for eg, will allow us to recognize the player's gameplay at that moment rather than have it linger towards the end of the game - when many reasons might deter us from taking the time to acknowledge a player.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"T2K Baka","date":"2019-11-23T14:45:23.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bring back honouring enemies again.

Does anyone actually believe it improves player behavior? It's just another one of Riot's harebrained schemes to \"gamify\" good behavior. All of it has failed miserably which is why you don't hear about them trying to address \"toxicity\" anymore. If Riot had even the remotest inkling of a clue about human behavior, you would have seen a drop in \"toxic\" behavior some time in the past 10 years.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lemexis","date":"2019-11-25T09:56:24.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like an unnecessary distraction.
