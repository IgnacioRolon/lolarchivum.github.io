Ive been playing league for about 5 or 6 years now, and only recently have I had framerate issues. I have a gtx 970, so I cant think of any reason for my game to lag this badly. It constantly bounces from 100+ frames all the way down to 7, and when I'm playing averages about 10 or 15. I can play a lot of other games that are much more taxing on my computer at a solid 60 FPS. Any help would be greatly appreciated ive been looking for solutions for a while now.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-05T01:00:00.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your frame rate could be caused by an outdated driver, so our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide may be able to help tune things up.  I also suggest capping your frame rate in-game, just in case your pc might be too good!
