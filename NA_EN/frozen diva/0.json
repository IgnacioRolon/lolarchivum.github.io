A lot of people suggest she only needs a new passive or damage/range increases for her Q, however I believe she needs more fundamental changes:\n\n**Issues**\n\n- Slow. She has 325 ms because of her teleport (fair enough), but her E is also slow to accommodate her instant CC.\n\n\n- Clunky. As well as slow ms and E, she has inconsistent ranges: 550 AA, 725 Q, 450 W, 1050 E and 550 R.\n\n\n- Counter play. The only real counter play to Lissandra is out-ranging her (which most mages do). Her CC is instant and offers no counter play beyond not being in range, which also sucks up her power budget. \n\n\n- Lacking passive. Her current passive does nothing for her theme and feels like a justification for high mana costs.\n\n**Solutions**\n\n- Increase the speed of her E. Lissandra is offset by her MS, and her E is already a heavily telegraphed skill shot. Adding power here seem fair.\n\n\n- Update the W. Perhaps lowering the initial cast radius, then allowing it to be charged (like Galio's W) to 550 radius. Or perhaps updating it to be an actual ['Ring of Frost'](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/kNYOlxEG-lissandra-passive-and-w-suggestions). I think matching her W range to her autos would go a long way to improving her feel, since she wouldn't be encouraged to dive practically face 1st on to a target to be effective.  \n\n\n- Spread her damage. I would suggest moving some of Es damage to the updated W, since it would have counter play other than \"don't be in range\".\n\n\n- Give her a thematic passive. No suggestions, but I have seen a ton of good suggestions floating around the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"ArchMageM4gnus","date":"2017-10-21T08:26:16.132+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Honestly she just needs more damage. Problem with her I find as I use to main her, is that she has no carry potential if you're team isn't on board with team fights. She feels like an Assassin Mage - gated heavily by cool downs and mana costs. I've played her in bot games just some fun with friends, and have gone 20-0 at 20 mins....yet I STILL can't wipe out a team like I could if I was a number of other mid mages (Fizz, Viktor, Taliah, Brand, etc). I end up running out of mana or just can't seem to finish a team off before they can walk away from me....which really shouldn't be for a mage that is 3 levels higher with 10K gold.\n\nLike mentioned her passive is also garbage. You could make her AA's perhaps have a slowdown effect, similar to Ashes, or have a freeze scaling effect similar to Talons passive, in which if 3 abilities hit and she autos you, the enemy becomes frozen solid for 1.5 seconds. This won't happen very often at the start of the game due to her high mana costs, but becomes pretty powerful late game freezing a lot of opponents with her area of effect abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2017-10-21T10:18:37.254+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've seen Lissandra to 1shot people with just Q, but this was years ago before all AP changes and she had max mejai stacks.\nBtw, you can't give a champ with 3 CC abilities too high damage.

(I have hotkeyed self casting spells, but I can't disable self casts when using quick-casting+mouse only, so this is especially annoying for me to have an accidental self-cast when I've trained myself for a hotkey combo for self-casts)\n* Lissandra's burst is based on combo'ing, and any moments of cast-preventing CC from the enemy team can throw off Liss's burst combo rhythm. \n* Her ultimate's damage has to spread to its maximum AoE, meaning even if you cast it in the middle of the enemy team, not everyone is guaranteed to take the damage or be slowed by the spell because they have so much time to run away from it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miku Append","date":"2017-10-20T23:46:35.438+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"* Abysmal movement speed\n* Range is garbo\n* Probably does less damage than a Soraka support\n* Has the lane pressure of a level 1 Vayne\n\n...and I hate this because I love Lissy.

It makes more sense that she got created as a machine and is looking for her identity.  Furthermore, she is not necessarily evil (like the joker), but she is cold hearted because she wants revenge for her quest for identity. does that make sense?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cowseed","date":"2017-10-20T17:54:55.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're champ is good and unpopular consider it a blessing in desguise. No meta whores whoring them out, no circle-jerk, the champ gets a short of hidden power being as how people don't play against them often so you're game against them is often their warmup games against that champion, rarely will they ever be banned so you don't even have to hover the champ and risk falling prey to champ select terrorists. Honestly I don't understand why you'd complain people aren't playing a champ you like.

While other mages suffer against gap closers and high mobility assassins/melee fighters, Lissandra is unfazed by both of them. True they can still outplay her, but her E offers outplay moves as well. Her damage is eh and her mobility is eh too, but for some reason the latter doesn't prevent her from roaming, because she can just push the opponent back under the tower and she can roam safely. Ranged characters can give her difficult time tho.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ROYALR3IGN","date":"2018-10-20T13:38:29.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No NO NO NO NO Stop I dont' want people picking her, shes my pocket pick, the less people know/play her the better I'll be at her. :D\n\nHer aftershock - Zhonya - Self Ult is disgusting in teamfights hahha sleeper op","replies":[]}]}
