How can he make the system any less effective? Your pompous behaviour is totally unwarranted.\n\nZero effectiveness implies that intentional feeders never get banned. If you wish I can start linking threads where people have been banned but I'll only do so if you weren't going to move the goalposts as soon as I did.\n\nThere's a reason that poor game behavior gets caught less often than poor chat behavior. It's both harder to prove and people are far more likely to be salty and falsely report it whenever someone starts playing extremely poorly.\n\nRiot has to be reasonably sure that the player feeding or trolling is doing so maliciously, and due to the size of the playerbase asking them to manually review every report is an extreme pipe dream. As bad as the automatic system is at detecting intentional feeding I'd wager that it still catches more people than the manual reviews from support tickets can even reach.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-11-06T01:08:37.744+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"From [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player):\n\n> Do not threaten or repeatedly tell a player you will report them. Doing so can encourage players who are already negative to continue their behavior. Whether they know they are being reported or not has no bearing to whether the system will act on them. But most importantly, repeatedly threatening or arguing with a negative player can end up derailing the game for everyone else and then open yourself up to reports and possible disciplinary action as well. Avoid negative thoughts and useless chatting with poor performing teammates! Focus on victory by muting the offending player and then reporting them at the end of the game.\n> \n> Do not ask other players in the match to report the offending player. It only takes one report for our systems to review a game. Additional reports will not do anything for the offending player; however as mentioned above, it could open yourself up to a report of your own; especially if you are derailing the match by constantly demanding reports of other players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vreivai","date":"2019-11-06T04:04:02.049+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. Look through this board. There's plenty of evidence you're wrong here.

All the system looks at is whether the player was reported or not.
