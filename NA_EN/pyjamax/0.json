I said aight, let's reboot this thing, so I restarted my computer. Nothing. Uninstalled and re-installed, I had an error of OLEACC.dll, checked it up online, nothing would work, at least of what was being suggested. I said aight, lets re-install, and so I did. Rads error came up, http couldnt not connect to server..firewall..etc. I was like aight, lets check it up online, common error iirc. Tried most if not anything but nothing worked. I was so pissed off cause I had a tournament thingy and I had to pass cause of this, so I just starting opening LoL gently, and trying, maybe if I believed it really hard it would work. Five minutes into this, I dont get the http error, but league disappears again, this time without prompting me to click launch whatsoever, I barely click the icon , get the logo and then nothing. \r\nI would appreciate all sorts of help with much love,\r\nAir Surfer.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-01T22:12:03.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhh sounds like your OS doesn't have the right permission settings in place for League to be able to read from the files it needs to.
