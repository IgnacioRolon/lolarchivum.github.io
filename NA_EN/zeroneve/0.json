I&#039;m not about to give up on him yet just because Riot most recently gave Aatrox a minor QoL change that doesn&#039;t change anything. The windows for feeling strong as Aatrox feel so very limited, and his early-mid game isn&#039;t strong enough to justify how absolutely awful his late game is.\n\n**Riot on Aatrox**\n\nTo my recollection, there are two instances where Riot has acknowledged Aatrox in the forums after his one update: One by Morello and another by Meddler.\n\nMorello\n\n02-18-2014\n\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=45244229#45244229\n\n>     We made some big game health mistakes on Aatrox that put him in a problematic spot - there&#039;s accuracy in the fact that if he&#039;s buffed, he&#039;ll be a problem.\n> \n>     We&#039;ve had some Aatrox changes to solve this (as a soft rework sorta thing) that could fix this, and then let him get back into the game. I&#039;ll have to check on the details to see which direction we&#039;ve taken with it (there were a lot of ideas on the table for it, originally).\n\nMeddler\n\n12-26-2014\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/alR9fGRR-can-we-replace-aatroxs-ultimate-steroid-with-an-aoe-fear?comment=000c\n\nMeddler&#039;s post is a lot larger, but to summarize: He agrees that Aatrox&#039;s ultimate isn&#039;t as satisfying and good as an ultimate should be, acknowledges that a PBAoE Fear addition to Aatrox&#039;s ult has at least some thematic reasoning behind it, remarks on Aatrox as a Tank vs Aatrox as a Fighter, and concludes that him posting isn&#039;t an indicator that there are upcoming Aatrox changes and that Aatrox is \"overall in an ok spot.\" Apparently the rest of the Riot team who works on gameplay and balance agree with those sentiments as Aatrox has received only one significant change (the aforementioned) since his release. It&#039;s been one whole year since Morello mentioned \"some Aatrox changes\" and nothing has really come of it. As it is now, Aatrox suffers from terrible base stats, terrible scaling/late game (AP ratio on his ultimate?), very low impact and unsatisfying ultimate (backed by Meddler), getting kited too easily, bad 5v5 teamfights, and a bunch of other things like how his sustain is minion dependent (IOW no minions or zoned from CS = no sustain).\n\n**Comparison of Aatrox/Rek&#039;sai as junglers **\nOn other social media, I posted a comparison of two top tier junglers of different eras (season 3 and season 5) in Aatrox and Rek&#039;sai. These are supposed to be two \"Fighters\" as Riot classifies them, while Aatrox&#039;s secondary is \"Tank\". Rek&#039;sai has no secondary. Keep in mind that Rek&#039;Sai&#039;s base stats are better overall - she has far better health, health regen, longer base AA range, and better armor than Aatrox. Aatrox has negligibly better AD, negligibly better AS, and negligibly better move speed. Rek'sai is also the only current jungler who isn't straight up a tank who can scale decently well as a tank late game with cinderhulk.\n\nRek&#039;Sai has easily far more mobility, far better clears, much lower cooldowns (which leads to a lot of things like more knock-ups, more damage, etc.), relevant damage at all points of the game thanks to true damage (vs Aatrox who falls off mid-late), better base stats, a much more reliable/larger knock-up that is much easier to land (this + her mobility translates into better/more ganks), and far more utility, and transitions to a late game tank way better than Aatrox.\n\nAatrox has a free GA, potentially better prolonged sustain, a metric ton more AS, and a slow-moving small AoE skillshot that slows, and potentially more mixed damage early on (his magic damage because negligible mid-late). Other than that, Aatrox is split between either sustain or damage (remember, one or the other on the third auto vs Rek&#039;Sai who gets an auto attack reset - something that Aatrox, an AA based champion, lacks) and is worse in basically every other regard to Rek&#039;Sai. Additionally, Aatrox has to kill himself to keep his resource bar up and loses 15% of his current health with Q+E (1500 gold worth of stats at level 18 with Randuins/Spirit Visage/Warmogs) while Rek&#039;Sai&#039;s stats are 100% free.\n\nSo Riot, can Aatrox get his rework already or some ACTUAL changes? One QoL change to his ult doesn&#039;t change anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-06-08T04:47:42.179+0000","up_votes":49,"down_votes":3,"body":"Long term we'd still like to do some significant work to Aatrox, take advantage of his theme more and make him a champion with more distinct gameplay.

Assuming they aren't waiting for you and want to attack your teammates, then you have your Q off of CD and, since a lot of abilities will be blown, can jump on their adc or try to peel for your adc, depending on circumstance obviously.\n\nI absolutely agree that he needs some buffs because while the potential mechanics are there, his stats simply aren't.

May infringe into Taric's territory, but Taric is up for a rework last I heard and he really needs to be worked on even more than Aatrox probably.\n* Some sort of damage on hit buff for his team; similar to how Ardent Censer now gives magic damage on hit to his allies, have him do the same thing.

What we have now is a champion that completely revolves around self-buffing, and creates a really binary playstyle. In my humble opinion, as a rather frequent Aatrox player, is that Riot needs to give Aatrox a complete kit rework. Number tweaks might put him back into viability, but won't remove the binary abomination that Aatrox has become.\n> I would love to see him become a team buffing fighter, sorta like GP currently is with his E, but, of course with more team buffs.\n> That's just my opinion though, and of course, what I see as core identity may be different for others\n\nI agree. Aatrox should play out like a Commander, a jungler who has several bonuses fighting monsters, but against champions relies in rallying his teammates and strenghtening them. His kit should have all sorts of synergies, like:\n\nQ - Allies get bonus movement speed towards targets knocked up by Aatrox\n\nE - All enemy champions hit by this skill will enrage allies fighting them, increasing their attack speed against this target\n\nR - All champions hit by Aatrox ultimate will be marked with Bloodlust, which allows allies to heal based on damage dealt to all affected enemies (Spellvamp + Lifesteal).\n\n\nProbably would have to be hit by tons of damage nerfs, but I wouldn't mind having a champion that's useless 1vs1 and the only thing he can do alone is kill monsters, but can empower his allies in unique ways.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2015-06-07T13:54:38.869+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"i'm not really sure about this.

Vladimir may have been nerfed an incredible amount, but he's in a pretty good place right now. He has good poke, AoE, and a reasonably good escape. I think the biggest problem with his kit is that DoT and things like Fizz's R, Zed's R, and Veigar's E can still hit him while in his pool.
