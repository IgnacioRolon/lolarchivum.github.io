Caitlyn&#039;s niche is supposed to be the sniper. She uses her long range to damage people at a safe distance. Her net goes against this. \n\nIf somebody manages to get on top of her, she still has her net dash/slow to create some distance again. But why does it proc headshot? Shouldn&#039;t she be less effective once somebody manages to close the distance like most snipers in videogames are?\n\n It punishes anybody who tries to close the distance by not only slowing them and setting them up for the e-q combo, it also gives her an empowered auto attack. \n\nMaybe the slow could be increased so the e-q combo is more reliable and to emphasize her safety more, but she shouldn&#039;t gain extra damage by using her safety ability.","replies":[{"poster":"BLYAT moon Akali","date":"2016-07-12T20:34:40.286+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"cait's problem is that she is allowed to have up to 5 traps at once at absurdly low mana costs.\nenemy laners literally have nowhere to go, it's ridiculous. even a tanky support can step on a trap and eat a guaranteed q followed up by a headshot from huge range for very high damage. you can't ever clear traps unless caitlyn recalls.\nmorg and sivir used to counter the traps but now they don't.\n\ni don't have a problem with the net, but the trap maxing is just frustrating and should not be a thing in its current state.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-07-12T20:36:19.142+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AI RealSuperSand,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=syWk38FB,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-07-12T20:34:40.286+0000)\n>\n> cait&#x27;s problem is that she is allowed to have up to 5 traps at once at absurdly low mana costs.\n> enemy laners literally have nowhere to go, it&#x27;s ridiculous. even a tanky support can step on a trap and eat a guaranteed q followed up by a headshot from huge range for very high damage. you can&#x27;t ever clear traps unless caitlyn recalls.\n> morg and sivir used to counter the traps but now they don&#x27;t.\n> \n> i don&#x27;t have a problem with the net, but the trap maxing is just frustrating and should not be a thing in its current state.\n\nit wouldnt be as bad if she \"only\" had a lot of traps/cc and range imo. the mobility is kindof overkill.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-12T20:39:31.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"It's on a moderate cooldown, and isn't that great of mobility.\n\nBesides, even snipers should reposition every now and then, and sometimes that requires jumping through a wall.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-07-12T20:42:00.339+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Votable Jester,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=syWk38FB,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2016-07-12T20:39:31.967+0000)\n>\n> isn&#x27;t that great of mobility.\n\nyes, it is. on top of her already long auto attack range and the slow on the ability its a really strong mobility tool. fired point blank its a free disengage and sets her up for dropping a trap under her opponent.\n\nreduce the cooldown slightly to somehting around 10 seconds, increase the range and remove the dash. now she has to pay a bit more attention to positioning and actual kiting.\n\nthe backwards dash is just a result of mobility creep. her entire kit could work without it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-07-12T20:28:40.041+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"or remove the dash from the net, and increase the range on the ability to compensate.\n\nseriously, why does a long ranged poke adc with hard cc need mobility coupled with a slow? its just an arbitrary get out of jail free card tacked onto her kit for no actual reason.\n\nshe should focus on playing around her traps and long auto attack range. her net gives her a more reliable way to get an extra headshot, but the mobility is entirely unecessary.\n\nits like \"hey, this adc outranges most other adc in the game, and can poke like a nidalee. lets give her a dash in case shes ever stupid enough to get caught\"\n\nits similar with tristana. i dont understand why the 2 longest ranged adc are also the ones who have serious mobility coupled with hard cc in their kits.

And Garens Q should give him a dash to his target.\n\ntechnically he has one. its 50 units.\n\nthe game could do with less mobility. especially on champions with long range who already have an advatage when it comes to positioning, poking and kiting. why are certain adc kits just stacked against melees to the point that you need 3 or 4 people to lock them down?\n\nthink of how many recources you have to blow to get in range of a tristana. you have to get through her auto attack range 3 or 4 times.\n\nif an adc has some kiting tool, its not the problem, but some of the are just overloaded with them while they have mobility. theyre still the class that deals the most conistent damage in the game and should remain somewhat team reliant.\n\nits the same reason i just cant stand vayne. its not even her damage, but her mobility and free disengage coupled with it.\n\nkog maw has range and a load of damage too. but hes more team reliant because he doesnt get a free dash or knockback in case he fucks up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
