It does 320 at 10-15 min by then i would be lucky to have 200 or near AD assuming i am going full AD. This does not add up. They need to have 150-200 static those damage increase things and armor pen for turrets is just toxic interaction and doesn&#039;t seem healthy in any way considering they stand with 5000 hp and can get up to 300 armor so they basically are just there to be op whenever they want.\r\n\r\nTurrets doing too much damage, gold income too high for laners, snow balling too much effective, little comebacks. all this together is a too much damage meta. But runes are ironically a small portion of this problem.","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2019-01-24T23:45:00.148+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good, Turrets should be strong","replies":[]},{"poster":"The thigh guy","date":"2019-01-25T00:54:51.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um.
