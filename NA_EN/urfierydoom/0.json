The entire high elo Yi mains reddit fought with riot on twitter for all of 9.8 and 9.9 and told them the nerf to guinsoos is not a good idea but did they still go through with all changes? YES! and they reverted buff on highlander and added a 2% conqueror nerf just cause! \r\n\r\nSo this shows that they do not listen to the actual people playing LoL and would post 4 nerfs to a champ in the same patch for beginners that is only relevant under plat and sucks at high elo. \r\n\r\nNote: This is not a disrespect/hate speech thread so stop hiding the truth moderators! This is probably what Riot wants them to do, delete all evidence of people not liking league of legends.\r\nThis is a analysis to show people that riot games doesn't listen to the players and it is true but thats something to do with not so great game developers.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-05-17T05:03:17.467+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"\\- community\n*\"Damage inflation is getting out of control, stop just buffing everyone!\"*\n\n\\- also community\n*\"Wtf Riot, why did you nerf the item/rune/champion that I like to use?\"*","replies":[{"poster":"Soul Dealer","date":"2019-05-17T05:08:46.160+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AeroWaffle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=abEP1kdA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-05-17T05:03:17.467+0000)\n>\n> \\- community\n> *\"Damage inflation is getting out of control, stop just buffing everyone!\"*\n> \n> \\- also community\n> *\"Wtf Riot, why did you nerf the item/rune/champion that I like to use?\"*\n\nTo be fair when riot nerfs something they almost always do it the wrong way.","replies":[{"poster":"UrFieryDoom","date":"2019-05-17T05:20:14.514+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes exactly.\n\nQuote: \nYea trashing an entire build archetype and nerfing the champion that uses it while giving vayne a slap on the wrist is totally fixing damage.

It's right up there with console elitism; pissing on any console that they personally didn't like.\n\nI think it stems from a deeper embarrassment and lack of self confidence.

Therefore we should listen to them and not nerf the most dominant top laner\n\n\nthousands of yi mains on twitter were also enjoying the changes, and understanding respectfully why the changes were changes and not just direct nerfs.\nthousands of yi mains aren't you and won't just cry foul the moment something changes.\nYes Rageblade got nerfed. Yes Yi got changed. Perhaps the changes to yi ended up being more power negative than Riot had hoped, but the change was aimed at allowing Yi to be less of a low elo stomper and better when you're good with him. Regardless of if this succeeded or not, Rageblade was getting nerfed for more reasons than just Yi and Yi wasn't even nerfed, instead changed and updated in such a way that riot thought would help Yi shift into better or different builds and styles rather than forcing his balance to be tied to Guinsoos. \n\nYou're basically just crying over a tiny slap on the wrist, just like you said Vayne mains are. Yi got off pretty fucking swell considering his rising popularity in higher elo, and he's been a low elo stomper for years now. If you think this is the worst thing that could of happened, then you're very naive. You got away with the removal of the bonus AD on E, and changes to the way R movespeed was calculated, but gained a new mechanic on your Q (improving single target damage, making your untargetability more consistent and powerful &amp; improving your clear) and removed cast times on your Q + E. \n\nI'm going to quote Riot's context with regards to the changes. I'll highlight the areas I think you need to pay attention to.\n>\"We want to **increase the satisfaction on key parts of Master Yi's kit** while **nerfing him in ways that'll help out those who don't know how to counter him**. **Those with more experience won't find Master Yi significantly better or worse, but he won't continue to dominate in average play.\"**\"\n\nIf the changes end up being too detrimental, then he'll get buffed soon. They did it for Aatrox, they did it for Yuumi, they do it when they notice a significant loss in a champions power. Yi's lost a little bit of power, relative to where he was before, but its nowhere near as bad as you think. You're just crying murder over a small scratch.\n\n***ADAPT OR DIE***\n\n\nP.S: Acting like this is some sort of analysis rather than a rant thread is hilarious. If this thread gets removed, its because you categorized it wrong. Get off your high horse and just accept that you're mad. You're not conducting a social autopsy, you're just salty about changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-05-17T06:29:14.550+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UrFieryDoom,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=abEP1kdA,comment-id=000100020000000000000000,timestamp=2019-05-17T06:02:45.691+0000)\n>\n> Okay and i'll also restate a part of my other post.\n> \n> Thousands of Yi mains on reddit asked riot to not do this guinsoos nerf for 9.8 and 9.9 and they still did it.\n> So is it just me or haven't I gotten verification from every Yi main in reddit they all think this change is non sense.\n> \n> And if this wasn't backed up by all yi mains in reddit(but it is) then see this\n> If riot won't listen to one then how can they listen to many of ones?\n\nWhat does it matter to you now?\n\nSounds like you're off to go play Wizard101.
