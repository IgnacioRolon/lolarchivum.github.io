If one team has a vayne top and a twitch, that lose to a jinx bottom ez jg. It would effect 4 winrates (which could leave a larger impact making them seem balanced).

Same argument does not apply to any other lane in the game, because they are inhabited by many different classes of champions. There is only one class that is the bottom carry class, and that is the adc.\n\nAs a jungler you can see tanks/bruisers/assasins/mages/adc's thus the winrate and playrate of champions is affected by that. However the bottom carry role has only the adc class in it, thus in every game you will see at least 2 adc's. And one will inevitably lose, leading to many adc's having near 50% winrates EVEN if they are unbalanced.\n\nAgain, i ask you to do some research in how winrates operate and how context matters, because you still seem to not be able to grasp that concept.\n> \n> They're reliable and versatile. There you go. Then people in soloQ play them because they saw other people play them. Then people in soloQ see them picked a lot and assume they're broken. \n\nYour argument operates on circular logic. \"Why do people play a champion? Because they saw others play it\" Its circular logic fallacy. The reason why champions become popular in a meta is because they are strong in a certain meta, or due to certain meta changes become too strong and thus allow people to win more games on the back of the champion. Currently janna is a great example of that.\n\nPeople in soloq play certain champions at a high rate because those champions are good and in the meta. This knowledge comes from experience and yes, looking at others, because you can observe a champions strenght without playing that champion.\n\n\n\n> I hate to say no but. In the \"current meta\", people pick Twitch, assuming he's broken, and feed on him. It used to be Vayne. Or Yasuo. Or Riven. Or Zed. Or Lee.\n\nSome people will always suck on certain champions even if they are op. Tell me, was Kassawin (Prenerf) a completely balanced champion if someone sucked with him? No, he was the most broken champion in the history of league. Someone being able to lose with an op champion, does not make that champion not op. One of the more notable example in this is Azir, who was broken due to his kit, yet due to his high skillcap only good players could abuse it.\n\n> She never was, Cait's weakness was always her midgame (which people didn't play for) and sorry, she was disliked for being a pubstomper.

The current cait thrives at all times of play, she was disliked for being unfair to play against, i know, i was here and saw the threads. Master yi is also a pubstomper, i don't see threads about him. That is because being a pubstomp champ is not a problem.\n\nShe was not the only threathening adc, however, she was too strong for what she had. She had no proper weaknesses to exploit. And she was more broken than zed or yasuo, both of which were nerfed for more than one reason, which you seem to not know.\n\nPlease, i will repeat again.

Because they saw others play it&quot; Its circular logic fallacy. \n\nAh, if only I hadn't also said that thing about them being reliable and versatile, then that would be true.\n>The reason why champions become popular in a meta is because they are strong in a certain meta, or due to certain meta changes become too strong and thus allow people to win more games on the back of the champion. \n\nThat's not wrong but that's not the only factor and quite frankly the people on these forums are blatantly ignoring any successful champion that isn't an AD damage dealer when they complain about champions.\n>Currently janna is a great example of that.\n\nLol, \"*currently* Janna\", the most overpicked soloQ support for years is \"currently\" being abused.\n> People in soloq play certain champions at a high rate because those champions are good and in the meta. This knowledge comes from experience and yes, looking at others, because you can observe a champions strenght without playing that champion.\n> \n> Some people will always suck on certain champions even if they are op. Tell me, was Kassawin (Prenerf) a completely balanced champion if someone sucked with him? No, he was the most broken champion in the history of league. \n\nAnd winning with him was notably easier too and these people here say that all there is to playing ADC is getting RNG crits and rightclicking. Are you telling me they're wrong?\n>Someone being able to lose with an op champion, does not make that champion not op. One of the more notable example in this is Azir, who was broken due to his kit, yet due to his high skillcap only good players could abuse it.\n\nIt would also be reflected in \"oh they picked Azir, let's see if the enemy team can win\" being said at high levels of play, which isn't the case with Twitch or any other random champions that people circlejerk against.\n> OLD cait weakness was midgame, not the current ones. The current cait thrives at all times of play, she was disliked for being unfair to play against, i know, i was here and saw the threads. \n\nThat is so insightful; \"unfair to play against\". Incredible research.\n>Master yi is also a pubstomper, i don&#x27;t see threads about him. That is because being a pubstomp champ is not a problem.\n\nIf Yi was picked a lot, you bet there would be complaints about him. Although they might be more muted because a jungler doesn't bully you. People wouldn't notice him, even though he'd be a dominating factor.\n> She was not the only threathening adc, however, she was too strong for what she had. She had no proper weaknesses to exploit. \n\nYou mean outside of having more damage than her during the midgame if you didn't walk into her traps?\n>both of which were nerfed for more than one reason, which you seem to not know.\n\nLol sure, reasons like \"they have a Q that can damage me when I do things normally do\" or \"they have a passive, nerf that!\". I was there too, that's all there was. Prove me wrong.\n> Please, i will repeat again. Do some research before talking, because not only can you not grasp basic concepts as how winrate operates, you do not even know the context of balance changes you talk about, nor do you know the metas you are talking about.\n\nI do know, every time I see a thread complaining about a champion they complain about some part of their kit that clearly doesn't matter if you play well. Or that ignores certain irremovable factors in the game. Like  a duo or trio of overpicked ADCs.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2017-09-23T10:25:23.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Classes and roles are two different things. Many junglers can be played top lane. Many top laners can be played jungle. Many mids can be played top and vice versa. That is not the only thing, for example, even if one class has only one role, that does not mean that the role has only one class. For example the role of the midlaner can be covered by at least 3 classes without even counting subclasses. Same with other roles besides the bottom carry role.\n\nThe bottom carry role has only one class that is played there, the adc, and it is not changeable to any other class. Thus winrates of the adc class always center around 50% no matter how broken or not they are.\n\nFor example, im midlane, if assasins become the top dogs, their winrate will skyrocket while the other classes winrate will plummet, because midlane is inhabited by many different classes.\n\nAnd yes, i agree champ power is not the only thing influencing its popularity, however in terms of meta, that factor is one of the most important ones. Currently many champions are ignored and the focus is on the adc's because the boards and humans have a one track mind. They want to fix the current problem and then move on from there. While i agree that adc's might not bwe the only problems in the game, until we fix THAT problem, we cannt really move on to others, because every fix will have some consequences and yet again change the meta.\n\nAlso, janna has not been the most overpicked support, that title belongs to thresh. Janna has always had a good winrate and playrate due to the nature of her kit, not because she is op. However the buffs to coin, ardent and the overall synergy with those items paired with the increased strenght of the adcs pushed janna overboard in this season.\n\nI do not agree that adc as a class does not require skill. It does, it is more than right cicking. The problem is that currently, it is not as seen as previously. Again, when was the last time you actually saw an assasin in your game? Because every adc counter is so incredibly weak right now, they are running rampart and their skill requirement has fallen from where it was previously.\n\nI am summarizing caits problems into a few phrases because this is not a cait discussion, many people and me included have already listed her problems many times on the boards, and she had many.\n\nAnd again, popularity is not the thing that makes people go against those champs and calling them op. Popularity is directly tied to champion power. As such again, if a champ is indeed unbalanced he will become popular, you have to make a distinction about why people complain about champs, and it is not popularity. There have been many popular champs that have not been complained about.\n\nAgain, traps were not the main source of damage of cait, since she could proc her headshots from many other ways including her mobility spell. Saying that others had more damage than her in midgame is simply false, becuase her damage even without headshots was high.\n\nAnd no, complaints about zed and yasuo were far better explained, but you seemed to ignore them for the sake of your argumentation. While yes, there were  some stupid threads talking shite, there were just as many threads talking extensivelly about these problems.\n\nAdc's are not an ireemovable factor of this game. if the game was properly balanced they would be removable and interchangeable. Best example of that is dota, even Hots and Smite have gotten that right.","replies":[{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2017-09-24T13:23:39.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And as I've said, junglers being played in the toplane are an exception, not the rule. Buuut I can kind of see your logic now. Wow, an actual argument for how ADCs are (or well, could be) broken ,despite of all the champions that are doing a better than them, and it isn't their pickrate and it only took me months to find one!\n\nRegardless, onto disagreeing with you. I do appreciate you laying out your arguments for me like this though. Really. ^_^\n\nIf we \"fix\" the current ADCs, can you guess what will happen? That's right, different ADCs with a dominating winrate and pickrate will pop up. That's literally always how it's been and quite frankly, that's what *you're* ignoring.\n\nThe only popular champions who don't get complained about are the ones whose input is incremental. Janna is a great example of this. The fact that ADCs have to be picked every game and as such, have higher pickrates than champions who outperform them, which are *countless*, is why they're considered a \"balance issue\" here.\n\nWant another example? Consider Lucian or Corki mid. Abyssmal winrates, literally nothing broken about them but \"oh look at how OP ADCs are, they're getting picked mid!\" Or Thresh! \n\nNo, I'm not ignoring any complaints about Zed or Yas. The only upvoted threads were \"look at their banrates! The new Kassadin!\" and some passive aggressive ramblings about Yasuo killing you with his ... \"tank\" build. As if bruisers building tank items was some sort of novelty. Zed had already been gutted repeatedly, so even this forum couldn't come up with more things to hate. They just didn't like what little kill pressure he had left. There were other complaints? \n*D o   t e l l.* (And don't bring up Wind Wall, just don't.)\n\nWhat you're saying kind of implies that Caitlyn did huge (midgame) damage without her only AA roid, erm, wut? Her only damage sources outside of her headshot are her Q, her R and technically her range. \n\nAn assassin in my games? Last time I queued up for normals. And what about Talon? In all seriousness, if the nerfed assassins are the reason for this anti-ADC circlejerk then that's some delicious irony. Because this community is entirely the reason why they all got and get gutted. \n\nDotA's balance is imbalance. One OP thing counters the other. That's not the direction LoL is going in.\nAs far as I know, HotS has its own version of Herald accessible from minute 0 (multiple times). You really want that in LoL?\nLoL has had around 5 seasons of ADCs and any deviation from that hasn't exactly been the epitome of balance. But do elaborate, what would a balanced version of LoL look like?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"i cant move wtf","date":"2017-09-17T13:36:42.733+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":4,"body":"For a role that many here consider easy, it's amazing how many people are so bad at it.","replies":[{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2017-09-17T14:27:18.295+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=i cant move wtf,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1fEOhKNW,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-09-17T13:36:42.733+0000)\n>\n> For a role that many here consider easy, it&#x27;s amazing how many people are so bad at it.\n\nBecause it requires positioning to be consistent.
