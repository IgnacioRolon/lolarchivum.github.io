I would think that the mana restoration is a on-hit effect that procs when the attack proc's, and the bounces of Sivir's do not proc on hit effects. That's how it makes sense to me at least.

How exactly is this unfair? I mean, there are champions that are actually resourceless without needing anything. There are also champions that have a resource but are still very relevant when that resource runs out (e.g. a Jinx can easily go OOM, but she's still hitting massive AAs when she is OOM). \n\nI play Ahri mid. The number of times I've lost a 2v2 countergank pre-6 because I had too little mana is insane. Mana is a huge issue for me - I even take a few points in meditation but it doesn't matter. There are plenty of lane opponents that I can hit every Q on, and I'll go OOM before I can kill them. How in the world is that resourceless? Using only my primary harass ability and I go OOM before they're forced to recall? \n\nI mean, damn, Mana gates me early game. It'd be horrific if I was gated late game. Yea, I'm 30% of my team's total damage output, and that damage will entirely disappear if I go OOM in a fight. Instant lost game off of that. Sounds fair, when any non-AP champion or resourceless AP champion doesn't have the problem of being completely useless if they go OOM.","replies":[{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2017-03-20T21:41:42.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"oh 2900gold is a massive item right? it gives cdr ap mana on assists the blood of a virgin but its a massively overpriced right? gtfo.","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2017-03-20T22:15:20.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dominusx,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0VH5XF6y,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-03-20T21:41:42.739+0000)\n>\n> oh 2900gold is a massive item right? it gives cdr ap mana on assists the blood of a virgin but its a massively overpriced right? gtfo.\n\nThe point is, mages are gated by mana early, and by cooldowns late.\n\nThey're not supposed to run out of mana late game. They never have. Back in season 4 you'd rush DFG which didn't give any mana and you still wouldn't go OOM in the mid game very often because you had enough innate mana regen (well, and mana pots were a thing). \n\nIt would be horribly unfair for a mage to be able to go OOM late game (unless they're just nonstop spamming spells on nothing, or have a scaling mechanic like kassadin ult). It doesn't make sense. Their entire kit is centered on damage, and all of their damage requires mana. The champions are literally useless, worse than minions, without mana. So why in a late game teamfight that's going to decide the game, should a champion who has actually spent gold on mana items and leveled up (i.e. level 18 base stats should be pretty solid to let a champion do what they're designed to do) become completely useless because they hard pushed 3 or 4 waves before a fight broke out? How ridiculous would that be? Why should Zed/Yasuo/Katarina and company basically get a guaranteed free win by clearing waves that the mana-opponent can't match until they're OOM and either have a literal 5v4 or one where the 5th is oom?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ben Sharpio","date":"2017-03-20T21:34:06.817+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"you think theyre out of mana so you try to fight them and then they use 4 rotations of spells, 1 death combo and their ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2017-03-20T21:27:27.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Remember when mages were QQing about how there was going to be a colossal mana shortage in the coming mage update?
