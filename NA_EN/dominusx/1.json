I saw a wow forum and a bunch of people also had same issues with way more expencive machinery aswell with a suggestion about turning off a recording program from the xbox app available on w8/w10. FUnny part is the july update causes my mice to mulfuction all 3 of them (they arent expencive dont call me a spoiled cuck) whilist the AUGUST uypdate caused major FPS issues and a lot of crashes.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-08-13T23:21:27.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, did you end up disabling the xbox app game DVR that the latest windows update forced or nah?\nBecause I was having the above issues and doing that actually solved it for me.\nI used this vid to get it done:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6DFUgBE4g&feature=youtu.be","replies":[{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2016-08-14T11:35:47.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"indeed this fixed the problems regarding the games, now i'm still on the lookout for any freezes cause those occured outside the game aswell . simply by browsing ( btw at the time i posted this i was in bed and i did it with a tablet thus why i didnt post my results. ) Also ty for the video i already knew how to do it but still you took time to post it many thanks","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-08-14T13:04:14.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No prob^^ glad it helped a little.\nYeah Windows 10 has a lot of things that are annoying; would be a nice OS too if we didn't have to fight with it all the time.  \nAs for the freezes outside the game I'm not sure what's causing them.  I've had to spend a lot of time force uninstalling windows 10 features by going through folders/deleting stuff I just wish they'd ask before putting stuff on our comps.\nAt one time Cortana was causing the freezes so I got rid of her, and then the  search windows bar was acting up so I got rid of that.\n\nBest thing would be to look at what's eating a lot of memory on your process list during the time near the freezes and then to google that to see if you can find a lead.  Be super careful and cross-reference stuff though since force-uninstalling stuff is dangerous.\n(gotta say this; you likely already know why though)","replies":[{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2016-08-14T13:29:27.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah W10 has only caused me problems tbh. i switched to them after friends reccomendation but i only had a stable patch since june.
