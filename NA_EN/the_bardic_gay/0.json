Outclassed by Morello's as a mana item for casters who rely on spell spam to deal relevant damage. I'm certain some people are quite happy with this, considering that it used to be an item you could buy to forget about your mana pool. That's not something I think needs to come back, it's a bit of a bad concept, even if some of my favorite champions greatly benefited from it. Anthene's unholy grail should be made a decent item that's worth buying, and as such, it should be given something that differentiates it from the rest of the mana/cdr/ap/ items. \r\n\r\nNow, we ask ourselves, why, exactly, is anthene's an *unholy* grail? Clearly, it's a grail filled with blood. It's omnious, cultish, malevolent. If I had to guess, it looked like it was a sacrificial artifact of sorts.\r\n\r\nI think you get where I'm going with this.\r\n\r\nI propose, that in order to make Anthene's a more thematically complete item, that is also a viable choice, that it should be given an active ability, one that allows the user to sacrifice a portion of their HP for a buff. *Maybe* a toggle, but I think an active ability with a cost would be easier to balance.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't quite know what this active would be. It should be something that is obviously geared for sustained damage mages, so i think a damage amp is a bit out of the question, otherwise it'd just be a slightly different version of DFG with a health cost. Perhaps a Cooldown reduction/mana buff? Something that applied bonus cooldown reduction that ignored the cap would be pretty fly, if you asked me.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm iffy on the details, but I think this is an idea that could genuinely give help to an item that got slammed, as well as providing a nice thematic touch to the item.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Sailor Mint","date":"2015-02-04T22:25:18.334+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You build Grail when you want MR, you build Morello's otherwise.

Taking damage shouldn't constitute being able to dish out less sustained damage unless you're dead. That's just a fundamental rule to multiplayer games. No one's resource is screwed when they take damage, literally no one, and it's an unfair playstyle. It's only good against poke champs, and even then it's unfair because if they're low on hp then their mana is gated to the harshest extreme in which getting Morello's would be better in all situations because it would always provide more regen. \n\nThere is no way to not make it feast or famine. It has to give a lot more regen at a higher current health than any other regen item, because if it doesn't than other mana items are always better, and at that point it skews it into a position where poke champs are again the best because of their safety.

It's like the change made me learn to conserve mana, which of course you said was a good thing, that going back to not giving a hoot about mana anymore was a horrible place.\n\nI still think 1 or 2 champions here and their need a small buff to their mana regen/pool to give them some help.\n\n\n\nIf I were to have any change added to the item, It would be the lower price or giving it a health boost.\nOR! \n\nImagine if it had a passive that granted nearby allies more mana regen? It would be a great support item them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xtremey","date":"2015-02-05T17:18:41.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3174}} **TOGGLE:**  Sacrifice X% of your max health every second for X% of your max mana.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weasel Kensei","date":"2015-02-05T10:57:10.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im sorry I have to disagree farily strongly. You may not have the ability to \"forget\" about your mana bar with is alone, but certain things are impossible without it. Im pretty sure I can still take Aniva and build mana and AUG and  maintain her ult at an enemy turret much longer while sieging with it than without it.... Id like to see that done with alone {{item:3165}} .\n\nJust like you get item synergy from {{item:3151}} {{item:3116}}  you may have to build {{item:3003}} {{item:3174}}  to get super good mana regen. In several games I have saved up the 1,750 or so gold just to get {{item:3028}} {{item:3070}} . This will mean that I can spam skills on Ziggs so hard that... I can still run oom but it is much harder. As that Tear otG charges up, the amount regened by AUG gets larger and larger meaning more and more mana sustain.\n\nIm a bit new to LoL, but not mobas. I prefer resource sustain and if manafont was taken it would hurt me. Maybe not every player but my play style for many of my champs would be impacted in a negative manner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SleepyLionCub","date":"2015-02-05T04:33:35.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chalice should just give 45 mr :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-02-04T23:30:27.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if its mana regen increased depending on how much health you are missing?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-02-04T22:27:04.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think its still good as an early magic resist option versus AP assassins. i still buy it a lot of the time and i have pretty good success with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Giovarco","date":"2015-02-04T22:25:12.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good idea.
