Crit items scale poorly alone, but provide a ton of synergy with eachother, making them the best late game items, but this leaves Kindred in the dust until they have atleast IE + a zeal item.\r\n\r\n To fix this i believe, that riot has to make her QW interaction scale with their levels instead of the points in their Q. This would open up the possibility of Kindred maxing E first and having a stronger burst for their ganks, aswell as in the smaller skirmishes around drag and towers. \r\nKindred&#039;s Q would not feel very appealing to put points into after this change, so making it go down in mana cost until it reaches 0 at rank 5 (like Lucian&#039;s e) would be the ideal solution in my opinion. Kindred spams this ability, and theres no reason for them to OOM while doing exactly what they&#039;re supposed to do.\r\n\r\nThey have other weaknesses too (w feels clunky, used to be instant. They OOM in the jungle and have poor sustain) but addressing their weak mid-game feels more neccessary than these, since they gutted their early game long time ago and made her a mid-late game champion.\r\n\r\nAlso, why on earth does Wolf do % current hp damage, when lorewise he is the guy who chases down the foes who wont willingly offer themselves to Lamb? He should do % missing hp dmg imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2017-06-19T00:54:58.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or they could've just revert the rework and make her Q apply onhit effects and be done with it.
