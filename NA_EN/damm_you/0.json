They said it was one of my processes, which upon removal didn't work. I put all that time into doing the steps and providing the information they wanted, and I get this in return? they also didn't give me a human response to my chat restriction query, and simply gave a blanket statement claiming they analysed my games, which they didn't because it took three hours for a reply, and I had loads more than three hours worth of game time. Not impressed with player support, and nobody will listen. Sorry.","replies":[]}]}]}
