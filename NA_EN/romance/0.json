At least in Season 3 I would get those ADCs who wouldn&#039;t talk which was great, but it seems now every ADC is just some entitled little brat. They get a role DEDICATED TO PROTECTING THEM, have another role who does what they can to SPOONFEED KILLS TO THE ADC AND WIN THEIR LANE FOR THEM, and yet they have the nerve to act as if they&#039;re the only reason the team wins? Seriously, any one else noticing this?","replies":[]}
