The skin looks really cool and sinister. Well, it was sinister until I heard the voice.  You kept Soraka's VO the same and only added a spectral filter to it. I'm not saying it's bad but when you hear Soraka talk, she does sound a bit sinister until you hear what she has to say. \n\nBecause of this, our new reaper goat sounds a bit out of place. This reaper shows compassion when reapers shouldn't. She shows sympathy and remorse when reapers shouldn't.  She cares about the living when reapers shouldn't. She acts like a reaper who would sooth and calm the spirits before ushering them into the next world instead of simply dragging them there.\n~~This tells me two things: ~~\n1) Reapers have a bad PR firm and have be unjustly characterized as heartless monsters.\n~~2) She's the oddball member in the reaping business.~~\nEdit: Because of the comments below, it's safe to say reapers have a really bad PR firm. \n\nI personally kinda like the idea of a reaper who flips this concept of what a reaper should act like. So with that said I want to suggest the splash art for Reaper Soraka. Try to make her appear either neutral or kind. Why not sinister? Simply because of how she sounds. It just would not fit with how this person acts. If you wanna go with a more mysterious look that can work as well because of how she looks. \n\nAgain, thanks for making this skin and I hope you take my suggestion into consideration.\n\nAlso what does everyone else think? Does anyone else see this kind Reaper goat or am I looking too deep into this?","replies":[{"poster":"Voidbringers","date":"2014-10-09T02:49:20.821+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reapers are sort of shepards for the souls of the dead, in a sense they're more akin to caretakers than killers.

Characters like the Grim Reaper and Hades are almost always portrayed evil, and I think this is just false: they are the most neutral of all, seeing as death comes to *everyone* not just good people. They see everybody, good or bad. They are just generally unwelcome, but respected. \n\nI do like that Soraka is being given this skin, as it drives that point further home.","replies":[{"poster":"Vellich0r","date":"2014-10-31T18:18:23.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hades was widely considered evil because that was his character type.","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2014-11-11T14:37:24.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I meant Hades from classic Greek Mythology, not like a specific portrayal of Hades.
