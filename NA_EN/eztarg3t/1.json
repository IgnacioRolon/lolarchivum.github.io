Most of it has been revolved around her second passive mainly and pretty much been judged based on it. But now it seems people are noticing some other things about her kit that people have been very worried about.\n\nSo I wanna talk about her ENTIRE kit this time instead of just her passive. I will be critical at some points but it's going to be moreover positive outlook at this kit...again. Sorry, if you're hoping that I'll join the bandwagon of shitting on this kit. Get ready for disappointment.\n\nI will be saving Q for last though because I found out about something that, simply put, pissed me off.\n[Here is Sorakas kit on the [Board](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/BTP5uwf1-this-rework-is-going-to-be-bananas-soraka-rework-preview-and-discussion)]\n*********************\nLet's start off with her Passive\nHer first one, no comment. Everyone loves this idea and has spawned WEEE WOO WEE WOO. Now we are just waiting on a paramedic Soraka skin. It has to come true, don't let us down Riot.\n\nHer second passive...well, I already talked about it[ here](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4828918&highlight=) and Vesh was able to give us some more insight into why this was implemented in that thread as well. Personally, this is just a new and radical idea that will obviously be looked at with a negative point of view. I **THINK** it can work but the only way we will know once the goat lady has arrived in the PBE.\n******************\nSkipping Q and going straight to W.\n\nNow the biggest issue with this ability is that Soraka will be using 10% of her max health. This was created to simply stop Soraka from building tanky but also create an actual trade of sorts. I'll argue that it acts more like a transfer of damage of sorts. The damage applied didn't go away it simply went to the wrong person you wanted to kill. Also the interation between Q and W helps delete the damage. Let's go through some complaints:\n1. She can only heal 10 times.\\ Not if she brings a few health potions. Not if she acquires a few health regen items (although itemization is rather poor for this). Not if she lands her Q. Not if she  acquires either Crucible or GA. There are plenty of things Soraka can do so she can heal more than just 10 times. It's tricky but it's doable. Then again, if she could get it easily, people would call this kit cancerous.\n2. Champions like Sona and Nami can outheal her. Heck even alister could outheal her.\\ I agree, champions like Sona and Nami could outheal Soraka...in the long run. But in short burst however, Soraka would leave the other sustain champions in the dust...at least, I think that will be the case. Sure Sona and Nami could heal a champion to max health but Soraka would be able to do it far faster. This is only assuming a Soraka player isn't trying to get that health back somehow in the process of healing her allies.\nI will admit that 10% is rather pricy but if Soraka does scale well with ap, I believe the health she will sacrifice will be on the small side compared to how much she heals her allies.I will also admit the amount of gating they put on this heal is rather heavy: health/mana/CD on her Q.\n****************\nAlright on to her E\n\nA lot of people are sad to see the mana restoration to go away. I too will be sad to see it go as well. It really was a unique ability that no other champion could call their own. But at this point, I'm simply preaching to the choir. But lets look at the positives this new E will bring.\n\nFor starters this is also a unique ability on its own as well. Many people thought Riot was trying to get rid of silence with how previous champions have had theirs taken away, Leblanc anyone? This is an ability that creates an AOE silence field that after it is done, roots any enemy left in it. I don't think any other champion can say they can do that. I mean, finally people can't flash or dash out of Jarvan's ult anymore if Soraka is on his team. I will admit that 24 second CD is rather large (too large) but I think this is just Riot erring on the side of caution. I really do hope they bring it down a bit because of the fact she only has a few CC abilities and only one ability that causes damage. \nI'm kinda curious as to why equinox does not do damage as well, at least during the root part. Although, if it did do damage, it might create some serious wave clearing potential. So that could be a reason.\n\n******\nNow to her R\n\nNothing much has changed about her ult except it gaining more power for each ally below 40%. I really wished (hue) that Soraka armor buff would've been transferred to her ult. Even if it sounds OP, I would've loved for it to be on here. Other than that, So far so good.\n\n*******\nNow to the big one. The one ability I think will either have her kit be successful or be an utter failure. Her Q.\n\nThis ability has a 10 second CD, a kinda weak CC, the healing capabilities are only effective on enemy champions, and is more reliable using at close range...\nI find that last part the most rediculous. I may be reading this part wrong but I feel like due to Soraka is going to be really squishy and probably going to juggle her health bar a lot, why would you make an ability that has a 10 second CD difficult to land at long range? I really need to see this ability in action because I can deal with all of her entire kit except for that little bit. She's already loaded with a lot of things to juggle and I feel like Riot is trying to load her with as much counterplay simply because they are afraid of a core healer. \nI understand that you should make it kinda difficult to delete her own damage, elsewise she will become OP and unfun. But this does not feel like difficulty to me, it feels more like a punishment. Now if landing her Q goes from ridiculously easy to land at short range to it requires actual skill to land then I think I am ok with that. \nIf this ability is on a 10 second CD then it shouldn't be really difficult to land. I would really like it if I can hurt enemy minions or jungle creep and heal up a bit at a reduced price if it's going to be on a 10 second CD. That way I can chose to either go for a cheap easy heal or risk going for a more powerful heal.\nI could be overreacting about this ability and once she hits the PBE then it will all make sense but right now this seems really wrong. She already has a lot of counterplay on her kit and if her Q is unreliable at long range then this just feels unfair.\nAlso I really hope that CC can, at least, scale up some more because I feel like 20% is kinda weak if someone is right on your a[B]s[/B]s.\nOf course, with all that said, this could be for the sake of making the laning phase fair. If someone is capable of deleting any damage you make it should be difficult on their part to keep doing that. I felt like ranting about this part of her kit but I might be simply overlooking something.\n*******\nWell, that's pretty much it. Besides her Q, I feel kinda alright with her kit. I might be overreacting with her Q and it could work. Except for that CC, I really think that needs to scale up. Now if you have gotten through all of this, Congratulations! Feel free to tell me how wrong I am and how stupid it is to even put faith in this kit. You've earned that much for taking the time to read my post.","replies":[{"poster":"Marthian","date":"2014-09-04T23:16:16.961+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm still holding off on making my thoughts on her new kit until the full numbers are revealed.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2014-09-05T04:13:12.229+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"This is a good mindset.

I think there's three conversation points:\n\n1) I fundamentally believe if Soraka is allowed to get tanky, we'll have to gut her. This release valve is there to prevent this and allow her to be good.\n\n2) New Soraka is both more narrow and more unique. Picking Soraka is very different than picking another support. If we want champions to have a unique strategic identity and have a reason \"to be played,\" this is important.\n\n3) The current passive can be tuned into obliteration if it's actually a problem, but we need a release valve. I know Soraka wants AR/MR/HP - that's why we have to discourage it or it will run afoul of 1), and Soraka will be gutted, and we might as well have not done anything and left her in the dumpster.\n\nTradeoffs are a huge component of good design, and sustainable champions. We've chosen these ones because we believe it will allow us to actually make a real healer character.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-09-06T01:58:14.762+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"There is, strictly speaking, nothing wrong with any of your points. You're missing something, however. You are not releasing her in a vacuum. You're releasing her in a game where grievous wounds is a thing that is on at least two ADCs kits and is easy available with a summoner spell that is almost guaranteed to be on at least one member of the enemy team. You're releasing her in a game with assassins that can use her to refresh their cooldowns and them obliterate her carry. And you're releasing her in a game with a bunch of hyper mobile champs that can run circles around her and dodge all of her Qs.\n\nI cannot say if her whole kit is bad, as I have not played it, but that passive is really worrying. You're giving every enemy team member 20% bonus armor and magic penetration on her.

A Critical Guideline of Soraka is that she must be vulnerable to being killed while healing to allow her to be an insane health-refiller.

It just looks like Soraka is going to take some skill now. Which I am going to freaking love because as much as I love my Bi-ped unicorn, I get bored of her stale play-style sometimes.

Vesh has worked very hard to try to make this a reality, and the previoust costs/downsides with things like blue healers or even other LoL champions don't do well when you give a character bonkers haling to friends. \n\nI've been against healing as a role a long time - I've learned my problems are with its execution and lack of decisions (for themselves or enemies) that's problematic. So, we've take a stab at fixing that. \n\nYou should be scared as Soraka. You're trying to heal people who should kill people and protect people for you. You can still buy GA and have 80% of the value in defense. You're not going to have 4000 HP and 200 armor/100MR on Soraka. As a healer, being tanky WOULD be the natural build, so we have to prevent that case.\n\nTHIS can let us make a character who SUPPORTS by HEALING to an unprecendented degree in LoL. No one else can do this. You want support to change a game? You want new reasons to pick a character? I hear you - super clearly. \n\nIt's not all buffs.

(I actually still believe that blitz slowing down after his speed buff was an interesting and good mechanic.)\n\nI still think that the raw stats you are asking of her will require either a massive amount of new support items, or push her into mid lane as sort of an inverse Karthus. Not that a Midlane inverse Karthus is a bad thing, I actually enjoy that thought.\n\nAlso, I believe that while balanced in appearance, the passive and W costs to prevent her from building tanky are both forced and dumb. If built tanky AP or support, she is making a viable choice one way or another, should Q be effective. Without Q being effective, she doesn't work at all. These forced mechanics don't actually discourage her, as resists are both very cheap compared to AP as a stat, and If she starts RoA+GA, she is pretty powerful immediately.","replies":[{"poster":"Morello","date":"2014-09-06T02:04:52.927+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I agree on Blitz - my bad on that.

It's the fact that she's [giving up too much](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/PPBWg2ms-a-brief-list-of-issues-with-the-soraka-rework) for people's liking.\n\nI really wish you guys would just take the rework kit, put it on a new champ, and then try to fix Soraka again at a later date.  It's just too radical a change for it to be considered the same champ.\n\nI think if this kit were put on a new champ, no one would be complaining like they are now and everyone wins.  Morello gets his infuse healer, soraka players don't see this abomination go live, and people who want a new champ get one with a fresh slate.  \n\nRiotScruffy, let me put it to you like this.  Think of your main champ and all time favorite.  Now imagine that champ being broken mechanically and thematically in a way that's out of left field and has few correlations to your current champ.  You can't build that champ like you did before, you can't play that champ like you did before, it might now  even have a totally new lane or role in the game.  Now even though you might not hate this new kit, you are probably more than a little peeved that it is being slapped on  your favorite champ.\n\nThat's how some of us feel.  Look at my link, the old Soraka is an extremely dense champ in terms of what she brought into the game.  While some people liked her for her heal, she was more than a heal bot.  It is extremely frustrating to be trying to convey that and having you all sweep all of our thoughts and feelings under the rug like they never existed.  And then you (riot) want us to be happy about all this.\n\nTake the Cass changes.  People are mad about those because you completely changed her concept around, she's not a poison champ anymore; she's a champ with 2 skills to mark the other guy for her E.  That's just wrong.  \n\nI've been looking at some of the reworks and they aren't inspiring me.  A lot of them aren't hitting all the notes with the fans that they need to.  A lot of them feel like the red queen effect when you randomly choose not to run on them.  As a soraka player, this dework as I've been calling it is more in lines with running the wrong way.\n\nMost of them aren't helping the champs they need to help out.  A lot of them aren't keeping the fans of the champ happy.  Some of them need another rework because you didn't fix the problem (evelynn) or you created new problems (nidalee according to many) or people stopped playing the champ until you buffed them a little afterward (ahri).\n\nThis doesn't even touch on the constant nerfs to top champs and the fact that bruisers vs ADCs is always a pendulum of who's the favorite this parch with none of the other classes stepping up to offer a rock paper scissors balance scenario.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"eztarg3t","date":"2014-09-04T23:30:16.020+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won't hold that against you.

I agree with pretty much everything, what I don't agree with is the new kit for Soraka itself, I understand you're trying to look at the good instead of focusing on the bad but honestly I think she's gonna be dead weight once team fighting begins, even those who take the time to master her won't be of much use, she's one of the supports who can be overlooked if you happen to have grievous wound on your team, and we know how easy it is to get that... Soraka as she is on that kit happens to be just a heal bot, when you choose her you're literally playing against yourself (you hurt yourself for healing, and most of your targets are ally based)\n\nNow I've been tinkering with the idea that she's made this way because of a reason, and that reason is: having 2 heals on her kit is simply over the top; the way I see it, Riot had 2 choices with Soraka, make one of her heals either difficult or counterproductive, they chose the latter but... what if... they made her heal difficult to land instead? like, a skillshot or a cone as Karma used to have... or hell, why don't they just scrap Astral blessing and merge it with her new Q, when she lands that tiny little star she heals not only herself but the closest ally, perhaps even not a heal but an aura of increased health regen around herself, W then would need to be filled by something else like a shield or magic resist buff of sorts...\n\nI remember a time when Taric was the option against a heavy AD team and Soraka was the answer to a heavy Magic damage team, that identity went away a long time ago but I think this is an amazing oportunity to fill that niche, a skill in Soraka that passively makes her share her magic resist and reduce the enemy's, a starcall that affects only champions!\n\nI rather an interactive champ than a champ that works against itself anyday ._. and those are my 2 cents xD","replies":[{"poster":"eztarg3t","date":"2014-09-04T15:43:59.689+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"For the most part I can't argue whether or not this kit can work but I will point out about GW. It will be Soraka achilles heel. Luckily, Riot has stated they didn't like how GW currently works and are looking into weaning it out of the game or change it how it works. But as long as that ability is still in the game, it's gonna invalidate almost her entire kit. Then again, her healing is on a low CD so it might not be too bad of a thing.\nI'd hope a band-aid solution would just to have GW effect self-sustain only.

That way one would have to choose whether to focus on disabling their sustain or take down someone else first, while those playing as sustain-heavy champion would have to be more careful about getting focused.\n\nFor example: first spell/attack applies 20% reduction for a few seconds. Dealing damage with basic attacks and spells would then increase the value to up to 60%, with basic attacks, DoT and AoE spells increasing it by small amount and instant damage single target spells increasing the reduction value faster. If target is not attacked for a few seconds, Healing reduction first drops back to minimal value, and if not attacked for a moment after that, debuff wears off completely. Alternatively, value would increase over time as long as they have taken damage in last ~2 seconds.\n\nThis way you can slightly debuff several opponents, but to really disable someone's sustain, you'd have to focus on them, which wouldn't always be a good idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"eztarg3t","date":"2014-09-06T02:57:37.306+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Be mindful though, Morello, that GW still keeps champions like Warwick, Vlad, Mundo, and Swain from being overbearing.

This will be her 4th or 5th major gameplay change, and some of the previous iterations were 'discarded' (nerfed to the bottom and left there until a rework) almost as soon as they came out.
