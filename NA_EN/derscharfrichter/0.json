Normally I play on my desktop, but due to either a motherboard or hard drive issue, my desktop is currently out for the count. In the meantime, I've decided to start playing on my Macbook Pro and noticed that after a few minutes into a game, my mouse starts moving in opposite directions and spazing out across my screen. Most noticably, it happens when I move the mouse from from one side of the screen to the other, or when I move it about half-way across the screen.\r\n\r\nIs there a fix to this? Because its pretty annoying trying to aim skill shots and your mouse suddenly goes the opposite direction.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-21T00:21:34.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a really weird issue, and I'm wondering if maybe the cause may be with the mouse itself.

Does it only happen in-game?  Are you able to swap out another mouse to rule out that possibility?  Let me know.\n\nI tried using my old Razer Mamba mouse, while the problem didn't happen all game, I had trouble trying to click out of the victory/defeat screen. As soon as I went to hover over the button, my mouse would go the opposite direction.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is that despite lowering my mouse (Razer Mamba) sensitivity to 0 in game and on System Preferences, I noticed my mouse skyrocketing across my screen ha ha. \n\nIt may seem there's a problem between the Macbook System Preferences mouse sensitivity mixing with the in-game mouse sensitivity, which I didn't see a problem with the Logitech mouse. There might also be a problem between OS Sierra and mice that have dpi control settings that you can customize.\n\nI'm going to look to find my basic mouse that has nothing special to it, and also test this out. It could be that OS Sierra isn't compatible with custom dpi settings that are preloaded onto certain mice (shame that Smooth Mouse is discontinued and has no OS SIerra support, using Smooth Mouse whilst playing league back when I first got my Macbook seemed to solve most mouse smoothing and acceleration problems).","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-21T16:10:18.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the detailed info on this, it helps a lot!  I'm wondering if there might be an issue with your config that's contributing towards this.  Try [resetting your config settings](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761934-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Issues#mq2) and test it out in a custom game to prevent penalties.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Olliepop","date":"2017-06-24T19:26:06.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP, did this work for you?
