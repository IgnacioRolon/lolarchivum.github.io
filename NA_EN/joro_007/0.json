Even the casters noted that is just too much expectation from DL.\n\nI think DL really made himself think he was the best ADC so he willingly picked a match up that is hard expecting to go even or slightly behind.

It's just how TSM always plays internationally. They don't adapt to the other teams at all. They play late game comps in the hopes of making it to 40 minutes where they can teamfight which is what TSM is best at. Problem is that they just didn't respect their opponents being able to snowball the game with 3 winning lanes.

If you look at the obj and gold for each team for  every game, they were pretty spot on. It took both EDg and SKT a long time to actually end the game. I actually thought they played really good.\n\nAnd yes, C9 will fight WE. I hope C9 does win because it only cements that C9 is much more successful than any other team in NA","replies":[]}]}
