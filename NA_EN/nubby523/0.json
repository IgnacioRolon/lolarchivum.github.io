So having no other option I close the program and my duo partner tells me that the pick phase is still going. So I hurry and log in to try to get back to the lobby, however as I login I have no option to rejoin the lobby and I check my lp and promo series and surprise surprise I have one loss added to my promos I lost 3 lp and I got a 5 minute queue ban for something that happened to my client which its functionality is up to riot to maintain. All I want to know is riot working on a way to fix this. Maybe an error report system for instances like this or maybe a way to rejoin the lobby. I feel as if I have been very harshly penalized for something that is either A) riots fault or B) Windows fault.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-20T04:43:05.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client dropped its connection to the game platform service entirely, which caused the crash.
