Whichever team got the best few champions won 99% of the time. You know EXACTLY which few champions I&#039;m talking about: **_Jax, Syndra, Master Yi, Veigar, Katarina, Kassadin, Fizz, and Diana, to name a few._**\nIn original URF, we had bans, so you wouldn&#039;t have a perma-highlander Master Yi inserting his sword into your anus. Unfortunately for both us summoners and Rito, original URF was not healthy for the game. About a year ago, an AskRiot article examined the effects that releasing URF has on the game, and unfortunately, they aren&#039;t all good. You can read the article here -&gt; (https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/12/ask-riot-urf/) \nTL;DR- URF causes some people to stop playing League altogether, and according to Riot those players **dont come back** when Urf ends. According to the article, Riot isn&#039;t sure why, and for a company, that is scarier than facechecking baron at 35 minutes.\nRiot is a company, an organization that makes money. Fortunately, they care enough about us to give us things we want (sometimes), but at the end of the day if they aren&#039;t turning a profit, nobody wins.\n\nThe up-side of URF is that it brings in a massive influx of players, but perhaps the reason people quit thereafter is because they reached their wit&#039;s end, or rather their rageblade Master Yi who spends more untargettable than he does on the map. What I mean by this is that players get tired of games being so one-sided. I know I certainly do.\n\nARURF keeps players from getting those few strong URF champions, and is a step in the right direction towards making URF fun for both sides, but it isn&#039;t enough. The next step (IN MY OPINION) would be to institute bans, or something similar so that even though the champion assignment is random, players have some control over the whims of RN-Gesus, and can have a more fun experience.\n\nThe alternative option to &quot;balance&quot; (omegalul) URF would be to institute **direct** champion nerfs (and buffs for you Yasuo players!), but this would require waaaaaaaay too much time to figure out.\n\nLet me know what you think in the comments below! I&#039;d love to hear some _intelligent_ feedback!\n-GSO {{champion:69}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2019-01-31T00:42:02.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urf isn't meant to be fun anymore.
