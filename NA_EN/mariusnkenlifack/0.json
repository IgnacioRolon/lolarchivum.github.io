Everything in the game was fine until the 1:20 mark when all of a sudden my game was freaking out on itself. The only thing I could see were health bars. The rest I saw were lines going all over the place. Now, when I open my league client I see black dots all over my screen as if I was missing pixels. I've tried to repair my client 3 times now,  I have also uninstalled and redownloaded LoL and still no luck. If someone knows how I can fix this, that would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-05T20:49:32.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on the context here, it sounds like you might be having some serious video card failure.
