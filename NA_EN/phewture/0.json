I have never experienced bug splat on this computer before, as a result of getting this I was subjected to losing 3 LP and gaining a queue delay. I don't think it's fair that i should lose this LP putting into account that I'm 99 percent sure it isn't my side of the spectrum. Further more I feel that if other people experiencing this problem they should not be inclined to this punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Quantum Lotus","date":"2016-12-27T06:56:43.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get this problem as well sometimes.
