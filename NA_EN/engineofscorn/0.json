NO CONSEQUENCES WTF???","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WHY IS THERE NO SOLUTION?\n\nThis game used to be fun, and now I can only play a couple rounds a day because this game has become so toxic. I literally cannot even play bot games without having people on my own team try and troll people just to try to trigger them and then say they are the one&#039;s trolling. Going to just start taking screen shots and recording it because it&#039;s almost literally every single game.\n\nIt&#039;s funny because once again, the report system or this joke you guys call a tribunal does little to nothing about this, and never has, and when I attempt to research the issue I can see a lot of people agree with my stand point!\n\nSo what&#039;s the deal? Is this game really just LEAGUE OF TROLLIN? Cuz it definitely seems like it to me these days. God forbid I actually try to play a ranked, end up having to actually tell people how and what they are doing as they pretend to not know while they keep doing it.. just to get my account banned for it. \n\nYou guys just sit back and smile saying, rest assured.. we&#039;ll get em buddy. YOU JUST HIT THAT REPORT BUTTON AND WELL DO THE REST... AHAHA I WISH>> Meanwhile... after the lies have washed away we are here again at the same point same problem.. so what&#039;s my solution? Apparently just play a different game until you guys.. if ever.. seem to care enough to actually address the real toxic element of this game, not just the people who are at the receiving end of it. \n\nBut it really seems like this problem hasn&#039;t really been resolved since like 2014, right around the time this game really started going down hill in my opinion. Imagine that.\n\nAnyways, it would be pretty tight if the people at riot or someone figured this problem out as part of their 10th anniversary,\nOne could only hope.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-17T00:06:44.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like yourself?","replies":[{"poster":"EngineofScorn","date":"2016-09-17T14:43:20.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yea? how do you figure? \nIt's funny that you'd even reply using those words considering one of your most recent posts was..\n\"MagicFlyingLlama (NA) about 20 hours ago in > Fuck your system riot.\nUpvoted. I refuse to play ranked anymore until riot takes out the trash, it is just not fun.\"\n\nIf you are gonna respond with some mentally lazy drivel like that don't even bother replying.\n\nWhats the point?\n\nIF you honestly think, that coming to forums and bringing up a topic of discussion to which has been widely ignored with so solution is toxic then you only drive the point that the source of toxicity is the game itself, and people like you. Exactly the kind of people I'm talking about. Look at this guy people. He read the whole page and only responds with some little two word toxic jab smoke screen. Literally pulling the same kind of behavior I described in original post and that he is probably just one of the people whose learned to benefit from the M.O.\n(Reverse Trolling= Trolling someone and trying to make it look like it was them who was trolling)\n\nBut thank you for showing us all exactly what im talking about.\n\nits like somone stealing blue, or jumping into a turret and dying.. then you get mad that they did that, then they say something like \":) Stop being such a toxic player\" Case in point. They caused the disruption, yet its always the person who reacts to it. It's literally destroying the game guys. No matter how many new broken characters you make, or nerf or go back and rebuild. Haven't you figured that out yet?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-17T19:31:23.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ever heard the phrase \"dont feed the trolls\"?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Reikken","date":"2016-09-17T00:00:42.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First you were talking about people being passive aggressive, which is legit, but then you start talking about having to tell what they are doing (and in a rude manner, from the sound of it).

You know what's not legit either? Only being able to \"ignore\" them while having to continue the game with them, only to be able to \"report them\".. to no avail. So thank you. Once again you bring me back to the same point that started the topic, and once again without even trying to come up with a solution. Yea, because league of legends isn't lets all sit here and attempt to teach each other how to play while the person who are trying to correct is obviously trolling. Then you only address part of what I was talking about, only to imply that because you think I'm saying something in a context you could construe as rude it detracts from my point. Have you read the forums? Have you played this game at all? This is about as nice as it gets without over the top trollery.\n\nWhat's not clicking here guys? \n\nThank you for taking your time with this, you are truly an outstanding example of humanity. *rolls eyes*","replies":[{"poster":"Reikken","date":"2016-09-17T15:39:16.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to clarify, I meant a legit concern.\npeople being passive aggressive and trying to elicit responses out of others is a legit concern. (but one that I personally deal with quite easily. responding with one or two word answers like \"absolutely\" or \"for sure\" usually shuts them up)\n\nbut you have no business being rude to people regardless, so you shouldn't have even mentioned that part. If someone is playing poorly, it's absolutely fine to make suggestions in a tactful manner, but being rude is never appropriate.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BIackfox","date":"2016-09-17T00:40:34.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how the fuck do people get toxic in bot games?  you cannot lose","replies":[{"poster":"EngineofScorn","date":"2016-09-17T14:39:43.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GO ahead and play some and you'll see, its not about whether you win or lose its about if you can practice your champ effectively, which.. SPOILER ALERT... it actually does if you practice team comp.\n\nHere's an example: Last night was playing with jungle khazix, he jumped into the fight, went for the kill and would have died. i ulted him as kayle, he runs out of the fight until the ult wears off and runs away and then i ask him why he wasted the ult, and he says its not his fault im a bad kayle. (as Im like 15-0-10+)\n\nThis type of stuff never used to happen, and now its all common play. \nI have played since season 1, and I consider myself a normal gamer from those times. Times of trash talk is ok. In my opinion I don't think that's near as toxic as knowingly wrongful plays. It's a topic up for discussion but yes as of the new rules I have gotten banned for stuff I've always said as a product of the auto-ban busters, and it actually might mean something if it made a difference, but in my opinion its taken the original problem and made it much much worse.\n\nMaybe this issue is the game doesn't know what's good for itself, IE toxic unaddressed elements within the game itself. Back in season 1 season 2. I could actually get people into this game. I've never been terrific, but decent. I've brought people into this game who've gone on to outdo me on every level so many times I've lost count.\n\nThese days its like pulling teeth to try to get someone to try league of legends.. and a lot of the old school people i used to play with (some of them went pretty far up in ranked too..), don't even play this game anymore. They say it's just not fun, and I'll agree. I play this game for the memories I used to have from it than the sad state it's in now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EngineofScorn","date":"2016-09-17T15:17:23.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"A solution of my own: \n\n-GAME OPTIONS>REPORT PLAYER (IN GAME)\nCreates a live feed between tribunal and reported player so they can observe and see what's going on and decide what course of action to take from there.\n\n-Design a better honor system, that has negative categories of how bad a person can do, and every time they get reported they get a point in one of those categories. \n\n-When a person gets reported, they get a notification telling them they were reported and what they were reported for.\n\n\nAnyone else?
