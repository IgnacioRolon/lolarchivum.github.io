There are a few reasons as to why the store won't let you gift chromas, and I'm happy to go over 'em with you if you want! \n\nOverall though if you want to gift him that chroma, you'll need to just gift him the RP itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Gloomkeeper","date":"2017-10-20T01:46:32.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"hey whats up? why u dont refund me my second purchase that was accidently made during the whole proccess of the subject above? wtf is that logic? i pressed everythign what was told to gift rp to a friend and the rp went on my acc and after doing it fro the second time succesfully u refuse to refund the previous action?wtf are u that cheap? i mean if so need the changes to survive i dont mind givingu 2,5euro like i would give to a homeless but get real for a second","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-20T02:08:05.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't directly issue refunds from here on the boards.

Looks like those agents *did* actually did a one-time exception refund one of those RP purchases for you the first time you wrote in. After that, you requested another refund for having made the exact same mistake. \n\nAbove in my first reply you'll see that I tried to let you know that you *cannot gift chromas*. The only way to 'gift' a chroma to someone is to gift them the RP. Slow down a bit when you're making those purchases and make sure you read what's about to be bought.","replies":[{"poster":"Gloomkeeper","date":"2017-10-20T03:11:38.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ye i tried to gift someone rpas we said and it again popped my rp in my account. Prob fked up something in the process but it wasn't in my intent obviously, i didnt bought the rp to gift chroma since we already figure that out as you say too ,but i tried to bought in order to gift. What you do now is like someone going in a store forgeting his wallet in ur cashier and then forbid him to take his wallet back claiming their money are now theirs. im pretty sure the guy forgetting the wallet didnt intent to forget  it and im pretty sure the cashier wouldn't tell him to slow down next time he is on his store.\n\nBtw it's becoming fking tiring, why not make things right and get over it, it's not that hard since you can see what happened too, it's not like bought rp and then thinking \"hmmm better buy beers refund me now situation.\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gloomkeeper","date":"2017-10-17T00:38:34.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i bought it yesterday, of course i aint used it, so ye if it is possible i need to refund it so i can give it as gift since there is no other way.none likes sending a half gift..","replies":[]}]}]}
