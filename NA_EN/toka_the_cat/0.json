Do you get any error messages on the legacy client?\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nIf you do receive any errors there let me know as it might provide some more specifics on what's going on, if a reinstall didn't fix this.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Toka the cat","date":"2017-02-12T12:51:33.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i only get an error message when i try and launch it and it try's updating, but idk yet i havent tried what u told me to do","replies":[{"poster":"Toka the cat","date":"2017-02-12T12:55:54.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not even letting me get that far with it","replies":[{"poster":"Toka the cat","date":"2017-02-12T13:40:10.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think i told u the wrong lancher xD, i ment the newer one","replies":[{"poster":"Toka the cat","date":"2017-02-12T15:48:11.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"terribly sorry for the confusion","replies":[{"poster":"Toka the cat","date":"2017-02-13T21:48:41.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok i promise im not trolling you, what happens is when i hit upgrade now i hit the launch button it comes up with that error, i have had an error at the store but it was easily fixed when i reloaded the store","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
