I have created a new profile for my PC and ran League there, it went well at first then it started to screw up, I tried opening by Administrator doesn't work, I deleted all these files, ONLY SOMETIMES these work and I'm so frustrated about this whole topic and I don't want to do a full memory wipe to my PC, I JUST got it last month and I don't want to ruin it. I uninstalled and reinstalled probably 3 times now with both profiles, repaired at least 3 times with both profiles also, please help, I just want to play League of Legends and I can't focus with this issue always in my mind knowing that when I exit out of League I have to keep reinstalling these files, waiting hours and hours to repair my Launcher, I press the play button, I see the blue loading circle around my cursor, hoping that it wouldn't go away but it does after 10 seconds and I'm losing hope for this game, please if there's any way to fix this, I NEED HELP!!","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-30T10:00:15.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you receiving any error messages?","replies":[{"poster":"Aerilous","date":"2016-07-30T19:14:24.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the time, no, when it does, it just says it stops working, I'm tired of this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-30T20:30:56.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to help you and get this fixed up!  As a first rule of thumb, deleting files and folders can actually end up causing you more issues than solving so we have to put that on hold.  This issue might be a setting with your OS that's not allowing the patcher access to launch.  It's not likely due to your game files, so reinstalling isn't necessarily going to fix this.  As a first step, please go over our [Permissions ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)guide which will provide a series of instructions to resolve this.  Once finished, please let me know your results or if the issue persists.
