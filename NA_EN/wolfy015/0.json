I'm pretty sure most people have forgotten about the movie, because it was pretty awful. We don't need another terrible video game movie.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfy015","date":"2019-01-12T16:01:47.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

Numbers spike up when an expansion hits, then drift downward until the next one. Basically the only people who watched the movie were WoW fans, and it was still mediocre. LoL's lore is basically a pile of retcon fanfics with more holes than Swiss cheese at this point, while WoW's lore is actually Warcraft's lore, which has been accumulating since the mid 90s. There's no need to make \"LoL: We Have A Movie Now\" just to check that ☑ box.","replies":[]}]}
