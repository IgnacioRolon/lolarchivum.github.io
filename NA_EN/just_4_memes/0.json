Tanks at this point can't really tank, but instead deal a lot of damage, which basically just turns them into fighters with more CC. Meanwhile, fighters similarly aren't particularly tanky, but stay competitive alongside tanks simply because the damage they themselves deal is even higher. This is one of the reasons why we likely need reductions to damage across the board, since the reason why X class deals too much damage right now, whether it be assassins or tanks, is because everyone is killing everyone else too quickly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BALDG1VEN BOOMER","date":"2018-08-12T14:04:19.126+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"In what world is a tank killing you as fast as an assassin?","replies":[{"poster":"concert clown","date":"2018-08-12T19:24:03.053+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:54}} {{item:3089}} \n\"Rock Solid.\"\n\n/s","replies":[]},{"poster":"meowwow7","date":"2018-08-12T15:28:44.012+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"in a world where you have to build some defense to be able to tell the difference","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kirov","date":"2018-08-13T02:07:29.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=205181825,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZdPUkl3F,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-08-12T14:04:19.126+0000)\n>\n> In what world is a tank killing you as fast as an assassin?\n\nIn a world where poppy exists.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anin777","date":"2018-08-12T19:16:01.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=205181825,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZdPUkl3F,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-08-12T14:04:19.126+0000)\n>\n> In what world is a tank killing you as fast as an assassin?\n\nYou obviously haven't seen malphite late game.
