A god at shredding people down, taking towers/objectives, etc. He went from being a late game champ to devouring people through the entirety of the game. He is literally a one man army. He can be CC&#039;d but in solo Q people tend to play squishy and I have little control over what they choose to play, so he melts them, and also has alpha strike always up to avoid damage/cc. He isn&#039;t broken, just seems particularly scary to go against.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-07-06T14:13:05.523+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi is always in a bad spot balance wise. He's either left severely unpowered, or he gets that one buff and he's suddenly Michael Meyers stabbing everyone from out of the blue. He NEEDS a new kit. There is no other way around it. When someone's nickname is \"Baby's First Pentakill\" or \"Press Q to Penta,\" he's a massive issue.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-07-06T16:51:42.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is because of his Q and True damage.
