I've been at it all day trying to fix it:\r\n\r\n- I went to my Internet Protocol 4 and tried DNS settings on both \"obtain DNS server address automatically\" and changing both values to \" 8.8.8.8\" and \"8.8.4.4.\" and vice versa.\r\n\r\n- I tried running League as admin\r\n\r\n- I tried adding the league client to my windows firewall exceptions\r\n\r\n- I uninstalled AVG Anti Virus ( I don't actually use it anymore)\r\n\r\n- I tried do ipconfig /dnsflush in my cmd prompt as admin\r\n\r\n- I uninstalled with CCleaner, deleted the folder, and tried to reinstall...\r\n\r\nand NOW that I have uninstalled, the new league installer just gets stuck at 0 MBs 0.00 and never moves. I have an older version of the installer as well, so I tried reinstalling with that one and the RADS error just pops up again.\r\n\r\nI downloaded the hextech repair tool and have it currently set to \"Force Repatch\", \"Reinstall\", and \"Clean Uninstall\". It's been stuck on \"Reinstalling...\" for 30 minutes and I have no idea if that means its  still going or if its stuck but at this point I have doubts that it will work.\r\n\r\nI have one system restore point available to me, I ran it but was unable to complete successfully. At this point I don't know what else I can do to get league working.\r\n\r\nNeed help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-11T17:14:39.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This error is usually caused by security  settings blocking game files, so steps like exceptions and running as admin are good.  Make sure to go over each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide as well to rule out all possibilities.  I don't recommend manually deleting files, though, as that can cause more issues.  Let me know if those steps helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Contracept","date":"2017-10-11T17:17:28.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have been through these!\n\n- UAC is currently disabled, no driver errors found, windows up to date, games is running as admin, and I tried to reinstall as admin as well.

System restore fixed it, I had one single other point I could restore to, had to do a safe start of my computer to get it to restore successfully however.I think the League update coincided with some system update, and the system update broke the game for me. Not sure if it'll update automatically and come back to this point though.","replies":[{"poster":"Contracept","date":"2017-10-11T17:58:55.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Angorism,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=oFIHB0xa,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2017-10-11T17:34:05.604+0000)\n>\n> I got lucky!
