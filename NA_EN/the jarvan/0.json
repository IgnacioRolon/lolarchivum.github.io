I submitted a ticket and entered the info needed. I then got a reply that requested more info, I gave that info and then was denied back my account saying the info I entered was incorrect. I know the info I entered was correct and the old Email that I created the account with no longer exist. I even submitted my IP so you can trace back and compare that they are the same IP. I have had this account since 2010 and would be very upset to lose it after getting hacked once.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-21T18:56:34.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our account team takes great measure to make sure an account is returned to the owner, without a shadow of a doubt.
