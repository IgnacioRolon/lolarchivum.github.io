You get a new job, you probably tell your friends because they are invested in your life and thus find joy when you do.

I doubt his mom would appreciate his accomplishment as much as the random people on these boards since these people can fully comprehend the difficulties of League's ranked system. Is it so wrong to let random people know about your accomplishments?\n\n> Never said he did. You don't have to put yourself above the others to brag about something.\n\nTrue. I guess when I think of brag I usually think of something like \"I did/have something that you don't.\" However, if he is acknowledging himself at no one else's expense, what is the problem?\n\n> When millions of people got a new job maybe even better or despite many obstacles they don't create a new topic. Because it's not something to have to tell other unknown people.\n\nSo are you saying that people should not seek recognition from anyone but those they know personally? If you won a lot of money, would you not proclaim your excitement to those around you? Should the sports teams not televise awards ceremonies because no one knows them? I don't think you need to know people personally to share your success with them.\n\n> No one is forced to upvote, great argument. No one is forced to read my comments, reply to them. No one is forced to create this topic and brag about reaching gold V to unknown people.\n\nSo we are in agreement then?

Or are you likening your comments to this topic which you mentioned is stupid, and thus my discussion with you is pointless?","replies":[{"poster":"Volphi","date":"2017-05-26T08:52:42.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Raven Redeemed","date":"2017-05-26T21:30:11.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We may just have differing opinions then. Personally, I think humans are a pretty social people and thus they can talk with other unknown people about almost anything (maybe not so much thing of a personal matter). Even though they do not know each other, strangers can also sympathize with another's emotions. We can feel sad for the victims of a crime or happy for the guy who beat cancer even though we have never met them before.\n\nI think the purpose of the League boards was to allow people who play League to communicate with unknown people who also play league. I certainly can see why you could see this post as cluttering the boards. I don't personally see it that way because I am happy that he is happy, and I imagine  the same to be true vice versa. Emotional health is important even in professional environments.\n\nYou might think of it as boasting, but considering that fact that it was at no one else's expense I see it has sharing his feeling of happiness. He is certainly not a special snowflake in this regard. True not a whole lot of people post of their success and I believe that is because A. there are not that many people on the boards compared to the actual game and B. (as you mentioned) the people of the boards usually upvote things of more gameplay related value. But there are literally hundreds of popular snowflakes on YouTube who boast of their success in the game, and thousands more who do it for no other reason than to share their moments with total strangers.\n\nI'll end by saying that I think he was justified in posting on the Gameplay board. It encompasses almost all of the actions and constructs in the game League of Legends, including reaching Gold V. No value or issue necessary.

Did that have value? No. Was it and issue? No. Was it informative? Yes, I did not know he was gold V until he told me. Similarly people will post complaints with out issue or value such as \"Yasuo is dumb.\" Currently this is acceptable in the gameplay board. Perhaps posts should require some value. I would be ok with that. However, I don't think there need to be issues. For example, a post discussing why Kindred's new kit is a heathy change for the game presents no issue but could still be of value to people when they consider game balance.\n\n> This is not an excuse. Mods may not take a proper care about this issue.\n\nSo why did you bring it up if not to make an excuse to not submit a report? Was it to imply that the mods may not take action on your report and thus I might look down on you if they didn't. Like I said, I could care less if they do or don't.
