Now there are still times when I get people trolling in games because they are upset or cursing at everyone in more than just a couple of games in a row, in such situations i find it best to just give myself a break and stray away from the game for a while. It's no secret to anyone that regardless of the various punishments the community is still far from great and that's to be expected given the amount of players.\n\nTherefore I propose some sort of a reform program or test that could give you an option to recover your account if you pass. Now i don't see myself as a person fit to judge under what circumstances you'd be eligible to regain access to your account so i don't have a balanced system in mind for this but Im sure one could be constructed. Whether you regain access to your account with a very strict behavior monitoring or you're only eligible to apply for the program after a good year or two have passed to even have a chance to prove yourself worthy.\n\nIf there is anyone else who agrees with the idea and has any suggestions about my proposal feel free to share them here.\n\nBest regards,","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-07-24T20:03:58.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Therefore I propose some sort of a reform program or test that could give you an option to recover your account if you pass.\n\nYou had chances to reform.

The goal of the 2 week ban is as the final “sticker shock” that Riot is serious about punishing players up to and including a permanent suspension. If players didn’t take the risk of a permanent ban seriously until the 2 week ban, and thus they have not been working on their behavior, that is their problem.\n\nRiot had more punishment tiers before - but the reform rate goes down greatly the higher the tier of punishment. As one example, according to a now inaccessible post by Riot Tantram, a little less than 20% of players get a chat restriction at *some* time during their League career. Only 0.006% of players get a permanent ban. The goal of the punishment system *prior to a permanent ban* is to get a player to reform. The goal of the permanent ban is to remove the player from the game. Another experiment Riot has done now twice on the NA server unbanning permanently banned accounts (or having the “level 20 challenge” from waaaaaaay back) did not display the idea that you are suggesting that players would have reformed in significant amounts.\n\nWhile I am happy that you no longer have the attitude/mindset that is toxic to those around you, the unfortunate fact is that if you were not permanently banned, it is very close to certain that you would not have actually continued to try to reform. Furthermore, if there were some sort of “reform” program to get your old account back, there would be no weight to a permanent ban - even less weight than the 2 week ban - as you would *have* to make a new account which you could instantly play on until you earned your old account back, then resume where you left off as if nothing happened. Such a program doesn’t meet the goal of removing toxic players who refuse to reform from the game.","replies":[{"poster":"High Af Koko","date":"2019-07-24T20:04:47.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is why i implied that ballancing such a program is not a simple task.

We know that once it proved to be a massive failure with a very low success rate, and the second time we have not heard anything about a decision to change the policy or reinstitute such an approach, which leads me to believe that the success rate there was equally small.\n\nWhen you have something that requires a lot of manual effort and encourages banned players to keep playing the game, it is not worth implementing unless it is successful in a majority of cases.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-24T20:23:16.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot tried, multiple times.
