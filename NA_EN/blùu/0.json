After about 15 minutes my FPS drops from 120fps to 55, and then progressively gets worst the longer the game lasts. My FPS was down to 35 by the 38 minute mark. I've updated my graphics card driver and ran the repair tool, both don't seem to work. I have a 1070 so i'm like pretty sure it's not my computer. Also, this happens to everyone in the game. I ask multiple times every game and everyone says they're experiencing the same problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-20T22:41:23.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Without system specs, drivers, ect, nobody will be able to help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dawston02","date":"2017-01-20T21:50:42.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no","replies":[]}]}
