This does nothing to buff her early game, which is now intentionally abysmal. It simply gives her more options.

But personally I think the problem is that she has no way to get to her targets, and while a decreased range of her passive would be nice, I think she really needs some sort of gapcloser in order to execute her kit. You have no move speed buff like old Eve unless you use E on a target. If you do that on a minion to get to the target you're pretty much gimping your ability to hit them, Your Q in a minion wave is ridiculously impossible. It feels good if you can land it between minions but the fact is it's not going to happen very often and the hate spikes afterward don't have as much range and are not really reliable. It seems like Riot wants Evelynn to W>E>Q but the problem is you're basically walking right up in their face to do that and you're gonna be dead before you can pull it off on most occasions. Her E range needs to be increased. Her tendrils are a lot longer than her arms anyways so it doesn't make sense.","replies":[{"poster":"abbbez","date":"2017-10-15T09:42:53.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree on most of what you said, it's just that increasing her e so that she has a gap closer might be a bit too much.

I wouldn&#x27;t really do much with balance changing before runes go live though.\n\nThe runes don't really change much to her playability tbh. I've done some thinking and her E while a problem isn't her main problem. You have to wait before you can even do damage for 2.5 seconds. You can't use ANY of your kit before then unless you just want to die. The problem with this is EVERYONE ELSE has initiations that take far less time, and deal damage as well. W either needs way less prep time(any ADC can gun you down before you even have a chance to fight them back if they see you at all, and if they don't then they're running from you and can usually get away because you have no gap closer). It's difficult to even pull off successful ganks after her very short window of power is up, and late game everyone runs from you before you get a chance to proc your W, or hunts you down because you die in 2.5 seconds(literally, because it takes that long for you to fight back and you're dead by then). You also can't fight anyone without your W, which leaves you vulnerable for an entire out of stealth fight. I can't think of any assassin that actually has to wait to use their full combo for 2.5 seconds. Talon just hops into a fight, Zed becomes untargetable before his damage, or just uses his without any prep time really, except for of his own choosing, Akali just hops right on your ass and makes it unable to get away from her without help, Katarina has multiple ways to engage and disengage with little to no prep time. See the trend? Evelynn's kit is in need of some drastic change if she's to be an assassin.\n\nThere are two directions you could go with this. Reduced W prep time overall, and then reduced prep time more per rank(2 seconds at rank 1, 1.75 rank 2, 1.5 rank 3, 1.25 rank 4, and 1 rank 5. If this still makes her too bad, it could be 2>1.5>1.25>1>0.5). Or make the charm go off either way, and make it deal bonus damage if the heart is full. This would solve the problem of her being unable to fight anyone if they're actually unloading on you, and also give you a better chance late game to actually use your W and succeed with it. It might look weird if the heart isn't full and you charm someone though. I suppose it could be explained as Evelynn didn't get them happy enough to make them suffer enough for her tastes, reducing the pain she inflicted.\n\nThe second issue of proccing it could be remedied with increased E range. It's currently less than Aatrox's attack range when he ults. I think at the very least it should be as far as that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mcsquzzy","date":"2017-10-15T16:08:50.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if her ult stealthed her on kills only i would find it acceptable","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karn Bishop","date":"2017-10-15T01:59:31.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes but if it did this how would ADC's earn penta's without being able to sodomize a defenseless champion for big lcs plays?
