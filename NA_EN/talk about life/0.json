Right now I am facing a great question about E-sports and religion. My high school is a Non-denominational school. I was suggesting if there is any chance to make a E-sport team happen in fall. But the CEO told me that many games right now are shooting people and \"killing\"(basically), and that's showing unsafe meaning(like shooting people)to parents or other sponsors, that's the reason has been stopping this amazing event to happen. The influences of video game to my school is a really important thing. Right here I am asking for helps to change this situation or any suggestions on help me how to convince the school that League of legends is \"OK\" for school to view it as a sport. Thank you all your helps! Have a good day!{{sticker:sg-soraka}} ","replies":[]}
