The paragraphs are halved and that free space does nothing. The only thing I can come up with is that it could be a signature place, but having it on the right might be extremely awkward. Two questions arise in the case of this thing.\n1) Why not just extend the letters so they go across the whole thread? In the preview they do. Why is this not the case for when it is actually posted?;\n2) Why not just remove that half if it serves no purpose? Surely you don't need it for anything.. do you?\n\nI know that this is extremely unnecessary and weird to talk about, but I'm just curious what it's for.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2014-11-10T15:18:59.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two reasons:\n\n* It's apparently the optimal horizontal distance for reading\n* The empty space eventually gets used by the UI for nesting\n\nI agree with you, it looks really strange how the text stops halfway across the screen and the UI keeps going.  This has been brought up before, and I think the general consensus from Riot was \"meh\" or something along those lines.","replies":[{"poster":"Montag","date":"2014-11-11T15:53:44.260+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't part of those discussions, but I moonlight as a typography nerd, so let me elaborate on the likely origin of \"optimal horizontal distance.\"\n\nThere's an idea in typography that an [optimal line-length](http://practicaltypography.com/line-length.html) exists. As line-length increases, your eye has to travel farther to complete a line, which is generally tiring on the eyes and makes it harder  to track your progress vertically.\n\nWhat's a \"good\" line-length? Turns out it's about 2-3 alphabets-worth of characters, give or take depending on the use case. There are a couple reasons for this:\n\n- Research shows that your [mind is energized](http://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability) when skipping to a new line. (\"[Typographie](http://www.designers-books.com/typography-emil-ruder-1967/),\" E. Rudder)\n- Usability research going back to the 1930s shows that some readers may read faster with longer line-lengths, but [readers generally preferred medium-sized line lengths](http://www.humanfactors.com/newsletters/optimal_line_length.asp) -- three to four inch lengths at 10-point font or about 2-3 alphabets -- and lost their place less often\n\nBoards is right in that area:\n\n(1)abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz(2)abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz(3)abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz(4)abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n\nNot everyone will agree, and there are lots of people who honestly read faster and just as effectively with longer line-lengths. But for most people, they're more comfortable and less prone to errors when the line-length stays in that golden range of 2-3 alphabets. I'm sure there are many, many reasons for the particular line-length  Boards has -- the team naturally obsesses over those kinds of details, I'm sure -- but I'd bet the 2-3 alphabets rule is likely one of them.","replies":[{"poster":"kayakninja","date":"2014-11-11T18:21:46.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That comment looked really strange on the Red Tracker.

It looks extraordinarily wasteful, even if it has a purpose.  This isn't to say I have any idea of what would \"fix\" it, so to speak, but I think that the aesthetic is the main question here.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"yellowbricks","date":"2014-11-11T18:18:32.672+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could\nfly a\njetplane\nin between\nall this\nwasted\nspace.","replies":[]}]}
