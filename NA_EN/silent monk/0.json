After this happened a couple of times the last games I tried to play it forced me to dodge twice not allowing me to lock in my selected champ to ban. I read all around about solutions, and came across hextech repair tool, try to download several times it always starts (about 1 min left usually, I have 100mbps download this should be quick but have left it on for hours with no success) and then it stops and the time remaining goes away but it isn't and won't finish. So I give up all hope and try repeatedly to submit a ticket to support typing out many times my problems only to have the loading circle forever whirling on the submit button, I called my isp and everything is fine on my end. \n\nEdit:league client updates to random percentages before starting over at 0% on login page.\nPlease put me out of my misery, open mid.\nSilent Monk","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-07T21:17:11.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds almost like there's a wall that's just blocking you off from reaching any of our services.
