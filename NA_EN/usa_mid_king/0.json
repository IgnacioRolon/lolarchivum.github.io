PLEASE HELP ME!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi. I was watching my replays from today and making highlights just like any normal day. I got done making highlights and wanted to play some more so I attempted to start a normal draft game when I first got a message saying that there was an error trying to create my lobby, then i got a different message saying I didn't meet the requirements for said game mode (which is 100% false). I figured I should just log out and log back in, so I did. Now I am faced with the screen that shows the \"Reconnect\" button, and when I press it I am faced with a black screen and the \"Failed to connect to server\" error. I have already tried restarting internet and running a full repair. PLEASE HELP!!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-21T04:20:36.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you're getting hit with this ghost game issue as well. This happens when the game doesn't correctly tell your client that the match is over, but we've got some guys working to try to smooth this out if possible. The most likely fix is going to be simply giving it more time though.","replies":[{"poster":"Crush721","date":"2017-09-21T18:54:41.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thanks for the answer! Perhaps you could give us a rough estimate of the amount of time we should be waiting before proceeding to take further measures?","replies":[]}]}]}
