I waited for around 5mins if it would resolve itself but it didn't, so i relogged and checked Hextech Crafting tab again, and i saw that i got an Gemstone and a Champion shard.\r\nBut here's the problem i get the Icon in the \"Champions\" area but there's nothing inside, just the actual Border that basically shows \"Here's a champion\" but there is no actual Champion art in it, and when i placed my cursor on top of it, the Info pop-up window shows but still not a single info about what that Champion is.\r\n\r\nI tried to create the champion but the \"upgrade\" option is greyd out complely, and only options are \"Re-Roll\" or \"Disenchant\" i ended up Disenchanting it in the hopes it wouldn't actually happen again/i already had that champion and it was just an bug.\r\n\r\nI'm still new to this all Hextech crafting and found out that i could make an Chest and Key with an Gemstone so i tried that, and all of the animations for that actually showed properly, and i got the loots animations working properly. But when i actually opened again this chest i got from the Gemstone, it showed the animations properly however this time i got loot, which were empty border'd Skin (And again i got an empty bordered spot in the Skins sections this time, and this time it has an \"Legacy\" icon on the bottom left of the Skin) and again not a single information about what skins, for what champion...and it has the options for \"Renting\" and \"Upgrade\" greyed out again, but i do have enough Orange essence to unlock it, but it just won't allow it and i don't know what that skin even is :(\r\n\r\nPlease help :(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-03T22:54:33.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and pulled up your account, and it looks like the skin shard was Nutcracko Shaco. I'm not 100% sure why it wouldn't let you activate it if you own the champion and have enough essence. \n\nSome of the game files associated with hextech crafting might have had some sort of hiccup, so let's try using our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) to repair that. Run that tool with the force repatch option selected, and let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"PandeeBum","date":"2017-04-04T15:36:15.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried the Hextech repair tool and it fixed the problem!
