I've forwarded this to interested parties to look into, but yeah this is not legit.  That sale is suggesting skin that is [limited](https://www.google.com/search?q=Limited+skins&rlz=1C1NHXL_enUS727US727&oq=Limited+skins&aqs=chrome..69i57.3012j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), and no longer available.  Meaning, they do not make a return during any special event or store.  \n\nFurther, old codes also expired back in April 2014 and were no longer unlockable per our [code cards FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202801810-Code-Cards-FAQ).  \n\n> \n> Note: While some websites or individuals sell Riot code cards on the Internet, they are almost always doing so with fraudulent intent (i.e. those codes are usually redeemed, expired or stolen). As we do not support 3rd party re-sellers, please avoid buying stuff from Internet Strangers! We will not be able to help you if your 3rd party code does not work for any reason.\n\n\nLet me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2017-03-15T09:58:48.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At one point they deactivatet all the old Codes to prevent skinshops from 3rd Partys if I remember correctly.
