Now it shit the bed today. Other DirectX games have no problems launching, so there must be some spaghetti that's under-cooked. Going to try reinstalling the game and my GPU drivers.

However, the website showed a new optional driver that I upgraded to. Did a clean install of the driver and the game launches again. \n\nThis has been twice now that LoL refuses to launch after a new driver is released and I haven't upgraded immediately... Not sure if coincidence or something with AMD drivers or the LoL game failing randomly. I'm going to start launching a quick practice game every day now to make sure the fame works before queuing for something...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-06T22:14:37.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The error resulting from the fullscreen issue should be resolved.

I was gonna say \"not to slander or anything, but...\" but it's impossible not to, this is pathetic Riot. You're letting X number of people lose LP and wait 20-30 minutes to queue up, and not even doing so much as acknowledge it but in addition try to sweep it under the rug. Not a single mention of it on the server status page like it was before.
