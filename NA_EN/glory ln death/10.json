You have to predict where a fight will go to get the &quot;best&quot; use out of it, since the root duration scales with distance traveled. A lot of times, it seems easiest and most reliable to use it point blank, even though it only gives a 0.6 second root, as opposed to the full 2.4 second root after it travels. However, there is a very interesting facet to Maokai&#039;s ult that makes those point blank roots more satisfying and useful!\r\n\r\n**Maokai&#039;s ult can root champions more than once.**\r\nhttps://i.imgflip.com/1oiso0.gif\r\n\r\nThe gif might be a little small, but, you can see Vlad get rooted point blank for a short time. Then, as he is chasing down Janna, Maokai pushes him into another root, where he is rooted again!\r\n\r\nConsidering the short duration of point blank ults, this is extremely useful for Maokai, especially given the bent formation of the roots! If you angle the ult correctly, you can either trick the enemy into running into the ult again (most players are used to CC abilities only being able to affect them one time, or having a cooldown on being able to be hit again) or knock them into another root yourself (or have a teammate do it!). \r\n\r\nAnyways, just a cool trick I found out by accident while playing Maokai! Hopefully people can make good use of it!","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-05-06T03:59:45.066+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I told you the secret was gonna be to point blank it.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-05-06T04:10:58.347+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, there's a bit more to it, but, yeah. Point-blanking it can be more effective than it seems on paper. As long as you get a second root in, because, holy cow, 0.6 seconds is short. You almost can't tell he gets rooted the first time in the gif.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-05-06T04:23:06.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when combo'd with the dash it still is essentiall a 2 second snare, 1.4 with .6, with another snare on the same target you get what amounts to about a 2.6-ish snare on one target.\n\nOf course its still conjecture at this point, but what if you w, r at an angle away from target, but close enough to hit them with first root, into a q into a second root? because if that works then you get to use what amounts to an undodgeable and very long cc.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-05-06T05:05:25.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That could definitely work, and is close to what happened in my game. It would definitely be longer than 2.6 seconds, too, since the ult only needs 1000 units to reach the max 2.4 second root. In the gif of my game, you can see that Vlad's second root was actually pretty long. It does require the enemy to move in the same direction as the ult, though.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-05-06T04:02:33.499+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"in my opinion you kinda have to change the way you play and think of maokai and his kit... he is a defensive tank... he is best now designed to be counter engage , wait for a team to commit then ult , W or whatever to lock them into place to peel and trap for your carries. using the ult offensively is now subpar compared to his old ult for fights/trades.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ben Sharpio","date":"2017-05-06T04:23:24.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"youre a genius. nice post","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-05-06T05:01:53.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
