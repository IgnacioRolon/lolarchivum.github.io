Is this intentional? It made it really hard to team fight tbh that whole game and ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Xenogenic","date":"2018-09-02T02:21:41.148+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The former sounds like a rule we'll discuss fixing, and the second one sounds like a straight-up bug.  I will take a look at it.  Thanks for bringing it to our attention. :)","replies":[]}]}
