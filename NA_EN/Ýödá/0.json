My in-game settings are not saving, for example if I make it so that I can see the mana costs of abilities, the next game it won't be like that. Or if I want to turn \"team frames on left\" off, it only stays for the game that I do it in. It's becoming very frustrating. Anyone know why this is happening? Thanks :D","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-30T23:34:11.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there is a corruption or sync issue with your config, so it's not able to properly save to our servers.  Resetting your config should fix this up, but keep in mind you'll need to redo bindings:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nThat should help get your options saved!","replies":[{"poster":"Ýödá","date":"2016-12-30T23:56:47.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, so much!
