Lose your license now for (X) months, or you get a single point for the next 12 months, and if you lose it, you lose your license for 2(X) months.\n\nA huge problem with unwanted behavior is the habit. This system forces the driver to continuously and consciously make sure that they are in no risk. During the first month or two of being on this \"golden point\", their every thought is about following the road rules as best they can. After a while it becomes second nature.\n\nAs someone who has lost many accounts to toxicity, I can say that chat restrictions are a damned joke. They do nothing. Everyone just sees them as a minor inconvenience, and I'd argue that they actually increase toxicity. People are going to be more frustrated when they can't type, so when they are finally allowed to talk, they have an outburst, worse than what the original one would be.\n\nOver the course of my accounts, especially the last few.. my behavior has dramatically improved. I used to be terrible, but now I am much more tame. Until you are told \"this is your final warning\" and you have a constant reminder of that, it is very hard to break the habit of being rude.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does nearly every legal system in the world encourage reform and rehabilitation, rather than just punishing bad behavior?\n\n\nAnyone who takes Psych 101 could tell you that positive reinforcement is better and more effective than negative.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-03-31T18:01:49.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Toxic Shaco,realm=OCE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=y5RcEwYb,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-31T13:21:54.092+0000)\n> \n> A lot of people in game, and more broadly, in life don&#x27;t realize just how serious the consequences of their actions are until they are **at the end**.\n\nSo then you agree that Riot **needs** to punish these people very aggressively past the 14-day ban.
