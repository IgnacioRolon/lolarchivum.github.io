I'm currently using Win10 64bits, Nvidia 960. Haven't had this issue since I upgraded my windows and the only error I have had so far is a one time error that the client froze when I opened a capsule (no error msg pop-up from it, cannot regenerate it either)\n\nWhat I've tried:\n- No hardware updates. \n- At first I was on Win10, 32 bits. Starting to have this error since the client was updated to beta version\n- Full repair from client --> didn't work\n- Reinstall client --> didn't work\n- Update Nvidia driver, reinstall Nvidia driver --> didn't work\n- Downgrade to Win7, 32 bits --> didn't work\n- Upgrade to Win10 64bits (for my school project.....) --> somehow have it fixed, at least for now\n        - have Nvidia Cuda tool box installed for school work, not sure it contributes\n\nMeanwhile, my 5 year Acer laptop with Win10 32bits & Win8 64bits later on, AMD Radeon, appears to have no issue throughout the time.\n\nHope it helps and good luck to all.....I feel your pain : (","replies":[]},{"poster":"nietzschelloo","date":"2017-12-12T21:38:54.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same this has been messing me up and im starting to get really annoyed have found several threads but no solutions","replies":[]},{"poster":"Francexxxx","date":"2017-12-06T17:57:38.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guys i had same problems for 6 months but i find fix atleast it worked for me my client is litlle bit laggy so when i did those things it helped me i change my lol compatibilyti to windows 7 , and on my client - general i enabled low spec mode , close client during game and chancged my client windows size to 1024 x 576 , i got no error 183 or crashes during champ select or ban select .. i hope it will work for you how it worked for me :) {{champion:19}} BTW SORRY FOR BAD ENGLISH ;( ","replies":[]},{"poster":"hazzza3","date":"2017-11-27T08:08:59.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Failed to create dump file  errer183","replies":[]},{"poster":"thekiller56","date":"2017-09-21T21:27:52.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot please fix this.. im still getting it every like 3 or 4 games, ive lost so many promos because of it.

Situations like this can typically be fixed by running a repair through the client options, so give that a go and test it in a custom game to avoid any possible penalties.
