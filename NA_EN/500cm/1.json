For example i own 2 skins for Veigar, final boss, and white mage. It is frustrating to me because sometimes im caught out changing my runes pr doing other things in champ select and it always automatically selects the white mage skin, although the final boss skin is much better. can you make it so that is chooses the skin based on highest tier?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-18T02:50:07.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure that skin choice should either be defaulting back to the last one you had chosen, or back to the actual default skin for Veigar. Maybe try running a quick repair, or a config reset following the steps below to tell the client to stop being indecisive about what skin to give you.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings ","replies":[]}]}
