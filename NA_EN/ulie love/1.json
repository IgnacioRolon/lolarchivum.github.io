I have been playing league on this computer for over a year its a 2 year old laptop. High end at time of purchase ($1899.99) Never have I had any issues on my end before.\r\nThe other day I got a bug splat transitioning from champions select to loading screen.\r\nAt this point I get a black screen after champion select where I should be transitioning into loading screen.\r\nSince that point I can not join or spectate any games. I have repaired client, Reinstalled LoL, Updated my OS.\r\nThere is a history of people facing this issue I have included just one thread below\r\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2729407&amp;page=5\r\nThere is no acknowledgement from Riot.\r\nOut of the blue I can no longer play LoL on my computer. Has anyone else faced this issue before?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-25T23:50:25.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugsplats are often caused by Operating system or hardware issues.
