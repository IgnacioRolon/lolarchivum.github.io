It&#039;s now 20 minutes into the queue as I&#039;m writing this.\n\nThere are barely any new players compared to when I started. I get matched with the same people over and over, and those same people are INCREDIBLY toxic, calling new people &quot;boosted shits&quot; and &quot;useless fucks go kill yourselves&quot;. This is in level 15-25 games. I made a new account to see how far I could get as a OTP, and this has reminded me of how painful the new player experience is when starting out and why so many of my friends have never made it to level 30, which is where the ACTUAL game barely even starts.\n\nYou are at a disadvantage before the game even starts if your opponents are high leveled than you even 1 more level, that means more mastery points and runes. \n\nAnybody who is matched against someone level 18 or up when they are 17 or lower almost always loses lane because of keystones.\n\nThere is a majority of smurfs and banned players with new accounts just being absolutely abusive to anyone and everyone they are matched with. I know this from other friends who are brand new who dont have the matchmaking adjustments I do because of my match history on my account.\n\nThis is horrendous, and this is why this game can&#039;t succeed without you completely redoing one of the most important parts of the game. Starting out. This is currently like deciding to play american football at age 14, being thrown onto 1 of 2 teams with players aged 10-18, and saying &quot;good luck have fun&quot;. It just doesnt work.\n\nEdit: Took me 25 minutes total to get in a lobby and start a game. The population of \"new\" players is smaller than plat. That says something.","replies":[{"poster":"Ghostcrawler","date":"2016-07-26T21:40:57.052+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"A few things:\n\n1) We'll look into queue times for sub 30 accounts.

The most tangible effect is sub 18, where you will play against people with keystones while you dont have any, which can put you at quite a significant disadvantage, and thats something new players can and DO feel.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2016-07-27T01:15:55.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ghostcrawler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QTWAKEhp,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-07-27T00:03:24.805+0000)\n>\n> and\n> \n> Yeah, we&#x27;ll look into it.
