The reason? The reason was me speaking on chat too much because of being tilted by trolls in team. I DIDNT insult ANYONE, nothing like that. Before last 14days ban I sometimes insulted people, because i was mad. It happens. But after that i improved myself and didnt insult anyone even if I personally was provoked and called by offensive words.  I made a ticket to contact with riot support, because i felt like a victim of really nasty report system. Someone reported me for offensive language even if i wasnt offensive. A support send me my last games chat and i admit i shouldnt answer at all to these people but i did. We are all humans and we make mistakes. I accept punishment like chat restriction or even timeban but not permaban. This offense doesnt deserve such big Punishment. What do you guys think? Am I right or wrong?\r\n\r\nthese are support responses:\r\n1.\r\nHello, i just saw my account is permamently banned. I didnt flame at all after last 14days ban. I think someone just reported me for bad play and i got banned. You can check my last games after last ban and you will see i didnt insult anyone. Please review this and send me a message.\r\n\r\nVYNIX wtorek,\r\nGreetings,\r\nThank you for contacting League of Legends Support, Vynix here, I&#039;ll be assisting you today.\r\nYour account has been permanently banned after being escalated through multiple levels of punishment by our disciplinary audits.\r\nTo see the most recent games which led to this action, please log in to the client to view your reform card. While we do our best at Riot Games to encourage reform, we permanently remove players who continue to create negative experiences from our game. Even if you didn&#039;t insult your team that much, you were still really negative and offensive and we do not tolerate such behavior.\r\nThis action is only taken after repeat punishments and we will not lift the suspension under any circumstance.\r\nAlthough this marks the end of the line, we&rsquo;re confident that with some reflection you will be able to avoid this kind of situation with whatever new games you decide to play.\r\nBest of luck in your future endeavors.\r\nVynix\r\nPlayer Support Specialist\r\n\r\n2.Well, you said i can progress and be better. Im after my last ban, why did you banned my account? i didnt insult ANYONE, check chat ,thats the proof i improved myself. do not link chat from games BEFORE last ban.\r\n\r\nVYNIX \r\nHey again,\r\nThe games linked to this permanent suspension were all played after the 2 week suspension. Due to high levels of negativity exhibited in those games, we issued a permanent suspension of the account.\r\nThat being said, the suspension will not be lifted and the matter is closed.\r\nKind regards,\r\nVynix\r\nPlayer Support Specialist\r\n\r\n3.what do you mean by &quot; Due to high levels of negativity exhibited in those games, &quot; Can you tell me what i did to be permanently banned? i didnt break summoners code after last ban. I didnt insult and offended anyone, and chat proves that. If you cannot unban me then tell me with who can i speak?\r\n\r\nVYNIX \r\nHello again,\r\nI will attach the chat logs of the games in which the negative behavior was displayed.\r\nGame
