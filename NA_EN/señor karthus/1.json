They can be eating badly because they just don't know the problems that obesity brings because their sociocultural level is low. They can be eating too much because of metabolic disorders. Because of certain medication they have. They can be eating too much because we live in a society that encourage that kind of eating behavior with oversized meals. They can be eating too much because they are surrounded by assholes who treat them bad because of their body shape and make fun of them or keep shaming them for being like that, leading them to depression (yes that's where people like you fit).\nEvery professional in the obesity area will tell you that the self responsibility in obesity is, at the most, 50%. \nSo please, unless you have studied for years one of the most complex and challenging health issues of our days, I think you should shut up.","replies":[{"poster":"Mannysmoker","date":"2015-03-09T23:23:10.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Looks like that one went deep.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-03-11T06:40:39.968+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what every bully says.\n\nAnd someday, one of those bullies will indirectly cause the death of their victims.\n\nSomeone is telling you how certain actions and words harm people, and you respond by saying you don't care.
