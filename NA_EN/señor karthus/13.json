It is nearly impossible for him to get he's q proc off on hem unless the enemy significantly miss positions or you land a taunt q combo.\n\nSecond, I really miss his old passive Ki Strike, which felt fairly fun to use and build for.\n\nThird, his lack of sustain is quite saddening, I don't miss his old fairly non interactive q but losing the sustain aspect  definitely was a negative.\n\nFourth, he is heavily reliant on his enemy fucking up in order for him to land a q.  It is unbelievable how easy it is to dodge that thing or just simply make it so shen cannot hit you with it.\n\nFifth, his w dodge field feels fairly gimmicky.  It is very hard to set up properly (largely because you can only pull the blade to yourself) and even when you do it is very easy to counter.  The field is so small that it makes you an easy target for spells if you want to actually use it.\n\nSixth, I do like the new passive, and find it very interesting and fun to use, especially if you land abilities in a team fight which can cause it to proc a lot more.  However, it is heavily reliant on him landing his q in a fight, which without taunt and against a competent opponent is extremely hard to do during lane phase (not as bad in tonight's because of the hectic nature, but still fairly hard, although I chalk this portion to my lack of skill with new shen).\n\nThat is all I got from it for now, still testing him out.","replies":[{"poster":"Señor Karthus","date":"2016-01-29T19:06:26.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"W should also move the ki blade to his location.
