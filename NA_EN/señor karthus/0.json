FUCKING FEMINISM PISSING IN MY CHEERIOS!\"\n\n>Who cares if the characters in a video game don't represent real life... it's all fantasy. \n\nBecause the two are not fundamentally separable. Where do you think all the ideas in this game come from?\nNo one is asking for total realism, but everything in this game and indeed all games on some level has referent within the real world, and by definition has to. It's not simply necessary in order for the creator to even make the content, its necessary in order for the player to understand the content.\n\nConsequently it can't simply be ignored in total even if ones goal is not making a realistic game. It's even common for game designers to switch things within a game to match perceptions of a what a thing is rather than what it actually is, especially with mechanical objects.\n\nThis is also why Riot ends up changing things both in visuals and kit in order to make them \"readable\".\n\n>This is a list of strong female characters who I wouldn't call overly sexualized\n\nAnnie is not sexualized? I certainly fucking hope she isn't.\n\nThe only champions there that aren't sexualized are Poppy and Annie.\n\n>I'll admit, many characters are sexualized but sex does sell.\n\nVery debatable. Typically sex in advertising only sells content when the content is specifically related to sex. Otherwise, it more often than not only serves to distract the audience away from whats being advertised.\n\n>My list is from overly sexualized characters. The males fit the standards of what women find attractive in a male, and the women do it visa versa. \n\nThis argument is fairly common, which is amusing because the same people who use it also tend argue that the games are played overwhelmingly by males and that things in games and made to appeal to males. It then follows that the \"sexualized\" male champions aren't made for female consumption at all and are at best designed around what men think women want, without regard for whether or not that is the case. Not that their views matter because, again, it's not made for them to begin with. It would then follow that these characters are made for the male audience but for what purpose? Couldn't possibly have to do with a power fantasy.\n\n>I hope I discussed this properly. \n\nNo, you don't. Your entire post after your commentaries on sexualized content largely serves to try and argue that this discussion is pointless and that it shouldn't be had and that your tired of it and that it doesn't matter.

This argument is usually thrown by sexism-enthusiasts. It is just as absurd as saying that 3 criminals in a house are innocent just because one of the roommates is innocent.\n\nBut lets play your game and go with the facts of your cherry-picked characters: \n\nQuinn: one of the few whose base design is not bad. Still, young and good looking in the standard euro-centric model of beauty. As every other female character. Winter skin incredibly sexist.\n\nKalista: lets compare it with Karthus or Thresh who are similar concepts/origin in male version. They are monsters. Skeleton faced. Completely horrid. Kalista meanwhile keeps a decent female face and mostly human parts, so important for an undead as breasts who will slightly show from the light clothes she wears. But hey, lets not suppose that it happened just because it is a female and has to look a bit pleasant to the eye. Right?\n\nAnnie: we could discuss here about all the anime-related stuff that Annie's concept comes from. A culture of over sexualizing girls in school uniform. but lets leave that out of the conversation because we are talking about a little girl and not an adult female and it would be completely horrid if she was also blatantly sexualized. \n\nRiven: a Champion that is supposed to be incredibly strong. Still she has sticks for arms. Just comparing it with her male counterparts, who are huge and muscled makes clear that female designs are not allowed to look like anything other than a standard western model. Her look makes no sense with the concept and that is because of the sexism behind the design. Because people don't want to fantasize about \"super muscled women.\" Right?\n\nLeona: exactly the same problem. Male tanks are HUGE. While a female tank still looks skinny and has the body of a standard model. Because female characters are not allowed to be anything else than that.\n\nPoppy: not a human. Out of discussion.\n\nKayle: another young good looking female character but nothing much to actually complain about with her. I like her design inspired in Samus Aran. \n\nSejuani: same problem as Leona. A tank looking just as skinny as Jinx. And of course the Traditional skin that has even less clothes than the normal one.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2015-08-24T04:43:21.247+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":5,"body":"Holy crap you blew up on that guy, and made some horrible assumptions.\n\n1. Poppy counts.  We're talking about gender here, not species.  Even if we were excluding non-human species Yordles are based off of human anatomy, so they would still count.\n2. Annie counts.  Just because you don't like the idea of her being a problem area doesn't mean it won't be a problem if you don't discuss it.  Personally I don't think Riot created sexism problem here with Annie, but again no debate no answer.\n3. \"This argument is usually thrown by sexism-enthusiasts.\"  Holy fuck this is a worse assumption than anything I've seen from people disagreeing with you so far.  I'm actually tempted to report your post because of this blatant insulting of anyone who tries giving examples you do not think are good enough.\n\nYou are acting like a child here.

Do you know what that feels like?\n\nEveryone knows what it feels like, stop acting like it only applies to one gender, when it obviously doesn't. Realize it sucks and move on.\n\nIf you have such a low self image that you can't handle being yourself because of something someone drew or animated, then that is more on you than the person drawing. Harsh but is a fact. \n\nEveryone deals with it, but you deal with it, and move on. dealing with it isn't repeating the same line over and over until someone gives you the sympathy and pandering you are looking for.
