As one who does not like his current skin, I am formally requesting a brand-spanking new skin.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I thought that an Omega Squad skin would have fit him perfectly. Give him a dark mustache, a cigar, new hat, medals of honor and some veteran-like new voice lines and *boom*. Add in a scarred and experienced-looking Skaarl, and it would have been absolutely perfect.\r\n\r\nObviously this didn&#039;t go through, but still. Did we need yet _another_ Fizz skin? Show our taco-loving Yordle and his cowardly yet loyal lizard some love. Please Rito, please....","replies":[{"poster":"ARBR1","date":"2017-08-12T20:12:39.232+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A Dragon Trainer Kled would be perfect as HELL.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-11T06:09:45.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just don't think they can top the chocobo.
