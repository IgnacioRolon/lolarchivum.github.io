In this case, tell your friend to follow the [account recovery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694-Recovering-Your-Account) FAQ to get his account back. The standard process is that they will place a security lock on the account until the original owner can be verified. This will take some time and is not instant, so please be patient. \n\nGood luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klaytonix","date":"2018-01-11T23:48:20.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IKR I was sitting right next to him when it happened, <MOD EDIT> was stolen by <MOD EDIT> but be wary cause hes jumping and gathering different accounts through hacking.
