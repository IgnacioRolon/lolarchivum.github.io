Any system that hinges its effectiveness on a player being conscious of their own toxicity is pretty likely to fail.\n\n> AND GUESS WHAT. they will still throw their money away on your trash game and they cant get perma banned.\n\nAnd what if Riot _wants_ toxic players to be permabanned, and what if they don't care about the toxic players' money? Since, as it stands, that is Riot's official stance. They don't want unrepentant toxic players playing their game, and they really don't need or want those toxic players' money.\n\n> wala.\n\nSmall nitpick; it's \"voilÃ \", not \"wala\".","replies":[{"poster":"1 Inch and Proud","date":"2019-04-14T21:55:20.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"not want toxic players money? is that why they allow people to make infinite accounts..?","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-04-14T22:33:13.220+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> is that why they allow people to make infinite accounts..?\n\nWell, how are they going to _stop_ them from making accounts? Since their game is Free-to-Play, there's no bar to re-entry, and they can't (to my knowledge) feasibly ID ban every single person they want to leave the game.\n\nSo what are they supposed to do? They can't particularly _keep_ those players out, due to the nature of League being a Free-to-Play game, but that doesn't mean that they want those toxic players to come back and buy more stuff.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-04-13T23:41:55.148+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot tried accumulating chat restrictions, but those players ended up being toxic in other ways.
