It asks that you complete 4 other missions. Any previously completed mission before \"A Real Challenger\" will NOT count towards it. I bought the 1,300 RP ticket AFTER I completed 1 of the 2 basic missions, and \"A Real Challenger\" appeared around that time.\r\n\r\nQuestions for Riot Tech Support:\r\nDoes it come with the ticket?\r\nIf so, why didn't it count the previously completed mission?\r\nIf it's not intended to retroactively count completed missions, then why isn't it specified before purchase?\r\nIf it does not come with the ticket, when does it appear?\r\nIf it's suppose to retroactively count completed missions, can I get help debugging \"A Real Challenger\"?\r\n\r\nIf you are a player who is using this system, please complete the poll down below.\r\n\r\nAny help and all would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-27T17:22:05.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"More missions towards the overall completion will come each week aligned with Worlds.  **Everyone **participating with a pass should be at 3/4, until week 2 starts.
