Cap put a link to his official site, and if you're familiar with the 40K franchise, I recommend the stories he's written around the Horus Heresy in particular, namely A Thousand Sons. He's also written several of the codexes, which are excellent reads themselves despite mainly being rulebooks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Killaburn","date":"2018-03-03T07:01:30.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"riot should gave him many more stories to write.","replies":[]}]}
