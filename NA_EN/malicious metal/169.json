If a champ, like Heimer, means an autolose in the lane for a champ like Garen/Darius/Sejuani in the top lane, that's unhealthy game design.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Leo Cat","date":"2017-07-25T14:34:59.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing his counters means you don't get to play what you want to play.

Think you need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Panth bullies the shit out of the vast majority of top laners with very little effort and unavoidable damage. Also factor in that you don't always get the luxury of counterpicking your lane opponent\n\nIf the game was balanced around how a champion specifically fairs against our mains, it would be a pretty poor game. For example, even though Darius completely stomps my main in lane, I've actually defended him on multiple occasions.
