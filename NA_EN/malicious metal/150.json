The one reason that pertains to both of them is that they build Rylai's simply because it is too strong right now. Ideally, Rylai's will be reduced in power to the point where it is a utility _option_ only built in situations where you need the health or disengage. The main reason every Brand builds Rylai's right now is that it is more gold efficient and more powerful than his other options, and that's not what balance looks like.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-07-19T22:30:08.346+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":2,"body":"Let's be real here.\nFrozen mallet's passive is less effective on ranged so why shouldn't Rylais?","replies":[{"poster":"kDrakari","date":"2016-07-20T01:00:20.547+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the theory is that Frozen Mallet is applied using auto attacks, so ranged attackers have a much easier and safer time applying the slow, which is why they get less reward from it. Rylai's is dependent on spells, so auto attack range doesn't really have anything to do with how easily or safely they can apply it; instead the slow varies based on the type of spell so multi-target spells don't get too much value and DoT spells aren't crippling. I think that both items have the slow they provide vary in a reasonable way, and I don't think that a ranged versus a melee auto attack should be a deciding factor in an item that isn't related to auto attacks at all.\n\nThe thing that I think is different between them in an important way is that Frozen Mallet has a HUGE amount of HP turning it into a non-viable item for damage dealers. Rylai's has a lot less of its cost tied up in health, thus a lot more damage so it can be used efficiently in full-damage builds on champions that have sustained damage patterns, rather than as a defensive option or for champions that need real survivability and chase potential.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-07-20T01:02:08.088+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Well, Rylais used to have a mere 80 AP and 500 health.\n\nI'd actually love some more HP on it and make it a defensive option.\nHell, it has more AP than Zhonyas.\n\n70 AP and 600 hp would be the dream :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-20T02:05:11.279+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are already so few high AP items though.

Here is the current text on Rylai's:\n\nUNIQUE - Icy: Damaging abilities slow affected units based on their type:\nSingle Target: 40% for 1.5 seconds\nMulti Target: 40% for 1 second\nDamage over Time, Multi Hit, and Pet Attacks: 20% for 1 second\n\nWith the live iteration, Rylai's varies its slow strength and duration based off of spell targeting. This has enabled champions like Morde, Brand, and Malzahar to chain slow targets for 5-10 seconds, usually because their target simply stood too close. Here is my proposed new text:\n\nUNIQUE - Icy: Damaging abilities slow affected units by a maximum of 40% for 1 second. Max slow is achieved at 200 range and decays by 5% every 100 additional range, to a minimum of 10%. Multi Target spells, Damage over Time spells, and Pet Attacks slow for half value.\n\nWith this iteration, champions like Malzahar and Singed will still be able to kite but not able to engage without other items like {{item:3152}} or {{item:3800}} .
