Let&#x27;s keep it that way.\n> \n> What non-juggernaut gets the better of Mordekaiser in lane (I&#x27;m specifying in lane because I&#x27;m reasonably sure champions like Tryndamere, Jax, Nasus, or Master Yi can duel him late game).\n\nRenekton can get the better of mordekaiser early game since the shield can't nullify his entire combo, especially if its an above 50 rage combo. Pantheon can also do well if he manages his blocks well for the morde Q.\n\nMorde will outscale both of them but lane phase is relatively in their favor.\n\nNasus is a juggernaut by the way, and doesn't struggle to hard against mordekaiser since wither fucks up Morde's ability to lay down the Qs.\n\nAlso when I say out of combat I mean his shield decays after 1.5 seconds, which is hardly out of combat. It's short enough for on-and-off fights to really throw mordekaiser off since it's hard for him to heal poke that gets through his shield back up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raid Boss Morde","date":"2016-09-13T02:38:40.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are many champions who beat Mordekaiser in lane. \n\nIrelia, Fiora, Quinn, Graves, Jayce, Jax, Tryndamere, Renekton, Pantheon, and if you wanna talk about Juggernauts, Nasus, Trundle, Olaf,  and sometimes Darius.","replies":[{"poster":"PermabannedGaren","date":"2016-09-13T03:47:21.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Raid Boss Morde,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wg0nPwEZ,comment-id=0001000300000000000000000001,timestamp=2016-09-13T02:38:40.131+0000)\n>\n> There are many champions who beat Mordekaiser in lane. \n> \n> Irelia, Fiora, Quinn, Graves, Jayce, Jax, Tryndamere, Renekton, Pantheon, and if you wanna talk about Juggernauts, Nasus, Trundle, Olaf,  and sometimes Darius.\n\nFirst of all, I already acknowledged that ranged champions can handle him.\n\nSecond of all, I frankly don't believe you. You can't sell the idea that Jax beats Mordekaiser in lane to me lol. \n\nThough yeah I guess a Tryndamere who has studied calculus could beat him.","replies":[{"poster":"Raid Boss Morde","date":"2016-09-13T04:12:43.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jax completely destroys Mordekaiser in lane.

Mordekaiser can hit Jax with those with little counterplay on Jax's part. Only use Q when Jax has already used his E. It's not like he will be doing much damage to you through your shield early on. Max W obviously.","replies":[{"poster":"Raid Boss Morde","date":"2016-09-13T04:46:47.743+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morde's main damage in trades is his Q though, which Jax negates.
