goes to show how much I just love the &quot;idea&quot; of Mordekaiser.\r\nHe looks like an indestructible titan in his splashes, making you think he&#039;d be this towering colossus in game that&#039;s extremely durable and just walks over the opposition.\r\nAnd then we get this tin can with weird proportions and a kit that&#039;s all over the place.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis shows really well WHY Morde needs a VGU, he has a solid character idea and an endearing champion fantasy, but he just does NOT deliver on it.\r\n\r\nNow excuse me while I touch myself inappropriately to this Aatrox
