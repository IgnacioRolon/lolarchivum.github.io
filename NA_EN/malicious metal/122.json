Auras provide quite powerful stats for the entire team but the bad thing about them is that the power is invisible as it is passive in nature. Just stat boosts that don't leave any visible traces, making them feel incredibly lackluster because the champion that provides them does literally nothing but stand near his team and provides \"moral\" support.

Aatrox would be just as happy fighting everyone and leaving all but one dead just so they could tell his tale.\n\nGoing the support route also destroys the things about Aatrox's kit that I really love. The clutch moments when you're at 5% HP and every time you heal you get a spike of health just large enough to survive. The strong burst of his empowered W.

He is a diver and is being reworked as a diver. The \"fight to the death\" and \"inspiring\" his allies was only a method to stir more bloodshed and cause more havoc on the battlefield. Aatrox is a selfish character, he is not in it to 'help' anyone, he thrives off meaningless wars and does not care who wins or loses.

You're basically doing what they did to Morderkaiser. You're taking a champion that some people really enjoy and forcing it into alien territory on some whim that it may work. Whether or not it will work is not the problem, the problem is Aatrox already has some kind of established identity to those who've played him.

A demon that only appears during war, to turn the battelfield for the losing team, but with a bloody price for the victory. I was expecting a strong dualing champ, who supports his team with offensive buffs, not a diver who excels on solo fighting... But I don't wanna see him turned into a supporter, since there are already people who main him and will probably outrage over such a dramatic change (which is quite understandable), so I want him to become more teamoriented! I thought of an ability that would alert him of an on going teamfight and allow him to teleport in the middle of the fight and after arrival he would gain a strong buff and also a buff aura for his allies. It could be coded so it will only trigger if atleast like 4 or 5 champs are fighting in the same area for already X seconds. So he won't just be able to make his team win every 1v1 (that comes to close to Shens niche in my opinion). Of course such an ability needs a fairly high cd (for better visualising: it should feel like someone with baron buff teleports to a minion wave). If riots wants to hold on to his current kit, than I would suggest something like his ult giving him his current self buff and also a buff aura for his allies. And the buff should become stronger the longer a fight takes. For example his ult could count the seconds you are in combat and scale with the duration. Or to further explore the “turn a loosing fight around“ thematic, how about something like: upon activating his ult the current number of dead allies will be counted and make it and the buff aura stronger.","replies":[{"poster":"Sevixys","date":"2016-12-03T09:17:12.358+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A quality comment but could you please tidy it up a bit?

Over time, their memories of battle faded, only to be replaced with a grim revelation: their acts of heroism were, in fact, brutal atrocities committed by their own hands.\n\nSorry, but while his lore works fine with him as a Dive Fighter, there is definitely a Support aspect to it. He imbues an army with an unnatural bloodlust and strength that affects them even after he disappears.\n\nWhen he was first revealed I read his lore and was surprised his kit didn't include an offensive buff to his allies. You could definitely add that without making him a support, but it'd definitely be feasible to make him able to support.\n\n(And since you're a support main too, I'll add this)\n\nSincerely,\nA Braum/Leona main ","replies":[{"poster":"Abandon","date":"2016-12-01T14:23:09.840+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean if we're going by thematics, when Aatrox's team has a lead he should just abandon his team and join the enemy team and imbue them to be stronger than his current team. That way he can \"support the losing team\". \n\nI understand that there is some MINOR support-esque vibes in his lore if you're picking it out but if you look towards the last two lines, it sums up his character pretty well.\n\n\"Aatrox's true legacy may be a world filled with conflict and strife\"\n\n''Some fight for honor, some fight for glory. It matters only that you fight.''\n-- Aatrox \n\nBasically, Aatrox is a demon figuratively and literally. All he wants is to experience the endless tides of battle. He cares little for who he supports and he cares even less for who he slaughters. \n\nI mean if that doesn't convince you that he is not intended for the support role then please look at his opening description:\n\n\"Aatrox is a legendary warrior, one of only five that remain of an ancient race known as the Darkin. He wields his massive blade with grace and poise, slicing through legions in a style that is hypnotic to behold. With each foe felled, Aatrox's seemingly living blade drinks in their blood, empowering him and fueling his brutal, elegant campaign of slaughter.\"\n\nNow I don't know about you but typically supports don't tend to want to be the one doing the killing, hyper scaling off each enemy they kill and empowering themselves so they can do more killing. \n\nLook... I get that you see the potential in Aatrox to be a support but you have to understand, we as Aatrox players DON'T want to be forced into unfamiliar territory because some *random had a GREAT idea to change his entire identity. If he can have skills that double as a feasible support buff, great! I just ask that his direction FOCUSES on his INTENDED roles and that is according to classification 'FIGHTER/TANK'.","replies":[{"poster":"Bladeglory","date":"2016-12-01T16:34:22.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I mean if we're going by thematics, when Aatrox's team has a lead he should just abandon his team and join the enemy team and imbue them to be stronger than his current team.\n\nHe uh... didn't do that though.

Not another Morde situation. I was mostly replying to the \"IT MAKES NO SENSE\" outrage. I basically want what you said:\n> If he can have skills that double as a feasible support buff, great!\n\nWouldn't it be nice if Aatrox gave his allies a reason to engage with him other than the standard \"Strength In Numbers\"? If part of his power fulfilled on the \"empower his allies\" fantasy? That when your team is outmatched or outnumbered he can turn it around and turn his team into monsters?\n\nAnd then if it's something that's beneficial early game, the adventurous and stupid of us can take him support for some cheese strats, like Sion/Teemo/Illaoi support or stuff like that.\n\nBasically when I imagine Aatrox being taken as a support, I think Leona when you take her top lane. You dive into the enemy ranks and cause a team fight you think you'll win. If Aatrox had any abilities that actually benefit his allies, or made his allies benefit him, well... I just think that'd be a really nice way to get him back to a healthier spot.","replies":[{"poster":"Abandon","date":"2016-12-01T22:57:08.738+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, none of those picks are conventional \"supports\" - they are by definition mages that have such high damage output and some reliable CC that people have found a niche for them in a kill lane bot. Adding to this, most of the time you do not want to be taking the kills anyways unless that's how the cookie is crumbling in the teamfights and there's no other way.\n\nI wouldn't mind an ally passive/buff but I just hope that his rework focuses on keeping him a fighter/diver by definition and maybe focuses secondly towards his team utility. It'd be great if he could provide more for his team.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2016-12-01T07:19:12.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheDevice,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2JXl9efO,comment-id=0036,timestamp=2016-12-01T07:12:04.903+0000)\n>\n> WHYYYYYYY!\n> \n> NO!
