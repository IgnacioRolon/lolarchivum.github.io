That's not even getting into FPS games (of which Blizzard is also guilty of weird balance there, too, with Year of the Roadhog event currently going on effectively) and other fun genres that tend to have either a larger team dedicated to balance changes or just one man for the role.\n\nAnd no, I'm not trying to say DotA2 can do no wrong in the balance department either (it's had its share of mis-steps), I'm just curious about whether it's better to have a smaller, more centralized unit for balance or a larger team.
