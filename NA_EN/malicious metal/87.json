He&#039;s a very strong champion in the right hands and unlike some other straight-forward champions he&#039;s not only rewarded with a good performance but doing that just feels great.\nHis popularity this patch is due to three things:\n\n-He&#039;s ALWAYS been popular, thus he&#039;s already got a pretty big player base, which only got BIGGER with the release of his *Bloodmoon* skin. Even the other BM champions got an increase in play rate, especially talon\n\n-He abuses Armorpen like there&#039;s no tomorrow. It makes him too oppressive early when most adc&#039;s should be. This itemization also covers a LOT of his intended weaknesses of being squishy, LOW mobility and generally just popping when caught.\nMostly a {{item:3814}} {{item:3142}}  problem and not a Jhin one\n\n-He snowballs like crazy, which this meta is all about. Utility ADC&#039;s and late game powerhouses like Ashe are not seeing the light of day because games are too fast and early dominance is valued a lot more. If the game slows down we&#039;ll see a lot more variety in the adc role.\n\n\nSo yeah, Jhin is a strong character but don&#039;t  play dumb and say it wasn&#039;t obvious that he&#039;d become even more popular.\nAll the recent updates benefitted him directly or indirectly of course he&#039;s going to be strong.\n\nAnd RIOT knows that.\nThey&#039;re hitting Lethality AND his R catch potential on the PBE.\nThey know he&#039;s strong but unlike certain individuals they do not just want to gut that champion.\n\nBesides, I&#039;d rather play against Jhin than stuff like Cait and Vayne.","replies":[{"poster":"bbQsauçe","date":"2017-02-17T12:53:38.907+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":67,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2017-02-17T12:56:34.912+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":4,"body":"> I'm not denying that he's currently VERY Powerful, I'm not.\n\nSigh, did you even read the thread?","replies":[{"poster":"bbQsauçe","date":"2017-02-17T13:00:53.801+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":45,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-02-17T13:01:36.896+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":43,"body":"Jhin fanboys man, they're fucking delusional.","replies":[{"poster":"MissingKayo","date":"2017-02-17T13:53:12.042+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":28,"body":"At least we're intelligent.","replies":[{"poster":"Mordemir","date":"2017-02-17T14:11:15.184+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MissingKayo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=v2Ekzye9,comment-id=00030000000000000000,timestamp=2017-02-17T13:53:12.042+0000)\n>\n> At least we&#x27;re fabulous.\n\nFixed it for you.","replies":[{"poster":"JoeMG","date":"2017-02-17T15:36:47.231+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:44}}  You called?","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-02-17T18:21:43.626+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gems?","replies":[{"poster":"Papa Andrei","date":"2017-02-17T20:28:30.012+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/1d/1d0a6ed3b7c1ba6226ab7954d694ed541fe43649aaa36db30717ef94bdc2937b.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-02-17T21:03:45.405+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fuck?

I kinda gave up any hope of playing any normal ADC at the time :(\n\nQuinn, jhin , mf....people are complaining about them. Calling them overpowered.

It's the fact that only they can survive long enough to do something via their range and movespeed along with edge of night preventing any oneshots. \n\nThis is a sad time for league of legends where only 3 botlane ADC's are truly viable for soloque.
