That is essentially tossing aside money, effort, and the set timetable- the epitome of unprofessional practices.\n\nUrgot's rework has been planned for a long time now. It's his turn on the schedule and they've divided up time, resources, and all manner of things to accommodate this schedule. Changing it up on a metaphorical dime is only going to lead to rushed solutions that bring you right back to the problem board again.\n\n\n> They'll just push them away until they get a 'rework' when they have only been out for a year (Vel'Koz for example)\n\nI imagine you're talking about the Mage Rework because otherwise Vel'Koz was virtually never touched. And he was updated to give him more options and an actual reason to be picked beyond damage- which he didn't have before. Now he has to choose between maxing Q and W. Now he has to land several skills to get the full potential out of his ultimate. Now he's got a proper niche as the tank-buster since he can ignore resistances.\nHe also was fairly easy to update, Urgot required a full-scale overhaul, another reason the schedule is so important and shouldn't be changed on a whim.\n\nMalz is likely on the schedule, but the changes they need for him will likely wait until a suitable opportunity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2017-04-05T04:11:33.473+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"What? \n\nNo.\n\nThose champs are just added to the rework list, but at the bottom, in terms of priority?\n\nWhy? Because of the reasons you mentioned; some champs need it more. Champs like old poppy, yorick and urgot needed updates more than the new champs, which have updated designs and abilities, but aren't healthy for the game.\n\nThey devote their times into updating those champs, while temporarily nerfing the new problematic champs, because they simply don't have the workforce for it.\n\nI believe they have two rework teams? The one that did Yorick went to do Urgot while the other finished up WW. Now, as the Urgot is being finished, the WW team moved on to Eve. Why not Azir, Kalista, or Malz? Because they need the updates less than Urgot and Eve. But, if left in their current states, they'd cause problems to the game. So, the only way they can fix it is by nerfs. If nerfs/buffs don't produce satisfactory results, the champ needs to be gutted. \n\nThe third \"update team\" is the class update team, which I believe is working on divers. When those guys get the chance, they'll pick up some outdated champs and give them some tuning in the corresponding class update, often making them a \"small rework.\" Those occur alongside other problematic class champs that needed  more changes.\n\nThus, you get champs like Velkoz, Malz, Annie, and Fid as small updates in the MYMU.\n\nIt's not mediocre, sloppy, or unprofessional.\n\n>  If something is messed up this horribly, you spend time to fix it first. I get that they want to push things forward, but when you pile crap on top of crap it adds up and people leave due to the stench\n\nAnd what's causing a bigger stench right now?
