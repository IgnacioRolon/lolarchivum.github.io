A lot of range... making it hard to feel safe from him.  Rengo has to ult to get on you unless you facecheck a bush he's in and the game telegraphs that he's coming. HARD.  Talon has to walk up into your grill or flip a wall and land next to you.  Sure, he can do it while his ult is up, but again... telegraphed as hell.  Zed can shadow-swap in and ult you from almost a screen away, mash all his keys, and kill you.  There's counterplay to his ult, yeah... but his long-range dive in is brutal, and he can toss his Q from across the screen through his shadows.  Zed doesn't feel like he suffers the downsides of a melee champ, and even ranged champs have to play against him as if he's Xerath or something with all the long-ranged poke he can toss at you... let alone his hard all-in if he chooses to.  This makes him hard to deal with unless you can deal with both poke AND all-in...  Most mages and squishy mids do one or the other.\n\n2: Zed is safe.  He can shadow-swap away from dangers with ease.  He can abort a failed dive with one button and save himself from death by his own mistakes.  He's near impossible to pin down.  I see him almost like AD LeBlanc.  Not worth ganking unless he's gone in hard and blown his W first... and even then he'll probably get the kill he swapped in for before he dies.  Hell, he might still get out too by swapping back to his ult shadow!  He's very hard to punish, but he punishes YOU very brutally.  Counterplay or not, that's frustrating.  Talon and Rengar don't really have a comparable escape... or any escape at all sometimes.  They can just click to run away.  If Talon didn't use his ult to go in, he can use it to stealth.... that's about it.\n\nHell, I thought Zed was better back when his ult put a shadow beside his target instead of leaving an escape route.  Sure, it gave him more burst on his ult, but not having that safety net made his all-ins more punishing if he fucked up.  No idea why Riot changed him, but it's a large part of the reason people find him frustrating.  You have to build specifically to counter him or he'll bone you (which isn't an build against the rest of his team at times) and you know how people hate altering theri cookie-cutter builds.  Even if you build against him it just prevents death... doing nothing to let you kill HIM in return.  People hate Fizz too for the same damned reason.  He's super safe and mobile and frustrating.\n\nAll of that said... I DO think Rengar and Talon are bigger problems.  But then, any champ that snowballs off kills and is really hard to keep at bay would be.  Why the hell did Rengar need a free cleanse, Riot?  What the hell were you thinking?!  \"CC and kill the assassin when he dives\" is the way you are supposed to stop them and protect your carry.  There is no saving a squishy from Rengar. EVER.

I'd imagine Faker knows Nidalee's clear speeds, %s and about how much damage she can do at any given breakpoint.

Aside from that, she's only a quarter, no, not EVEN a quarter of what Taliyah's difficulty is.\n\nSome players display Zed as a god-tier difficulty assassin and completely forget that unlike Rengar and Talon, he has a get out of jail card, namely his ultimate. If Talon jumps over a wall to grab a kill and fails, he dies. If Rengar hops into the enemy line, the only hope he has is that they don't murder him before he flashes out. Zed? Ult, teleport from shadow to shadow, cya.","replies":[{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2017-04-14T13:43:21.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly!

He has multiple instant escape mechanisms, EXTREMELY high base stats and is manaless. Even Talon and Annie have none of these.\n\nPersonally, if I were going to nerf Zed, I'd chunk his base MS by about 10 points and reduce his base armor by 5. Make him vulnerable during laning and force him to rely on his shadows for repositiong rather than having jacked up movement speed for no discernable reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Anhartamin","date":"2017-04-14T15:02:49.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2017-04-14T15:21:17.615+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Anhartamin,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PMNFfx3t,comment-id=00380000,timestamp=2017-04-14T15:02:49.115+0000)\n>\n> Zeds laning is pretty weak\n\nHe has extremely high base stats, a safe last hit with shuriken/contempt for the weak and wave clear/poke with shadow.\n\nHe is also manaless... please explain how this is \"weak\", if by \"weak\" you mean \"not able to kill as easily as post-6\" then maybe, but weak in general? or vulnerable if you will? absolutely not.\n\n>Punish him when it&#x27;s down and harass him super hard with Autos and spells. \n\nYou do realize Zed will just backoff after wave-clearing with shadow, right? or if he doesn't want to waste shadow he'll just last hit with shuriken.... or fuck it, just let you push and very easily last hit under turret with contempt for the weak.\n\nUnlike Ahri, Zed has  a LOT of options during laning, which range from insanely safe to very aggressive. His ultra high base stats and manaless abilities allow him this.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
