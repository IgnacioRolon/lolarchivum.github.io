The reason most Jedi could not handle Grievous in lightsaber combat was because not only was he proficient in a style that trumped the traditional Shii-Cho's hack-and-slash sweeping style. Makashi was made explicitly to be a full offensive style with little to no defense, and to be strong against single opponents wielding lightsabers and the force. Adding the multiple lightsabers and his brute strength, Grievous could easily disarm and crush your skull effortlessly even if you were a Jedi Master.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2016-01-10T20:30:51.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And this my friends is why I have two birds I want Lucas to see for what he did to Grievous in the movie.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-01-10T23:54:59.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, Grievous was outmatched by Obi-Wan.
