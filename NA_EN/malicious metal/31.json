We had the Marksmanupdate 2 Years ago and the urgot update recently: Why is Urgot now classified as a Fighter with Jayce while Graves is still a Marksman? Sure, Graves builds a little bit more Damage, but he builds far more tanky as other adcs (or Jayce some times), goes not realy crit like most adcs and has a realy low range. Only 75 range more as Urgot but same time 75 less range as Lucian or Jayce Canon Form, but Graves autos need to recharge and can be blocked.\nWhy is Teemo a Marksman while Kennen is a Mage and Kayle is a Fighter? Teemo could be also a Mage or Assassin. At least on Kog'maw the main intended Build should be onhit and the Ap mid build is more of a secodnary one, but on Teemo and Kennen Riot seems more to like the community building ap on them. Exceptio is Onhit teemo being played high elo and onhit Kennen was played realy much recently, even in the LCS.  \nIn my opinion either Urgot should be in the Marksman class as well as Kennen or Teemo and Graves should not be there. Probably secondary. Cause while Jayce and Kayle have Melee Forms (Kayle rework without it maybe ;) Urgot and Graves are full range. So its ofc odd to have them on Fighter. But with their Lowrange having them on Marksman is neither strange. But how it actualy is, Graves Marksman and Urgot/Jayce Fighter, is the worst clasification i can imagine.
