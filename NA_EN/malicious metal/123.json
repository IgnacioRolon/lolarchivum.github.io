I wouldn't say it myself because downvotes from MM fans but fck it - several last posts were just cringy and hypocritical.\n\nMeddler mentoins some possible changes on Rylais they were just talking about. No final words, no iteration on PBE, nothing. And he went all tantrum and wrote 10 posts of what he'd call \"objective criticism and sparkling reasonable discussion\"\". Then he wrote topic about how we should not get scared by pre-season changes? Iterations that are already at PBE? From soneone who wrote 10 posts about mentoining of possible change?\n\nNow he dares to write that Assasin mains should not write hateposts? But rather give obejctive discussion? So assasin mains need MM certificate whether they are not writing hatepost but \"objective criticism and sparkling reasonable discussion\" like him. As long as you are not blessed by MM and his fanparade, it's just hatepost and you are biased. Not like him. Who would be happy If Morde used one ability from distance, permaslow you, get to you and delete you with two AAs from Q because Juggernaut.\n\nThen this:\n> Can you guys just appreciate what you're given and provide real feedback?\nAt least EVERY SINGLE ONE of these updates look great while stuff like the Juggernaut patch left some of the champs off worse than before and didn't get as much attention and love as the assassins.\n\nBasically Shut up, it looks great because I think it does. It gets much love because I think it gives. Juggernauts were hurt because I think they were. My posts about how Juggernauts were insatisfying are valid, unbiased and \"real feedback\". Anyting you write is being ungrateful.\n\nAnd the irony is I hate Assasins, I think this patch will give them tools they don't deserve (another AD+MR item with anti-disengage and anti-disrupt active fitting tanks more) and some of them will have broken aspect to them. Katarina is the only one looking pretty nerfed because she gets both delay and telegraph of her actions. But I am not sure If I'd like to write Assasins mains you are getting all the love possible while my Vel'Koz got only hurt (because he didn't).\n\nNow that I got this off my chest, let the downvotes commence.\n\nEDIT: Plus the argument here twice - he's Malicious Metal, of course he'll talk about Morde.
