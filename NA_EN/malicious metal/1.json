They had all been men once too, but now, so consumed by the true spirit, they had passed beyond what the normal animals looked like. The largest of them, a huge bear-like thing, lumbered out of the forest—where its head should have been, a decayed elk’s skull rested on a mane of black feathers. Eyes glowing with blue fire, it opened its jaws to reveal a child’s face inside its maw. Then the child opened its own mouth too, spewing a foul brown liquid. Other nightmares followed it from the woods, limping, crawling, and shambling forward.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In the forest behind Najak, the great black-leaf trees cracked and shook. Taller than a mammoth, it stepped out of the woods. Walls of muscle, each limb larger than a man, propelled the beast forward. Its broken, ancient armor of dark, metal plates was caked brown by the dried gore of a hundreds of battles. Broken weapons, rusted with age, jutted from its back and shoulders. One half of its face had been stripped of flesh, revealing oily bone, teeth, and horns. From its mouth, an unnatural, black blood dripped. Its four eyes, impossibly ancient, alien, and pitiless, looked over Sejuani and Udyr.\"\r\n\"Udyr climbed up the rubble of a stairway to a ruined square. Surrounded by tall stone buildings, he found the monster waiting for him. Alone and in the middle of the city, the bear spirit’s avatar impaled corpses on stakes arranged in some unknowable pattern. Black branches and roots grew from the speared bodies around the beast, like worms slowly crawling from the earth. The flesh and fur on the Volibear’s face had healed, it’s muscles seemed thicker, stronger than before.\r\nThe Volibear’s eyes turned to Udyr as the shaman approached. Across its face, a dozen new eyes bloomed, each as dark and cold as a spider’s. Perhaps it smelled the foreign magic on the Winter’s Claw shaman, and now deemed him worthy of examination. Somehow Udyr knew, this time, it spoke to him alone.\r\n“I will be reborn. You cannot stop that, son of man,” the beast said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Udyr wasn’t afraid of the fight he would inevitably have with this creature. He wasn’t afraid of anything. His head was clear. And in this certainty… he knew those were bad signs. The Volibear would consume him as readily as Sejuani. But his resolve did not falter. He had sworn an oath to protect Sejuani, as a father would. No matter the cost.\r\n“You will not take her,” Udyr spat.\r\nSilence was the only answer the beast gave as it turned back to its gruesome task.\"","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2019-02-20T00:33:26.093+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thank you so much.

By making Volibear into an eldritch deity, they can make the walking, talking bears more consistent with the world (since Vastaya seem to have more human traits overall besides Rengar) while creating an interesting and horrifying force within the Freljord. It also kinda ties into an interesting theme around the Freljord lately, where many characters from the location seem to be introduced as almost fairy tales come to life. Braum teaches kids about heroics, Ornn is a stern god figure, and Volibear is the horror behind the things that go bump in the night, the strange figures you see in the woods. Basically, he's almost like a physical manifestation of scary stories that could be told by mountain tribes. Stories of huge beasts, stories of corrupted humans, stories about creatures that just never die. He's a nightmare given flesh, a somewhat cooler concept than polar bear that shoots lightning, at least in my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2019-02-20T01:48:05.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, sorry to post this comment here, but I couldn't reach the original one in the other thread.\n\nI can't disclose the full essay or give names; even though I'm not presently involved in academia, giving out a students work is a big no-no, and I'd rather that not come back to bite me in the ass. However, I can give you the gist of it, which covered the experiences of a woman who survived an armed assault from October, 2006.\n\n_Attempted murder is impossible to condone given the physical consequences of its enactment. It alters a victims mental stability, oscillating between extremes; a scar that diminishes, but never truly fades.

I'm not against league incorporating darker elements into it's story, but I do wish that our bear didn't have to die in the process. I would've loved to have seen a new champion take on the role of corrupted avatar of darkness.\n\nThe worst part about is that Volibear is not a popular champion by any means. If this were a more popular character like Ahri, I doubt riot would feel quite as inclined to make such a drastic 180 with the character. There simply won't be enough people speaking up about the change to convince Riot to make a change that stays more faithful to the character's original story. \n\nEven some of the more criticized reworks, like Galio and Kayle at least keep a good part of what made the champion what they were. Galio is still, at his core, a guardian. Kayle is still an embodiment of righteousness and justice. \n\nPrevious Voli was a positive figure. He was a wise leader of his people. This version of Volibear shares nothing with his previous incarnation other than a name. He's a savage, almost cartoonishly brutal boogyman of sorts. He's the monster you warn your children about to convince them not to wonder out alone at night.  \n\nAgain, nothing against the concept. It's a genuinely cool story, but why use Volibear to fill this role? Why not a new champion all together? \nAll I can ask of Riot is that, if you do decide to rework Voli, try to keep the rework more faithful to what he is now. If Voli is going to be a more antagonistic figure, then I'd rather see him as an antagonist with his own set of values for what he wants the freijord to be. \n\nThis has been one Volibear main's rant.
