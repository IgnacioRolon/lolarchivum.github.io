I know it was very toxic in conjunction with his endless E harass filling it quickly against minions so how about upping the damage conversion back to 30% while only making it a THIRD against minions.\nA buff for this iconic ability (Always shield, never die) as well as toning down his lane bully presence.\n\nMetal! Yes, this is more of a visual nitpick but being the Master of Metal comes with certain...Expectations. How about giving his abilities a bit more UMF in terms of VFX. Dig the Q sfx though, really crisp.\n\nAll in all I'm positive Mordekaiser could potentially be tweaked in order to please everybody by giving him access to solo laning but opening him up for duo. Heck, who wouldn't love being able to play their main in all the lanes?\n\nBut yeah, it all boils down to tweaking his W  bit since it inhibits him from being viable solo.\nHis waveclear would be returend to him BUT less of up-front like pre-rework and his bully nature has already been taken care off so I don't see any harm being done giving him his W. It was such a great feeling putting your old Creeping death on you and mentally going all \"Bring it on!\"\n\nAnyways. I can't express how grateful I, no, WE are for you to have the courage to break the barrier of distrust and ill-will that has been festering in the Metal hearts and tackle the problem :D\nMuch appreciated, If you're attending worlds I hope I'll get to thank you personally given the circumstances.\n\nHUE!\n\nMalicious Metal!","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-09-24T00:27:21.288+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hi Malicious, I'll try to answer some of this stuff to the best of my ability.

You see your 800 shield strength but won'r be able to fill it as easily since Morde has lost quite a bit of AoE damage and he won't build as much AP as before, making stacking the shield somewhat difficult.\nIt WAS toxic before though, when one E could fill it to the brim while simultaneously poking your opponent and obliterating minion waves.\nThis bully behavior wasn't really fair and by shifting Champion/Minion rates a bit we could make him really feel like Iron man again without making him return to his unhealthy roots.\n\n\nNo worries about the VFX, Morde's in need of a visual update so I expect you to do a better job the next time you revisit his visuals. A little note saying \"MORE METAL\" posted at the Visual update team's desk might just be enough :)\n\n\nWell, there was ONE benefit to allowing Mordekaiser to go duo.

Before, when you were in a lane vs a very long ranged opponent, you could sort of shield off their poke enough that you could maneuver them around in a position for a good Siphon.

He was simple, but i had fun.\n\n\nThe removal of the metal effects just sucks though. He isnt the Master of Metal anymore...they gave him the standard Shadow Isles effects. Yay for spooky green!
