Except for his Q. That bad boy can easily destroy turrets and champions after 3 consecutive hits. Get a slow item and your set. (They can't get away, because even flashes don't stop his E.)\n\nPeople love to abuse things that are powerful and his Q is one of them. Able to give bonus damage for each attack, the total damage is 260 + 360% AD + 260% AP in bonus damage (unlike most other three hit spells). True it costs health (that bonus health can over look) and has a cool down but it makes it even scarier to get close.\n\nNow, not that I don't like his new passive (it is fantastic and makes his tank that more better) but if he is going duo one of his abilities needs to go back to its original and that's his passive or his W. Why his W? When in duo (especially when with a healer) it makes him harder to kill since he builds a healing item and has this spell (and can be healed by the support). His W honestly should be a one cast spell. Cast on one person to give bonus MS and a small heal (more heal if near enemies and way more heal if it hits a champion) for and after 3 seconds. Or it can still give to both but has a longer cool down to stop the constant heals. (Or just revert it.)\n\nI would love for some of the damage from his Q to go to his E.
