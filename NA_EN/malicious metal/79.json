Lack of Mordekaiser mains in plat+**\r\nChampion.gg only includes stats from platinum and above and as far as I know high elo lacks serious Mordekaiser mains who dedicate enough time to learn the ins and outs of League&#039;s Iron Man.\r\nA lack of experience and proper champion mastery might just be the biggest factor for Mordekaiser having such an abysmally low win rate currently.\r\n\r\nThis is just something that bothers me greatly, seeing that Morde&#039;s slowly becoming a real Joke and the lobbies who flame me for picking Mordekaiser get more common by the day.\r\n\r\nIn the end I think Mordekaiser&#039;s win rate doesn&#039;t reflect his power level as it currently stands and might even lead riot to do something rash and result in Mordekaiser becoming way too strong and get trashed in the process.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneakyy XD","date":"2016-02-05T22:20:44.026+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":22,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Malicious Metal,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aWnoNqQg,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-02-05T22:17:54.000+0000)\n> In the end I think Mordekaiser&#039;s win rate doesn&#039;t reflect his power level\n\nNo champion's win rate reflects its power level.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-02-05T22:27:18.954+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"Win rates around the 40% or 60% mark do indicate if a champion's either OP or Up though","replies":[{"poster":"Sneakyy XD","date":"2016-02-05T22:29:16.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":24,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Malicious Metal,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aWnoNqQg,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-02-05T22:27:18.954+0000)\n>\n> Win rates around the 40% or 60% mark do indicate if a champion's either OP or Up though\n\nNo, they indicate how often different champions win.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2016-02-05T23:30:09.489+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be reasonable to conclude that high (or low) win rates have some correlation to the champion having more (or less) power than the others.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Edge of Daybreak","date":"2016-02-06T01:44:52.237+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Malicious Metal,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aWnoNqQg,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-02-05T22:27:18.954+0000)\n>\n> Win rates around the 40% or 60% mark do indicate if a champion's either OP or Up though\n\nBruh you know you are too well liked when you get upvoted for stating winrate shows a relative level of power on Gameplay.

He has the least mobillity one can have, he has no cc, and early on he's fairly squishy.\nAnd even if he survives lane, the pay off isn't really there. Once you opponents are decent at chaining cc and focusing a target, you can't affort to built squishy. You need rylais into 2-4 straight tank items to do anything in a teamfight, and that causes your damage to fall flat, as you rarly will make you way past the frontline, and you lack the magic-pen to really do that much to the frontline. And often enough, you will just eat some CC and everyone will get out of range as soon as your 3ed Q is ready, and 2sec later when it's expired you just get ignored once again.\nNot even the ult is much of a saveing grace, as carries will get QSS as 3ed item. If he somehow manages to get a carryghost or a dragon ghost after a won fight, then chances are good that he will take alot objectives and snowball from there. But if that doesn't happen, he's pretty weak vs good opponents.\n\nThe only exeption to that i have seen so far is a morde with good suport, like a midlane lulu, as that allows him to built more agressive and still become a die hard while also beeing way harder to kite with the speedbuff.\nThough lulu is a beast in many combinations, a darius or garen with lulu sup is just as scarry, and fnatic showed today how powerfull an adc with lulu can be...","replies":[]},{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2016-02-05T23:42:13.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this theory.

Instead they focus on pushing tower objectives and punishing teams that take time out of lane for worthless dragon buffs. Except then there's Morde. Free dragons = free tower pushing power to a ridiculous degree. If you play a comp that allows you free reign on the dragon you'll basically win bot lane outright unless you completely screw up. It would be cool to see some team take a chance and try to abuse this lack of dragon control by using a champ that can really make use of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gypsyleeboy","date":"2016-02-06T07:20:14.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"too many people who try him for the first time and hate him cause they know how to to play him.\n\nNot enough pro's interested in playing him anymore cause of all the new champ/meta champ hype's\n\n#truetalk","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raid Boss Morde","date":"2016-02-06T07:03:56.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in Plat+ and I am indeed a Mordekaiser main ;-;","replies":[]},{"poster":"hi im minty","date":"2016-02-06T04:58:50.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really liked that you took the time to explain this.
