E feels like a waste to put points in, as it has horrible scaling, and the shield generation is the same at all levels, so its been turned into a 1 point wonder.

Here's what I've wanted to change on Morde:\n\nPassive: change around, but slight net raise in health costs. Shield generation doesn't fall off and becomes a heal at full (similar to tryndamere, but with abilities and automatic). Full health = ability to get full shield. Full spam = always shield never die, hue.\n\nW :  Passive that gives small AOE damage around Morde. Active put on self and one ally, buffs damage, and steals armor/mr/ms from all enemies hit (reduced by X amount per enemy after 1) passive lost while on cd.\n\nE : Rains shards of metal over an area, dealing a 15% slow, but slow and damage increase over time while in the area. \n\nR : Dragon Force gone, un-cleansable, and make it so damage from enemy champions is increased by 5/10/15% while debuffed.","replies":[{"poster":"Jotunheimr","date":"2015-09-22T10:03:11.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your ideas.\n\nThrowing another out there for:\nW: Upon deactivating w, Mordekaiser charges a sphere of dark and magnetic energy, and reactivation damage does scaling bonus magic damage reletive to how soon you deactivated w.\n\nE: that is perfect right there.

Other than that there are a few reasons I made the abilities the way they are.\n\nPassive: The idea is to give him a heal with counterplay. Poke him or all in him hard enough, he won't get shield and will only hurt himself more and more. Don't bother to touch him/touch him enough and he'll be like vlad who'll sustain through anything you throw. \n\nW: This is to encourage 2 things. To get in the middle of a fight and to offer late game scaling without buying penetration items. If it's pure damage it won't be effective enough without items to back it up (part of the reason current morde falls off later on).\n\nE: Current E is one of the bigger reasons Morde is hard to balance, there's little counterplay to it. If you're in range and cant become untargetable, its going to damage you, no excuses. It needs to be completely revamped into something new. What I proposed will add counterplay in the form of an ability that can be relatively ignored unless you stand still. The best way to get maximum effect from this is to have initiation or quick follow up from another player (see Riot, SUBTLE HINTS FOR TEAMWORK INSTEAD OF BLATANT HANDCUFFING!) While I understand the reasons you want him to lack CC or mobility, this is a giant creative handicap...\n\nDesigner A: Dude, check it out! I thought of an ability that, when mixed in with his other moves, solves all of this champions problems!\n\nDesigner B: Ok cool, let me see! *reads through* whoa whoa whoa! There's CC in here! you know how our playerbase feels about crowd control being on this guy! change it.\n\nDesigner A: Well, without the CC the ability kind of doesn't work...\n\nDesigner B: Then scrap it, if we added it in it'll cause an uproar. MOAR DEMAGEZ!!!!!\n\nl:T\n\nR: I agree that Dragon Force really fits Morde and is really powerful. Sadly though, its situational, and a bit gimmicky. If the ability was too good, they'd have to either nerf that aspect of his kit to be horrible (and there'd be no point to it if it was) or nerf the entirety of his kit so all his power was wrapped up in that one aspect, which is even worse. Balance-wise, it's horrible for him.\n\nI hope I made some valid points. If you think I'm off on anything feel free to say. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Jotunheimr","date":"2015-09-22T18:00:56.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The w is toggle effect is for a greater heal from reactivation damage. Basically, you choose between immediate over time damage, or greater burst damage with a heal. The more you charged up, the better your heal. This can be used in a tight spot to heal up when close to lethal health. That way you can play around with when to use your heal, and how strong it is. Choose for yourself, more damage over time or a stalled, but much bigger heal?\n\nGood point about dragonForce. It is potentialy bad for balance because its so siuational. I'm on par with that. I could sacrifice dragon ghost for a first person Morde buff to his immediate kit.\n\nAlthough they do need to buff the shield first.

I always thought it was off that his abilities did so much, yet his giant fucking mace only had windows of power instead of hurting all the time because IT'S A GIANT FUCKING MACE (morning star technically). I don't believe you should get talked down to for building certain items first over others, its not their job to choose what you build anyways, but I think some hybrid scaling should be there. However, it should be switched around some on his abilities so the one's that should be meaningful and scale are done so with numbers put into both sides, and the ones that are meant for utility are buffed from the AP.

Because of Deathcap, the amount of damage you can get on Q from AP items is actually pretty compareable to what you can get from AD items since there is far less AD per slot.
