His identity is as a mage ADC essentially since his soldiers provide zones of consistent damage that are able to shred through people based on his AS, he only needs Rylai's for two main purposes and that's so his soldiers can get a decent number of attacks off after he moves them because his W range is pitiful, and their attack radius was already nerfed so its harder to land a good number of stabs post Q, which the slow allows for. The other reason is that even though Q is on a low CD in many team fight situations his damage (his soldiers) are very easy to kite around, ADCs which are his closest competition for consistent damage are able to relocate and adjust their threat area between every shot vs Azir who has to wait on a 2-3 second CD to continue to be relevant in a fight. To top it all off Riot nerfed his main defensive tool and designed his other one to be near useless against hard engage. His E hitbox is super glitchy such that u can be stopped from dashing by someone totally opposite the direction u were aiming due to hit box overlap, preventing u from escaping from that Akali or any other hard engage champion capable of soloing him. His R now has less than half the duration it used to as well preventing it from serving as an effective buffer zone to allow him to self peel and kill hard engage champions with burst before they can get to him (Akali being the example again), even pre-nerf it wasn't that strong as champions like Zed, Fizz or anyone with flash up  could also circumvent it's safety to kill him. \n\nAs far as I'm concerned Azir is much less irritating to play against than a Lux since she throws out her stupid giant Es from a mile away and chunks your whole team for 500 damage a cast, and if you get caught in her snare mid-late game you better have a ton of MR or a GA up cuz you're about to be dead in under 2 seconds","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2016-10-10T04:12:51.982+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"If I were to rework him it would be to change how his Q works and give him an entirely new E. His Q should have a much lower cooldown and much lower damage, it should be all about repositioning his soldiers to keep up with people, not be part of his poke. \n\nHis E should not be a movement ability, the main weakness he should have is being jumped on, managing his soldiers correctly should be where his skill comes from, not jumping around like an idiot. \nAs for what it could be replaced with, there could be many ideas but how about this for a first one. What if they made his W like TF's W? Make it so he can pick between two different soldiers to summon? A spear soldier and a shield soldier for instance and have his Q manipulate his spear soldier and his E manipulate his shield soldier, have the shield soldier be impassable and block skillshots but have it be pretty small so that he has to clump a couple together to make something substantial or he could strew them out in various spots across the battle field to make skillshots harder to land. \n\nThis is JUST an idea, might be good, might be horrible, but it's an example of how you could change his kit and still retain, or even enhance, his theme.","replies":[{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2016-10-11T14:28:49.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd just shift the W passive AS to his Q.
