Jax's pride and joy is to mess up any and all auto attack based attacks. If i maxed my Q, i would do next to no damage to the jax because he will just dodge it all and stun me and it will be wasted...... However maxing E and W (i normally max E unless vs someone like Riven or Fiora, in which case W or Q to me seems better) results in you beating the jax a lot easier. The jax was actually surprised I even knew that he dodges all auto based attacks......\n\nThat aside, yes Morde APC or support should do quite well. Something that i am going to be testing soon is having spell vamp quints for him to help his obsurd sustain..... Although using the exp quints would result in me getting level 2 off the first wave of minions (if he starts W and does not miss any minions) which is a HUGE advantage in bottom lane especially. Been testing that out a bit as well in top or mid.\n\nIf played right I have gotten almost solo pentakills easily with him. Actually the two games that got me the S ranks for him i got a penta each time. In top lane, depending on how good the enemy top laner is i normally get my tower by minute 8-10 and start pushing on to the 2nd. By this time the enemy team often sends their mid laner and jungler after me so it helps if my mid laner actually pings..... But even then it can often end with a double or triple kill for me.","replies":[]}]}
