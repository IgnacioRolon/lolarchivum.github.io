I play him for the theme of a big badass undying juggernaut and warlord. You guys put a lot of effort into the game, even though you get shit for it a lot of the time. Can you give our big metal boy a rework with the power of a thousand dying stars? I'm really hoping for spooky thematic music honestly, that lasts all game. Just don't overload him, I'd like him to not be banned all the time. And please, learn from EA and Bethesda, just don't bring politics into the game and don't be _too _ greedy, it's pretty anti-consumer. I want you guys and Riot as a whole to do well, and I want this game to do well.
