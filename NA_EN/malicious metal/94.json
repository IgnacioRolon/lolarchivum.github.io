Back in that day, they called it \"the Renekton bar\". They decided that even though Renekton was dominating top lane, they thought he was in a good place for the game overall. So instead of following their normal strategy of nerfing the outlier (renekton), they decided to buff other top laners so that they'd have a chance of surviving Renek's laning phase.\n\nNow, replace \"Renekton\" above with \"Old poppy\", \"Old Sion\", \"(old/live) warwick\", or \"Urgot\".

Darius does well because he counters, HARD, anyone who can't dodge his Q reliably. Also, he snowballs very hard, being able to nearly 100-0 squishies when ahead , and having engage tied to hard CC, as well as a slow. Then he falls off once he meets an ADC with peel, but he should've gotten his mid fed by now, maybe just by flash + E + full mage combo + auto + W + Q + R.\n\nAlso, he does the best when behind, due to his grab pulling people into tower range. It's like Blitz's grab before they changed it to pull people in front of him instead of into him. Although you end up in front of Darius, he kinda pulls you to him, and then you bounce off.

(Just in general mages, not just LoL mages). So if you are failing as a mage it means you are doing less damage, and if you're succeeding you're doing lots of damage. This is easy(er) to balance because you just have to balance around how much damage they do, how fast they do it, and how easy it is to do it.\n\nWith a diver your success vs fail looks really difference. A successful diver can run past all their defenses and kill them despite trying to run away or hide under a turret, which feels awful as the player under the turret. \"Even though I caitlyn trapped him, used both summoners, thresh flayed him away, and I cleared the whole wave so he had turret-aggro the whole time, the hecarim still ran through everything killed me and got away with 80% health. No fun for the target.\n\nOn the flip side a failing diver is essentially useless because you are going to use all of your cool mobility tricks to get to their carry, and then just get cc'd and die without doing anything.\n\nThe difference between our hypothetical mage and our hypothetical diver is that a semi-successful mage still has a purpose, whereas a semi-succesful divers purpose becomes \"I am not actually doing at all what I'm supposed to so now I guess I build tank and just be a less good tank?\".\n\nThe fact that there is no neutral outcome for a diver is the main issue here.
