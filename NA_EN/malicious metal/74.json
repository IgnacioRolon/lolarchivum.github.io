He&#039;s a modern Juggernaut and his VGU team did a great job trying to build him up to fit that version of the split pushing zombie-army juggernaut.\r\nAnd what&#039;s better, most of his skills feel extremely heavy without feeling clunky!\r\n\r\n{{champion:44}} \r\nBy far my favorite support.\r\nBut that&#039;s beside the point.\r\nTaric is a great example of how you can give an outdated kit a new spin, as his W, Bastion, gives him a ton more skill expression beyond just spamming spells whenever they&#039;re up. It adds a new layer to him but functionally he&#039;s still very much the old Taric.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you&#039;ve found the common theme here.\r\nThis VGU pod just nails down **Heavy**, **Satisfying** and **Thematic appeal** while also making champions better than their old selves by adding new mechanics and layers to them that boost their skill expression more than their old versions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake a look at the other pod.\r\n{{champion:19}} {{champion:6}}  Are GREAT, yet they do not carry the **OOOMPH** factor of the other reworks. They&#039;re thematic successes and feel a lot like their old selves, which isn&#039;t what Mordekaiser needs.\r\n\r\nMordekaiser needs to be given more ways of skill expression as well as delivering on all the hype surrounding him, making him satisfying to play while also making him heavy and metal in the process.\r\nThis is why I believe that Eve&#039;s rework team would be better suited to tackle Mordekaiser than Warwick&#039;s as Mordekaiser doesn&#039;t seem to be the kind of champion that would benefit from that team&#039;s approach.\r\n\r\nBut those are just my two cents.\r\nhttps://pre00.deviantart.net/42a1/th/pre/i/2017/214/e/b/mordekaiser___the_iron_revenant_by_waza_art-dbilfr3.png","replies":[{"poster":"Blakiepug","date":"2017-08-22T02:06:48.842+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":3,"body":"I would strongly disagree.

I will freely admit that I'm one of the people who severely dislike his new iteration, from both a character and gameplay perspective, but just to touch upon the latter I think his new kit abandoned a playstyle that had a lot going for it, ditching the idea of a tank that was low on CC and mobility, but high on ally utility, and instead going for yet another hypermobile, CC-heavy bruiser-alike with 2 dashes and 3 AoE hard disables. To draw a comparison, this is about the same kind of fundamental alteration to a champion's identity as when Mordekaiser was turned into a duo lane carry, only Galio's update had enough resources to look finished.\n\nGoing a little bit more on Morde, I'm sure he'd feel much more impactful, fun and satisfying to many players if he received a bunch of dashes and knockups, and who knows, that might even make him significantly more popular and easier to balance as well. However, none of that is at all part of his core identity right now, and I'm pretty sure you would agree that if that was the direction taken for his VGU, it would not feel correct. Going further along this line of reasoning, if Mordekaiser were retconned into being a morally grey character like the Ruined King or whatever, that would similarly feel wrong, because one of his defining characteristics is that he is clearly evil. This is how a lot of players felt when Galio was turned from an intelligent, observant and brooding character into what is essentially a very large toddler.\n\nAt this point, I feel it's not actually all that difficult to make a champion feel fun, ignoring everything else. Dashes are fun, burst damage is fun, big AoE knockups are fun, at least for the player accessing all of these. Stringing them together on the same kit may not be all that original (and, let's face it, almost every single one of Galio's new abilities looks very similar to a previous one, such as his W active essentially being Warwick's E), but it will certainly feel fun, have an \"oomph\" factor and everything. There's definitely a large contribution from animations, visuals and sound to make the whole thing come together, but from a pure gameplay perspective, it's a known fact now that certain effects feel reliably fun to use. Because of this, I think evaluating a champion simply on the basis of their kit feeling fun or satisfying is not enough. Going back to the pillars of successful champion design Riot talked about a while back, fun is only one part of the whole thing, and it's important to consider how the champion delivers on all sides. Galio definitely gets good marks for fun and skill expression, and is mostly fair, but when it comes to having a resonant theme and uniqueness, I feel there's been a loss relative to his old self.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-08-22T10:36:59.914+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"I disagree with a few of your points, mainly on the aspect that Galio before was an absolute mess of a champion with varied themes frankenstein'd into a kit. You say his theme should've been focused on Team-based utility, yet his original kit had a single ally focused spell, and even then, was selfish in nature as it was used to heal himself. \n\nMeanwhile, his other close to Utility spell is still selfish in it's use, with only a side benefit for allies. His Wind-speed thing was only used to help himself get into position, not the other way around. Even then, it still carried enough damage for it to be mainly used as a Damage spell in his rotation, more than utility. \n\nLastly, he's confused in what he wants to be in the first place. His Q being a heavy nuke and slow, similar to a mage, yet his Ult drawing focus, like a Tank, and then nuking them again like a mage? Meanwhile, he's meant to be anti-mage, but has something that punishes Auto-attackers? It's confusing, and doesn't make sense for a character whose meant to be a guardian. \n\n{{champion:3}}  \"I protect things! By blowing them up! Violently.\" \n\nSo we have a problem with Theme and Gameplay, which forces them to settle it down to what aspect of Galio do they want to focus on. Lux's lore, and Demacia's stance on Magic, seemed perfect to go alongside someone who was meant to be an Anti-mage, since that was one of the things Riot originally labeled him as. Not a Team-utility tank, not a Burst mage, but the Anti-mage champion, similar to Kassadin, but more Mage/Tank like. \n\nFrom there, it's easy to see where they focused their efforts in giving Galio new abilities. Since people wanted Galio to compete with mid, he was given Wave clear that was good on Waves, and good in zoning and damage in a rotation with Q. Mages hate it when people get on top of them, and most tanks have mobility regardless, so gap closer with CC. A Taunt with magic damage shield is better against mages who have weak autos, than an ADC. \n\nNow the big question is Theme and feeling. Old Galio was observant, brooding, but...why? I get the fact of being sad and all, but having a character whose just sad and depressed **all the time** just hits a real extreme niche. You're having fun throwing blasts of magic at people, but your character is acting like he's at someone's funeral? It's a real collision in theme and gameplay. Imagine if Zed, instead of acting Ruthless and vicious, acted Shy and Placent. \n\nNo evil laugh when Ulting someone, no lines about the Shadows, he was just real reserved and quiet, acting like something that just doesn't fit how he's playing. A perfect fit with Sad-depressed Gameplay and Theme is Naut, who pulls it off really well. His abilities are slow and punishing, his animations heavy and large, it fits really well. But like players, when we do something that feels really good to do, those feelings aren't just mutual to us. The Character should be feeling the same. \n\nSo yeah, Galio is quite a bit happier than he used to be, because his abilities before-hand felt extremely fast and impactful, yet he was acting sad and mournful. When you back up to punch someone in the face, that's not just you feeling it, it's Galio feeling it. Notice, his saddest lines are when he isn't fighting, but walking around. He has nothing to distract himself from what will eventually come, and that's where sadness makes sense. \n\nIt makes a living character that feels like he belongs in a world. He's more than just Voice lines in a model, his mood shifts depending on what's happening. While fighting, he's excited and happy, but when battle fades, his true reality sets in, and you can hear it. There's depth in what he says, and he know it's coming. \n\nI read Galio's Judgement and past lore, but I really don't know how you can derive Intelligent being a key feature. Extremely devoted and loyal, and yes, brooding, but there isn't a lot to say he was an intellectual. He was made to serve, he got real depressed, and then was inspired to serve again. New Galio's time with Lux in the new lore shows many more sides to him, than just isn't \"I'm broody, mehhhhhh\". \n\nPoking back at Naut, he's broody and depressed, but most importantly, vengeful. He wants back at those who doomed him to the sea, he could even want back his original body. Hell, depending on the Black Mist, he may even show dedication to the common good by fighting off Shadow Isle creatures. His life, his family, all lost because some men cut him loose. There's room for interaction with other champions, character growth, Naut is a surprisingly well made champion with possibilities. \n\nThen finally, what on earth is a broody character's story meant to fulfill? His old motivation, and his now, was to serve Demacia to the best of his ability, but that leaves extremely little room for much else. Main characters are never brooding _alone_, those brooding characters are always resigned to Side characters. New Galio has more than Service as a motivation.\n\nHe wants to be alive! He wants to experience life, but the only times he gets to is when he has to kill the thing that's giving him life. It makes you wonder if he'd ever run away with Lux if he wanted/could, since it'd give him freedom to live without killing or fighting. A broody character whose only motivation is serving Demacia, runs out of possibilities really fast. \\\n\nWelp, that's my rant over. Sitting here at 3:22, waiting for my Que to pop. Main point is that Galio was not an easy character to keep aspects for, and I think Riot did the best for what they originally started with. To a degree, I can understand players disappointment, but I have to wonder just how much are some players disappointing themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-08-22T13:54:18.820+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dr Mercy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XOp1c7xx,comment-id=0000000000030001,timestamp=2017-08-22T10:36:59.914+0000)\n>\n> I disagree with a few of your points, mainly on the aspect that Galio before was an absolute mess of a champion with varied themes frankenstein&#x27;d into a kit.

I don't disagree that Galio's previous kit was dysfunctional, and I was very much looking forward to his rework. However, I do think him having damage is more justified than on other tanks, as he was a battle mage/warden hybrid who paid for it with less CC and mobility. Additionally, he always had the theme of empowering his damage through the enemy's magic.\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Dr Mercy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XOp1c7xx,comment-id=0000000000030001,timestamp=2017-08-22T10:36:59.914+0000)\n> \n> So we have a problem with Theme and Gameplay, which forces them to settle it down to what aspect of Galio do they want to focus on.

It's also worth mentioning that if you were to switch Galio's current MR scalings to armor, he would just as easily become an anti-AD champion, so his anti-mage identity isn't particularly intrinsic to his new playstyle either. Additionally, whereas Galio could previously derive power from his enemy's magic, via Bulwark's self-heal (it made him especially strong against DoT mages), he now can only block magic, so in terms of enforcing his anti-mage theme there's actually been somewhat of a regression from his previous iteration.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Dr Mercy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XOp1c7xx,comment-id=0000000000030001,timestamp=2017-08-22T10:36:59.914+0000)\n> \n> From there, it&#x27;s easy to see where they focused their efforts in giving Galio new abilities.

A Taunt with magic damage shield is better against mages who have weak autos, than an ADC.\n\nGalio previously also had rather decent wave clear, and the fact that his dash stops at the first enemy champion hit actually makes him more apt at disabling frontliners, i.e. fighters and other tanks, rather than mages (this is also compounded by the percent health damage on his Q, which is better against frontliners than mages). This is one of the reasons why players who pick melee champions often get frustrated with Galio, because in spite of his purported anti-mage identity, it's the front line that takes the brunt of his power. Galio's taunt is something that was part of his old kit as well, so I don't think it's reasonable to bring it up as if it were a new asset.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Dr Mercy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XOp1c7xx,comment-id=0000000000030001,timestamp=2017-08-22T10:36:59.914+0000)\n> \n> Now the big question is Theme and feeling.

It's not like we have negative-affective characters in the game either, as Lucian constantly mourns the death of his wife, Maokai laments the destruction of nature around him and his own corruption, and Yorick constantly fights the temptation to give in and abandon himself to the Black Mist. Developing upon a brooding, tactical character would make for something truly unique in League, whereas turning him into a punch-happy meathead puts him along the exact same lines as Malphite, Vi, Zac and so on. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Dr Mercy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XOp1c7xx,comment-id=0000000000030001,timestamp=2017-08-22T10:36:59.914+0000)\n> \n> No evil laugh when Ulting someone, no lines about the Shadows, he was just real reserved and quiet, acting like something that just doesn&#x27;t fit how he&#x27;s playing\n\nThe only reason such a personality would not fit the new Galio is because his new kit makes him constantly throw himself into battle. If he had been a slower, more back line-oriented tank, as was the case with his original kit, such a personality would've fit him much better. Adding to this, I think there's a pretty big amount of thematic dissonance between his current character, who's a colossal statue, and his gameplay, which lets him zip around like he's a much smaller fighter. Similarly, I think his character is inconsistent with his backstory, as Galio is a statue who's spent centuries, if not millenia observing the people around him, learning from his observations, and seeing countless people he cared about die, while being powerless to help them, yet he still turns out to be impatient, immature, and exceptionally poorly observant when allowed to move, to the point of endangering his allies just for the sake of wrestling with some other big creature. He is, in many ways, the exact opposite of what he should be, and it takes a pretty serious amount of mental gymnastics to try to reconcile the two.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Dr Mercy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XOp1c7xx,comment-id=0000000000030001,timestamp=2017-08-22T10:36:59.914+0000)\n> \n> I read Galio&#x27;s Judgement and past lore, but I really don&#x27;t know how you can derive Intelligent being a key feature.

That's a pretty unique kind of drive, and definitely allows room for interaction with others, particularly with other Demacian champions, as some may remember his greatest failure and may look at him differently for it. By contrast, the new Galio is purely motivated by wanting to squish mages, and has no narrative arc besides acting as a side character to one of Lux's stories. It does not make for a particularly deep character, and so far he has been written in such a way that all but a few characters are bound to not even acknowledge his existence.\n\n > [{quoted}](name=Dr Mercy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XOp1c7xx,comment-id=0000000000030001,timestamp=2017-08-22T10:36:59.914+0000)\n> \n> He wants to be alive!

The one story angle where he gets to do something is if a mage appears, and that is something that would have many more opportunities if he were consistently intelligent and could make the most of it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2017-08-22T05:40:55.321+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"you should write a thread about galio, cuz this is exactly how i felt but i didn't manage to combine all those words","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Golden Tager X","date":"2017-08-22T05:30:49.720+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Personal enjoyment =/= Good rework\n\nA good rework must stay as absolutely true to the old as it can possibly be whilst fixing the problems.\n\nThat Pod Has absolutely no plan on keeping it near the original, they scrap a champ and make a new one, lore and all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2017-08-22T14:08:22.319+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huge success.

If they so much as add horns or a tail to her like the teasers and texture leaks are suggesting, I don't think I can attach myself to that champion anymore as that's not what I want my eve to be. I liked my eve for her appearance and attitude (in a non-thirsty kind of way) and the fact she was this mysterious generic character without anything fancy done to her, as she just seems like a shadowy human assassin. Giving her tails, horns, limbs, whatever frankly is not how I'd want to envision one of my mains and I'd buy a traditional skin even if it looked exactly new eve's base minus those details. \n\nAs for your morde, you do you but what you're probably going to get is: A heavy metal champion that feels like what you want, but becomes either a balanced nightmare so nothing really changes aside from putting your champ in a worser off state, or you'll get a champion that's literally a chef Boyardee Can and resonates nothing like the old champion to you.
