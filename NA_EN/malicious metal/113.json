And auto-attack DPS scales WAY harder with gold than with experience - for most marksmen, base AD is barely doubled between level 1 and 18, whereas the AS gain from levels does not exceed 68%. Contrast abilities, whose base values are often tripled between rank 1 and rank 5.\n\nTo truely offer an alternative to marksmen in the bot lane, Riot needs to find a non-problematic way to make less XP-dependent mages. For example, they could revive Cass' old stacking passive - that was feeling odd on her kit back then, but was, at least in theory, a way to make a champion's strength scaling somewhat XP-independent.\nCurrent Cass did a 180° turn from that direction, though - the implementation of her MS/lvl passive made her more XP-dependent, and thus a worse bot laner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2017-06-27T03:16:59.659+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss the old super minions.\n\nThe giant claw hands were the best.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blades of Navori","date":"2017-06-26T22:57:25.144+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Matches do rely a lot on the ADC.
