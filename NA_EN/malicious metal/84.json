It is still in its early stages, but the foundations are already being laid for a complex hierarchy spanning across up to 3 club rooms (squadrons). We stay in our boards character in army chat (kind of like roleplaying and we will offer roleplaying for anyone who wants to join once I develop a section for that in discord). And we will have easy access to coaching and signing up for coaching. There shall also be internal competitions as well. I am not quite sure what these are yet, but the one idea I have been having so far is competitions every 2-3 weeks between squadrons. High levels could act as coaches but cannot compete for their squadron, unless we get enough high level ranking officers, in which case we can create a high level match. Most are bronze or silver atm though.\n\nAnd we accept everyone, new and veteran alike. I guess this is what shaco (aka aqualious) meant when I said it \"free[d] up some more space.\" Since it gives people an easier time to connect with everyone and be noticed.\n\nI was hoping LF would help in this endevear as an officer, which does require quite a bit of work to manage. The problem was that it would require him to reform a bit and drop his ego/God complex (god I hate using that wording, I don't want to be an asshole ;_;) but he wanted all the power then proceeded to insult me when I denied it. Then started insulting my supporters. \n\nAs much as it pained me to oppose he who gave me my king, I could not support he who hurt my people.","replies":[{"poster":"VoidStaresBack","date":"2016-07-13T15:40:54.056+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"As long as it doesn't involve me having to bash someone I don't have an opinion on either way other than their memes are funny, I'll join this \"army\", I approve of what it stands for.","replies":[{"poster":"Aír","date":"2016-07-13T15:44:11.749+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"*bows* \n\nThank you for your support.
