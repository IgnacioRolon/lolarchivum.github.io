Using their mobility will get them closer but rarely right to you. Once they use their mobility, by your logic, they're \"rooted (while slowed)\".\n> this causes champions without obscene amounts of mobility to be pushed out of the meta.\n\nThe melees without mobility are few and far between. Even less when you take out the beginner champions. After which the word \"obscene\" becomes arbitrary.\n> then why has the game seen less and less immobile picks since the mage rework and their play and winrates have been crashing into the ground?\n\nThat had nothing to do with it. Kayle, Karthus or Cassio had been dominating toplane ever since the Fiora nerfs.\n> claiming immobile champions are generally better splitpushers than mobile champions is rdiculous in the first place. champions with high mobility and duelling potential can usually splitpush better or just as good than slower champions.\n\nExcluding Trundle, I suppose but yeah, I kinda tunneled on him.\n> its not uncommon for assassins to start splitpushing by mid and lategame and looking for picks while roaming between lanes.\n\nAnd for beefy toplaners to laugh in their face ain't uncommon either.\n> EVERY top laner. mobile and immobile, which makes mobile picks still superior in the face of permaslows.\n\nMobility isn't a win button.
