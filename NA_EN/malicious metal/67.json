But you&#039;re unable to dodge, since it&#039;s your last game of promos.\nLoading into game you&#039;d come to notice something odd about the duo...\n\nThey&#039;re both running the rune &quot;Unsealed Spellbook&quot;...\nIntriguing...\n\nhttps://www2.pic-upload.de/img/34500197/unsealedmord3.jpg\n\nBut slowly you&#039;ll come to realize that these madmen do not just play this strat for shits and giggles.\nNo, there&#039;s a reason for this madness...\n\nhttps://www2.pic-upload.de/img/34500195/unsealedmord2.jpg\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/299493047899521024/392729633059110923/Bildschirmfoto_2017-12-19_um_18.27.04.png\n\n\nBoth of them seem to rush {{item:3711}} and after abusing the enemy Jungler, stealing their first two camps and maybe even killing the fool trying to stop them, they change their summoner spells to Ignite and Exhaust respectively, with Mordekaiser using GHOST later in the game for the improved mobility it provides...\n\n__________________\n\nBut why is this working you may ask...\nWell, here&#039;s where things get technical.\n\nMordekaiser bot lane does not farm and scale like a regular ADC, he prefers to dominate the opposition and end the game as fast as possible, giving the enemy no chance at turning around and get any advantage.\n\nWith Unsealed spell book and smite, Mordekaiser and his Support are going to starve out the enemy jungler out of Xp before building the one item that offers so much...For so little money.\nRunic Echoes does give Mordekaiser a ton of useful stats:\n-Movement speed; probably one of Mord&#039;s favorite stats since he wants to run down the enemy and be mobile in the midst of a fight\n-AP: Morde&#039;s primary offensive stat\n-More Burst: The Runic Proc gives Morde a lot of early damage to pop the enemy, nobody expects a Luden&#039;s proc this early in the game and it also gives him better clearing\n\nAnd of course:\nA LOT OF VISION CONTROL\n\nTogether with his Support, Morde won&#039;t need to invest into a Sightstone, but rather has all the wards he needs to stay safe in lane, snuff out the enemy Jungler, keep track of enemy movement and set up ambushes and skirmishes in their favor.\n\nUnsealed Spellbook in itself is already great on Morde since he can transition from using {{summoner:14}} for early game Snowballing to {{summoner:6}}  for late game mobility.\nEven something like {{summoner:1}} can be useful against certain champions.\n\nThe Inspiration+Sorcery combo also gives Mordekaiser a TON of AP as well as EXTENDED POTION DURATION, which helps his early game Hp costs with stronger pots.\nAnd here&#039;s the kicker, Unsealed Spellbook also REDUCES summoner spell cooldown, making Morde, who relies on Flash/Ghost so much even more of a threat since his spells are going to be up so much more often, especially IGNITE for early game power.\n\n\n______________\n\nAll in all this Strategy was one of the best things coming out from the new Rune system.\nIt offers a completely new play style that allows those with the Balls of Steel to try it to really BREAK the Meta and find new innovative ways to play the game.\nAnd it&#039;s not trolling by any stretch of the imagination as you&#039;re simply using all the tools Riot provided you with to really push the limits of how to destroy the opposition.\n\nBut that&#039;s for today&#039;s tale out of the Book of Heavy Metal.\nTune in next time when we&#039;ll go over everything you need to know to take Mordekaiser into Season 8 ranked!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig-79E6VD1c","replies":[{"poster":"xDingwithsalad","date":"2017-12-19T17:48:23.411+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":20,"body":"No offense, but this is kind of a shitpost","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2017-12-19T17:57:04.936+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'd classify 90% of Gameplay threads as shitposts.","replies":[{"poster":"Auz the Ripper","date":"2017-12-19T22:11:31.077+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"10% of gameplay not being shitposts is pretty generous.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-12-19T23:23:34.829+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"10% are misplaced memes.","replies":[{"poster":"The Lexer","date":"2017-12-20T21:08:53.246+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"which are just better shitposts","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-12-19T18:13:39.877+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not a shitpost at all.\n\nIt's a unique playstyle that works, and they are sharing it to give the rest of us inspiration to try new unsealed spellbook strategies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChompyWulf","date":"2017-12-20T19:44:54.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No offense, but your post is pure shitpost. \n\nAnyone who knows anything of the boards shouldn't doubt or insult Malicious Metal posting about Morde.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2017-12-19T21:38:54.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"WR in ranked though?","replies":[{"poster":"Faustavian","date":"2017-12-20T16:53:18.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well don't take this in ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2017-12-22T12:09:16.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is he's promoting this as a winning, viable strategy. \n\nIt's also malicious metal, so people are even more likely to eat it up.\n\nThe last time MM (on that account, could smurf idk) played smite morde was 3 days ago, after 2 consecutive losses.\n\nI don't think an entire post should be dedicated to promoting this strategy for ranked, and maybe even draft.","replies":[{"poster":"Faustavian","date":"2017-12-27T17:26:18.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do the same with Skarner support.
