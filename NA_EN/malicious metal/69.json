Iron Man.\nNot only is it awesome in team fights and dueling due to it giving you a substantial shield but it&#039;s VERY effective in lane due to him having a ton of victims to generate shield off, in form of YOUR minions, basically turning them against you if you dare to fight him.\n\nHis spells all being AoE make it easy for him to build up a massive shield on them and make any form of harass and trading useless against him if you&#039;re not ranged, then again every melee struggles against Ranged.\n\nIt&#039;s highly unintuitive and not very interaction and what&#039;s even worse; Really unhealthy and unfair due to his opponents not really being rewarded by choosing favorable fights and playing around it.\n\nIt&#039;s the reason he was kept in such an awful state ever since his release and maybe it&#039;s about time we&#039;d remove this feature in favor of balancing him more outside of the laning phase and giving him actual windows of powers and ways to deal with him in lane.\n\nSo, I personally would be a fan of removing his minion draining in favor of other buffs that make him feel more like a juggernaut and not let him win by default just because you just happen to have a ton of minions.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the matter?\nYay or nay?\n\nhttp://s2.favim.com/orig/28/black-sabbath-gif-iron-man-ozzy-osbourne-paranoid-Favim.com-233856.gif\n\nEdit;\nTo clarify; I do not suggest SIMPLY removing the minion aspect without any form of buffs.\nThe prime problem with balancing Morde is how oppressive his laning can feel like and how few ways there are to actually play against him in lane.\nIf your champion doesn't counter Morde you're boned, it's unfair and very poor design.\n\nMaking him way less unhealthy opens up avenues in which he can be buffed, giving him some love and making feel like a real Juggernaut while eliminating most of the frustration when playing AGAINST him","replies":[{"poster":"Sona x Rubick","date":"2016-10-29T14:31:50.897+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"then what's the point of his spells costing HP?\n\nIt's been since 2010 that every league players (at least smart players) know that Morde has always had HP cost to balance th shield that he gets from hitting minions and countering pokes.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-10-29T14:39:55.202+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"To be completely fair, most Morde players max W, he never really hurts himself all that much with the costs.\n\nBesides, if his Passive no longer works on minions Riot might actually give him  decent stats for a melee juggernaut.\nLike decent hp/5, base hp pool and maybe resistances.\n\nIt's been about seven years since his release and Riot has been getting rid of these kinds of uninteractive lanes, as seen in Vlad's rework so Morde might as well have his laning made more engaging and fair for both parties involved.","replies":[{"poster":"Sona x Rubick","date":"2016-10-29T14:53:21.881+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"you want an interactive laning phase?\n\ngive morde a reason to fight\n\ncause now there aren't reasons to fight when you have trash base stats, and not that good all in compared to E poke.","replies":[]},{"poster":"grug","date":"2016-10-29T15:12:08.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Malicious Metal,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2M66XQxb,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-10-29T14:39:55.202+0000)\n>\n> To be completely fair, most Morde players max W, he never really hurts himself all that much with the costs.\n> \n> Besides, if his Passive no longer works on minions Riot might actually give him  decent stats for a melee juggernaut.\n> Like decent hp/5, base hp pool and maybe resistances.\n> \n> It&#x27;s been about seven years since his release and Riot has been getting rid of these kinds of uninteractive lanes, as seen in Vlad&#x27;s rework so Morde might as well have his laning made more engaging and fair for both parties involved.\n\nyeah, this is true.\n\nthe only players i've ever seen max anything other than W are people in low silver to bronze not realising the harvester gives full heal on jungle camps l0l.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-10-29T15:14:07.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I max his q.....\n\nQ.Q","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-10-29T15:36:52.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"....\nWhy?","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-10-29T17:53:30.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I dont know sempai......\n\nDamage?\n\nI just never saw w as that usefull.... \n\nQ.Q","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-10-29T19:35:19.094+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His Q's damage doesn't scale that much with ranks but more with Morde's levels due to the ratio being TOTAL ad.\nW gives you an entire 590 damage when maxed.\nAoE\n\nas well as a potential 380 heal.\n\nIt scales really well with level, giving a ton of wave clear, trading prowess and an actual way to survive ganks","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2016-10-29T23:44:59.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Malicious Metal,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2M66XQxb,comment-id=0003000000010000000000000001,timestamp=2016-10-29T19:35:19.094+0000)\n>\n> His Q&#x27;s damage doesn&#x27;t scale that much with ranks but more with Morde&#x27;s levels due to the ratio being TOTAL ad.\n> W gives you an entire 590 damage when maxed.\n> AoE\n> \n> as well as a potential 380 heal.\n> \n> It scales really well with level, giving a ton of wave clear, trading prowess and an actual way to survive ganks\n\nDo you max Q second, or E?\n\nI max W first, but I always max Q second for the damage.

We already seen it with his rework, it's time to stop it.\n\nI'm not good in terms of numbers and balancement, so i will say this:\n\nWhat me and, i believe, most morde mains like about him is his unique mechanics due to his passive, which force him _to play around enemy units and around his positioning in lane_. His shortcomings of cc and dashes, blinks, high defensive stats etc are due to the iron man and the possibility of \"always shield never die\", which makes morde himself and satisfying to play. We have to remember it.\n\nThis thing distinguishes morde mains from casual morde players. These ones can spam E and W in lane and still lose every trade because they can't position themselves properly, or simply don't know when to go in. The shield is good IF you can manage it, not in every occasion.\n\nPlus, if these changes were actually made, morde would become a toplaner vs melee only champion, countered by every ranged or not exclusively melee champ, because he couldnt shield himself from any kind of damage. Goodbye mid morde or bot morde, he would lose his possibility to go to other lanes like a numero 1. \n\nSo riot came out with the \"morde is a juggernaut\" thing and \"his passive and his old E are toxic and hard to balance\", but we all know this isn't true and he is (and was) one of the most counterable champions in the game, nobody complained about him etc.  I know riot have \"chose this path\" for him and i don't even ask for a revert, but let's keep calling him mordekaiser, there are way more toxic champions out there, let's help make him healthy without trashing his identity further.\n\nI'm sorry for my gramatical and lexical mistakes, i'm italian, english is not my mothertongue.\n\nedit\nSomebody can say \"give him some kind of dash or cc\" but let's be honest, can you see morde dashing? i can't...","replies":[]},{"poster":"CyberBalt","date":"2016-10-29T17:51:25.257+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could buffing shield generated to actual champions hit by it be used as compensation?
