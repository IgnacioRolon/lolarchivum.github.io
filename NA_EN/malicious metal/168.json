We don't see him when he's quietly on his pedestal, we don't see any of that. We only see Galio in the best situation he can be in.\n\nIt's not that Riot changed Galio.

People took him as sombre. For whatever reason. It's what they value about him. Clearly Riot don't feel there's some inherent message to his original tone that was so crucial they had to preserve it, so with original author intent aside then the only thing of importance is fans of the character and what they identify him as.

Lux's tone is a good counterpoint to Galio's because her life kind of could be hell, but she has an inherently cheerful personally despite or maybe IN SPITE of it. Old Galio's life had one, distinct, terrible happening, and he never fully recovered from it but, as you said, has managed to start having successes.\n\nThough I'm not actually trying to do it, characterizing old Galio by his lore shouldn't be that odd since the new Galio, like all recent reworks, is heavily lore-oriented. (And for what it's worth, his old lore was more than just a snippet; he was one of the lucky champions to get expanded on in a [\"Judgment\" piece](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Galio/History). He was actually one of the MOST expanded-on characters in terms of written lore.) This thread's premise is to defend new Galio using his lore, so surely we can use his old lore to point out differences.\n\nThe real issue though is this: You're saying his old lines were just a mere 15, all about assault or defense... On paper you're right, the new one is arguably even MORE sombre because he has more lines that actually make sombre statements. But there are two problems with that.\n\nThe first, is the ratio problem. The first Galio never said anything that was particularly sad, but he never said anything HAPPY. Absence says as much as presence; this is a fundamental of characterization. The new Galio has, what, the 6 lines you posted that are sombre, but also one of those huge, modern selections of voice lines, most of which are cheery, boastful, proud, or whimsical. Just taking a casual listen of his [14 minutes of voiceover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJFip-XdMIw&t=628s), even ignoring his jokes and taunts, and he's cheerful more often than not. That's flooding his character with new traits, not really just filling in the blanks.\n\nThe second, is acting. And this might be impossible to really be definitive about, but it's plain to me when listening to most of Galio's new lines that this guy is proud, boisterous, mostly pretty happy, and certainly lively. Old Galio only communicated as much pride as he did humbleness --  \"An honor to serve.\" \"By your command.\" -- was never a braggart, and wasn't especially happy and not especially lively either.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Axle the Beast","date":"2017-03-09T07:05:02.139+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you're doing though is reading into a single line. Yeah the lore does mention that little thing about it being bittersweet that he is only awoken by the thing he must destroy, but that is pretty inadequate when you consider the other issues that differ between the two versions:\n\n* \"It's bittersweet (their actual word choice) that I must always go back to sleep when not fighting\" is NOTHING compared to \"MY MASTER IS DEAD I CAN NEVER REDEEM MYSELF\" (his champion quote literally used to be: \"There is no such thing as redemption. Only penance.\" There is no comparison in terms of how sombre these manage to be.\n* Galio was literally the \"Sentinel's Sorrow\"; if a character is defined BY TITLE and all their lore by an emotion, and that emotion isn't at the forefront of the re-done version of the character, then no, you have not succeeded in translating them. It doesn't matter if he has sombre elements, because he's very clearly overall pretty jolly about things.\n* None of his old lines are happy; tons of his new ones are. I don't need to tell you this; listen to the new voice-over. He isn't too broken up over anything.\n* The voice-ACTING of the lines is completely different too; the old one is, well, sombre; the new one is basically a jolly superhero.\n* Using rock-and-roll to advertise the new Galio honestly speaks volumes and I don't understand how that point is getting glossed over.\n\nYou really can't take a single detail like the last third of his new lore, and then try to stretch it and say it applies to the entire character's tone.

Yeah, we've got different versions of that in Garen, Darius, Draven, among others. But old Galio was basically an oddly masterful depiction of DEPRESSION. He was a character basically broken in terms of motivation who -- through Poppy and his involvement in the story -- was only _starting_ to come out of it. The old Galio actually was a more distinct entry to the cast; the new one basically doesn't add anything, or at least adds very little.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Recuro","date":"2017-03-08T22:44:55.350+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I won't deny that he's not sad anymore, but that doesn't make him like old Galio.  There are plenty of sad champions, they aren't Galio either.  His old personality was very solemn, he was a quiet protector.  New Galio is still sad, but he's also really boastful and dramatic.  He went from being sad and quiet to being sad and loud.

But it's not just the words, his voice was always calm, solemn, melancholic.  You could give new Galio the same exact quotes but his personality would still be vastly different because of the way they both talk.  New Galio is much more cheerful and and jock sounding.

Actually listen to those lines, the solemness and melancholy you're thinking you hear is only there because you've read his previous backstory. New Galio has at the least, two emotions, happy and solemn while old Galio's voice is completely one note with no emotional feeling in either direction.","replies":[{"poster":"Axle the Beast","date":"2017-03-09T07:27:23.585+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to what depressed people sound like?\n\nLook people fault Keanu Reeves for being a terrible actor but a fundamental of his personality is he's actually gone through a terrible loss and is literally going on purely for his fans. (I'm serious; read about him.) Sorrow and especially depression is arguably a \"weak\" emotional state, and I'm not saying that as an insult but rather trying to illustrate that they are often very soft-stated emotions or ways of being.\n\nThe entire point with old Galio is he basically gave up on everything; he only went on at all because Poppy inspired him. That is pretty much a depression analogue; devoid of emotion and/or motivation. It's not a surprise that whatever emotion is there in his voiceover is pretty understated. You can argue I'm reading into those lines then, but considering the lore is clear about his emotional (and motivational) state, I doubt it. Especially since the voice-actor who voices him (if I have any ear for voices at all) is [David Lodge](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0517087/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t36), who is fully capable of loud, boisterous characters like Kenpachi from Bleach or Jiraiya from Naruto. (He was also the very emotional Skarner.) If they had this guy sound how he does in the old VO, then it was for a reason.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Axle the Beast","date":"2017-03-09T07:19:24.661+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one's going to contest the production quality and writing detail put into the new lines in comparison to the old ones. But your point falls flat:\n\nFirstly, Galio -- like any character, particularly in a gameplay-driven competitive title like LoL -- is defined by a lot of things. Since the story doesn't unfold in-game, hard plot is outside it. The lines are only a portion of his story and characterization, and a rather small one considering that, since he was one of the few champions to get a written [Judgment](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Galio/History), is actually one of the MOST expanded-on champions in the game prior to the big lore reset. Galio's personality and his overall tone as a character is better defined there.\n\nBut more importantly, someone else in this thread made an excellent point, which is that _absence_ is just as important as presence in characterization. Galio is defined not by obvious emotion, because he is literally the \"Sentinel of Sorrow\" according to his old title; he is a clear depression parallel and thus is defined by a lack of strong emotion or motivation. What's important -- and it IS important because you can see left and right that lots of people DID take his old character as sombre, solemn, etc. -- is that in his old voice-over he never says anything particularly happy.\n\nThe difference, and the point of contention, is that the overwhelming majority of new Galio's lines and his overall presentation is mostly cheerful or cocky. That's not like old Galio by any estimation. And it wasn't a necessary change if the only goal was to expand on him or to give his voice lines a better look into his character. Better writing on the obviously outdated VO would have done it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keyshe","date":"2017-03-09T00:26:19.447+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Listen to them. \nThe actor made his personality very clear.

I'm surprised to see you of all people defending the personality.\n\nSomber? Melancholic? Guy, his reveal opened with a guitar. I know you're trying to find silver linings, but please... don't give us that. Just as serious a character, maybe, but this new Galio almost has Zac beat for chipper attitude.\n\nIt's not Galio. Sure, Sion was goofy Arnie zombie, but the lore (and relatively the theme of his kit) was terrifying zombie butcher. And, boy, those might be about the only three words new Sion _can_ be called by.\n\nBut Galio was the somber, dutiful protector. This Galio feels like the opposite-- a vivacious, loose-cannon destroyer. It's not that it itself is bad-- it's that this almost feels like an idea for a Zac skin that went a little too far into Galio's yard. The lines are great, the voice is great, the attitude is great, and none of it is even remotely Galio. About the greatest similarity is that they're AP-scaling guys made of rocks. And, frankly, Malphite would like a word if that's where we're going.\n\nHonestly, this could be made into a Zac skin very easily and I doubt Zac players would argue with a skin taking a unique approach to his model.","replies":[]}]}
