For example, we wanted to get these out before Taric, but we weren't quite there and had to put them on hold to get Taric and the Mage Update out, then when that settled down we got back to the Trundle/Trist/Nidalee splashes. We are currently focused on Ryze and all his splashes though we have started really early ideation on Sion Splashes. Sion and Twitch's will for sure be after Ryze but I can't say how long after. The good thing is that Yorick has very few skins so that should give us a bit of bandwidth after Ryze. Warwick has A LOT of skins as well though so there will be a point we have to start to focus on that.\n\nThere are also a few more 1 off splashes that we have at 70-90% complete that we didn't get to in the last round of random 1 offs (Olaf, PAX sivir for example) So I would to expect to see a few more random 1 offs here and there too.","replies":[{"poster":"Brutusness","date":"2016-05-25T17:34:51.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you know if there's an ETA on Ryze's champion update?
