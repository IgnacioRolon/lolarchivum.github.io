It scales on DAMAGE output and gives you DURABILITY based on the damage you deal.\r\nIf you get fed on Mordekaiser there&#039;s nothing the enemy can do to stop you as you&#039;re going to completely destroy them without them being able to retaliate.\r\nIt also makes trading against Mordekaiser very binary in lane. Either you have the DPS required to breach his shield or he&#039;ll just shrug it off like a bad case of fleas.\r\nIt&#039;s broken by design and keeps him in this awful spot where he&#039;s not allowed to be buffed.\r\nThe sad thing about it is that it&#039;s heavily linked to his THEME and IDENTITY.\r\nThe meme &quot;Mordekaiser es numero uno; always shield, never die&quot; comes to mind and it certainly shows that a lot of people seem attached to this, which makes this even more tragic.\r\nIt&#039;s theme of battle-bound durability really fits with the whole Juggernaut shtick but its current form is broken.\r\nThere are other ways to fix this but I&#039;ll come to that in a minute.\r\n\r\n**Siphon of destruction**\r\nhttp://cdn.garenanow.com/webupdate/live/lolphweb/news/2015%20June/23/VFX%20in%20League%20of%20Legends/Mordekaiser.jpg \r\nThis skill was what earned Morde the spot in the trash in the first place.\r\nIt&#039;s un-intuitive poke and a spell that has little to no decision making involved.\r\nIs it off CD? Spam it.\r\nIt&#039;s INSTANT AoE RANGED harass that was nerfed into the pitiful state it is now.\r\nIt could be so much more but it has become this part of his kit that&#039;s so unnoticable and boring that it could be replaced by anything.\r\nThat&#039;s the problem of most of his skills anyways, they&#039;re binary, and binary is not a bad thing for a Juggernaut, but they have little to no decision making involved except his Harvester of Sorrow, which ironically was what made him pick or ban in a duo lane.\r\nMordekaiser needs more intuitive gameplay patterns especially in his base line kit in order to offer him and the enemy ways to outplay and truly raise the skill ceiling on both ends of that matchup\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/5.4.1/img/spell/MordekaiserChildrenOfTheGrave.png **Children of the Grave** http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/5.4.1/img/spell/MordekaiserChildrenOfTheGrave.png \r\n\r\nMordekaiser&#039;s ULTIMATE ability and arguably the coolest thing about his kit.\r\nIt&#039;s a curse that allows you to rip the soul out of a dead champion&#039;s body and make them follow your every whim, or rather it should if the AI wasn&#039;t mentally retarded.\r\n\r\nIt provides Mordekaiser&#039;s high point when he gets HUGE damage and durability scalings due to the Ghost not only BUFFING Morde but also Morde giving a percentage of his stats to the ghost.\r\nThat 12/0 vayne on the enemy team?\r\nNP, it&#039;s a 12/1 Vayne on YOUR team now.\r\nHis Ultimate scales with how hard you&#039;re losing similar to old Veigar&#039;s R\r\nIt&#039;s efficiency is non-linear unlike other summons and completely relies on how well the enemy is doing.\r\n\r\nNot only this but it does a lot of things at once.\r\nIt gives:\r\n-Burst\r\n-Heal\r\n-Shield\r\n-Potentially a huge DPS increase\r\n-Potentially a huge tank steroid\r\n-A sixth man on your team\r\n\r\nWhat the problem with it is that it&#039;s POTENTIAL power and unlike a healthy champion&#039;s kit it&#039;s not binary, meaning unless you get the maximum out of it it&#039;ll either suck or be OPPRESSIVE as hell.\r\nJust like Iron Man it&#039;s one of his core thematic elements, which makes Mordekaiser in general a real pain to balance and work on as a Riot designer.\r\n\r\n\r\n**So, how could we fix this?**\r\n\r\nHonestly?\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s actually rather simple:\r\n-Give Mordekaiser more ways to outplay, make him less binary\r\n-Make him less feast or famine\r\n-Make his scaling binary and depending on HIS stats and not other variables\r\n-Reduce the sheer lack of meaningful counterplay\r\n\r\nConcrete things?\r\n\r\n**Ultimate**\r\n\r\nChildren of the grave&#039;s damage, HP and other stats should be dictated by MORDE himself.\r\nIt should be similar to Daisy, meaning that Ability Ranks and Mordekaiser&#039;s own stats add to the clone&#039;s efficiency, making it a binary scaling that does not rely on the enemy being fed.\r\nThe way he gets the clone can be changed for all I care but seeing that he has to retain this in some way I feel this is the way to go to balance the Thrall he summons\r\n\r\n**Battle-bound durability**\r\nProbably THE Juggernaut thing.\r\nIllaoi got her tentacles, darius his Q, every Juggernaut has a way to keep kickin&#039; in the midst of battle and fulfill the role of being a damage threat, scaling well in the midst of battle and surviving a lot of punishment.\r\n\r\nBut how could we do this?\r\n\r\nWell, I had ONE concrete ability change in mind that would build on one of my PERSONAL favorite things about Mordekaiser:\r\nThe Shrapnel shield, iron Man and his sheer in-fight sustain\r\n\r\n**Iron Man; Reworked W**\r\n\r\nActive; Mordekaiser shields himself with necromantic energies and unleashes a torrent of malice and metal around himself, the Shroud damaging surrounding enemies. (Shield strength based on %HP)\r\n\r\n(Reactivation; Implodes the metal storm to drain the surrounding area of life, healing Mordekaiser for a percentage(?) of his max HP for every unit struck, half as efficient against minions??)\r\n\r\nI wanted to move Iron man to an active, giving Mordekaiser more control over how he should use his survival tool, giving him a way to reflect incoming damage conscuiously and giving him a way to survive even outside combat.\r\n\r\nThe cooldown would be somewhere around 20-15 seconds but here comes the kicker:\r\nEvery time Mordekaiser is damaged by an enemy champion or monster the Cooldown of Iron Man is reduced by (1-1.25-1.5-1.75-2) seconds, half as effective against monsters\r\n\r\nThis would give Mordekaiser a tool to keep fighting in the midst of battle, his survivability still bound to actual brawling and not to simply dealing damage.\r\nBut then again, I&#039;m not a Rioter so this may be too freaky to even implement.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact remains; Mordekaiser has inherent design flaws that keep him from ever being allowed to be STRONG.\r\n\r\nHis Kit is a balancing nightmare and he lacks all the aspects of a healthy Kit, lacking Windows of Power, binary scaling and ways to outplay opponents or be outplayed.\r\n\r\nI just hope Riot finally comes around to give Mordekaiser the VGU he so DESPERATELY needs, seeing that his core THEMES and IDENTITY are some of the coolest things about him as a character and once expanded upon; Oh baby; he&#039;d be one of the most awesome Champions in the LoL roster.\r\n\r\nWho wouldn&#039;t want to play an updated Murder Emperor?\r\nA Metal tyrant who rips the souls out of his enemies and goes to town with necromantic powers, ensorcelled mace, his sheer presence of malice and the will to DOMINATE and CONQUER!\r\nHe&#039;s got the potential to be bloody awesome!\r\nhttp://www2.pic-upload.de/img/32272229/mordewallpaper.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-12-11T00:45:44.659+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Malicious, great topic.\n\nI wanted to pipe in as a Kog main who has often found myself on the receiving end of Mord's Ult, especially having lived through the older incarnations of Mord down through the Seasons.\n\nWhen he blasts you with that thing, you're either skunked or you're not.  Either you manage to escape with your life and Mord gets a cooldown for his trouble, or you eat it and he gets his ghost.  I think that, perhaps, instead of just being this giant nuke, why not focus it even MORE on his soul-stealing aspect while giving it a bit more interaction on the receiving end?\n\n**R - Children of the Grave:** Mord rips out part of the soul of his target, dealing magic damage to them and creating a phantasm of the target under his control.  The phantasm gains (percentage) increased damage against its twin.  If the victim of Children of the Grave is killed before the duration expires, the phantasm is empowered, greatly increasing its lifespan and granting bonus stats to both Mord and the phantasm.\n\nSo Mord always gets a ghost to play with and if he kills the ghost's twin, then the ghost gobbles up the rest of the twin's soul and Mord gets his full-powered ghost to cause some havoc with.  I think this would resonate really well with Mord's character while giving the target more room to play around it AND giving it more of a sustained damage pattern rather than being *just* a giant nuke if it doesn't kill the target.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-12-11T00:52:29.384+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is something that went through my mind on numerous occasions but your elaboration rally sold me on this idea.\n\nCurrently Morde either wins or loses, getting either a powerful clone or he...doesn't.\nIt's hit or miss and him literally gripping a piece of your soul and ripping it out could give him more ways to express his strengths and soul-stealing aspects.\n\nIt would also provide benefits without having to outright murder someone.\nHow it currently stands his ult is a \"win-more\" ability, if your team manages to draw fist blood you just wipe them all out, which only increases the amount of binary aspects in his kit.\n\nSo yeah, it's an idea worth exploring as it would also be extremely badass and fit thematically.\n\nAlso, how's Koggles currently faring? haven't seen one in ages D:","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-12-11T01:08:13.206+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Malicious Metal,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sR8InejI,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2016-12-11T00:52:29.384+0000)\n>\n> This is something that went through my mind on numerous occasions but your elaboration rally sold me on this idea.\n\nGlad you liked it!  I've always been a fan of focusing more on champion design rather than just the raw numbers.  For Morde, the question is 'how do we make him more fun to play both as AND against?'  Always giving him some soul-stealing high points with his Ult in place of a simple giant nuke would pull that off pretty well, I think.  A ghost is easier to interact with than a targeted nuke/dot is.  You can focus the ghost down quickly or disengage until it's gone.  But short of pre-nerf QSS, there wasn't ever any way to deal with Morde's Ult aside from being tanky enough to soak it.\n\n> Also, how&#x27;s Koggles currently faring? haven&#x27;t seen one in ages D:\n\nHe's still super unpopular.  AP Kog has been *really* strong for a while, but the recent patch really took him down a peg.  The removal of Locket's MR aura helped him out a fair bit, as did the recent item changes and his W buff.\n\nThough, really, I still think buffing his W damage is pretty much the worst way to buff Marksmen Kog.  All it does is make him stat-check people harder.  I would rather see more of his power budget sunk into his ability to shred resistance.  Giving him the niche of THE damage amp Marksmen would be a fun and compelling way to go.  So he would be  the team focused tank-buster while Vayne is purely selfish.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2016-12-11T13:24:04.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morde's ult is kind of useless sometimes because the clone's AI is rudimentary.\nAA champions that get killed and revived, benefit from this simplicity as the stats those champions buy boost their AAs, which is the most complicated thing the AI can do.\n\nSpellcasters that get killed on the other hand, just transfer a portion of their power to Morde, basically accomplishing nothing in terms getting a spooky ghost that's going to kill people, you just use it to tank towers or dragon/herald/baron.\n\nI feel that if Morde's ult is going to work properly and feel satisfying on using it on anyone,\nspellcasting/enchanting types of champions need to be figured out.

What has he lost for this?\n\n-Utility\n-CC\n-Mobility\n-Range\n\nNow granted, the power of his ultimate is somewhat contingent on who his target is, but turnaround power is part of Mordekaiser's strength, and frankly there aren't enough abilities in the game contingent on scaling off of enemy stats.\n\n> **So, how could we fix this?**\n> \n> Honestly?\n> \n> It&amp;#039;s actually rather simple:\n> -Give Mordekaiser more ways to outplay, make him less binary\n> -Make him less feast or famine\n> -Make his scaling binary and depending on HIS stats and not other variables\n> -Reduce the sheer lack of meaningful counterplay\n\nWell, I don't know how you'd accomplish any of this without giving him actual utility and CC, and I don't buy the counterplay argument for a second, as the very nature of his kit makes him fundamentally counterplayable by design - he has no way to force a confrontation the enemy doesn't have to have.\n\n> Concrete things?\n\nOk?\n \n> **Ultimate**\n> \n> Children of the grave&amp;#039;s damage, HP and other stats should be dictated by MORDE himself.\n> It should be similar to Daisy, meaning that Ability Ranks and Mordekaiser&amp;#039;s own stats add to the clone&amp;#039;s efficiency, making it a binary scaling that does not rely on the enemy being fed.\n> The way he gets the clone can be changed for all I care but seeing that he has to retain this in some way I feel this is the way to go to balance the Thrall he summons\n\nThis is a terrible idea, and pushes him even FURTHER into feast or famine territory. This basically means, if he has items his ult wrecks, if he falls behind it's useless - whereas the current ultimate will always provide him benefit, either from his stats stacked on the ghost, or the ghost stats onto his.\n\n> **Iron Man; Reworked W**\n> \n> Active; Mordekaiser shields himself with necromantic energies and unleashes a torrent of malice and metal around himself, the Shroud damaging surrounding enemies. (Shield strength based on %HP)\n> \n> (Reactivation; Implodes the metal storm to drain the surrounding area of life, healing Mordekaiser for a percentage(?) of his max HP for every unit struck, half as efficient against minions??)\n\nI don't like this either. Mordekaiser should _never_ scale off of max HP for anything. Forcing him to build HP to power his shield defeats the whole point of having a shield, as the shield IS his hp that he's losing in combat - changing Iron Man to be Max HP based was the second worst change that came out of the juggernaut update.\n\n> I wanted to move Iron man to an active, giving Mordekaiser more control over how he should use his survival tool, giving him a way to reflect incoming damage conscuiously and giving him a way to survive even outside combat.\n\nI don't really see the need or point of this - iron man is Mordekaiser's Life Steal ability: it's what keeps him going by doing damage. Much like life steal is a passive stat, morekaisers iron man works best when it's just always on.\n\n> His Kit is a balancing nightmare and he lacks all the aspects of a healthy Kit, lacking Windows of Power, binary scaling and ways to outplay opponents or be outplayed.\n\nI think this is the main problem with your analysis of Mordekaiser; the above statement is factually inaccurate. This is not a 1v1 dueling game, it's a team strategy game. Mordekaiser's counterplay was always being attacked by multiple people for as long as he was a thing, as he had no choice but to push the lane and be super aggressive.\n\nAs far as Windows of Power are concerned, that's not really fun or engaging game design as it's basically an arbitrary lock on the player saying \"okay now you can do stuff for the next 3 seconds\" followed by \"okay now you're worthless for the next 15 seconds\".

I'm not nearly dedicated to Mord as you are (I've said repeatedly I despise his current kit and playstyle)\n\npassive:\n- Limit his shield to only activate when it's filled up. It should be harder to stack up but once he activates it, all of Mordekaiser's damage (includes autos) feeds a portion of the damage to the shield until it's destroyed, and then it resets. This way he's got to work more for it, but once it pops it's a lot easier to keep up. \n\n- Possibly push some of his damage capability into his passive too. I'm a very big fan of Zarya and how she works (the only hero I like in Overwatch, matter of fact) and I think something similar would be really epic for Mord. His damage starts out fairly modest (still high because he's a juggernaut) but as he fills up his meter his damage starts to climb, he gets AoEs on his Q, he gets bigger, stuff like that. If this were the case I feel it'd have to replace his shield as a passive because it'd get too hard to keep track of two things on one resource, but we could move that to his W like you suggested. This is a pretty far-out change but I've been really liking the thought of it myself, since it means he could actually build fairly tanky and still be the heavy carry he's meant to be, and I think it suits his fantasy well. \n\nSiphon of Destruction:\n- I think this spell should be a strong DPS ability, followed up with burst (or a stun, maybe) if a condition is met. Say, like a short channel (uninterruptable maybe?) where he drains the life out of everything in the same cone he's got now.  If it reaches a threshold then he can reactivate it to strike the same area with a lot of damage and a stun. He can't use any other attack commands without canceling it, but it offers up strong sustain (that you can walk out of to stop healing him) and if he uses it well then he gets to take that charge and smash you with it. I want it to feel like an actual siphon, rather than just the instant poke he's got currently. \n\nI think his Q warrants changes too. I've been thinking it before he got the rework, but Rengar's Q is a lot what I'd like for Mordekaiser; the half-circle swing in front of him instead of the three-hit bop. Tying into the passive idea, he'd get secondary blast ranges for each swing to extend his influence, and he might go from the half-circle swing to a ground-targeted slam that sends out a big shockwave in front of him. This way he's kind of target agnostic and if he positions right he can hit the tank and the ADC behind him. \n\nI like Rebonack's suggestion for the ult a lot. mm pls respond","replies":[]},{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2016-12-11T19:49:06.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"After reading this I really want to play an updated Morde.
