I'm not saying other regions didn't mention this at all and i was the sole reason but i'll have the benfit of doubt for this region at least.\n\nIt's not a major change, but if Riot feels a change is in the right direction, they'll do it even if it's the few suggesting it as long as it feels right to THEM. It all comes down to intuition and the main reason the NA Boards are heavily populated is because of Riot's developers mainly being here which means everybody's content gets more recognition/attention on a bigger \"stage\".","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2017-04-14T19:56:23.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I don't know who Mira is because i don't use the Filter by Category a lot.
