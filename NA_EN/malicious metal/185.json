I get the significance of it, but when you look at newer champions like Evelynn, Poppy, Zoe, etc, they have full facial animations, so a full face helm would kind of limit the ability to continue adding that kind of thing to the game. People tend to connect with faces, so not having faces visible sometimes breaks that connection. I mean, even Samus Aran in newer games shows her face from time to time via reflections in her visor, so while I want Kayle to have a full helm, I can see where it can lead to her being a lot less interesting as a character in the long haul. They could do it like Kai'Sa's helm though, and have it be a toggle, as that could keep both up with modern design trends and give her a face for folks to attach to.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2018-08-07T18:20:58.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had not thought of that- Riot doesn't like simple recolors being full skins now do they?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-08-07T15:19:44.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lichformed,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=oM5Ej4BT,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-08-07T12:45:34.335+0000)\n>\n> Unmasked Kayle is a skin so put those in a calculator\n\nDoesn't really mean anything seeing as how they changed one of Akali's skins completely.","replies":[{"poster":"Yung Daemon Sand","date":"2018-08-07T18:43:22.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the most renowned legacy skins and crimson akali are 2 completely different issues -_-","replies":[{"poster":"HeresyUntoFedex","date":"2018-08-08T17:13:16.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yung Daemon Sand,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=oM5Ej4BT,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2018-08-07T18:43:22.640+0000)\n>\n> One of the most renowned legacy skins and crimson akali are 2 completely different issues -_-\n\nHelmetess Kayle is so mundane though, it's literally the exact sane as base skin but trading the awesome as hell helm for a generic sameface model","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NocaNoha","date":"2018-08-07T19:50:17.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lichformed,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=oM5Ej4BT,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-08-07T12:45:34.335+0000)\n>\n> Unmasked Kayle is a skin so put those in a calculator\n\nWould be nice of them to put it on a toggle.. and then add a new skin maybe?
