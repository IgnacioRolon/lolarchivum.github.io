They're all low cost, not-1350 RP skins and Riot is no longer putting effort into VGUs.

Almost all the recent VGUs have put tons of effort into making their skins look amazing, regardless of their price tier. Kayle's classic skin may have been poorly recieved (and I mostly agree with the feedback), but her other skins (and all of Morganas) look awesome - people are even angry about the amount of effort put into skins like Silver and Judgement Kayle, since hardly anyone owns them. Skins that were just recolours before now offer a whole fantasy - e.g. Green Kayle is now Elven Warrior Kayle. I'd say Swain's 520 and 750 skins were both upgraded to a quality that I'd say is equal to his Tyrant (1350) skin, and I still prefer using his cheapest (Pirate Swain) over his new shiny Dragon Master skin (which is honestly meh as far as models go even if the concept and having an army of dragons is cool).","replies":[{"poster":"QMighty","date":"2019-02-25T03:11:33.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People are disappointed with Ezreal and Kayle/Morg since with just about every VGU before them, all or at least some of the low-tier skins got all new effects and sometimes even voicelines, and now Riot's taken a new stand on VGU's where they don't want to give VGU skins new effects that they didn't have before the rework.\nUnderstandable disappointment.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2019-02-25T04:45:00.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, I guess Shen and Fiora just set a standard they wanted to follow.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kazekiba","date":"2019-02-25T06:46:56.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eeyore,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=NyY0cR6E,comment-id=000f00010001,timestamp=2019-02-25T02:10:00.669+0000)\n>\n> That's unfair - which recent VGU would you say didn't have effort put into their skins? \n\nDidn't have any problem making Akali's 20 skins all interesting and turning \"Red akali\" into Flame Atronach Akali. \nThis new policy means Morde's own Infernal skin will continue having no ... well, Infernal traits unlike Zyra, Akali and Diana. \nZyra's skin is 975 btw, but has entirely new particles and W\n\nEzreal, meanwhile, didn't get icy effects on Frosted.

Just like i did with ALL the other reworked champions. *Sigh*.\n\nEven so, Mordekaiser always stood out to me as particularly bad-ass. I always had a love for very heavy weaponry and heavy armor, and as such no other champion ever appealed to me like he did. He was so cool. And even better yet, he was unpopular - apparently not that many people could play him. That just encouraged me even more.\n\nNow, this is the fifth time i re-write this next part of the comment, i'm trying to keep it a little shorter and more to the point than my previous rants:\n\nYou, Malicious Metal, eventually became the symbol of Mordekaiser to me. More so, Mordekaiser now makes me think of you.\n\nBack in the day, you and Tidal Tyrant would post very frequently, especially in memes &amp; games.\n\nAnd that was to be **my** coping mechanism for dark times in my life. I begun flaming, i got banned once the new instant feedback system was introduced. Originally, the only reason i ever came to the boards was to ask questions in the player behaviour section. That's when i stumbled across memes &amp; games. \n\nLong story short, at one point one of the only things i looked forward to, waking up every morning, was opening my web browser to check if you, Tidal Tyrant, Laughing Fish or that something something Evil (i feel horrible for forgetting his name!) person had made a new post in Memes &amp; Games.\n\nBut enough about the emo drivel; you were the reason i got into online forums. I'd never bothered before, and i only really used the internet to listen to music on youtube or to look at funny pictures. \n\nEventually, i wanted to comment on one of your posts.\n\nYou replied to my comment. I was STARSTRUCK.\n\nThat opened a whole new world to me i had no idea even existed. Chatting with people online and interacting on online forums became an essential part of my life and is one of the things i enjoy the most today. I've even just started exploring reddit!\n\nI am reminded of that every time i see Mordekaiser. Because, as mentioned, i think of you and all the good memories i have of reading your posts here on the boards through the years whenever i see him, either by picture or in-game.\n\nYou probably don't know or remember me, as i at first added you (and even met you in a couple normal games and ranked games now and then up through the years) on my old account. But i know you (at least your \"public face\") and the things you unknowingly and unintentionally did for me meant a lot to me.\n\nFrankly, just talking to you feels like talking to a celebrity. It's hard to stop fangirling when i see just how strongly you radiate this contagious passion with every word you write. Even now, when i feel very tired of playing Mordekaiser (having played _thousands_ of games on him across several accounts on various servers) i am reminded of the good times i had with the champion, and my passion for his character is reignited. I don't have a habit of getting excited about things because i'm terrified of being let down, but how can i not when i read your posts? Your enthusiasm, passion, love for the character is so dazzling it's impossible not to feel excited about the champion once again. That makes me look forward to his rework, if nothing else then to see what he will become. And how you will take to it.\n\nI think you are the pioneer that paved the path Mordekaiser is now treading. Even Riot acknowledged your constant devotion. And they're not the only ones that have witnessed it. It doesn't mean much, but i have paid attention, i remember everything i've read and i wanted to recognize everything you have done both for Mordekaiser and for the community as a whole here on the boards.\n\nMordekaiser was supposed to be a re-animated moving suit of armor. A long-dead man. And yet here you are - his living, beating heart, breathing new life into both him and everyone around you.\n\nKind of ironic for such an evil, ~~edgy~~metal character, don't you think?\n\nSo, cheers to **you**, Malicious Metal.\nA toast for many more years to come.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Troll Fiend","date":"2019-02-24T15:33:21.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"On patch 6.20 I had opened a chest and received a skin for this boxy looking guy, 'Dragon Knight Mordekaiser' at the time I had only just stopped playing bots and began to play on PvP after gaining a few friends, and quite honestly; I hadnt picked up a champion i thoroughly enjoyed yet.
