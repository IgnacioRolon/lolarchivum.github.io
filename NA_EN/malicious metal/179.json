A game where Morde is a farm dependent duo laner because his kit has passives saying \"Morde is a farm dependent duo laner, unlike all the other melee champs\" is not. It feels forced and it limits future design space in that area.\n\nThey did something similar re: \"Marksmen in the Jungle\" with Kindred, but since Kindred were a new champ and there wasn't as much of a demand for variety in the jungle nobody really raised a fuss. The patience system could have led to some Marksmen becoming viable as junglers organically, but Kindred's release totally overshadowed a few off-meta builds (why use Twitch jungle when you can just play Kindred?).

Mordekaiser has none of that, which makes him super heavily reliant on his support, as well as making him vulnerable to ganks.\n\nIn top lane, that doesn't matter as much since your opponent will also have to get close to deal damage.
