We can do our best to help them out, which is why I personally don't joke about those topics, but since we can't see ahead of time what's going to bother people, we can't reasonably force everyone to censor themselves for the off-chance that someone will be around and bothered by it. More than just rape bothers people, after all. Abuse is relatively often referenced and joked about as well, but that one doesn't get as much attention despite the potential for being as traumatic as rape can be. I've seen many haunting things and had to deal with a lot of terrible things, I have to be prepared to be reminded of those things any time I go online. \n\nTo be clear, don't confuse what I'm saying with accusing them of being weak or easily bothered or thin-skinned or anything like that, but after a certain time they don't have to necessarily \"get over it\" (how do you \"get over\" rape or abuse, after all?) but they will need to find a way to deal with it being brought up in some way, even if it's hard. That's just life, unfortunately. Life is hard. :\\\n\nAlso, this applies mostly to other places. I think Riot has a no-rape type of policy they can enforce, so realistically people shouldn't joke about rape if for no other reason than not violating the rules they agreed to, but not every place necessarily has this rule, and in those places you can't expect people to censor themselves against what might bother someone else.","replies":[{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2017-05-19T01:27:52.912+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nope you dont sound crass at all, this is something I fully understand.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dogbroth","date":"2017-05-19T00:42:39.035+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"But let's be honest, you really don't care about that do you.
