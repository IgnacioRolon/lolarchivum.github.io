At present it&#039;s too universal a choice, whereas we&#039;d prefer extra CC be something with more of a trade off to it. Not yet sure if that&#039;ll mean lowering it&#039;s damage (more of a tanky/utility thing), lowering it&#039;s health (making it a squishy kite option) or some alternate approach (making it only work with certain spell types or something like that).\n\nWhile I absolutely think Rylais is in dire need of changes this statement left a really icky feeling in my gut, especially the second option about making it a squishy kiting option.\n\nThere&#039;s already a lack of mana less hp+ap options and once again nerfing Rylais&#039; HP would really hurt those champions who always wanted it for the mix of defense and offense and NOT those who simply built it because of its huge amount of AP.\n\nRylais should, IMO be the defensive utility option (Rylai is a support after all) that should be consciously built in order to make you provide more utility to your team and allow you to become a bit more durable with its slows and health.\n\nThough the last point of making it only work on certain spells seems interesting too though it&#039;s bound to screw over some champions.\n\nIn the end any changes to rylais WILL have consequences and impact some of its users either positively or negatively, knowing this I&#039;m anxious to see what exactly you&#039;ll be planning to do to the item and IF some champions get dumpstered by it ({{champion:82}} ) you&#039;re going to give them the attention they need.\n\n-MM","replies":[{"poster":"Sona x Rubick","date":"2016-09-12T10:55:59.507+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":5,"body":"\"rylai is fine\"- board\n\ni'm amazed by the fact that meddler understood how universal it is, and how it gives a retarded amount of damage for the utility it gives\nmake it a defensive/utility item, built on bruisers, built on mages if they want to survive an annie burst, built on supports like zyra if they want utility\nnot build on {{champion:1}}  as a 2nd/3rd item because it gives 100 AP.\n\nmake it 60 AP/550 or 600 hp reduce the cost to something like 3000, and it will be fine\nalso maybe reduce the slow to 30% for  aoes ~~but increase the duration to 2 seconds~~to avoid strong permanent slows from aoe spells.\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/eiuRyb8gAvs/hqdefault.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Best princess EU","date":"2016-09-12T11:05:36.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what's that pic?","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-09-12T11:07:05.067+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"Crystal Maiden Rylai from Dota2","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-09-12T11:00:17.248+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"600 health?!\nThat would almost be enough to compensate Morde for his shitty base hp :      ^)","replies":[{"poster":"Sona x Rubick","date":"2016-09-12T11:02:47.772+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"not even close, i still remember dying against yasuo at lvl 2 due to that base hp.","replies":[{"poster":"Hail Kaiser","date":"2016-09-12T12:27:05.786+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't forget the base armor.
