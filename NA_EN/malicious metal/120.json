You make it sound like health regen only works when you are low on health, but being low on health and not being max health are not the same thing, and you only have to be just below max health for health regen to work.\n\nDoran's Shield is for aggressive vs passive lanes; it's the best option that a passive laner has to maximize effective HP against an aggressive poke lane. Think about matchups like an immobile juggernaut versus a lane opponent with ranged poke. The juggernaut just needs to hold out and pick up cs until their lane opponent makes a mistake that they can capitalize on, but will hardly be at max health for very long because of their lane opponent's ranged attacks and spells.

Im only comparing Doran's set because listing out why practically using any other starting sets over Shield are better will make the post way too long. Trying to keep it short and sweet as possible.\n> \n> Shield Cost and gold efficient:\n> As it currently stands, Shield costs 450 gold while only being is 95.41% gold efficient, without its unique passive. To put it in contrast, Blade is 134.63% gold efficient and Ring is is 184.06% gold efficient even without its passive mana restore on kill. While at the same time, Ring is also the cheapest of the three allowing you to buy two health pots instead of one. In a numbers perspective, Shield is 38.92% less efficient than Blade and 88.65% less efficient than Ring. For a clearer perspective..\n> \n> Doran's Ring = 736 gold value\n> Doran's Blade = 605\n> Doran's Shield = 429\n> \n> With pots included\n> Ring + 2 = 836\n> Blade + 1 = 655\n> Shield + 1 = 479\n> \n> Block Passive\n> Not only Shield provides the worst stats in gold value and but it does not even truly block 8 damage as advertised as it blocks damage before resistances is calculated rather than after. Meaning the actual damage blocked will always be less than 8. It is also the only item in the game that gains less value from it's block passive the more resistances you gain throughout the game. On top of that, the block passive is not only unique but it is also so restrictive that the majority of the time it won't see use as area of effect damage is the primary source of damage.\n> \n> HP Regen\n> The heath regeneration also discourages from buying shield because of it's flat 6hp regen per 5 seconds (1.2hp per second) and the worst part of it is that it doesnt scale. I say this because over 95% of the champion roster's health regen exceeds 6 at level 3 meaning that you will gain more value from just buying two rejuvenation beads in addition to having three health pots. To further my case, 98 out of 134 (73%) champs has or exceeds Shield's regen passive at level 1.\n\nEven making Shield cheaper allowing 2 pots will still not make it a worth while item in any form.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SzGamer227","date":"2016-12-22T21:14:30.945+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the record, I do think the Doran's Shield is weak, but I don't think it's useless.
