He needs to land 3 autos within his short range, assuming the ADC did not flash previously, in order to proc it. You act like he can pull W procs out his ass when in reality he can't. Mallet is completely acceptable on him. He is supposed to build it. Again, his E has a relatively large cooldown so that is often used as an escape, I would never use it as an engage since I am not an assassin and probably won't get out alive. I'm not arguing whether it is fair or not, I am simply saying that frozen Mallet is essential for Gnar because the rest of his kit does not provide enough kiting tools compared to other kiters. I will say this though, the correct combo can be done to slow, proc W, rinse and repeat. You are correct in the fact that there is a way I can continuously stick to my enemy but the combo is situational and needs to have the rest of the enemy team away.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2017-05-21T13:19:52.967+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes, his W \"simply speeds him up\". How does that contradict that it is a kiting mechanic?\nIn the end, both fulfill one task: increasing your movement speed in comparison to the enemy's.\nDid you ever fight a crit build Jhin in late game? Every AA gives him MS buff and he is insanely good at kiting because of that then.\n\nI didn't actually say that you should use E to engage. Except in team fights when you are going to transform, then you can actually make sick plays that way winning the game. But it is an escape and a pretty good one. And that makes his laning safe.\n\nImagine you are an immobile melee champ at top. For example: Singed. It is hard enough to get in Gnars range when he has slows with his Q and MS buff with his W (remember, it proccs off from minions as well, not just champions). And even _if_ you actually managed to get in range..... he can still just hop away with E in emergency. It is an additional safety net for him.\n\nSee, I don't even say that Gnar isn't supposed to build Frozen Mallet. But his kiting power is extremely strong, with **and** without that item. Did you see worlds last year? When they picked Gnar, the commentators used to say a specific phrase over and over again:\n\n>Gnar: safe pick, no counter\n\nAnd you could actually see this in the game. His laning was extremely safe because of his kiting and escape with E. He kept split pushing all game long and the enemy team mostly was not able to catch him at all, he always escaped with his mobility, tankiness and slows (partly because of Frozen Mallet).\n\nWhen Gnars numbers are strong, he is pretty frustrating for melees to face. That's just how it is, I have to agree with OP here.","replies":[{"poster":"SirLapse","date":"2017-05-21T16:03:01.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The reason Gnar was a safe pick was due to his E and safely farming with Q. Had literally nothing to do with his builds or his kiting. Mega Gnar was the entire reason you brought him to competitive along with the super safe laning. He could bully in some match-ups but that was also when his numbers were different.\n\nYou've confused the entire reason Gnar was strong and are linking it to an advantage he currently has via Frozen Mallet, rather than an advantage he has always had which is his safe laning. How can you engage on anyone halfway across the lane when he also has a gap closer to leave? Not even Riven can punish that. Tower dives are the only answer and in his Mega Form that is one of the riskiest plays to be making. I have 1v2'd before in that scenario.\n\nSinged is actually one of the safest, if not THE safest counter to Frozen Mallet users if you're using the Dark Seal build and use your minion wave properly to punish the opponent's aggression. These champions do not carry enough hard CC to be overcoming proxy farms and Righteous Glory + Boots of Swiftness/Merc Treads.  And you actually play Singed! It may not be in a ranked setting but I would hope you've actually beaten some Frozen Mallet users. Maybe use one yourself instead of implying they're hard to beat?\n\nEither way, Gnar's numbers when they are strong in MINI FORM make him a lane bully. They are not currently strong right now, seeing as he's consistently <450 range until lv10, compared to him getting that at lv6. When they are strong in Mega Form, which was the majority of his existence and is his current state, he is picked for doing what every tank wants to do in the game from chain CC and damage. Very hard to utilize in solo queue and there are champions that do his job consistently better, just like when he was released. Mind you he used to have both of these advantages with his older builds.\n\nLastly, Q gets blocked by minions/other champions and therefore turns impractical. The boost to his speed when his Mini form is not a lane bully in the current meta is meaningless, compared to things like Teemo who keep the mobility throughout the lane phase and get to boost it whenever they would absolutely need it. Gnar's Mini Form needs to be a threat or he is literally **useless.** Frozen Mallet is a means to that end and it is working better than literally anything else currently. If BoTRK was truly good him then that could've easily replaced it (it has before if you were paying attention at all to his previous build paths), but he's a tank and wants as much HP as possible. Also something Frozen Mallet fulfills. Gnar has had to build Frozen Mallet and Cleaver in over 60% of the games he plays and has a nonexistent winrate unless he follows this cookie cutter build in solo queue. He has literally no presence without them. That is a real problem and it's being ignored in favor of saying FM is too strong.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2017-05-21T07:10:58.611+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Windowed power most likely.\n\nI haven't put much thought into what it could be reworked into, I just think the current version is very unintuitive and feels pretty archaic.\nIt IS an ancient design anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2017-05-21T13:49:21.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make it an active is most definitively the best solution.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-05-21T19:39:58.779+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"that item already existed and no one ever used it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GreatWhiteNorth","date":"2017-05-21T07:11:11.090+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"Juggernaughts meta wasn't fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-05-21T07:18:49.006+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"you'd whine regardless of what meta it is \n\nlet juggernauts be good just like any other group gets to be good","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2017-05-24T21:36:36.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What juggarnaut meta it was darius and mordekasier meta.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2017-05-21T07:08:41.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Instead of flat health, it could grant a % of the bonus health you already have, like Steraks?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2017-05-21T09:31:16.859+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Make it melee only.
