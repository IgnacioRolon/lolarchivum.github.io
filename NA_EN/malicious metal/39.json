You know morde players have to deal with being kited, you know they're naturally worse off because of their limited range, yet the rework nerfs both his movement speed and his range on his ult, the only spell that actually was effective against long range on him. Instead of \"embracing\" his weaknesses, why not make some of his oppressive abilities less oppressive and improve on his kit in other areas? I get that the \"juggernauts\" are meant to be slow but deadly in meele range, but Skarner, Darius and Garen all have some way to get to their target. Darius has his E, Garen his Q, Skarner his W/E, etc. Instead of giving Morde the means to be effective on his own, you effectively force him into playing a role NO Morde player has EVER wanted to fill. \nAnd the argument about finding teammates that overcome his weakness of being kited is just ridiculous. Even if you can prevent kiting in the laning phase, you will NEVER find a support that can keep you from getting kited from an ENTIRE TEAM. Not to mention, the other team probably has peel and CC aswell, making the third proc of your Q almost impossible to land. \nI get where you're coming from and what you're planning with the changes, I just think reimagining his role into that of bot lane is just really unrespectful of his playerbase.

This is the NEW character strength/weakness/fantasy that CertainlyT is pushing. This is not the Mord that WAS. If Riot were to make a NEW character with this in mind, then go for it.

The rework nerfs him across the board, and makes it so he has to stay in a lane where there's almost guaranteed to be someone(the adc) who can poke him into nothingness. And where as {{champion:82}}  may have a support to try and set up kills, the enemy adc will have one to make sure that never happens. \n\nI agree that Morde needs a full rework, but since he is currently under powered as it is, there's no need to make him worse.

And i recognize CT and his team as far more competent of any group of players and commenters out there. They might be wrong, they might pick decisions we don' t like, but so goes designing and changing stuff.\n\nNo new update about Morde has arisen yet - either because he is working on an hard champion ( because morde is an hard champion to work on )  or because he is not giving a shit, make your own headcanon - and when they will come i will speak myself again, until it comes out.\n\nAnd then i might be angry, or sad, or happy - but during that i will treat him as a fucking human being.","replies":[{"poster":"ArkenStorm","date":"2015-08-08T16:31:15.961+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly if his w was castable on self/minions the rework would be workable and acceptable. even if it had a lesser effect, morde would not be dumpstered","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-08-08T16:53:15.269+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Friggin agree - is the same thing i said under the morde changes thread!\n\nThis not only keeps part of his original gameplay and feel, but is just so cohesive tematically: he is a commander, as long he has minions ( or supports) he is stronger, and i like that.\n\nI also proposed that, in case of death, the targeted minion becomes a ghastly immortal version of it until the effects expires, but probably that is too much farfetched...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2015-08-08T13:53:46.077+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Beoridas,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uosY3yez,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-08-08T12:15:38.892+0000)\n>\n> Lets be honest here guys. Ive read the thread with certainly T. He was there to get feedback and help. Stattik and repertoir said they are brainstorming together to find solutions. But when Certainly T came in the forums...it was a maaassssiiiveee hate fest. People telling him out of nowhere to quit his job. That hes a *ock sucker, lots of insults--personal insults. As much as some wants to hate him: Thresh playerbase is huge; People love the champ, its a good champ. People love darius: we can even go to the thread, and its ironic how the people wants their beloved darius--CertainlyT champ--to then give the biggest F U ive seen given to someone un deserved or unprovoked on his morde thread and talk trash about his champs. Hes a freakin human being. \n> \n> As much as people say yasuo is cancer: I think mechanics, interactions is always a good thing in league.\n> Yasuo has several passive for instance. But it doesnt matter how many strenghts or weaknesses he has overall: as long as all the trade offs; counterplay; difficulty etcc are there its fine. There is many characters in the moba world who has tons of abilities. OVerloaded is just a word made up by ppl to always complain about a champ in the broadest way possible. (a bit like straw man arguments) Lets not forget the designers arent the one choosing the numbers for their stats.\n> \n> I also think his champions are very very thematically sound and believable. Hes very good at making you feel and appreciate a champ and connected to its personality.\n> \n> It doesnt mean Morde changes are good. But i can see **_some_** good reasonings for the abilities he gives him (thematics) But i would be angry too if he changed my olaf, kass, ryze to the point they are too different or just flat out suck. But he still deserve respect and appreciation for the good stuff hes done. He has talent. Perhaps if we werent just flat out immature and treating him like garbage--he would have talked and listened more.\n\n\nThat seems to be the common trend to anything CertainlyT related. People hate his champs and then treat him like shit.\nI for once do not enjoy playing versus his champions but have to acknowledge that they hit the nail on the head in terms of thematics and overall feel, albeit being a tad too annoying.\nStill, I wouldn't want him to be fired but rather be a bit more open about player feedback. I hate the majority of the Mordekaiser changes but with some community input this rework could become one of the greatest!\nJust because people bash him as a designer doesn't mean that he shouldn't listen to anybody anymore. He should assemble some people who aren't biased due to his prior creations but want to provide CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK/CRITICISM.\n\n@CertainlyT Don't condemn a champion due to people bashing you as a designer. You actually have some great ideas but your execution is lacking at some points. Don't let the dreams of a better, badder Morde be dreams.\n\nJust DO IT!
