Probably would get a slight cost reduction with the loss of HP but now it makes a meaningful tradeoff of being the utility/tank mage option.  \n\nSecond, we make Luden's a better option for the mages that just want dmg and better kiting potential and whenever Luden's passive is procced they get a burst of movespeed that rapidly decays over 2 or 3 seconds.  This still lets mages have a kiting option to survive without completely crushing the dreams of every melee champion in League of Legensds.  It also could be an option for AP bruisers that want to sacrifice tankiness for dmg and chase potential when snowballing.  \n\nThis may be completely awful idea but I figured I'd mention it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-10-07T03:02:32.618+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":17,"body":"You guys nerfed the passive for traditional users (single-target, moderate-low CD abilities), buffed it for non-traditional users (AoE/DoT), then nerfed the reason traditional users bought it (utility+HP on an AP item), and buffed the reason every mage in the game would want it (Highest AP outside of deathcap after all other AP items were nerfed).\n\nHow the fuck do you think adding mana/CDR to it would fix it?\n\nNerf the AP back down to 80, or even 60 to put it in line with other AP item nerfs.

It will break {{champion:112}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:61}} even more since they would much rather have the CDR/Mana instead of the HP. All 4 of these champs like to spam abilities/have high mana costs.
