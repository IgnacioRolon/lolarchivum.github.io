What you get is a capsule. Inside the capsule are champion shards. They will grant the champion they are for or can be disenchanted. Yes this is an overall rip off compared to what IP used to be. This all happened because people didn't want to buy runes before playing ranked. This also punished players who already had runes as it refunded all of them at 30% or lower. No the other system isn't coming back, sad day.\n\nBE is only earnable through disenchanting shards. Earlier levels happen faster later levels take around 15-25 games depending on your win/loss. It's about 800 BE a capsule. This is a lot less then we used to make. Don't worry, unless you were an uber collector before you will not be able to get emotes or the warwick skin with the essence shop. Those items are also limited time value. Yes the champions cost the same even though it's harder to get in game currency.\n\nYes they want more people to buy champions with RP. I hope this covered everything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BÃ©la","date":"2017-11-15T03:09:28.163+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I once said to myself that Riot was a real good company that cares for its community.
