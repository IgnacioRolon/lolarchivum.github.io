When you know the OP champs wouldn't that make it easier to go with their counter picks no matter how niche they are? I mean if Zed is strong why not pick champs that will beat him in lane overall. I like to play champs like Lissandra (again) against him for the same reason I pick her against other assassins. She has a zone of control that excels at keeping alive against assassins. I digress tho.\n\nI think low elo players put to much into OP champs as a whole and focus on them so heavily. They need to tone back their own views on them and not expect so much from them. LIke trist isn't much of a problem with early harass champs. Pushing her into tower and causing her to miss out on CS. Since its so hard to kill her once she gets her jump you have to focus on denying her CS more than killing her. yet people seem to not realize simple things like this.

Riven has no range and Nasus' Wither destroys me. With Shyvana, it's just a bar brawl and he's too tanky for Shyvana's crappy E to do anything at early levels. Then once he farms, cuz he can tank all my hits, he eventually beats me down because I can't stop him from getting CS. I have poked, I have gone all-in, but he just takes the damage, Withers me and walks away, or chases me down and beats the crap out of me once he gets the CS. Veigar can't hurt him early on without suffering for lack of farm later. He's got serious mana problems early on and I focus everything on farming my Q. Now this is a double-edged sword. I've had better success with it, but it can be problematic for my team if they can't handle a fed Nasus. On the flipside, I'm a fed Veigar and that has it's own advantages.
