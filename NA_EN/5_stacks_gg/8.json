Apparently he can heal himself more than 30% missing HP with the item.\nThe second is the insane AD bonus with Bloodrage. I \"don't think\" it's a good idea to nerf the AD from the bloodrage, it's the identity of the champ, like \"Get Away from a full rage Gnar\".\nI think the Hotfix does too much, even if the Q is the only real \"Basic spell\" on Darius.\n\nAlso, it would be good to not nerf Darius over 3 patch and finish him with a coup de grÃ¢ce, sending him in the unplayed Champ Tier, remember Zac,  Kha'zix, Lee sin, Kassadin, Ryze ?

By double buffs, I mean the straight buffs in addition to the new items just being vastly better than they have any right to be. Deadman's plate basically cancels the nerfed speed to Garen/Darius. Ect... Very much like when Sej was dominating the jungle. She got nerfed, then nerfed, then the item she used was nerfed and now she is forgotten. This is the total reverse of it. \n\nI know Riot was in a hurry to put these changes to Live before works. But man, this whole thing feels REALLY rushed and poorly thought out. Hopefully next year Riot plans out their year a bit more so they don't just toss items/champs/updates out in a hurry to get things ready for Worlds. This has thrown the whole balance of the game out the window. Even when beating down the juggernauts early, they still hard carry late game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taigongwang","date":"2015-09-04T13:24:34.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly think its just people still learning how to play against him still. Once you learn when you can engage or not against him in lane, it becomes easy. His Q is a massive part of his damage, and without the 'bug' on his E he cant catch you as easily anymore. What he does in lane is punish the mistake of trading with him for too long, and he snowballs off it.\n\nBut the thing I noticed playing him, is that with 0 good reason to max your W second anymore, he gets %Armor Pen WAY sooner than he used to. This is probably the root cause of why he is doing so well right now. Having any Armor Pen in your runes and then combined with maxing E second leaves your opponent in lane little choice but to build anything but pure health to survive against you. Combine the Q heal with that, and Darius can turn around most jungle ganks. \n\nTo make it short, Darius is hitting an old powerspike of his FAR sooner than he used to because of his new lackluster W. Its not powerful late game, and there isnt any reason to rank it up. So you take one point, and max E for the Armor Pen. Just tone down the Armor Pen passive, or attach it to his Ult.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CppL","date":"2015-09-04T04:48:20.615+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off all they should fix his double Q proc bug asap.Mb then his ban ratio would drop.Thats the only reason i ban him.","replies":[{"poster":"5 Stacks GG","date":"2015-09-04T05:23:30.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"it's been fix already","replies":[{"poster":"CppL","date":"2015-09-04T06:51:16.406+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=thebloody7,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OsikT3n3,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-09-04T05:23:30.791+0000)\n>\n> it's been fix already\n\nYesterday i saw darius healed over 1k hp with a single Q.yea i dont think its fixed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dormidon","date":"2015-09-04T05:43:06.710+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Tell us something about {{champion:103}} win ratio and pick ratio. \nhttp://clip2net.com/clip/m370052/e81e5-clip-51kb.jpg?nocache=1\nNo one actualy bans her.

Jump on her without ult, and she dies. She does a lot, but she's really squishy.\n\nBruisers are much harder to deal with because they're way too tanky to kill while doing stupid amounts of damage. They're less punished for screwing up because they're tanky, as well, so it often feels like they get a stat lead and then just keep winning regardless of player skill because they're all so forgiving.","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-09-04T09:43:42.299+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"They don't necessarily have to be tanky though. Many of the highly banned melee champions are assassins or melee carries (or Riven). Yasuo had like a 99% ban rate for a while and he definitely wasn't tanky. I think people just really don't like champions that can get in their face and kill them; hell, I can't remember the last time the most banned champion wasn't someone who jumped on your face and killed you. Even the last 2 ranged champs to top the ban charts, Leblanc and Azir, tended to be very melee-esque when they actually killed you. People really, really hate champions that kill them quickly and at close range and they tend to ban the ones that are thought to be the strongest. By contrast, I don't think a champion like Xerath or Vel'koz could ever become highly banned no matter how powerful they are; they simply don't have the kits to forcefully impose their will on the game even when quite fed.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2015-09-04T16:05:30.338+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The squishy melees you mentioned have invincibility frames and are generally hard to target even when they are targetable.

Those 4 champions were powerful in their own right when played with the right team compositions as well as in the hands of experienced players.

Not only did they buff those 4 into states where they weren't only stronger, but they were dominant picks. Additionally, they gave them items that amplified their new strengths, taking champions that are powerful and pushing them way over the edge. This exact same thing happened with the introduction of BotRK with the hyper-carries ({{champion:96}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:67}} ).\n\nI personally think that Riot took things twice as far as they needed to. They should have either 1. Added the new items into the game, or 2. Rework the \"Juggernauts\". I personally think that adding the new items would be enough to work, because so many Fighters and Bruisers benefit from them now. I think Garen, Darius, Mordekaiser, and Skarner would have been perfectly fine with the new items and no reworks.
