It does look like there are a number of players who were having login issues about 3 hours or so ago, but I'm also seeing that most of those players were eventually able to get signed in. Let me know if you're still having issues and I can look into it!","replies":[{"poster":"Atimus","date":"2017-08-12T18:59:09.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so about 13 hours ago I was finally able to logon possibly due to lower traffic around 1 am in the florida time zone but it started acting up again any I checked my connection the client/server is unresponsive again probably because of AR URF traffic why not just turn on login queue line to lessen this nuisance even if in the slightest and for what it's worth I know it's not my internet connection because when I watch a video on youtube I check the pings/data sent and received and it's always anywhere between 10MB to 15MB however I close that tab and open up the league client it sits at around roughly 8Kbs to 166Kb Max however this wasn't the case during those hours of low traffic e.g. 1am CDT to 5AM CDT","replies":[]}]}]}
