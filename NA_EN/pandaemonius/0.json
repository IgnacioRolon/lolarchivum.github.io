It's fine when I start a match it can hit 100+ FPS, but as soon as I get into a fight with other players my frame rate drops drastically to like 15FPS. This is strange as I didn't run into this problem with my previous iMacs I owned (from 2011). I've even tried setting the graphics settings to Low and it makes no difference. The settings seem to produce the exact same results.

From there it's totally unstable - sometimes it's at a decent 50, other times it's at an unplayable 3. Even when I tab out, my whole desktop goes laggy until I close the game. I attempted the same fixes as OP, but to no avail.\n\nHere's a couple other problems I noticed: \n\n* When I try to quit a match from the in-game menu (or even when I press CMD+Q), the game freezes. It also freezes when I close the menu after making adjustments to my audio settings. \n\n* No in-game sounds while using a wireless Bluetooth headset. Are game sounds supposed to transmit over Bluetooth? I can hear everything else, even the client. It probably would have been a good idea to try the built-in speakers. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nLeague looks absolutely gorgeous on this computer. Unfortunately, there's no way to play around these bugs. I hope a fix comes out soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-18T16:57:22.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) just in case this could actually be packet loss during intense moments like team fights.

I was hoping it would be higher, but 50FPS is fine. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
