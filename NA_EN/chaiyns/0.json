Now I tend to occupy myself with playing support sona and doing obscene ~~damage ~~ healing even after all her nerfs rework/post-rework. (Seriously she's been nerfed like four times in a row plz stahp)\r\n\r\nJungle might be less fun to me personally since the increased difficulty change, not a gripe mind you but an observance since jungle's presence tended to outweigh other roles and item changes when in a position where you're used to carrying more than one person's worth of weight.\r\n\r\nOn top or jungle I loved building mallatma's vi/voliburr, these two I see the most stark change by far, I built it frequently as the application was amazing, people often griped about mallet/atma's because of gold efficiency, but tbh getting 2 aa's for your 1 with the combo outweighs what was all too often unaccounted for.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the effectiveness of that is what spurred the removal?\r\n\r\nAnywho\r\n\r\ntl:dr item synergy with items like this FEELS nice, and works nice, and it sucks to see it gone.","replies":[{"poster":"DisasterSola","date":"2015-02-11T08:30:24.514+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"no one bought it\"\n\nI dont think items should ever be removed unless balance or another is introduced, personally. \nBut atmas wasnt really.... good.
