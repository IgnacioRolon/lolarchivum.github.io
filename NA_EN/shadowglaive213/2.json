The issue with sexualizing characters when it&rsquo;s not part of who they are is that it makes the work seem shallow and makes it about the viewer rather than the character, thus objectifying them.\r\n\r\nMuch of the community challenged Riot to explore different ways a woman can be attractive or disgusting, to show us all the different kinds of women that exist in Runeterra and they indicated that they would. They showed us they can come up with new, more original designs like Rek&#039;Sai, Illaoi, and Zoe. In comparison Kai&#039;Sa seemed like a disappointing step backward from what they previously promised so the apology was warranted.","replies":[{"poster":"Colgate Gator","date":"2018-04-09T16:27:05.906+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":5,"body":"While I can sort of get where you're coming from. You have bigger issues than Kai'Sa's V neck line in your hands if you truly believe an apology is warranted over the design of their Champion that didn't quite hit home like they would have wanted.\n\nI probably would have gone with the word \"explanation\" or something. Stop treating Riot like you would with a significant other.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-04-09T21:25:30.947+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"Kai'Sa was an opportunity to make a grungy, slightly unhinged female champion from the paranoid survivor angle. After all, she's been living for 10 years in the caverns beneath Shurima, only just recently finding the exit to the surface. So we have a girl, at the tender age of 10ish, who gets thrust into a hellscape, watching and hearing the people around her die horrible deaths, and scavenging meats and rotting foods for survival - that is, until she tries to kill a voidling that attacks her, and it bonds with her in it's last moments and they create a symbiosis.\n\nMind you, 10 years a long time. Any food that would have been in the village that was swallowed would have rotted away. Which means she'd have needed to feed on Void creatures, or even possibly the corpses that were left behind. Also, being hunted relentlessly by never-sleeping hellspawn would mean that she's under a lot of stress ALL the time. This also means that her appearance is the last thing on her list, as it's not imperative to her surviving the hellish creatures, and long hair like she has would be a tangle/grabbing liability against things trying to capture her. If she DID keep her hair long, she wouldn't be grooming nor would she have the tools or time to groom it, which means it would evolve into a matted mess of dreadlocks. She'd be thin and near emaciated, and she'd look like she's not slept a solid night for a decade.\nShe'd also be lonely - desperately lonely. There would be no one for her to talk to, except the skittering Void creatures, and the mocking voices of the sentient ones like Vel'Koz, Cho'Gath, and others, and they would sooner kill her than have a conversation with her. In other words, she'd be unhinged, her mind unraveling and desperate for companionship. She'd most likely have developed an unhealthy relationship with her symbiotic Void suit, and she'd probably converse with it as she would another human.\n\nKai'sa, therefore, should look thin and gaunt like Kalista. Her hair should be a ragged mess, if she hadn't cut it off (a short haired or even bald look being something the game is lacking for a woman...), and she should be deranged, like Kled or Jinx. \nWhat she shouldn't be is an Australian underwear model who looks like she's sporting the newest catsuit by Coco Chanel. And on that note, why the fuck IS she Australian? Literally no one else in Shurima has an Australian accent, not Kassadin, not Malzahar, not Sivir, not even the ancient ones like Jax or Azir. The only accent we have is the slight Middle-Eastern accent of Taliyah, which is distinctly NOT Australian. So all in all, Kai'Sa is just utterly wrong from every design aspect. She looks, talks, and overall doesn't mesh AT ALL with the lore as it portrays her. It's like they had one team tasked with making her, and another completely different team tasked with writing her lore - and neither of them spoke for like 6 months while she was in development. She's just a poorly constructed character through and through.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2018-04-10T12:15:29.006+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=b1O0UMEE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-04-09T21:25:30.947+0000)\n>\n> What she shouldn&#x27;t be is an Australian underwear model who looks like she&#x27;s sporting the newest catsuit by Coco Chanel.

They ALL have accents, while the Ascended are hard to tell as their voices are changed, Sivir is just a regional american accent. As someone from the south of England, I found it extremely hard to hear Kai'Sa's accent at all. Some regions of southern England's tones are similar to some Australian tones depending on region. Kassadin is the only one from her region but he's a traveller, isn't from where her mother was plus is messed up so his voice wouldn't sound right anyway.\n\nIt might just be a case that in that region, their accents do sound Austrailian. Shurima is a vast place, mostly desert, if it's assumed the Runeterra is around the size and scale of Europe plus North Africa, an Eqyptian accent will south different to Mali accent but they are both connected to the Sahara.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Usefully Useless","date":"2018-04-09T21:28:08.279+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"It all boils down to was it intentional. Did Riot head into the design with the intention of sexualizing a champion in a demeaning manner? If not then it just purely boils down to a few select people had nothing else to bitch about today and then people who are easily influenced followed the footsteps. Honestly it is not a big deal unless there really are some devious sexist Riot designers, which I doubt.  Let's be honest, there are blatant displays of sexism and there are this type, where butthurt people find things to be butthurt about. Normal, level-headed people see no harm in it and move on.

The justification Riot provided was that they were attempting to make her read more human. While some accept this explanation, I find it confusing that they felt the need to make her read more human when the predominant complaint when she was revealed was that she looked too human, making such an explanation difficult to believe, and I'm curious as to what the other approaches they tried were before settling on exposing her chest.","replies":[{"poster":"I Main Swain","date":"2018-04-10T17:19:56.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think you may be kind of confused because your statement coupled with the facts about kaisa and her release kind of contradict each other.  for starters, they didnt reveal kaisa until she was already 99.99% complete, it wasnt like they revealed her to the community then made major edits to her image, those changes were likely made a long time before her release.  also, the intent from riot was that she be very clearly a human wearing a void skin as the core of her character design, it was specifically intended to be contrary what we have seen from the void up to this point which is what most people didnt get.  either way, at the end of the day it was their creative choice to make her appear more human, but thats all besides the point anyways.  getting down to the specifics of making her look more human, keep in mind that they were talking about the in game model, not the splash art.  when you think about it, are there any other ways they could have made her appear more human that would have made sense and still accomplished both the goal having her look human and having the void skin very predominant and realistic?  because i cant think of anything else they could have done that i would have felt made sense.  maaaybe having the upper chest and shoulders exposed instead, but that i dont think would have been any better in either way\n\nps, i apologize if anything sounds condescending or anything because thats not the intent\n\nedit: as a side note i feel like you could have used better examples than taliyah and jinx in your post, because most people dont find taliyah attractive as far as ive seen, and jinx i think could be argued to be fairly sexualized (not in a way thats too far or not fitting to the character but still)","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowGlaive213","date":"2018-04-11T05:38:57.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm aware that those experimentations were earlier in her development. I mentioned them because knowing what these other possibilities they came up with were might help to reinforce their claim that this was the optimal route, and the fact that they did say they tried a few things and that they could've done better means that there exists other ways. The first things that come to mind is playing with her hair. Try cutting it and/or changing it's color. Try changing the size or shape of those wing-like things, or change their position so it doesn't obstruct her head as much. Maybe they tried these things, maybe they didn't, and honestly if making her read more human was that important they wouldn't give you a helmet toggle. My understanding is that it wasn't that she wasn't reading human at all, aside from her shoulder protrusions she looks like she has a human body and a human posture both walking and standing, it's that she wasn't reading human enough for them.\n\nWhile Kai'Sa's design is not what people wanted, even looking at it from the angle of what Riot wanted her to be it isn't successful.

As you said, they've had Rek'Sai (if you really count her), Illaoi, and Zoe as very different designs on female champions.  Producing a conventionally attractive female should still be allowed.\n\nThen again, I'm of the opinion that it's perfectly fine for fictional characters to be disproportionately more attractive than real people on the basis that I'd much rather see pretty people in my games than ugly.  You can say there are other ways to make characters attractive, but there's a reason there's a conventionally attractive character.\n\nI fail to see the harm in having characters that are conventionally attractive.
