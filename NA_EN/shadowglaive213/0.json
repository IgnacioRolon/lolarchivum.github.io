Skill shots don't activate his side step, lowering his HP doesn't cause him to retreat, and he doesn't use abilities when you're in range. He just stands there.\r\n\r\nI don't know what's causing it or how to reproduce it aside from rolling Taric Bot when you play Co-op vs AI, and that he's generally alone when this happens. I feel like I've seen this happen before so I don't think it was introduced in recent patches, and that it has been around for a while.\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/DwfLjp0","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-30T01:17:02.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is waiting for his W-linked ally to get into range so he can cast a doubled spell.
