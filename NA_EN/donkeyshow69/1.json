I mean COME ON, this game is over 6 years old and you still haven&#039;t come up with a system that says, &quot;Hey, this player spent 70% of the game time sitting in the fountain. Maybe his teammates shouldn&#039;t be demoted.&quot; \r\n\r\nBut no. Lose game to DC on your team, get demoted. someone on my team was also in their series.
