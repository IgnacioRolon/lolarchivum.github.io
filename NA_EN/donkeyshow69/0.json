To get from Rank 5 to 7 on your Champion, you have to perform well enough to get at least 2 S-'s and 3 S's on your grading. While I'm not saying you should be Faker-quality to do that, you do have to be able to do well enough with your Champ so that you know what you're doing and can do it consistently. For example, you have to have a certain K/D ratio as an Bot Carry to achieve S-quality grading; die one-too-many times and you'll end up with an A grade. And you have to do this at least in Normals, so while it's not extremely hard it's definitely more challenging than just challenging Bots.\nAs for the chest/key probability, this new Mastery Ranking system is meant to be long-term, showing that you are capable of putting enough time and effort into mastering your Champ with more than just play time.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralimak","date":"2016-05-25T13:13:35.871+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the blue essence requirement doesn't have anything to do with time or effort spent in mastering your champion. In fact, if you don't want to pay for the chests, it requires you to spend time mastering different champions.\n\nIt took me 15 chests to get the 600 blue essence I needed to get one champion up to level 6, meaning that - in order to level one champion up to level 7 - you probably have to open 20-30 chests. With the 4 chests/month limit, you MIGHT be able to get two champions to level 7 each year without buying chests, and you would have to \"master\" 46 other champions enough to get at least one S rank with them. \n\nRiot has said that they will add \"champion-shard-only\" chests that can be bought with IP, which will fix this problem, but it would make more sense if they required a certain number of mastery points in addition to the mastery tokens instead of requiring blue essence. That would actually be an effective indicator of how much time and effort you have spent mastering that specific champion - I have spent time playing it, as you can see by my mastery points, and I have put in effort, as you can see by how many S ranks I have earned.","replies":[{"poster":"Milodic Mellodi","date":"2016-05-26T02:12:44.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While your points are true, there's still the matter of getting the Rank 6 and 7 Tokens which has been pretty much my whole point all along.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralimak","date":"2016-05-26T02:46:34.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No one has ever said anything about the Mastery Tokens not representing champion mastery.
