Just one concern that bothers me is in the Blood Lord Vladimir Skin Spotlight, it appears that the skin contains \"blood-mist\" when he walks around (check the link). In game when I play, it doesn't appear. Any reason why this might have happened? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-05-25T17:56:26.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Arisoul! \n\nIn the future, if you could post bugs [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report), we can make sure they don't get lost. ^-^ \n\nI loaded him up in game, and it does look like the blood mist is there. Are you playing on low/very low settings, by chance? The lower graphics settings you use, the less blood mist you'll see, in order to maximize performance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pasion ","date":"2017-05-27T08:52:27.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you!","replies":[]}]}
