Don't get me wrong though, I do still try in normals, and 95% of the time I play things that make sense. But sometimes if my friends and I want to have fun and try something weird, I try weird shit like vi and sion in the bot lane. We do still try to do good, but playing those champions in the bot lane is not normal in the slightest, but it is fun as hell, which is all that really matters in a game. And I guess by using this logic, if straight up feeding is fun to some people, than they should do it. I'm not trying to justify that, because that's just being a dick.

I think that it is perfectly fine to play an AP Riven, as long as you set her up to still be able to do her job (it's possible).  If she fails at killing, but is still bruising/harassing/initiating?  Let the player be.  They are doing their job, just poorly.  \n\nHOWEVER, that being said... if they are just blatantly trolling, going AFK, or whining about 'Try Hards?'  They should be banned, or remanded to 50 bot games.  \n\nActually, I like the bot games idea... think I'll make a post.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YOLO420SWAGSCOPE","date":"2015-07-11T21:42:35.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"what happened to, \"it's just a game\" ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-07-11T19:23:10.429+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actively trolling is an issue,  normals is where you are supposed to practice stuff right?

The objective of the game is to destroy the enemy Nexus. Just because it&#039;s normals doesn&#039;t mean that you&#039;re allowed to afk in the middle of the game because you don&#039;t feel like playing. Normals also doesn&#039;t mean that you can build AP on riven and feed 0-10.\n> \n> Think about it. If you play basketball with your friends, you score on the opposing team&#039;s hoop because it&#039;s the proper way to play the game. You don&#039;t kick the ball 30 meters away from the court \"just cuz it&#039;s a friendly match lelelele\"\n\nFuck that, ranked is already too stressful with the amount of children who play it and the zero patience they have that just ruins the experience for everyone. If I play norms with my friends, I play it to win but I don't feel the stress and I can try new shit out. Going AP riven is dumb but I don't mind experimenting in norms. Unless you're afk or intentionally feeding, do what you feel like doing. There is nothing to really gain in normals apart from some IP so just have fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Father Cthulhu","date":"2015-07-11T16:00:00.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get what you're talking about, but I'm not gonna take normals as seriously as ranked under any circumstance.

That's why many people play normals and don't give a shit if they lose\n\nIf you really wanted to tryhard balls deep or some shit, go play ranked (or 5s) and you would actually get something out of it.\n\nIt is excusable if someone goes 0/10 because they are practicing unfamiliar champs (because bots don't teach you anything about PVP btw).
