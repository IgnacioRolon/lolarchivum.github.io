I do some skills buy some different items and still have the same problem, so i ask my team, and they realize they arent receiving the extra ap from the deathcap either.

I don't know whether this is true or not, but figured I'd let you know if you want to look into it. :)","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-03-13T16:45:27.684+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't Lux's passive apply magic damage to marked targets?

That the tooltip is false on the bonus ap given.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"IziMytTJd7","date":"2015-03-13T04:03:19.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=caJjPV4A,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-13T03:50:25.008+0000)\n>\n> Looks like this is just a tooltip bug.

Look at your AP: 444.  Your items only add up to 300.  Runes and Masteries can't bring that up to 444.  Therefore, Rabadon's Deathcap had to apply the extra 30%.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IziMytTJd7","date":"2015-03-13T01:34:58.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just checked this out and its legit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sh33rKnurd","date":"2015-03-16T18:55:51.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a lot of the tooltips are bugged, Lich Bane has been giving me whacky numbers all patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boltonator","date":"2015-03-13T16:35:16.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just did a Co-op game and I was only getting exactly 120 AP from the deathcap, no Offensive masteries, just a straight 120 AP increase with no bonus.\n\ni.e it isn't just a tooltip error.","replies":[{"poster":"Ice Weasel X","date":"2015-03-13T17:16:24.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YachiroFirespark,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=caJjPV4A,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-03-13T16:35:16.917+0000)\n>\n> Just did a Co-op game and I was only getting exactly 120 AP from the deathcap, no Offensive masteries, just a straight 120 AP increase with no bonus.\n> \n> i.e it isn't just a tooltip error.\n\nIt doesn't always update your AP immediately.
