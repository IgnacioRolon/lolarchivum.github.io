I understand I was toxic and all but my whole team was too and constantly harassing me. I would understand if I got a chat ban or maybe even a suspension but not a perma ban. They said I was intentional feeding, but I wasn't and had a pretty decent score 22/5/9. I'm just really wondering how I got perma banned without a single warning...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-24T02:14:33.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"After reviewing your account's history, it does actually look like this account went through the standard chat restrictions followed by a timed ban, which then led to this perma.
