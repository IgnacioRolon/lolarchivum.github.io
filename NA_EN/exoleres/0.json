AFKing in particular has a very slow escalation of punishments, so only a few accounts would be necessary for a hired duo booster to take advantage of this kind of AFK forgiveness. And then there are other problems, like players encouraging their low-performing teammates to AFK in order to save the team's LP. Do you want to be told e.g. \"cho ur 1/8 and costing us the game, afk or we report\"?\n\nYour idea has been suggested many times before, always has the same flaw which I explained, and will never - _can_ never - be implemented.","replies":[{"poster":"Exoleres","date":"2019-07-13T02:18:55.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Read the title again.

Neutralizing a loss isn't reward or punishment, it just undoes the last work of a griefing account.\n\nEdit; And there's a way simpler explanation. Human nature is to rage when already losing. There are many cases where a teammate gets so trashed by the enemy they rage in a way that leads to a suspension. Winning is how the game is intended to be played, so that alone makes a huge difference in what is 'deserved.'","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-07-13T23:18:30.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may have made a mistake in assuming your wanting mmr to be forgiven as well as LP. Do you just want lp forgiveness or both?\n\nOne impacts rating inflation the other does not so my bad if I assumed incorrectly.\n\nI don't quite agree that you can have a draw and win as a match result. I feel that the concept of undeserved losses is interchange able with undeserved wins.\n\nI also have a strong bias that you just can't trust the lol community with forgivness because far to many of them will be opportunistic in attempting to exploit it. As you pointed out, losing can bring out an ugly side in some people. I dont agree its human nature so much as some folks are just sore losers. Sportsmanships less common when being a prick runs zero risk of getting punched in the face.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Soul Dealer","date":"2019-07-12T21:24:23.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No one knows.","replies":[]}]}
