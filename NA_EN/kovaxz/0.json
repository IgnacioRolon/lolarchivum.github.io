This happened consistently throughout the game.  I don&#039;t know if this is an intentional thing or if it is a bug but it felt counter intuitive to how things should be working if it isn&#039;t a bug.","replies":[{"poster":"General Elephant","date":"2015-04-29T05:08:32.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"knockups interrupt it, roots simply prevent \"moving\" same reason leona's root doesn't stop corki's W or trist's w","replies":[]}]}
