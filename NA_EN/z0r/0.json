Amumu's ult is like Lissandra's AoE stun, but with different affects. It is not being continuously applied and will not root and stop you from auto attacking if you enter after he casts it.\nGalio's ult taunts anyone who walks into the affect the whole time he channels, and this has the happy bonus affect of keeping them there if they try to QSS.\n\nHope this answered your question.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-04-27T12:39:00.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really. I understood how it worked and thus the effects it created. My question was more about why it worked that way, which is a different way from anything similar in the game, as far as I can tell.\n\nMost stuff that continuously apply their effects are AoE damage/slows (old Malzahar pool, MF Bullets Rain, Graves Smoke, Anivia R, etc.), not instantaneously applied hard CC. Think Amumu, Cassiopeia, etc. you can QSS their effect or walk into the affected zone after the cast but before the end of the effect, and you won't be touched. Galio is an exception, only thing vaguely similar is Sivir ult, that still gives you a buff if you enter the AoE after the initial cast. Supawafle seems to say it's \"because balance\", but I'm not completely convinced.","replies":[{"poster":"PeponiPoro","date":"2016-04-27T23:45:28.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It makes sense to me, but I don't usually understand things other people do, so...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Blitzidious","date":"2016-04-26T23:28:08.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has so many ways of countering it, it'd be pointless if this wasn't an attribute. Any sort of disrupt or silence knocks him out of it, Braum just naturally beats him out of it, and if he ults when he's low health, he's locked down, still taking damage, and if the enemy adc is in there attacking you, you'll more than likely die due to crits before your ult pops to deal damage.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that Galio's ult is extremely predictable, you always know when he's coming in to ult you, due to him either flashing or casting his E.\n\nHIs ult is a powerful tool, but it's extremely reliant on flash, and the enemy not knowing what to do against it, or not having enough time to react to it.\n\nIf QQS were to do that, he'd quite literally have one of the most situationally useful ults in the game, more so than it already is.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-04-26T23:03:31.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana's Black Shield does allow a player to completely walk away from it though, unless the shield gets popped from other means before they leave the taunt area.","replies":[{"poster":"PeponiPoro","date":"2016-04-26T23:21:06.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is because it continuously blocks his his continuous taunt.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Halodjin Tyr","date":"2016-04-26T22:36:32.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=38pIpAk5,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-04-26T19:56:57.483+0000)\n>\n> Yes, that&#x27;s intended.
