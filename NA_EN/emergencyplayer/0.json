I was wondering if anyone else is having this problem with their ping after the update for windows 10?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nEmergency Player","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-30T18:45:30.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some settings may have changed around with the update or an issue with your network that's causing your connection to become unstable and lag.

While playing in a ranked, my friend was getting an unable to connect error upon starting which later resolved itself about 2 minutes into game. My spikes seemed to occur every 6-7 minutes or so as it happened about 6 times in the 30 minute game and my character would freeze as the ping spiked to 3k or so for about 5 seconds. Just finished running an extended ping. Results were as follows for pinging the NA server IP a rioter posted on Reddit about an hour or so after the affected game ended:\n\nPing statistics for 104.160.131.3:\n     Packets: Sent = 716, Received - 715, Lost = 1 (0% loss).\nApproximate round trip times in milli-seconds:\n     Minimum = 54ms, Maximum = 3711ms, Average = 75ms\n\nedit: I believe I got 2, maybe 3 spikes during the ping.","replies":[]}]}
