Sorry, friend!\n\n\n\nDoes the whole  not banning for changing the in game voices still apply? Cause  yeah, I know its a two month old comment, but a ton of things can change in two months.  Cause I really dont want to risk getting a ban if things have changed.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-12-01T06:12:57.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The voice changing feature is still not something that's being actioned on, but again, these applications should be used *at your own risk* as any unapproved third-party applications could be malicious to your system or have features that violate the Terms of Use/EULA.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
