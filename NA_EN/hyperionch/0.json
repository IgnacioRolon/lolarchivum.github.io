So it was a goal-swap and not a step back from hanging out in the community. \n\nOK, that makes sense.\nThe part about account information isn't ingame stuff (like feedback) but it's an important information especially for new players. So when the Code focus mostly new players (and giving feedback is mostly not a new players topic) this move is OK.\n\nBut I have to say that for experienced players in EUW it's a strange sign.\nNow only the the Term of Use has a statement about giving feedback to Riot and there it don't seem that feedback is welcome. The absense of Riot especially in the German board increases this feeling.\n\nAnd with the missing response in the boards (yes, 3 weeks is a little bit too long; but over 16 weeks like in the German Board is really a problem) Riot loses confidence und it seems noncredible when Riot makes statements in the same time that they want feedback from the players.\n\n> Player feedback is one of the most important ingredients in League&#x27;s secret sauce, and we always want it. That will never change at Riot.\n\nIn my opinion, in this case Riot should also focus more the communication in other regions/other languages.\nNot all players speak English and have the skills to write feedback in English. I don't believe that the feedback in the EUW boards are sent to the responsible Riot staff (in NA). When the player support don't ask the responsible team (if they don't know the answer), it's improbably that feedback in the EUW boards reach the responsible team.\nSo a lot of feedback (from players which don't speak English) gets lost.\n\nSo the activity of Riot in the EUW boards should increase strongly. I know that isn't in your responsibility but unfortunately there is no location where I can give this feedback (it don't makes sense to write this in the EUW board: a) because probably no Rioter will read this and b) if a Rioter reads this, it won't be effective because it could feels like a exposure to the Rioter).\n\nBut also at the player support needs a improvement:\n\n- the player support needs a 3rd level support (aka they can asked the responsible team if they cannot answer a question)\n- SPOC-system (aka \"Single Point Of Contact -> I got answers of several support employees in the same ticket and have to explain the topic repeatedly)\n\nIt wasn't a good experience that the player support (EUW and NA) answers my question with \"sorry, we cannot answer the question\" and my suggestion to ask the responsible team with \"no, we couldn't do that\".\n\nAs I wrote (in the other threads): bad experience in the Riot customer service (player support + EUW boards) is the reason why I don't buy RP since 11 months.\nAnd I didn't became the feeling that the staff at the player support / EUW boards likes to improve the service quality. I hope that will change sometime.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Icy Hot Shoto","date":"2017-10-11T20:26:34.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, I believe this was answered before by a Red.

I think that's why I don't get an answer from Riot and not because they ignoring specific players/customers.\n\nIn my opinion, Riot should improve they customer service appreciably. I have also some ideas how they could do this. But I don't think it's worth to give some suggestions if Riot don't want to improve this part of the company or (what I think) my suggestions don't reach the responsible employee because this employee isn't active in the boards and no Rioter trasmit my suggestions to her/him.\n\n> and here is the red tracker:\n> https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/redtracker\n\nAnd here is the German red tracker (please don't laugh):\n\nhttps://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/de/redtracker\n\nbtw. fun fact: compare the positions of the red tracker in the menu here in NA and there in EUW. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Killer3000189","date":"2017-10-11T18:10:47.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on the question","replies":[{"poster":"HyperionCH","date":"2017-10-11T18:22:55.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Killer3000189,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=r40dKU0v,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-10-11T18:10:47.203+0000)\n>\n> Depends on the question\n\nCould Riot tell me why they deleted the part about feedback from the Summoner's Code?\n(the part about giving feedback to Riot)\n\nAnd yes, it's ironic that I get no answer from Riot in this topic. {{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-10-11T18:26:07.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you mean in the Terms of Use and not Summoner's Code?","replies":[{"poster":"HyperionCH","date":"2017-10-11T18:39:36.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Imperial Pandaa,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=r40dKU0v,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-10-11T18:26:07.841+0000)\n>\n> Do you mean in the Terms of Use and not Summoner&#x27;s Code?\n\nThe Summoner's Code.\n\nIn the old Code, there was this section:\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nDrive Constructive Feedback\n\n\"When you confront a problem you begin to solve it.\" -Rudy Giuliani\n\nPlayer feedback is an important force in the decision making process of Riot Games. If you want to make your voice heard, taking the time to let us know how you’re feeling about the game is a good place to start. When you give feedback, make sure you take a holistic approach. If you only give negative feedback, you may find that the changes you influence detract from what you initially enjoyed. Moreover, people are simply more likely to listen if you present yourself in a calm, well thought out manner.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThis topic isn't anymore in the new Summoner's Code.\n\nNow it's only this in the ToU:\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n4.5. Can I submit ideas for improving the Game to Riot?\n\n(**Please don’t. If you do anyways, we’ll have the absolute right to use it forever**.)\n\nWe value your feedback on the Riot Services, but please don’t submit any creative ideas, suggestions or materials to us (collectively, “Unsolicited Ideas”). This policy is aimed at avoiding potential misunderstandings or disputes when the Riot Services might seem similar to Unsolicited Ideas that people submit.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nBecause Riot deleted the feedback-section in the SC, the ToU is really reserved about giving feedback and a got serveral bad experiences in the Customer Service of Riot (get no answer from player support, no response in the (EUW) boards or only after a month, etc.) it seems to me that Riot don't want feedback.\n\nSo to understand more the move of Riot (delete the feedback part in the SC), I asked for the reason. I think there is a reason and it's not a confidential information.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-10-11T18:53:50.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the clarity.
