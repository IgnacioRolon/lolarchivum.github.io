Since 80 I&#039;ve gotten about 3 champions worth 3150 or higher. That wouldn&#039;t even be too bad but if I get a champion I already have, I can&#039;t reroll it. My only option is to sell. Not for it&#039;s value, not for half its value, but less than that. When I hit level 93, pull 3 champions in addition to a pity BE drop and still can&#039;t get a single thing from it...that&#039;s a problem.\r\n\r\nI got 900 B.E. from that pull. Now if I could buy a champion I actually wanted at 40% off that&#039;d still be pretty good. About 4-5 days to level, need 4.2 levels for 3780 so that&#039;s maybe 3 weeks to get the highest tier champ in the game, not bad. Except the reason we&#039;re here to begin with is because I simply don&#039;t see those champions. \r\n\r\nThat&#039;s okay, can&#039;t get high rolls every roll. But even when you get a high roll you&#039;re still just crossing your fingers for the specific high roll you want. The most expensive pools conveniently being the most populated ones. Making it even harder to get a champion you actually want.\r\n\r\nOh and hey buy a season pass for a different event every few weeks so you can get to play the new slot machine more.\r\n\r\nYes you made an excellent game and need to make money somehow. But after the 5th or 6th content wall it&#039;s exploitation not monetization, and not just bad luck. You&#039;re still _leagues_ better than Activision or Bethesda but this is headed in the wrong direction.","replies":[]}
