This nerf will most likely drop Asol&#039;s winrate even harder. One of the reasons why sol is failing in this meta is because phase rush was nothing like stormraiders and Sol can no longer compete with champions like ahri and zed and is out maneuvered easily. \n\nA easy way to fix these problems would be to buff Phase rush, give it slow resistance and an increased duration to better position ones-self. Another large problem aside from the runes is Aurelion sol, unless fed is a DOT champion and with the burst meta he suffers, an increased Q stun duration or more damage on W would bring Sol back to his former glory.\n\nSincerely a worried Sol main rito please help my champion.\n\nEdit:Just to show the drastic change of the \"Keystone\"\n\n_**Phase rush**_\nApplying 3 stacks to a target within a 3 second period grants you 15% - 40% (based on level) movement speed for 3 seconds.\n\n_**Stormraider's Surge**_\nDealing 30% of a champion's maximum health within 2.5 seconds grants you 40% bonus movement speed and 75% Slow Resist for 3 seconds.\n\nHuge difference, losing the 75% slow resistance and 25% movement speed dropped his winrate 4% :(.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2017-11-22T01:13:47.112+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":5,"body":"He wouldn't struggle against hypermoble champions so much, if riot would give him some quality of life buffs, like letting him reactivate his Q to stun enemies in melee range.","replies":[{"poster":"Fairyfleur","date":"2017-11-22T03:34:32.759+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"It would make him so much harder to balance if he could double tap it like Anivia; he wouldn't have many weaknesses.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2017-11-22T06:04:22.517+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"He has less range than most mages without his ultimate, which has a long cooldown.\nAnd still fairly squishy for being some fanfic celestial dragon.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2017-11-22T06:23:43.962+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Being squishy for his lore is not a weakness any more so then just being squishy.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2017-11-22T17:44:59.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then why does ekko get a self revive combined with a nuke?

Since sol has little in terms of CD in his build maybe they should think about giving him !0% cd as a passive on one of his abilities.  This sucks because right now I cant play Sol with phase rush","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Existential Bard","date":"2017-11-22T02:10:00.301+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel that an even better buff would be to make his stars go around him even faster when he uses his W at higher ranks while also reducing the cooldown of reactivating","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-11-22T20:53:57.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't he already max W first?

Phase rush only has 15-25% increase movement speed because these games nowadays ends before you reach level 18. The worst part is you gain no slow resistance lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AP Amumu Main","date":"2017-11-22T07:59:42.959+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I 2 am an Auralion Sol, main (secondarie really since my Amumu baby) --- ---- And I made a post that I forsaw this drastic decline in win rate he needs to have his W nerfs reverted to be somewhat suitable to compete in this day an age, the amount of nerfs Auralion has gotten is harsh combine with the fact he has a  S H it ton of easy to exploit weaknesses please...","replies":[]},{"poster":"waiting for WoW","date":"2017-11-22T06:44:40.423+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except Celerity on Asol becomes meaningless when it makes other champions that are already hyper mobile even more oppressive for him to face.
