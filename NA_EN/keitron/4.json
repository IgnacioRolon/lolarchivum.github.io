Trap is only used to notice enemy jungler blindly walking into it in bushes or to proc her passive. Pounce is used for mobility. E is buffed.\n\nHer early clears are fastest when she starts W, because % HP damage is very powerful against the jungle monsters of S5 who have no resistances but massive HP values in place of them. Bushwhack on a monster loses ~160 damage at level 1 now, and every time she uses Pounce per camp it's 10 extra damage lost.\n\nIf she starts Spear then it's not too important but Bushwhack is better for clearing, so this is a big nerf to Jungle Nid's clear.\n\nLane Nidalee's combo does more damage as long as she has 100+ AP at level 1, 200+ at level 6, 300+ at level 11 and 400+ at level 16. Bushwhack likely never catches up, though.","replies":[{"poster":"ColinFly","date":"2015-02-28T18:09:31.356+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But why nerf her first and second clear where she arguably struggles the most if being played by a summoner who isn't properly trained on her kit or isn't quite the greatest at jungle camp kiting.\n\nHer mid game clear is what needs hit because once she gets a little AP in her she just pounces all over the jungle just absolutely blazing a trail all over the map.","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-02-28T19:07:21.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ColinFly,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AdZ39w9l,comment-id=000700000001,timestamp=2015-02-28T18:09:31.356+0000)\n>\n> But why nerf her first and second clear where she arguably struggles the most if being played by a summoner who isn't properly trained on her kit or isn't quite the greatest at jungle camp kiting.\n> \n> Her mid game clear is what needs hit because once she gets a little AP in her she just pounces all over the jungle just absolutely blazing a trail all over the map.\n\nDon't ask me, I'm not the balance team :P It's possible they think a poor early clear will be a good enough weakness to offset her strong mid clear.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2015-02-28T16:18:43.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> she has 100+ AP at level 1\n\n100 AP at level 1?","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-02-28T16:33:21.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShinobuElveszett,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AdZ39w9l,comment-id=000700000000,timestamp=2015-02-28T16:18:43.745+0000)\n>\n> 100 AP at level 1?\n\nSorry, I wrote that badly.
