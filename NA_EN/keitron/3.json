Anyone that relies on skillshots is gonna have a hard time against her now with her Q mobility, which is the majority of midlaners. Also, let's not forget that the ahri buffs came at the same time as two big assassin nerfs: fizz and akali. Both of their winrates have dropped significantly; if ahri is being picked in the same games as fizz and akali, it's only natural that ahri's winrate will go up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-01-31T17:38:12.187+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's much stronger in lane now.
