I can pretty much only provide assistance against the Riven Nasus and the Annie. \n\n1. If you are vs a riven build early armor and she usually wont be able to hurt you much. Also if you have a hard cc jungler you can ask him for a gank or 2 early on. The final way would be to just counter pick her for example somebody like Garen, she can do little to nothing against a Garen and gets shut down hard against him.\n\n2. I personally find facing a Nasus extremely annoying and almost pointless at times but there are ways to beat him gets countered easily and I personally find him to be a risky pick. I would highly suggest choosing a Teemo because he cant q when he is facing a Teemo it is his hardest match up in my opinion. another way to beat Nasus is to build armor pen to negate his armour which he usually builds. My third form of countering Nasus, is to simply kite him, Nasus gets easily kited due to not having any gap closers and I know it is annoying to kite when slowed but it is possible and very effective against him.\n\n3. Finally for Annie I personally love to play Annie but she is counters rather easily by picking a Leblanc, Leblanc is an easy win against an Annie because Leblanc gets early game pressure at level 3 where as Annie gets her first power spike at level 6 which is also matched by Leblanc. Also whenever Annie's stun is down you can easily go in and get a kill on her because she is just a squishy champ after her CC is taken away from her. Another way to counter Annie is to build against her for example if you are playing an ad champ try to get a Hexdrinker or a Quick Silver Sash either of these are very effective for killing Annie. My final tip for facing Annie is if she is played top try to pick a Irelia into her because the tenacity reduces the stun duration and you can easily burst her your only problem will be possibly depending on your items getting bursted by Tibbers so go in when Tibbers is down.\n\nHope this help you to beat those champs you think are op.
