Tencent acquired a majority in Riot in 2011 (with part equity as early as 2008). In 2015 Riot sold the rest of itself to Tencent. Arena of Valor dropped in 2016, 8 years after Tencent started its acquisition of Riot Games.\n\n\"In 2015, Tencent approached Riot Games and asked them to turn their popular game League of Legends into a mobile title. However, Riot declined and claimed that League of Legends gameplay could not be replicated on smartphones. Tencent then proceeded to create their own mobile game.\"\n\nLooks like Riot fucked themselves on that one, coulda had mad bank but they couldn't see past their own hubris.\n\nOn a side note, Arena of Valor is actually pretty fun~","replies":[]},{"poster":"YambrinZ","date":"2019-03-11T13:41:49.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Trent,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=iVAanQZX,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-03-11T01:35:21.967+0000)\n>\n> I thought you were going to link the mobile game that's made by tencent (the people who own league) that is infact a total rip off.\n\nThat wouldnt be a ripoff if they own both.","replies":[{"poster":"The Trent","date":"2019-03-12T02:03:10.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SunloungerZ,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=iVAanQZX,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-03-11T13:41:49.904+0000)\n>\n> That wouldnt be a ripoff if they own both.\n\nYeah except League of Legends was bought by tencent. I don't remember if they made the rip off before or after they bought league, but League wasn't created by tencent. The mobile app game is a rip off, Riot just can't sue them for it. Still a rip off by my definition. A low effort copy of a game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2019-03-11T15:41:57.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Boy, LoL is nothing, try Civ6 with the disasters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Clone Is Friend","date":"2019-03-11T08:25:33.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"brilliant one gotta say.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hotarse","date":"2019-03-11T05:12:52.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually, ARAM could learn a thing or two from that game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-03-11T03:31:41.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Literally me when the website loaded\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=c03wO8ds2rM","replies":[]}]}
