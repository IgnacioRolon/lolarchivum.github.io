I did not say anything offensive or even swear again in the actual post, I was simply asking why Fiora needed a buff and stating that I thought it was unnecessary. How are these people taking down random content that they disagree with on the boards and NOT getting punished for it? Riot can assign these people to crack down on anything they disagree with, but ragequitters and inters are only being detected after dozens, if not HUNDREDS of games. Season 10 makes or breaks this game, the amount of moderation of the boards versus the amount in the game is intolerable.\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/tOZgvQ6\r\nhttps://imgur.com/6b3xqYy","replies":[]}
