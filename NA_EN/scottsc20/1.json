Instead of attempting to dictate how another person plays, instead figure out how to use your own unique talents to supplement it. For example, I prefer enchanter-based supports (specifically Nami and Lulu) but also like to be a bit aggressive, as sitting and doing nothing all game just feels boring to me. If my laner is also aggressive, great! We just pubstomp the enemy through our overwhelming force the moment one of us lands a catch. If they're more passive, I take more of a zoning role: attempting to simply poke at them without a full commitment instead of going full-auto aggressive, and saving my crowd control for a moment where we *must* fight, since I know my landing it in most other situations is probably going to be a waste of my mana and cooldowns.\n\nIf our jungler is gank-tastic, awesome! I'll rush a sweeper asap and focus on keeping all the paths clear whenever I get a chance. If he's more focused on another lane, or farm heavy, I'll focus far more on keeping our own wards up, and trying to keep vision on the nearest entries to our jungle to try and spot invasions.\n\nNot only does \"you suck noob, go in!\" never get you anywhere but the banlists, it's actually not accurate in most cases: people play the game differently, and part of the challenge is to play your game in a way that doesn't suck for everyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"Scottsc20","date":"2019-03-04T23:58:47.685+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well said.

As Doge said, if you push to tower, go try and place deep wards for your jungler (or you) to invade more safely. Take Scuttle. Take enemy camps. Take herald if possible. Take, take, take. And give as little as possible. Imho, teleport ganks should only be done if you're planning on losing your tower anyway, in exchange for multiple kills bot, bot tower, and dragon (make them pay for your tower by taking from them far more than what you give)\n\nIf the jungler is the shotcaller of your team, and the support is the overwatch of your team, then you as top would be considered more of the backbone of your team. So your job is not necessarily to drive the other team into the ground, more than it is to keep your team standing, even if you take a large hit, by being the most consistent and persistent nuisance possible to the enemy team. If that means you splitpush and take objectives while your team 4v5s, that's how you do it. If it means you group and peel, that's strong too.\n\nBut early game especially, your goal is to simply live, farm heavily, and not give up anything for free.

Maybe I am doing ok, I had a 64% win rate on Garen before I went on a 10 game loss streak, now it is 57%.  I could definitely ward better.

I would say about 20% of the time I lose lane because of a direct counter or I run up against someone who is just better than me (and/or smurfing).  I usually don't die much either, even when I am getting crushed I still don't die that much.  \n\nMaybe the grind is just too long, and my luck is really crap.

It has its merits.\n\nBut lately, I've started to kind of realize that morale plays a big factor in winning/losing a game. If your bot lane is getting destroyed, for instance, everyone is probably cringing at the state of their lane. For the jungle main of an OP, that usually is a sign that he needs to try and turn the tables on the map somewhere, as the jungler. Be that by snowballing you or mid, or be that by coming down and ganking bot to oblivion to try and turn the lane around, there's no \"right\" way to handle it, necessarily...or maybe it's easier to say it'll depend on exactly how its going down.\n\nWhat you can do at top to combat this comes down to 3 things, generally:\n\n- Push in and help secure herald/the whole top side of map (your usual thing, only full-tryhard and taken to an extreme)\n- Try a bunch of ganks with your jungler (roam mid/tp gank bot and hope to take kills/tower/drag)\n- If it's just that your bot lane is countered, you can attempt a lane swap if you and them are confident it'll help.\n\nIssue with lane-swapping is that Riot's positional ranking system is boning that sort of strategy right now as far as how LP works. >.>\nHopefully they change that soon.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dweeebles","date":"2019-03-05T00:07:54.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe I should switch rolls...","replies":[{"poster":"Scottsc20","date":"2019-03-05T00:11:27.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, maybe.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"R107 Games","date":"2019-03-04T23:45:57.089+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scottsc20,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=lqxRgkBE,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-03-04T23:37:29.450+0000)\n\n> If your bot lane dies, don't think \"Wow, they're bad.\" think, \"Okay, the enemy team is probably going to try to take dragon now.\n\nWhy can't I think both?","replies":[{"poster":"Scottsc20","date":"2019-03-04T23:47:46.637+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"I mean, you can.
