Ranked is fun, and at first, the flaming was real bad since it was my first season ever, on season 6.  I made it to Silver 3, promos to 2 twice before the season ended.  Yeah that&#039;s not amazing, but for my first season ever learning TONS of champions, I&#039;ll take it.\r\n\r\nI post this chat log with the guys named removed.  They were playing soraka in ARAMS, and I Zed (a champ I&#039;ve never tried to master, just basic understanding of how he works).\r\n\r\nThis is the POST game chat because i had to mute them in game, due to how annoying it was spamming the chat with down right rude things.  I play ARMS to not be serious - to have fun.\r\n\r\nName: ZED\r\nName: YOU SUCK\r\nName: LOL\r\nName: ROFL\r\nName: JUST UNINSTALL :)\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t feed the trolls (sorry trundle) because it was no longer muted at this point but I  Obviously reported him and I hope he get his account banned, not just a chat restriction.  I hope this game continues to pick up new players, but people like this make it hard to continue playing.  I&#039;ve never been in a game that was so toxic.  It&#039;s insane.","replies":[{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2016-12-14T04:00:19.933+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Whats insane is how sensitive people have become.","replies":[{"poster":"BladeSteel","date":"2016-12-14T04:21:58.634+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly been playing games online for the past 15 years and I haven't seen as many jerks as I have on this game. It isn't sensitivity its the stupidity of people like you who think that its fun to tell someone to \"uninstall\". What did that do besides bully them? What purpose does it solve? Did it help you be a better person? a better player? Did it help them be a better person or player? then why say so? What is the point?\nyes trash talking has been around forever. But I miss the old days when you kill someone and you say \"lol noob ;)\" or they kill you and you say \"WHAT A HACKER\" etc etc. Now its just \"KYS\" \"UNINSTALL TRASH\" \"I HOPE YOU GET CANCER\". One is funny and in good fun, the other is stupidity.","replies":[{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2016-12-14T04:26:55.425+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Its 100% sensitivity. If the statement \"LOL YOU SUCK\" is enough to make someone want to quit the game, then that person should not even be using the Internet. \n\nI think if you yourself have been playing online games for 15 years, you'd understand. Can you honestly imagine people getting so upset over something like \"you suck\" back then? In case you don't remember, they didn't.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-14T04:54:45.678+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Online games went mainstream, average player ages dropped about 15 years over the last 15 years.\n\nand the rest is history.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cr3ator","date":"2016-12-14T04:53:34.178+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the post game chat, the guy is classless a hole.    I wish I had the logs of in game...\n\nIn 99% of games, it's the person who rages out because they're sucking that starts the trash talking.  In league it's people who know their better, go out of their way to tell you how bad you suck and you should go kys/uninstall.  \n\nI was an original xbox online player where trash talking was the normal, but 99% of the time it's started from someone raging because they were LOSING, not nearly the same in this game.\n\nEdit:  The post was about why new people don't stick around.  I played the entire season, but had I not been introduced via a friend, which got me hooked I probably wouldn't of stuck around dealing with this pretty much every other game.  Picking a game up off the shelf and trying it out so to speak, doesn't retain it's new users when you see this so much.","replies":[{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2016-12-14T05:00:49.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would understand the point you were making much more clearly if you had a better example. Saying  \"lol u suck/uninstall\" is completely different from telling someone to kill themselves. And c'mon now with that last part. If you played Halo 2 back then, you know that people trash talked constantly regardless of if they were winning/losing. That community would make Leagues look good.\n\nAs for keeping new players, I think a larger issue is how prominent smurfing is and the fact that there is no decent tutorial to teach new players the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WilliTheWit","date":"2016-12-14T13:15:25.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It may or may not be sensitivity; however that doesn't matter.\n\nI personally don't bother about such insults anymore. I report them and go on. And I have not been playing online games for long.\n\nIn general, much like in real life, I would expect people to show some decent behaviour. I can separate between someone who is momentarily salty or pissed off because we may lose the game, and who then throws some one-time bad remarks out to his or the enemy team -- and someone who constantly insults his mates & opponents because he is just used to do so. I call that bad education. (And I bet they are not much different IRL).\n\nThe latter sort of people doesn't restrict him/herself to just throwing \"noobs\" etc., and the latter sort of should experience some serious consequence. I'm not sure whether a permanent ban is a solution. But there must be consequences which hurt. (Losing skins, ranks and goodies on an existing account **does** hurt, I guess).\nSo for me the question is not how it was 15 years ago, and the question is not that this in an online game. It is all about how we deal with each other.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BladeSteel","date":"2016-12-14T06:11:40.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah you suck isn't that bad. but what is the point of telling someone to uninstall?
