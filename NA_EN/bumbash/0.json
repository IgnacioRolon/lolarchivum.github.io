The new Mordekaiser is lackluster as a solo laner but in my opinion he is a very strong bot lane carry now. It is very different from supporting an adc because Morde does well with an aggressive style. I need less protection than  a normal adc but instead i need others to initiate and hold the enemy down while i bring down the pain.\r\nMorde is a very snowbally carry who has a good early laning phase and very strong mid game. What I need is an aggressive tanky support with good initiate. cc is important and peel is nice. If you can play Nautilus, Leona, Thresh, Blitz, Alistar (only if you're good with the combo) that is optimal, but Morgana, Lulu, and Nami are decent too.\r\n\r\nPlease post with:\r\ncurrent rank \r\ntop 3 supports\r\ntimes you are free to play (I'm in Jerusalem Time Zone)\r\nhow much ham can you handle?","replies":[{"poster":"BumBash","date":"2015-08-29T15:55:54.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-08-24T21:26:47.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd offer to help you if I didnt like playing him so much XP\n\nUnranked fyi","replies":[]},{"poster":"BumBash","date":"2015-08-24T21:17:09.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pls?
