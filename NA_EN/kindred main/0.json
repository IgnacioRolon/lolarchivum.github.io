To be more specific, 962 days. Which is over two and a half years.  While keeping that in mind, Kindred wasn't Ivern ( I apologize for saying this, but U got what I mean ) that have such a small player base. I understand how making skins for popular champions will make more money, but please don't just completely forgot that some champs that exist. And also, there are some high-quality Kindred skin concepts out there that are REALLY good ( I posted 3 of my favorite ones ) but seems like that It will never happen. Half of the champs that have lower play rate than Kindred already received 1 or even 2 skins after the last Kindred skin released, and over 90% of them have over 2 skins. \r\nRoyal Kindred\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/CxqYW51\r\nPopstar Kindred\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/INuuOyn\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/OBzcZDQ \r\nElderwood Kindred\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/8rVshYL\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/zVV4wWy\r\n\r\nIs Kindred going to get a skin somewhere around this year or Riot will just treat them like Rek'Sai #2?","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-08-30T15:01:34.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} {{champion:267}} Spooky when long dead threads come back from the grave!\n\nWhile the art of thread necromancy can be useful in some cases, this unfortunately, is not one of those times.
