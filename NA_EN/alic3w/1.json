My ping has doubled to a ridiculous amount. Reinstalled the game, even renew my entire pc by restarting everything. \r\nI did a log check with the service riot provided and it says i have a ridiculous percentage of my package loss. Contacted my isp and they said they didnt find any problem with my internet. Does anyone else have problems ? If there is a solution please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-24T22:18:39.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're already sure that the main issue is coming from that packet loss, there's sadly not going to be much we can do from our end. Packet loss happens before your connection even reaches our servers, which is why it can mess things up so much. I'd suggest running a traceroute to our NA servers at 192.64.170.1 using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/). The data you get from that traceroute should be more ammo that you can use to let your ISP know that something isn't working as well as they think.\n\nIf you're still not getting anywhere, reach out to our techies in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so that they can help you get this sorted out!","replies":[{"poster":"Alic3W","date":"2017-09-25T10:00:28.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is what i have i have no clue what it means~ would be nice if you can answer me.\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                             192.168.0.1 -    0 |   58 |   58 |    0 |    1 |    2 |    1 |\n|                             10.36.128.1 -    0 |   58 |   58 |    6 |    9 |   13 |   10 |\n|                             10.4.18.153 -    0 |   58 |   58 |    7 |   10 |   16 |   10 |\n|    211-76-114-254.static.kbronet.com.tw -    0 |   58 |   58 |    7 |   10 |   17 |    9 |\n|        219-80-240-185.static.tfn.net.tw -    0 |   58 |   58 |    7 |    9 |   18 |    8 |\n|          60-199-4-153.static.tfn.net.tw -    0 |   58 |   58 |    7 |   13 |   35 |   14 |\n| xe-0-1-0.r00.taiptw02.tw.bb.gin.ntt.net -    0 |   58 |   58 |   38 |   43 |   70 |   38 |\n|     ae-2.r20.taiptw01.tw.bb.gin.ntt.net -    0 |   58 |   58 |   41 |   48 |   86 |   44 |\n|    ae-24.r31.tokyjp05.jp.bb.gin.ntt.net -    7 |   46 |   43 |   38 |   42 |   57 |   40 |\n|     ae-3.r03.tokyjp05.jp.bb.gin.ntt.net -    0 |   58 |   58 |   38 |   43 |   49 |   42 |\n|     ae-1.a00.tokyjp06.jp.bb.gin.ntt.net -    0 |   58 |   58 |   38 |   45 |   69 |   45 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|        ae-2-52.ear2.Seattle1.Level3.net -   85 |   13 |    2 |    0 |  252 |  257 |  248 |\n|                             4.35.241.86 -    7 |   44 |   41 |  229 |  233 |  241 |  233 |\n|                          104.160.129.44 -    7 |   46 |   43 |  224 |  235 |  247 |  233 |\n|          ae30-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    7 |   46 |   43 |  275 |  281 |  290 |  282 |\n|                         104.160.131.101 -   10 |   42 |   38 |    0 |  307 |  317 |  307 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T20:13:12.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry about the late respond, but your reply came in during the middle of the night when I wasn't working (even poros gotta sleep), but thanks for that traceroute! \n\nSo that connection is bouncing all over the place for some really weird reason. I'm seeing both Taiwan, Tokyo, and Seattle all in the same trace which probably shouldn't be happening. This might be happening because of some really awkward VPN settings or something, but it could actually just be your ISP doing something really weird.
