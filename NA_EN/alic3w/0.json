And let us take a moment and collect all the thread and post JUST this week, about ping doubled issues  disconnection problems or client unable to start because of discord. ISNT IT CLEAR ENOUGH that there is sth wrong from the riot service side ? Its not just ONE SINGLE PERSON riot!!! common {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n\n\ni seen another exact or 2 post that has that  no response from host problem. AND AALLLL YOU SAY IS GO TALK TO YOUR ISP and give us this connection fix  thing with our firewalls and  cancel peer to peer  suggestions which i dont think most of us suffer because of that. And if we did we would prob have fixed that because we can read - ___- \nbut REALLY  just submitting a ticket and it will be fine? NO WAY my friend told me you guys just simply post the exact same thing from the FAQ  {{sticker:sg-ahri-3}} \n\nIM SORRY IF IM USING THE CAPLOCKS AND I SOUND REALLY PISSED, BECAUSE ITS BEEN DAYS THIS PROBLEMS HAS HAPPENED AND THERE IS NOT EVEN A SINGLE THING YOU GUYS FEEL SUSPENDED ?????\n\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                             192.168.0.1 -    0 |   58 |   58 |    0 |    1 |    2 |    1 |\n|                             10.36.128.1 -    0 |   58 |   58 |    6 |    9 |   13 |   10 |\n|                             10.4.18.153 -    0 |   58 |   58 |    7 |   10 |   16 |   10 |\n|    211-76-114-254.static.kbronet.com.tw -    0 |   58 |   58 |    7 |   10 |   17 |    9 |\n|        219-80-240-185.static.tfn.net.tw -    0 |   58 |   58 |    7 |    9 |   18 |    8 |\n|          60-199-4-153.static.tfn.net.tw -    0 |   58 |   58 |    7 |   13 |   35 |   14 |\n| xe-0-1-0.r00.taiptw02.tw.bb.gin.ntt.net -    0 |   58 |   58 |   38 |   43 |   70 |   38 |\n|     ae-2.r20.taiptw01.tw.bb.gin.ntt.net -    0 |   58 |   58 |   41 |   48 |   86 |   44 |\n|    ae-24.r31.tokyjp05.jp.bb.gin.ntt.net -    7 |   46 |   43 |   38 |   42 |   57 |   40 |\n|     ae-3.r03.tokyjp05.jp.bb.gin.ntt.net -    0 |   58 |   58 |   38 |   43 |   49 |   42 |\n|     ae-1.a00.tokyjp06.jp.bb.gin.ntt.net -    0 |   58 |   58 |   38 |   45 |   69 |   45 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|        ae-2-52.ear2.Seattle1.Level3.net -   85 |   13 |    2 |    0 |  252 |  257 |  248 |\n|                             4.35.241.86 -    7 |   44 |   41 |  229 |  233 |  241 |  233 |\n|                          104.160.129.44 -    7 |   46 |   43 |  224 |  235 |  247 |  233 |\n|          ae30-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    7 |   46 |   43 |  275 |  281 |  290 |  282 |\n|                         104.160.131.101 -   10 |   42 |   38 |    0 |  307 |  317 |  307 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   11 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting &amp; Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T20:17:50.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, sorry I wasn't able to respond to your several other posts until just now. You just so happened to respond during the boards off-time, which is why there's a section unanswered and it looks like nobody was doing anything. I just got in to work myself, and you'll see that you've got another respond in your first reply to me already.\n\nSecond, as you'll see in my other reply, that traceroute data is *pretty* messed up. Your ping spikes are happening because your connection is being sent literally all across the world for some strange reason. I can't say 100% what's going wrong with just that information, but it looks like it could possibly be an ISP issue or something else that's bouncing your connection all across the globe.  \n\nI'm not trying to give you the run around with suggesting ISP issues or forwarding you to a ticket. ISP's aren't immune to having problems, and it definitely looks like the data might back that up with this problem. The best way to get to the bottom of what's going on here is a little more investigation, which is *much* easier and quicker to do in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shaco Danko","date":"2017-09-25T17:10:39.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem since this afternoon, started around 3 PM.\nAlso i must add, that i used regedit to fix my lags before this happend, and it actually worked!\nBut...
