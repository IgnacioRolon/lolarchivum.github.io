They actually brought in live balance guys (frankly I'm surprised they even showed their face, the way a lot of people are upset at that particular department the past month or so) to \"explain\" why they did what they did, even though what they explained was counter-intuitive of the truth.\n\nOne of the more ludicrous things I remember from the rundown was \"Sivir has very short range, so beating her up with Caitlyn is a very good option in lane\" (paraphrased only slightly)\n...\n...\n...Sivir is like the best counter to Caitlyn. Spell Shield basically negates an entire ability of Caits (traps) which gives her endless mana to continuously spam Boomerang Blade all day, making up for range immediately. She never actually HAS to get in Caits range, lol. Dont forget she can Spell Shield Cait's ult too!\nArguably there are ways for Cait to outplay, but that line just floored me for a second watching that video.\n\nThis line came from a \"Live Balance Team\" member. I lost a LOT of faith right there and then. It's the first time I actually ever felt this way towards the live balance team.\n\nNext up: Kassadin is mentioned. They claim to have balanced him around competitive play, saying he stamps out picks because he's super oppressive. The only example they give of picks stamped out? Lux. A champion that was seen once (to my current knowledge) in the past 2 seasons in competitive play (HotShotGG played her when he subbed midlane at one point.) BTW, he lost. Miserably. And not to a Kassadin either. Logic.\n\nI feel like they just kind of skimmed over the fact that Veigar could potentially achieve the same amount of AP that he can now post Q-rework. Sure he can hit 2 minions at once now, but unless they forgot... the *same amount of minions spawn each wave.* Veigar players have been extremely vocal about this fact, claiming that they could easily get most if not all of the minions per wave anyways when it was a single target ability. So the net gain of AP over the course of the game is literally 0. It's now just *\"easier to obtain\"* That's where I feel true Veigar players feel cheated, because he received a delay on his E (personally I do agree with this mechanical change. It makes sense; though .75 second may be a touch high), but also R got toned down. So overall, it's basically a full nerf. They called them buffs (9:50 in video).\n\nThese are just the primary examples that stood out to me. I did indeed watch the video a couple times to actually go over all the changes in my head and actually think about how they affect the games current live status.\n\n\nTo me, it just feels like they are trying to fix the leaky sink while ignoring the overflowing toilet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"B3ER","date":"2015-02-26T22:15:39.666+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I successfully pulled off jungle Alistar today.

People who are not in that group (us) find the changes out of touch and appear like favoritism towards specific champions by not touching them.\n\nThe Balance Team most likely gets feedback from people they talk to in the office, the most vocal posts on reddit/boards, and their metrics. The problem is these is that they only give a slice of the game, and even worse, metrics can be incorrect or manipulated as UPS is now going to have to be dealing with thanks to their Telematics system having bad data due to driver gaming the system so they don't get punished, which is simply a human thing that happens when someone knows they are being monitored.\n\nRiot is going to need to do a lot of work to rebuild trust and improve constructive communication with feedback. When people don't trust you, they view you with animosity. When there is no constructive communication, people begin to resent you.\n\nThe last thing that needs to be fixed is the Gameplay Balance forum itself. Threads like these are born out of the mistrust people have for Riot and posting gameplay feedback gets buried under the resentment people currently have for Riot. This isn't constructive for anyone. The Gameplay and Balance forum should be for balance itself, not questioning if riot even listens or if such posts are even worth our time.\n\nRiot will need to make major strides, as will we. This last point will not work without both sides coming to an agreement. If we change and Riot doesn't, these threads will simply bubble up again and it will revert to how it is and the mistrust will only grow stronger. If Riot changes and we don't, it will simply reinforce for them that we just need a place to vent instead of help improve the game and just try and run damage control as they move forwards with their changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sethrock","date":"2015-02-27T22:44:25.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"preach","replies":[]},{"poster":"Newb the Legend","date":"2015-02-27T20:08:57.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can jungle with Noct, I just choose not to if Vi isn't banned because she can dominate through the whole game and doesn't fall off as hard compared to Noct","replies":[]},{"poster":"shadecrapper","date":"2015-02-27T18:08:23.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They aren't doing a good job are they?

The random whack-a-mole champion nerfs are discouraging, as well as the consistent and seemingly misguided nerfs to jungle, sure, but the frequency of reworks and systemic changes, again even though/if they prove problematic in the short term, it *seems to me* at least that the game is on the upswing, and that Riot might actually be working to fix some of the long standing issues that have worked their way into the game over the years. It probably means the game is going to be out of whack for a while, but I think/hope it'll be better in the long run.\n\nIn the mean time, the game is still far from unplayable, especially in solo q (you can get away with most things in solo q), there are always ways to adapt; I've changed my main many, many times, and I've learned to play old mains well enough to bypass some of the balance issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoblePeace","date":"2015-02-27T03:37:45.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I respect Riot for all that they've done to make changes, but honestly I feel there not taking a proper direction. For example, yay a new support champion that can zhonyas a whole team, but why can't Taric make plays with his gems? I use to see everyone agree they'd rather see new defined older champions made new again, but now we have a new op champ coming out in place of, maybe instead of buffing the game we're slowly leaving behind we can just get rid of half of the older champs and start over? One thing is for certain, though, you often see the same champions, every match, and what we said might be read or might be ignored, my opinion is simple if you move forward you have to pickup your feet, if you don't pickup your feet then you're hardly moving forward.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-02-26T21:53:24.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"welcome to the club bro, membership fees is 2800 RP a month\nenjoy your stay","replies":[]},{"poster":"kep67565","date":"2015-02-27T17:01:17.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"PraetorDon, I'm so proud of you for writing this post.
