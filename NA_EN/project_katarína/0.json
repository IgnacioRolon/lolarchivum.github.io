League installs. I get into game and fail to connect. Open league client. Whole game reinstalls a second time. Takes 20 minutes so team remakes and it counts as a leave. Patch 7.11 comes out and I install it. A few hours later, after playing multiple games, I take a break. I come back and play another game. League says my network is not connected or something like that. I restart the client and 7.11 installs for the  second time. Team remakes and I come back to see that someone said \"Report this mother\". Moral of the story, don't install updates.\r\n\r\nWould be much appreciated if I could get help with this, it'll probably just happen once every patch, but if I'm in ranked, that would suck, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-02T01:21:05.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like something went wrong the first time you were installing the patch if it reverted due to some corrupted files. If this keeps happening, I would try running a **Force Repatch** using the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool), and you also might see better results with patching by using a hardwired connection, but definitely hit me back up if that isn't helping.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Katarína","date":"2017-06-02T02:56:38.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks ill try that","replies":[]}]}]}
