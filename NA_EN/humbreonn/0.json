I had the best kda on team, i warded more then any one else. I only got an A. My jungler  (21-6-9) who i made into a god and let them carry got an S+ and my adc who had an ok game (7-9-13) got an S-. I have a lvl 6 mastery on {{champion:25}} with a S+ for 1 lvl 7 mastery token. I guess i suck? maybe i have to go like 2-0-26? maybe my 6 deaths was considered feeding?

The system doesn't know that tho. Anyway, as I said, I've had worse games than that and got better grades.\nThis game, for example:\nhttp://matchhistory.br.leagueoflegends.com/pt/#match-details/BR1/841072782/673499?tab=overview\n34 wards at 51. Got a S.\n\n> You bought only 1 pink ward. \n\nThat's my bad. Doesn't justify a B tho.\n\n> Your gold generation was low, meaning u didnt utilize your gold income item properly\n\nAs I said, I was solo at the lane. Trying to farm under tower, and even if a wasn't, how am I supposed to auto attack the enemy in a 2x1 lane?","replies":[]}]}]}
