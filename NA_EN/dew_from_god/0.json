Sorry for being impatient but I dont want to play untill this is solve :/ I lost motivation for lvling because of this.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-07T16:33:41.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems you didn't get a reply to your ticket yet because you replied (\"bumped\") it before a specialist responded, which sent it to the back of the queue. I can answer your question here, though. \n\nThe Hextech Chest content that you open is essentially random, with the only modifier being that it prioritizes giving you content that you don't already own.
