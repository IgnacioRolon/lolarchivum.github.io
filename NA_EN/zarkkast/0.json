And I don't mean only because the current meta doesn't allow champions like her to shine.\n\nLet's start with her in-game model.\n\nThis is it:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/hSejHJz.png\n\nIt totally gives an obvious answer to classic line: \"don't you find me beautiful?\"\n\nWhile it's nice she receive a splash art upgrade her texture hasn't changed since and she still looks like her old splash.\n\nThis was her old splash:\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=1012761&d=1405131067\n\nPretty awful.\n\nThis is her current one:\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Cassiopeia_0.jpg\n\nNow I can see she's actually beautiful.\n\nAs you can see, her ingame model still looks like the old splash art: her claws are black (in the new splash they're gold), the jewelry on her head is black (in the new splash they're red, be noted that this is wrong even for her old splash which shows purple jewelry) and she still has those weird lines coming out of her hip. Also the details on her bra and hip armor also reflect the old spash. But on top of it all: her face looks horrid. It just looks awful, awful, awful. Also her scales don't look at all like scales. For comparison this are her Mythical and Jade Fang models:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/aZHYNA0.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2zukWry.png\n\nThese two models look beautiful, you really want to play Cassiopeia when she looks like this. She looks like an actual serpent. Her scales look realistic and her face is really pretty.\n\nI know she's in no way priority. There are champions there that need a VU much more than her, I mean, look at Sion, for instance. But the main reason I'm creating this is that Cassiopeia looks really bad, but not bad enough to be remembered, I have never seen any rioter commenting on a visual upgrade for her and I really do think she needs one. Also, since we're talking about ingame model, her tail movement is very awful. I mean, look at Vel'koz and then look at her and you'll see it's possible to make her tail look much more realistic.\n\nIn case you were wondering, her other two skins models also look rather bad, specially Desperada, whose dress looks like it's a part of her body, but still the main problem remain at face and scales (also, the rattlesnake rings are really poorly made):\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/n7UXok1.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PJt3G98.png\n\nEDIT:\nBrought up by Flemman, when Cassiopeia dies she switches automatically to her classic skin model (except when using Jade Fang skin)\nVideo of it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNXm5YPVEDU\n1:36 You can see that when Mythic Cassiopeia breaks she becomes her classic model (pay attention to her head).\n\n-----\n\nNow, as for quality of life, Cassiopeia really needs minor changes that will make playing her feel like you're playing against other people, not against the game:\n\n1) Her Twin Fangs (\"E\") need to consider the cooldown reset on cast, not on enemy hit. Why? Sometimes you cast your E on an enemy and before it hits it the poison ends and the cooldown doesn't reset. ALSO: if you cast your E on a target and it dies before your E hits it also doesn't reset. Now, I don't know if many of you guys play Cassiopeia, but a missing E reset in the middle of a team fight can often mean her death. (I'm not saying the cooldown reset should be applied on cast, but that the binary system of reset should be considered on cast: Is the target poisoned? Yes - reset. No - doesn't reset.)\n2) Her Q hitbox needs to be more clear, the same problem with Karthus before his rework. This not only helps Cassiopeia, but people playing against her, cause more often than not the poison will apply even if the target doesn't look like it was hit. You guys should add the size of the hitbox the same way you did for miasma (\"W\"). If you play Cassiopeia using the Jade Fang skin this isn't much of a problem because the spell animation is clearer, but a hitbox size is still needed. \n3) The delay on her ultimate makes it really easy to be dodged or cc'd. Several times I ulted and was, for instance, hit by Tristana's ultimate and my ultimate instead of going the direction I wanted too went to a completely different direction, meaning that not only it went on cooldown, but also it hit nothing. And obviously resulted in my death. \n4) Her ultimate hitbox is problematic (taken from this thread: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/live-gameplay/oK21Zbjg-riot-remember-cassiopeia)\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=888550&d=1391354284\n\"As we can see, enemies like Lee Sin who can easily jump unto Cassiopeia automatically avoid getting hit by Petrifying Gaze. Sure, you might say that's intended due to the animation but I'd like to raise another question.\"\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=888549&d=1391354276\n\"How come something like this is allowed to exist? Lee is clearly getting damaged despite staying BEHIND the source of Luxana's laser. Why can't Cassiopeia recieve the same treatment?\"\n\n--------\n\nI really hope some of you address this, because I have never seen any of you talk about Cassiopeia and it's really awful how you guys put certain champions on a pedestal while completely ignoring other champions' existance.","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2014-07-22T06:44:25.644+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think we could get away with probably at least a TU until we really have the tools to make that slither really feel good.

The same with Cass's tail.\n\nTentacles/snake tails are rough due to the long joint chains through them. They're pretty taxing to animate, but more importantly almost impossible to engine blend between animation sets without very noticeable unwanted problems (like their tail straightening out). With Bipeds you might get a foot slide, but that's not as noticeable as a giant tail, and sometimes even works okay like the character just put their foot back into position. You never slide your tail back into position as a snake-lady. That's what all your weights on so it has to slither.\n\nVel'koz was animated the way he was to avoid these issues as much as possible. Luckily I think this helped give him a much more unique way he moves with his tentacles that rather than them just trailing behind him. \n\n\nThere are some tricks we could try on Cass to help alleviate some of the problems when the time comes. Back in her day we didn't even have \"idle-ins\" which is an animation that plays before a character goes into their idle. This is typically a settling animation. You can see it on all new characters simply by moving and stopping.\n\n\nCass animation spotlight:\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAVU0SdXjpY)","replies":[{"poster":"PhailRaptor","date":"2014-07-23T03:20:15.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imho the thing that has always bothered me most about Cassi is her movement animation.  But not because of the tail itself.  It's the fact that, when she goes to move, her hips do not \"fall\" down to the ground.  With her current animations, it almost looks like she has her legs together,  and is slaloming downhill on a pair of rollerblades hidden inside the tail, rather than using the tail to slither along the ground.  It looks incredibly silly and goes against basically every single portrayal of the Medusa archetype I've ever seen.  It basically looks like, when Cassi was put together, they took a human from the hips up, and attached it to a snake from the neck down.  This is convenient, because it allows her to retain more of a \"human\" height, but it just plain looks bad.\n\nHow I imagine it, using the above LoLking model viewer screenshots from the OP, is that central point at the bottom of the gold hip-band armor piece should almost be touching the ground when she slithers, as she rolls her weight forward out of the \"perching\" I'm-gonna-strike-you stance that is her current \"standing\" animation set.  All her movement would be in this lower stance, then when she comes to a stop again, she'd roll back up.\n\nThe only reason I can potentially think of that might be bad for this approach would be further confusion over the size and placement of her hitbox, because in addition to her having a long tail inflating it's length in front of and behind her, you're now also messing with her visual height.\n\n> There are some tricks we could try on Cass to help alleviate some of the problems when the time comes.

His in particular is really jarring, given how sudden it is and how huge it is.   And it's not the only one.  Lucian feels kind of awkward at times as well, purely due to how massively pronounced, and how suddenly they play.  For TF specifically, given his moderately slow speed, he pulls up as if he were running really fast as opposed to that easy gait he's doing, then does that sort of hop-step like he's trying to catch his balance -- but he was never going anywhere near that fast in the first place.\n\nCan we go back and tone some of those down a bit, and try not to go overboard in the future?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2014-07-22T21:21:23.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How come the model in the editor is superior in terms of textures and overall aesthetics compared to the one you decided to use ingame?
