Obviously, Demacia and Noxus were still at each others throats, but they were upstart and not anywhere near where they are now, but everywhere else, which I take to be either with the King, or minding their own business, was at relative peace. And then the King corrupted the Shadow Isles, and chaos spread. Over time, the city-states as we now know them emerged, places like Zaun and Piltover, and suddenly, everything was chaotic.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
