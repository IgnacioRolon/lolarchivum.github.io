Aka everything they spent their money on. If not then they have no reason NOT to be toxic. You can now just buy accounts with tons of skins which is easier then lvling to 30 then rebuying them all.

The thing about people like that is that they just lack self control, it's simply beyond them to curb their impulses. It's like putting a steak in front of a starving dog and expecting it not it eat it. They WILL keep being toxic not matter how big the punishments or rewards may be, so the only thing Riot can do is to try to get them to go and stay go.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-11-03T03:10:22.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've heard different reasons from different people.  \n\n[Riot Tantrum](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/ZZkQvApM-new-feature-one-time-permaban-buyback?comment=000600000000) pretty much stated that perma-bans are meant to remove players from the community rather than reform them.

That alone makes it difficult for a player to prove their claims that they also own this other account that's bound to a different email. How is Riot to know that you're not being a good boy to free up your super toxic buddy's account? Secondly, basing it on IP addresses does not constitute as being the same owner. I see players playing in my local game store, so again, there is no way to prove that 2 separate emails are owned by the same person, and therefore, no way to prove that two separate accounts belong to the same person. As for \"autobans\" I don't think that's a real thing, considering that Riot has only announced 1 forever ban, and imaqtpie was not that person.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-11-02T16:34:28.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"NOPE \n\nshouldnt of been a naughty boy and got banned at all in the 1st place","replies":[]}]}
