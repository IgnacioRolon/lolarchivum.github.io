We all know there are three ways to cast a spell in league: normal casting, quick casting, and clicking the spell. It is all about the preference. I personally like quick casting all my skills and I feel like I can never go back to just normal casting. \r\n\r\nBut some skills are just not meant to be quick cast. Normal casting has an option to quick cast using Shift+(the skill). I was wondering if it could work the other way around. I think there should be a key to press to normal cast something that was set on quick cast.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Acidic Puddle","date":"2015-04-08T15:28:26.931+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go into hotkeys in settings and you can do that.

At least i think.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fried Noob","date":"2015-04-08T14:56:00.157+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's an option that shows skill range with quick cast that allows you to \"hold\" a skill until you want to use it.","replies":[{"poster":"Thelmon","date":"2015-04-08T17:56:26.494+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick cast Range Indicators.
