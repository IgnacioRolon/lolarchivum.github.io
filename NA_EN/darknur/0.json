This means you can have W up permanently(even 2 sometimes) in fights which is a solid damage increase.\n\nYou're not actually reading patch notes. They nerfed the snot out her 2 days after the initial rework. 2 Sec longer base cooldown on W (makes the net cooldown reduction only 1.33 sec shorter than the old W after procs)\n\nOnly heals 20% off 1 minion per 2 waves, vs up to 8.66 per minion in EVERY wave. That's a net 13 minions per 2 waves, or 112% spell vamp vs a 20%. (56% at lower levels) If you add in a champion, it's 40% vs 120.8% or 60.4%.\n\nIn all worlds, the heal is worse on mid. The W change is a net positive, but it also risks situations where you don't have a cannon minion or a champ in the proc, putting you out 2 more seconds of using it, so it's not always worth that net 1.33 second reduction in cooldown.\n\nMorg has higher win rates because old players who shelved her but still know how to play her pulled her off the shelf. That's going to disappear. And, at the same time as her \"win rate\" went up, her deaths and assists soared, meaning these morgs were literally kamikaze ulting, which is viable, given' R's huge base damage. If she can pull it off, it's a guaranteed 500+ damage to an entire team, if not much more if AP. That doesn't speak to balance; it suggests people are abusing a feature to pull off statistical wins while destroying their KDA, kind of like Singed does. And nothing changed about her ult. Just the playstyle around it.","replies":[{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2017-12-20T02:19:47.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Morg has higher win rates because old players who shelved her but still know how to play her pulled her off the shelf.\"\n\nI admit that this is a cunning strategy for ignoring the statistics that contradict your point in favor of your anecdotes, but do you have a single fact to back this up?","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2017-12-20T07:32:24.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Attticus Finch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=O8lxMWIu,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-20T02:19:47.644+0000)\n>\n> &quot;Morg has higher win rates because old players who shelved her but still know how to play her pulled her off the shelf.&quot;\n> \n> I admit that this is a cunning strategy for ignoring the statistics that contradict your point in favor of your anecdotes, but do you have a single fact to back this up?\n\nThe pick rate went from around 2% to 4-5% over the duration of the patch. Those players came from somewhere. Many from old Morg mains, like myself.\n\nAnd, you're conveniently ignoring the fact that During these patches, Morg was #1 in deaths and assists, even though none of the changes should have caused something like that.","replies":[{"poster":"SB Arneeman","date":"2017-12-20T11:32:26.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She doesn't effectively have worse sustain really.

As a safe wave clearer you should not be taking that much damage anyway.\n\nThe Wraith camp discussion is subjective to your jungle and lane pressure, but you could do that before too. It's still only 1 target that heals you, same as a minion wave, and you're wasting it on the camp rather than your wave early game.\n\nI generally agree on the latter point. No. Morg is one of the most passive mid lane farmers. I'll give you that. However, if it's a high pressure lane vs someone who is good at over minion poking, and making your lane phase miserable, like Talon, Kat, Vlad, Fizz, Orianna, Xerath, Vel Koz, Syndra, Ziggs, ..... champs who can get aggressive and your Q usually misses on if they know what they're doing....... You need the sustain to stay in lane. Early game, W isn't that good at clearing unless you can also get in and auto, which puts you in a position where these champs can pound you before you get strong. In those matchups, her sustain does matter, and is worse than it was.\n\nI'd also like to point out again; Morg is mostly suffering due to the new runes. About the only rune that seems to be \"okay\" with her is Comet, and that puts her in a compromising position to where she used to be, because of her ult's proximity. She used to be tanky when building tank because the armor boosts activated when taking damage, rather than when applying immobilizes. You also had your just flat bonuses on the same mastery pages you had your utility on. Now, they are on different pages. If you go Comet, your survivability is a LOT worse, and there really isn't a Resolve build for Morg, nor is there a Precision one, and there's not even a Domination one (Only when Morg is ulting would electrocute proc, and Predator and Dark Harvest are ill suited).  So.... she's pretty much left with Comet, which misses a ton unless she has a Rylai's, or only activates correctly on her Q (usually her W has done a good job of putting it on cooldown though).\n\nThey also took 136 off her HP in the nerf after rework, so she's dying a lot faster even if we're arguing that her sustain is \"not important.\" 136 HP means Assassins kill MUCH faster (helps Zed get low HP faster) and she dies a lot faster in group fights. And keep in mind: They've been raising damage of items and runes at the same time as this is happening.\n\nYou used to actually use Morg's ult. Now, the majority of the game is spent spamming Q and W, and only using her Ult when her sacrifice could = a lane push or early game where people can't kill her in 2 sec yet.","replies":[{"poster":"SB Arneeman","date":"2017-12-21T08:06:13.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana doesn't really have worse synergy with runes than other midlane champions. Stopwatch is really nice to get a proper ult off early, and Comet is also a guaranteed hit whenever you hit q, and you also deal decent damage with it just placing W on the opponent. I tested her full combo and you get 2 or even 3 comets off.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2017-12-19T19:44:15.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"''however, with morgana in patch 7.24, you only elaborated on the initial change, not the hotfix.''\nPrecisely why us older players are aggravated with riot's deliberate miscommunication.","replies":[]}]}
