Yes he gets free lifesteal. He's also a melee without gap closing capability, and if he tries to spam his abilities to safely farm, he'll go OOM very quickly. It requires time and patience to build up to make his lifesteal worth while. There are many champs who counter him early, with enough poke to make him regret every Q he tries to farm-or outright stopping them in some cases (Teemo). \n\nNasus is meant to be a juggernaut that excels at 1 on 1 close encounters after having some time to farm. If allowed to do this, he'll WILL become a monster (though honestly not anywhere near the strongest lategame, plenty of other champions have more going for them without relying on farming for 20 minutes to do so). His team fighting is pretty meh; unless you spend an exuberant amount of gold to get items to counteract his weaknesses, in which case you'll end up a lot squishier anyways. Have you ever played as Nasus late game? It's not nearly as awesome as it would seem. Aside from the plethora of champions such as Kog Maw and Vayne who can rip him a new one, a team with a half decent amount of CC will chain CC him and kill him before he even does anything.\n\nI'll say it one more time; when you think of all the great things on a skill or champion, you should also thing of their collective kit before deciding how good or bad it is. Just as an example, Garen's W provides him with on demand 60% damage reduction+ tenacity, as well as boat loads of permanent armor and MR, and he gets free true damage! His E can crit with the damage going up to around 2000 late game!\n\nHe's also a sub 50% winrate champion because I neglected to look at his various weaknesses and shortcomings.
