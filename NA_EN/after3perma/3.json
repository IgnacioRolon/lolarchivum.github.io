Im talking 26/24/22/20/18 to 16 at all ranks levels of reduced. Or 24/23/22/21/20 if you want to play it safe. \nAnd if he ends up overpowered still, remove the 50% bonus armor pen that effectively negates the reduced Crit damage he does anyway. Yasuo should be hard countered by tanks while serving as a hard counter to mages/ranged burst (namely assassins and ADCs) instead of being the average CertainlyT champion and just being a counter to everything and everyone not named {{champion:10}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2019-02-17T11:40:44.821+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And now he's building tanky and people are complaining about \"tank\" Yasuo being impossible to kill while still dealing the same damage as before.
