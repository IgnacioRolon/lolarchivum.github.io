He also has resourceless Q spam that proc's on hit, Conqueror and crits and the cooldown of the Q falls significantly based on how much attack speed he has. He also has unlimited mobility as long as there are enemy targets he can E through. \r\n\r\nOk, so he has all this bullshit in his kit so why the fuck can he ult off other allied knockups? He has the capability in his kit to set up his own knockups so remove the interaction of Yasuo being able to use allied knockups. Especially when the cooldown is ridiculous anyways at 80/55/30 seconds without CDR. YES 30 second ultimate without CDR that he doesn't need to set up himself. \r\n\r\nAnd if the ult knockup is not enough, the bullshit champion also gets get 50% bonus armor penetration on crits for 15 seconds to ALL targets not just the ones affected by Last Breath. So you can't build squishy because Yasuo gets 100% crit in 2 items while the rest of the game except Trynda needs like 4 items, you can't build full tank because he has 50% bonus armor penetration. So basically your fucked if squishy or tank.\r\n\r\n_What I want to see changed:_\r\nIf Yasuo can ult off other allied knockups, increase the cooldown to 120/90/60 OR If Yasuo can't ult off allied knockups, change his Q knockup from Airborne to Tempested. \r\n\r\nThe 50% bonus armor penetration should only apply to targets knocked up by Last Breath, not all targets.\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel like this will give Yasuo proper counterplay, because right now his only counterplay is \"Just CC him\" but that is counterplay to any champion, and/or \"hope he fucks up\".","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2018-07-23T12:58:13.871+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Be OP:\n\n.> Needs to collect easy upvotes.\n.> Makes senseless thread about unneeded and inconsistent nerfs to Yasuo.\n.> Community shows how wrong would it be to let them take care of balance.","replies":[{"poster":"After3perma","date":"2018-07-23T13:15:37.710+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Stars Shaper,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Iupx8ahh,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-07-23T12:58:13.871+0000)\n\n> .> Makes senseless thread about unneeded and inconsistent nerfs to Yasuo.\n\n80% pick ban rate in competitive with a +60% win rate.

Additionally, it means that Yasuo can abuse more reliable displacements to give himself equally reliable CC and damage.
