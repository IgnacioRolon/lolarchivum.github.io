If a fighter is building damage items in a way to deal a lot of up front damage, why should they kill a tank? Why should 0 investment in % armor pen or shred mean anyone should be able to kill tanks? Yes, sustained damage is better against tanks, but you should still have to build to handle them and not just get handed a rune that allows you to kill them easily while building to deal more burst damage. You shouldn’t be able to kill both easily. Want to be able to kill a tank without it? How about Cleaver/Whisper, attack speed, PtA?\n\nLet’s also not forget that Conquerer encourages stacking on minions before even fighting so you have an instant advantage, and so discourages trading.\n\nSimilar issue to things like old Q crit Vayne and the high burst adcs had at one point. \n\nTanks have been dealing more damage, and that’s an issue. Tanks are getting more damage and less defensives, which is also a massive issue. But that doesn’t mean you should introduce another horrible mechanic just to Correct an issue.\n\nEdit: fighters are fine to want their own rune, but many seemed to want, or at least do now, Fervor back, because it was a better designed keystone than Conquerer will likely ever be.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sewer Side","date":"2019-01-02T09:53:17.811+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":6,"body":"Conqueror does not do fucking 7000 damage, nor does Electrocute/PtA/Comet only add up to only 1000 damage in the same time frame, jesus fucking christ.","replies":[{"poster":"After3perma","date":"2019-01-02T10:01:52.875+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sewer Side,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ixTBnEdk,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-01-02T09:53:17.811+0000)\n>\n> Conqueror does not do fucking 7000 damage, nor does Electrocute/PtA/Comet only add up to only 1000 damage in the same time frame, jesus fucking christ.\n\nMaybe if Electro/PtA/Comet didn’t have no cooldowns and if they worked on more than one target at a time then yeah the damage would be higher, but right now they deal like 1000 damage all game.\n\nNotice how I said no cooldowns and if they worked on more than one target at a time.

I can see an outlier where this occurs but he specifically nitpicked at a rare, worst-case scenario case and paired it with a regular occurrence to bolster his weak argument. I dislike Conqueror with a passion but this post is a useless one that contributes nothing to addressing the issue.\n\nEdit: OP said Conqueror can exceed 7K damage \"all\" game so he is stating this is a regular occurrence. He also says it has no downtime, which is false. It's just extremely easy to ramp especially on its core abusers.\n\nIn addition, the reason Conqueror is OP is because of the bonus AD it provides WITH the 20% true damage. The true damage amplifies abilities too much and with the AD on top, it disintegrates everyone from tanks to squishies due to autoattacks coming in with the abilities. The rune would be horrible without the AD and mediocre without the true damage. \n\nBoth bonuses create this huge damage scale that defeats armor penetration which is outright unfair in consequence to those who cannot utilize the rune and other roles. Also, all champions who utilize conqueror efficiently have a degree of survivability with the damage output of an assassin, mobility, and DPS greater than an ADC against tanks.\n\nConqueror offers too many benefits with its synergy with its meta champions and ignores a huge roster - defeating its original purpose and RR.\n\nRight there, I didn't even try and still made a better argument than OP.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2019-01-04T02:33:01.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"all\" can also mean in total\n\nI don't know where they got their numbers from to start with though, so there's that","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FFrazien","date":"2019-01-02T09:57:14.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"{{champion:67}} is also meant to be anti tank and she got buffed, so what are we talking about?","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2019-01-02T11:52:39.005+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FFrazien,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ixTBnEdk,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-01-02T09:57:14.946+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:67}} is also meant to be anti tank and she got buffed, so what are we talking about?\n\nHer main kiting mechanic was buffed, seeing as how that helps her survive more than anything else it seems riot are pleased enough with her damage.\n\nIf they wanted to buff her anti tank they´d go for her W. \n\nMarksmen have plenty of damage, the lack of survival tools is what drags most of them down to obscurity however.","replies":[{"poster":"Exin0","date":"2019-01-02T22:20:23.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thefrostyviking,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ixTBnEdk,comment-id=00050001,timestamp=2019-01-02T11:52:39.005+0000)\n>\n> Her main kiting mechanic was buffed, seeing as how that helps her survive more than anything else it seems riot are pleased enough with her damage.\n> \n> If they wanted to buff her anti tank they´d go for her W. \n> \n> Marksmen have plenty of damage, the lack of survival tools is what drags most of them down to obscurity however.\n\nher kitting mechanic also indirectly give damage but inst lack of survival on marksmen kind of core mechanic of game? they get suport and team should play around their damage dealers and protect them. why is everbody asking  for complete \"lonewolfs\" changes to be able deal with anything solo on their champs?","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2019-01-02T23:29:42.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Exin0,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ixTBnEdk,comment-id=000500010000,timestamp=2019-01-02T22:20:23.617+0000)\n>\n> her kitting mechanic also indirectly give damage but inst lack of survival on marksmen kind of core mechanic of game? they get suport and team should play around their damage dealers and protect them. why is everbody asking  for complete &quot;lonewolfs&quot; changes to be able deal with anything solo on their champs?\n\nBecause the protective supports got hit with massive nerfhammers and many are just gone and done.\n\nMakes self peel essential for any marksman if they want to stand a chance.","replies":[{"poster":"Exin0","date":"2019-01-03T00:14:08.187+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thefrostyviking,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ixTBnEdk,comment-id=0005000100000000,timestamp=2019-01-02T23:29:42.305+0000)\n>\n> Because the protective supports got hit with massive nerfhammers and many are just gone and done.\n> \n> Makes self peel essential for any marksman if they want to stand a chance.\n\nMake logic but dont you thing this aproach just make problem worse?
