Has a 95% pick/ban in Korea LCK. He has an overloaded kit and abuses Conqueror better than any other champion. Meant to be an early to mid game champion that is supposed to fall off late game but doesn't.\r\n\r\nLet's see his kit and how overloaded it is\r\n\r\nDot bleed which he can transfer to any target at 5 stacks\r\nGets free AD at 5stacks (30-230 free AD) \r\nUpto 36% missing HP heal\r\n90% slow with auto attack reset and attack range extend and deals extra auto attack damage\r\nPull multiple targets at standard ADC range with broken hitbox\r\nFree Armor Penetration\r\nTrue dmg nuke which resets on kill\r\n\r\nHe has too much in the kit.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to see changed is:\r\nI want the amount of AD he gets from the passive to be reduced to 15-160AD. He should not be allowed to get 4000gold worth of AD for free that is bullshit.\r\n\r\nHis Q cooldown and mana costs needs to be increased. Right now, his Q mana cost is 30mana every rank, so he can just spam this off cooldown and it doesn't hurt him or the mana pool one bit.\r\n\r\nLower the missing HP heal on his Q back to 30%.\r\n\r\nW slow reduced to 75%. \r\n\r\nFix his ridiculous broken E hitbox. It is already at an unforgivable range at 450, but it seems to pull in targets further than the animation. This needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you guys think because Darius is a serious problem in this game nowadays.\r\n\r\nPlus conqueror is a problem in this game. Meant to be an anti-tank keystone, but when you got these types of champions taking it every game and destroying tanks and squishies there is a serious problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2018-07-14T19:59:56.346+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now if you wanted to nerf a champion, one change is usually needed.
