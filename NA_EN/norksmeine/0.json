I suppose {{champion:10}} and {{champion:25}}&#039;s ancestry must be an airborn kind of bird so that they can incessantly fly, unlike {{champion:497}} and {{champion:498}} who can fly only in a short duration. Making these angels be one kind of Vastaya may be the most appropriate possibility for their upcoming updated lore. Still, I&#039;d like them as Angel rather than put them among the Vastaya.
