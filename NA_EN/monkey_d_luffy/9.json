When I think I've played pretty well (even if I don't have an amazing KDA to show for it) I typically get S or S+. When I think I've done alright I typically get A or A+.\nWhen I think I've done poorly I typically get B or B+.\nIt's been amazingly accurate.\n\nThe scoring though - disgusting. I mean, you get X points for your grade. IF you win, you get a time multiplier. How stupid is that?\nWinning a short game (where you dominate hard and clearly played well) results in way less points than winning a long game where you must have made a lot of mistakes to let your opponents stay in the game (or let them get ahead and force you to come back). \n\nLosing a long game (where you were actually close to winning) results in an obscene amount of time spent for basically the same amount of points as losing a short game where you got dominated and stood no chance. \n\nPoints should have been flatly based on score with a flat win bonus. Maybe a small bonus for longer games to make up for the extra time spent playing. So like 300 points for an S, bonus 100 points when your team wins, and a time modifier of #minutes / 20 to multiply. Adjust all requirements downwards to match (basically, 20-25 games at 400 points each should result in mastery, so say 10k points to be a full master level 5).\n\nLike, I thought the whole purpose of the mastery system was to show skill on champions outside of win rate. We already have win/loss statistics. Champion mastery literally adds nothing because it's much faster to get up in mastery with a bunch of long wins and fast losses at the C or B level [i.e. either your teammates were as bad as you and you got owned, or your teammates were good and carried you] than it is with a bunch of short wins and long losses at the S level (i.e. your teammates were also good and you won quickly, or your teammates were bad and you tried to carry them but often couldn't).

You did well, but not well enough to carry. Should it be higher? Probably.\n\n\nThe problem is that you can go 0/20/6 and still gain 1k points just because you got carried in a 70 minutes game.\n\n\nActually, lets also take about the timer. Why the fuck do you get less points for winning early? One time i was Bard, we won in 20 minutes because enemy surrendered, had a S+ grade, 5/0/18 with a Triple Kill, tons of wards and turret participation.\n\nStill got 500 points. Making the enemy surrender/winning early should give **more** points, if anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iBubbles","date":"2015-10-08T15:21:42.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it's stupid af that they can even take away mastery points.
