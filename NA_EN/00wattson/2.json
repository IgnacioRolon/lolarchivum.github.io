That it couldn't start correctly (0xc0150004)\r\nIve uses lol.admin to try to open it and it still doesn't. To top that off I can't access my PBE account (not sure if you can in the first place) cannot be accessed in the forums to write a ticket. Does anyone know is this a problem with my computer? Or can I write a ticket using my normal league account to report what's happening to my PBE account? (also, i've never shared my PBE account with anyone so no one should have access to it)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-24T03:33:23.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You probably need to setup [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) for the PBE client as well.
