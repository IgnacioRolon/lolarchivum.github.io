Once they place that on your account. Message riot support to recover your account and ask them to switch emails. I would also contact the email provider on getting your email account back just in case riot does not want to protect your account.","replies":[{"poster":"00Wattson","date":"2016-09-30T20:15:37.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok ill see where that goes. i appreciate the tip {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mrs Sylvie","date":"2016-09-30T20:20:44.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem mate.

If a hacker had access to any support e-mails that had been sent they can use that very information to get Riot to Recover the account TO THEM.  Literally just happened to me. I'm just lucky I'm still logged in to this account on this machine. But He already swapped the account e-mail and changed the password. So I'm now struggling to get this mess sorted out. And it doesn't even look like Riot has 2-Factor auth yet....at least not that I've been able to find.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
