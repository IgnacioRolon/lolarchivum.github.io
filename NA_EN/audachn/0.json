I thought about this after I saw the \"Sugar Rush Tristana\" concept, when i was bored, in classes (yea it's bad, I know). Soooo, first of all, this skin should be legendary because even Zoe animations are already 10/10, it should be ATLEAST 15/10 (and also because i was disappointed SG wasn't a legendary). \r\nSo, for particles:\r\n◘P: something very 'classic', with candyfloss on her hands, she would throw fluffy pink particles on her ennemies (PS: i don't have much ideas for this one)\r\n\r\n◘Q: Zoe isn't using ping pong paddle anymore but instead ice-cream cone (like this: https://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2019/42/2/1571162606-icecream.png ) and obviously, the \"ball\" she sends to ennemies would be ice cream ball.\r\n\r\n◘ W: Zoe got around her a TON of candys: heart lollipop (like this: https://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2019/42/2/1571162766-loliheart.png) , candy sticks (https://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2019/42/2/1571162857-candy-sticks.png) and classic candy\r\n\r\n◘ E: Zoe throws a candy/toffee apple, which spreads sugar, candies &amp; UNICORNNNNNNNS on the floor.\r\n\r\n◘ R: Zoe makes and jump into a portal which looks like a candy harlequin (don't know if u know it; it looks like this:  https://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2019/42/2/1571163057-harlequins.png ) : very colorful !\r\n\r\nHope u like it, (and hope u like Zoe as much as I LOVE her), see ya on SR, AND PLEASE RIOT, MAKE THIS SKIN (and give it to me tyyyyy)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2019-10-15T22:37:01.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, this is so cute and clever!  Zoe is EXACTLY the kind of character that would spazz out on a sugar rush in-game.  Eating candy instead of summoner spell balloons is so smart.  I think the ice cream cone is the weakest part of this idea, because it doesn't quite gel with the \"candy\" theme, you know?  What if she used stretchable taffy or bubble gum instead?  Or gobstoppers?!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kazekiba","date":"2019-10-15T19:36:46.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Id love a skin thats a costume change with no additional VFX. VFX changes are best to be done for one or two skins a month, and focus on making a variety of 3-5 skins for various themes/champs per patch instead.","replies":[]}]}
