Of course, though, it&#039;s never going to do so against anything except minions.\r\n\r\nThen again, maybe it&#039;s just Fiddle favoritism, given that his E is also nearly as good as Brand&#039;s *ult* (And *is* completely better once you pass a certain AP threshold); he has a point and click instant fear, while Shaco is stuck with a delayed one for half the duration; and is one of the last point and click draintanks now that Riot removed that from Aatrox...\r\n\r\n...Okay. I do know it&#039;s not *favoritism*, and more just Riot probably forgot about him. But for the love of god he&#039;s still oppressive beyond belief in any lane, nearly impossible to 1v1 because of his W and Q, impossible to poke down due to his W, and borderline impossible to kill before he kills your entire team in a teamfight because of his entire fucking kit. The only reason people lose on him is because another lane feeds their asses off too much for even a scripter with perfect macro to carry, or because they&#039;re drunk/high/asleep/afk/too stupid to actually right-click.\r\n\r\nBit of a rant, sorry.","replies":[{"poster":"Beatrice falls","date":"2018-09-17T21:13:57.286+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can do the same, look to make retarded comparisons that don't make sense\n\n{{champion:18}} W is the same as evolved {{champion:121}} E, deals more damage, has a slow related to it and is available from level 1 and doesn't need to be upgraded, and also has more reset, and {{champion:18}} also has more range on her AA and consistent dps\n\nComparing 2 champions that have nothing together is the most absurd thing one can do","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-09-17T22:20:49.496+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yet if I make the right comparison people *will* eventually start hating him almost as much as I do.\n\nWorst case scenario for me then is that people ban Fiddle for me, letting me actually ban a counter or statistically OP champion instead of a champion that's the definition of anti-fun.\n\nSure, it's a slightly absurd comparison. But it's a rant and I'm honestly sick and tired of this champion being able to be picked.
