A team of squishies, because top and jg think \"team comp doesn't matter, it's only normals. lul go play ranked u tryhard\".\r\n\r\nWell. Thing is, their team has the slightest chance of having an assassin, or of having anyone with lethality, or any kind of burst whatsoever? Congratulations, you need a tank. I recently lost a game to a _goddamned lethality Sion_, because we had no tank to block him and eat the damage. Nobody to CC him. And I've lost countless others to not having a tank.\r\n\r\nSimply put: ***You can't afford to not have a tank***. It being a normals match doesn't change that at all. It being a normals match doesn't magically change the meta.\r\n\r\n#In every match, you need a tank, unless their team has no burst capabilities at all.\r\n\r\nOh. And, of course, that's not possible anymore. Since Lethality is a thing, _anyone_ can theoretically buy it and burst you. And, yes, if you have no tank, if anyone on their team is intelligent, they _will_ buy some burst. Malphite will go full AP. Sion will build lethality. They _will_ pick an assassin. Or two. Or three.\r\n\r\nThose rare times where you see tankless teams win? Half the time, luck. The rest of the time? Serious coordination. Said coordination does not work in soloQ, because it doesn't exist. Your marksman _needs_ to be able to peel himself, or the enemy team needs to be obliterated before they can get anywhere close to your marksman. Otherwise, it's a permanent 4v5, because your marksman won't be able to do anything. And neither will any teammate that requires peeling. You essentially screw yourself over, and you lose in champion select.\r\n\r\nNote: ***Your*** fun is less important than the ***other four people's fun***. ***Nobody*** gets to screw over ***anybody*** on their team for their own personal amusement - that's what trolling is. So, no. You having fun does not excuse you completely screwing over your team.","replies":[{"poster":"EbonyBladeJ88","date":"2017-10-17T02:05:43.513+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"B-But I do play tanks...\n\nJuggernauts  (They're tanks, in a manner of speaking {{champion:122}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:83}} )\n\nAlong with some ACTUAL tanks... {{champion:98}} , {{champion:14}} , {{champion:78}} to name a few.\n\n Wh-what am I doing wrong? {{sticker:sg-soraka}} \n\nBut in all seriousness, yes, you're right.

Squishy tops are 100% alright. The problem is when you have a _Yasuo top, Lee jg, Zed mid, Sona support_, and you're stuck as an ADC with no peel. Meaning you cease to exist until the enemy team _puts you out of your misery_.\n\nNo, seriously. Go play any ADC but Vayne, Tristana, or Xayah (the only three who actually have any kind of anti-diver qualities) without having a tank. Existence will be pain for the next 12-20 minutes. Even if you're a busted-ass champion, you'll still be effectively useless.\n\nTop being squishy: Fine. Everyone being squishy: Not fine.

This is my last attempt anyways on this thread to educate on ignoramus about how the League Community doesn't revolve around you. I did main mid and to win the games I had to outplay the opponent, ward coverage properly, and play around enemy jungle pathing so that I could gank the other lanes and give them leads. ADC I have to outplay opponents or just power farm and roam with the team like an actual team player and in teamfights you're not supposed to be depending on your team to peel for your sorry bum, I peel for myself and position correctly as any ADC main should be. You belittle your teammates capacity to play their roles and win without having the least shred of faith and you apparently see nothing wrong with this. Keep bragging about not only having Bronze high winrate games but also LEONA 73% winrate in those games just laughable really. \n\n1. Rank does definitely matter if you want to have your precious players who go tank to win the game. \na) It's a stressed environment so players are more inclined to play META winning roles to adapt to the game's composition.\nb) You get MMR that Matches you with better teammates and people who are skilled that want to win. \nc) You trying to use some \"Garbage, pointless advice\" insults on me? Mind your place boy. Ask the majority of the Riot community and see who they would rather listen to. A Bronze 2 Player that rants about his team? Or a Diamond that actually has experience in every role, every champ, and most of the game scenarios here? The question is rhetorical.\n\n2. You're explicitly trying to whine about how people that don't fill for tanks are throwing a game and pretty much ruining *You're* fun. \na) Do you know what Normals is? Players don't have to go META champs and can enjoy more variety and finish missions etc.\nb) To have you go and probably flame with that short temper of yours pretty much tryharding in a normal game is what ruins those normal games. \nc) This ties in to why ranked should be played ---> Better zealous teammates = Higher MMR = Do Ranked idiot.\n\n3. Luck doesn't make consistent wins. Luck doesn't make better people. Luck doesn't provide an excuse to generalize your complaints about matchmaking teammates. \na) One of the benefits of League is that players are allowed to be rewarded for their skill and play style. Nowhere in this do I see people get rewarded for being a whiny ignorant bum that tries to change the community than change himself. Adapt to the game. \n\n4. Sit down before you even try to mention anything about ranked when you have only played 2 seasons 7th Season inclusive. \na ) Literally everything from 1. applies here\n\n5. Does it look like I'm talking about picks here? Tried to be considerate and tell you to better adapt but apparently you don't understand. \na) Flame and shit talking to me or your teammates doesn't get you jack in League of Legends so shut up for once and listen.\nb) You should know by now from at least 1 Season experience people don't give a damn about your complaints about how they have to follow your every given command as if they were peasants to your pope role. They play what makes them enjoy the game and you trying to tell others to play differently to better adapt to your precious meta is complete and utter bull. Normal games don't rank or grind or leave anything significant for your rank so why should people be all geared to win the game as much as you? Because losing isn't fun? Then go find teammates that actually care about the game in *Cough* Ranked games. \n\n6. You can't see how stupid it is to tell/mandate/try and force others to play champions they don't feel comfortable with/aren't in the mood for and ,on top of this, might be playing those positions since you currently have their favorite role. Being stubborn, condescending, and aggressive towards your teammates gets you next to nowhere and judging from your \"figuring out where it will put me\" in your Bronze placements and Ranked games, I don't see any reason to prove my point further :^)","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-10-17T02:33:43.530+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"a good play can overcome bad team comp in norms\nwho needs an adc when you have full ap nami\nwho needs a tank when you have a full ad morg top\nwho needs good team when you can win lane buy a mej and carry\nget good and learn being good is better than having a good comp (both if pref tho)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TiltoverEnforcer","date":"2017-10-16T23:57:43.408+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nah, I play what I want in normals.
