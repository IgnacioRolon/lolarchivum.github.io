So your fed Kha zix is in the enemy jungle and you use your Hawkshot to help kha see if the enemy red is up, your W shows that it is up and that the Enemy jungler (who is low on hp) is trying to take it, Kha then jumps in and kills the Enemy jungler and you get assist gold because your w revealed the Enemy jungler. \nI think riot made Hawkshot able to grant you assist gold because almost all of the other abilities that reveal enemies have damage or another helpful effect tied in with it (like ignite and Swain’s W).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NepgearDesu","date":"2019-02-07T21:44:02.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean...\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/tpWY5lZ.png","replies":[{"poster":"jocomotion","date":"2019-02-08T03:09:16.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh OP, he can clone himself and deals TRUE MAGIC DAMAGE.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2019-02-06T13:57:54.777+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're never going to do it.

Like in your example, yasuo clearly didnt do 2000 damage from a single Q, but if the death recap showed Yasuo Q 4 times for a total of  2000 damage, people could understand how much damage a single yasuo Q does, and hey if you have 1000 hp maybe you should heal first before trying to fight yasuo again because you clearly now know he does around 500 damage a Q.\nAll in all, i think death recaps is something riot should work on improving, like i said the game has changed a lot the past few years, but death recaps remain largely the same, and i cant forget about all the bugs  death recaps have.
