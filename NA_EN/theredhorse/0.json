I changed my PW, started a ticket, and then played a game. When the game finished I was surprised to find I was perma banned. Going to my email I found the LOL support squad had shut the account down for security until they could determine the owner. This was the second surprise, it had taken them no time at all to secure my account. After a couple emails and an account recovery form, less than 30min, I was sure that things were settled.....I was right. They sent me a PW change link after they verified my info. bobsongoats couldn't have been more helpful and responsive. \r\nthanks","replies":[{"poster":"Navillus","date":"2017-07-08T19:32:51.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the riot support staff is helpfully and are 99% of the time cool. :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-08T04:32:00.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heeeeey thanks for the shout out!
