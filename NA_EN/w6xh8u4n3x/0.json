Does netflix really use 20Mbit/s? Or is interfering with an ISP throttle or something? I understand that's a streaming application, but my god, getting a constant 500 ms when someone turns the bloody thing on is quite frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-04T22:54:39.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like League, there are other apps like Netflix that need a steady and constant connection to stream content your way.  You can try using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to see if there are local problems causing your ping to increase.  Otherwise, you could contact your ISP to check on the package that you have allotted to you.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
