My whole life has revolved around it. I'm a self taught pianist, beatboxer, and DJ. I absolutely love the EDM genre (I love you guys for the DJ Sona skin. You automatically stole my money with that. ;) ). \r\n\r\nI'm currently 18, fresh out of high school sorta, and pursuing an Associates Degree in the Arts (Art & Music) at Empire State College. \r\n\r\nMy parents wanted different things from me. They believed I was smart enough to be a doctor or lawyer, but I told them I'd rather pursue a career in something I love, that way it won't be me going to \"work\" everyday but instead me doing something I love for the rest of my life. \r\n\r\nI also have a different passion as well, and that's playing League of Legends. When DJ Sona's 3 tracks came out and I saw Bassnectar collabed for Concussive I got excited because he's one of my favorite EDM producers. It also raised multiple questions in my head, like how would someone like me get a chance to create a track for RIOT. Then I saw on the RIOT career page that there was a sound designer job opportunity. At this moment everything became clear as to what I wanted to do with my life. \r\n\r\nSo the question to you Rioters is, what next? What programs and degree paths should I pursue after my Associates in the Arts?","replies":[{"poster":"ProtoShredanoid","date":"2015-02-11T22:51:43.448+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude, Thanks for reaching out. It's always awesome to hear from people who share a similar passion for music and it's even more awesome to hear that you are following that passion \\m/\n\nMy advice as this point in time would be to take in as much as you possibly can while at college. Take as many classes as your schedule will allow and don't be afraid to experiment with courses that you think you might not like - they may surprise you. If not, you can always withdraw. Surround your self with like minded individuals. Be apart of music and gamer communities. Lend your talents to projects (Student films, mod projects ect) that need help with music or sound (even for free at first :P) Take lessons to take your piano playing skills to the next level and keep practicing. See these next 4 years as a time where you will be learning skills that you will use for the rest of your life. Hard work now will pay off for a lifetime.\n\nI'd also suggest joining something like IGDA. Search for projects needing music or sound and reach out to them. You never know who you could meet on there. And oh, Being a good person and building real relationships with the people you work with doesn't hurt either.......it goes a long way :-)\n\nGood luck and keep us updated!","replies":[{"poster":"oRexo","date":"2015-02-17T15:29:18.046+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for the advice.
