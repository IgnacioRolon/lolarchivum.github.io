Since the purpose of making them full price the first week is that you get a limited edition bonus, I seriously seriously doubt they will lower the prices as a bundle (at least not the first week).\n\nIf you don't care about the limited edition borders, you can wait for the second week when they will be on discount prices as normal.

Generally, we don't announce sales in advance. However, if there is a bundle, buying it during the first week would grant you the First Strike borders. \n\nAs Deep Terror Nami mentioned, during the second week of release, 1350 RP skins will be reduced to 975 RP, but you won't receive the First Strike border.","replies":[]}]}
