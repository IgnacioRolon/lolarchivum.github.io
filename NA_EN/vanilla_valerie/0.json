If there's nothing else you have in mind then I guess he'll just have to relog every time he goes ingame lol.

Do you guys only help certain boards or...? Curious as to why a certain huge thread over in Player Behavior forums hasn't been looked at or replied to by a Red.\n\nP.S. feel free to delete this comment afterward.","replies":[]}]}]}
