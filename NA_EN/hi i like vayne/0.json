(In short)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"League of Legends hosts what I believe to be the most toxic, immature, vile, and hurtful community in the gaming world. I've been playing games on the xbox and PS communites, as well as a wide array of other games online and League without a doubt takes the cake for worst community.\r\n\r\nIt is common knowledge to any League player that Riot doesn't do anything to deal with toxic player. You guys have a report button, but we all know that's just to shut us up and keep us happy. -Thinking that we have done something that will enact justice upon our situation. That doesn't work though, it is so pathetic I am tempted to call the report system fake... It would be hard to convince me that you guys are actually trying.. How hard could it possibly be for Riot to make a little script or bot that can read through a chat and search for keywords and phrases when a player is reported for toxicity. Or at least reported by MULTIPLE PEOPLE OF ONE GAME. This is an outrage; specially after what I have invested in this game. All the money I spent buying RP should go to hiring a couple extra people to tend to reports because it is now out in the open that your report systems are a compete failure and do not achieve what needs to be achieved in order for us gamers to have a positive experience at least most of the time. Oh yeah, and please remind of my ability to mute other players if I don't want to hear what they are saying..... Like that sounds like a great idea in a game that is based on team play and communication.\r\n\r\nInstead of dealing with the kid who has self-esteem and insecurity problems and is a ticking time bomb of raging all caps insults you think you should work on those darned afker's.... Well let me tell you this, it's not the people going afk that has got me to question whether or not I want to continue playing League, it's the toxic kids; and the fact that you cant seem to deal with them in all these years of this game being open to the public. Your new leave buster system is a joke, and it is abuse on Riot's end that they would force someone to stay in a match where they are being flamed and insulted by angry kids who are so afraid of the idea that they themselves could possibly contribute to the loss of a game that they need to be the first ones to chime in and throw hurtful words at you so they can further reinforce the illusion that they are perfect and without any error in their League of Legends career. \r\n\r\nLeague of Legends is a team game in which everyone has to be communicating well to be an effective single unit. It's not Riot's fault that the world is full of people who don't know how to act maturely and heal their own wounds, however I would really expect to see some better handling of these situations by Riot. Please step it up for the people who have more patience and strength than I and are going to continue to play your game.","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2014-11-27T17:38:03.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Judging by your post, I imagine you're hardly the nicest individual to play with yourself.
