Obviously, if you plan on being aggressive, ward before you start heavily pushing, but aside from that, people just ward randomly.\r\n\r\nCan someone post an in depth guide, or even just some really good advice, on the best times to ward? Preferably for mid lane, but all lanes are fine.\r\n\r\nIn case you don't know what I'm asking, or are confused -- basically, you could go to ward, ward the best spot, but when the jungler isn't close to your lane, making the ward  mostly useless. Or warding when the lane is in a bad spot, and you'll end up missing cs, or giving the enemy laner an advantage when you leave lane. I need to avoid this but don't know how.","replies":[{"poster":"KillnYall","date":"2015-03-06T07:47:21.326+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All the time.

I know where the enemy team is, so it's wasting the ward to use it now. I have a mental timer in my head of how long it takes for them to recall and walk towards my lane, so I look to see if we're going to be in a vulnerable position. If yes, I ward a little before the enemy team COULD come and gank us. If no (maybe we're farming at tower), then I save the ward.\n\nIf I'm jungling, maybe dragon is up in the next 3 mins and I know my team will be fighting for the objective when it spawns. So I'll ward up the enemy jungle around dragon ~2 mins before the fight to give us an advantage.\n\nSee what I mean? Think about what you're going to do in the next 3 mins, and what information you need to pull it off. That line of thought will tell you when it's smart to ward.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-03-06T22:17:23.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/tips-tricks/IwZA58zE-warding-a-guide-to-effective-warding I wrote a general guide including do's and don'ts as well as lane specific warding,","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-03-06T21:04:13.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you're ever going to extend to a place where getting ganked would result in your death, go ward before extending","replies":[]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2015-03-06T21:01:13.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When it's safe to ward the area you want to ward.
