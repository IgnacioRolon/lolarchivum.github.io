Bandages that meet bring both targets to center.\n\nW: Aoe attack (similar to E on live)\nEvery time Amumu casts W he creates an aoe aura around him that deals magic damage for 3 seconds and remains active as long as amumu remains in combat. Aura size and damage increases with every cast of W to a max of 3 times.\n\nE: Amumu takes reduced basic attack damage and enemies who Strike Amumu get reduced attack speed.\nAllies within range of despair aura (on W) takes 25% reduced damage from basic attacks and Amumu takes that damage increase. Amumu reduces that damage and applies slow as if he was attacked.\nFor ability point after 1 Amumu can target and mark an ally. Marked allies within range are pulled to Amumu after 1 second delay.\n\nR: Same as live.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2019-10-15T22:45:57.216+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the idea of combining W and E and opening up a new spell slot for something fun.  I think blacking out wards is a little off brand Amumu, though... what about a spell that helps him \"make friends\"?  Of course he'd ultimately fail at this, but that's what makes him so endearing.","replies":[{"poster":"nosafterburn","date":"2019-10-15T23:14:07.919+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"a 0.25 sec charm into a 0.75 sec fear lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2019-12-16T14:17:23.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I added a new changelist out of sleep deprivation and boredom.
