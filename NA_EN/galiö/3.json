I used to tease people who were hyped about reworks and quit league after. \n\nIt was so cathartic and they disappear.\n\nOnly rework I seen where it was 50/50 was irelia and akali. So \n\nMy fav was this eve one trick that would fight with me for hours at a time that she wants and would love a rework and then she quit after the rework. \n\nI'm so alone.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"4th3t0s","date":"2018-12-05T04:54:12.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look at what happened to {{champion:43}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2018-12-04T20:20:51.529+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"It helped weaker mid laners in pro play during the ardent meta... so not an entire failure.  \n\nWas just a failure 99.99999999% of the time in other uses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mundotakesroids","date":"2018-12-05T17:47:10.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"true","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Common Satyr","date":"2018-12-04T22:17:53.731+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the ult change, Im not conviced it is worth ulting if you are already in the fight. The dmg reduction was what I cared more about than the damage. And to take yourself out of the fight for 3 sec to MAYBE do damage (since it is pretty easy to move out of the ult) is kind of lame. Even more lame when you look at how big of a cool down is. Lastly it is a big hit to building MR since he lost 1/3 of the scaling that it was used for. Feels less rewarding now to stack it, which is kind of the theme of the champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2018-12-05T01:44:42.270+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"at this point, give us a self ult option already (half cast time and half damage) \n\nhaving a part of you kit damage relying only on your teammate ability to play (or inability to play in some case) never feel good","replies":[{"poster":"4th3t0s","date":"2018-12-05T04:15:59.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Cries in {{champion:98}}*","replies":[]}]}]}
