But something that would across the board better for Galio would be a Spellshield to his ult which is infamously great and terrible all at the same tIme. Galio has no real engage to pop his ult easiLy. So many times people blow a flash. It's annoying and frustrating enough to grab someone with your ult but the icing on the cake is that fact that half the league roster can stop Galios ult. His cooldowns is too long for an unreliable spell and flashes cooldowns o's even longer. I feel like a spell shield to truly keep people in there with Galio would be amazing And make him an even better champ then he already is.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-03-20T22:30:03.083+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know what my favorite thing to do against Galio ult is?\n\nStand there and let it happen. {{champion:201}}","replies":[{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2015-03-21T22:09:16.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this post is tge true reason Galio is the sentinel of sorrow...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Buff Nutskin","date":"2015-03-20T22:23:54.034+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The purpose of Galio's ult is to follow up an iniate. If you just flash in and don't get their CC with your ult, it's going to be stopped. That's like adding a silence to karthus ult. It's extremely strong when pulled off, but it's high risk high reward.","replies":[{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2015-03-20T22:47:30.568+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karthas has a slightly shorter cooldowns, can use it from distance (which it is most of the time), and can use it when he is 'dead' uninterrupted. I feel their ult examples are apples and oranges. this ult is what makes him essentially a tank and not a bruiser And it isn't reliable. it's already the shortest taunt in the game but the only taunt ultimate. It's distunguishing factors is AOE and dmg reduction, but like I said it's one and done. If it's ruined you kinda sit there and watch the rest of the fight happen. All his CD sucks, they are buffing E late game but most Galio mains level that last so it'll be a nerf until about level 15. He needs somethiNg.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WukongMain","date":"2015-03-20T22:27:08.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"imagine wukong being orianna ulted just as he ulted..then when hes ulti ran out the amumu ulted, and when that ran out the support galio ulted...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheI3igDaddy","date":"2015-03-21T22:32:13.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Galio's ult is one of the most, if not best AOE CC ults in the game (probably behind Amumu since he freezes everyone and Galio just taunts). \n\nIt needs risk to it, and part of that risk is teamcomps. Udyr, Braum, Leona, Hecarim... these are just a few of the champs that you really don't want to put Galio up against, since they can just pop a spell and then let you taunt them in order to pop the ult. In Braum's case, he doesn't even need to do THAT since he's Galio's number one general counter with his passive. \n\nI know that many people want Galio buffs, but you need to realize that he DOES have a good kit, you just have to know what to build on him in order to utilize it.","replies":[{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2015-03-21T22:43:32.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh. I'm a galio main. I k ow he has a good kiT. Sans his E for the most part. But I think his ult would be 10x better with the shield really making him a much more attractive pick. \n\nAmumu for example. His ult is better by 20-15-10 seconds And has very little risk to it. Amumu also has a reliable way of getting to the enemy instead of seeing a Galio run at them or make a wind trail to make it even more obvious he is coming for yoU. And stuns are a little better than a taunt. Even though galios taunt is benefiting his W on top of the dmg reduction.","replies":[{"poster":"TheI3igDaddy","date":"2015-03-21T22:54:06.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His shield is what keeps him from getting ult buffs, well, at least your proposed one. \n\nPotentially giving Galio bonus armor /MR, healing on enemy hit (regardless of damage) AND ignoring CC is too strong, especially if he has a lot of AP so his shield gives him back crazy amounts of health.","replies":[{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2015-03-21T23:19:21.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but after all that is over he needs to wait atleast 7 sec9nds, full build and late game before he can do anything. If you miss a skills hoy after having your ukt ruined you might as well have not been in that fight. I agree his healing is amazing but that's 1/3rd his entire kit, his ukt is the other 3rd and the rest is divided amongst everything else. So the majority of what makes his lot good doesn't really help much but his team and surviving. Having the shield o's more of a benefit t9 his team than himself because he will be just as oit of luck after.","replies":[{"poster":"TheI3igDaddy","date":"2015-03-21T23:41:26.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the main issue with Galio is that he's this ultimate hybrid champion when you think about it. He has some damage, he has some tankyness / sustain, and he has utility. He's GOOD at all of these, but he's not amazing at any, and I think that makes him balanced. \n\nNow you may think otherwise because you main him and I only play him occasionally as a situational pick, but meh, just throwing my two cents out there. I DO think the spellshield would be nice, but I question how much Riot wants to buff Galio like that. I think buffing his normal abilities would be easier.","replies":[{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2015-03-22T00:00:03.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree very much when it's laid out that way. But his main role is 'tank' and I think the shield would fit him thematically and complete the emphasis on that role. He will still be good at all those other things but be proficient just a slight bit more in him being a tanky and thematically as a guardian. \n\nI also don't think this will tip him so much out of the balanced area into OP. And it's hard to be considered balanced even with his crazy mana costs.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Joey Lumberpile","date":"2015-03-20T22:55:13.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"galio just needs a rework, all there is to it. his kit is garbo outside of his ult which, alongside things like kennen ult and morgana ult, both who have three times the utility, it's impossible to justify.
