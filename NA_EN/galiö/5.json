Galio's w has the same arbitrary strengths against some champs that Poppy's old passive had (the one where if an attack did more than a certain % of her health, the damage was cut in half).  To give an example, if ashe is attacking Galio (with his w active) and she activates her q, her damage will actually decrease.  Since Galio's W only counts instances of damage, the fact that ashe's q splits her auto into 5 instances of damage it actually makes her damage worse.  This is a very confusing and somewhat arbitrary interaction that Riot has been getting rid of in other champs.  This interaction makes Galio arbitrarily strong against any champ that has a dot, and conversely arbitrarily weak against champs with only a few instances of damage that are much stronger than average.\n\nAssuming Galio's w stays in any form (which I think it should), I expect it to heal based on a % of damage the shielded target takes instead of a flat amount that decreases every time you take damage.   I also might expect activating your ult to make the healing stronger on your W, so that you can still do low health ults.","replies":[{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2017-03-03T22:01:50.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MidEvilKnight3k,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EKicFcxt,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2017-03-03T20:43:52.961+0000)\n>\n> I would be surprised if it isn&#x27;t changed significantly.

I didn't like those two reworks the most other than what they look like and that's who is working on Galio. And so far from the teaser I'm so so on what he looks like.
