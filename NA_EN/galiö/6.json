Maybe.\n\nIdk.\n\nJust shotting ideas around. Not really refined.","replies":[{"poster":"EATARI","date":"2019-11-26T20:45:35.901+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I’m not sure if Vilemaw’s buff would fit in nicely in SR.

Also the Spiderlings could be stronger.\n\nIf enemy want to destroy that they need to come in your territory and attack the nest.\n\nIt's like the Herald is the bigger Version of deleted Banner of Command and Vilemaw will be the bigger Version of deleted ZZ'Rot-Portal.\n\nOne is more the offensive version and the other could also used as defensive version to hold a lane.\n\nThis way we will please 3 groups of players.\nThose who loved Twistes Treeline (as tribute to TT), those who loved Vilemaw in particular and those who loved Zz'Rot.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2019-11-27T13:05:57.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That also sounds good to me!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Z3SIeeper","date":"2019-11-27T02:13:48.157+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vilemaw is by far the best designed epic monster in this game.

The concept of the creation is much better overall and is actually challenging to go up against due to how it interacts with its opponents.
