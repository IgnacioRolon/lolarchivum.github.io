But no, some random yasuo mains or something are like &#039;hey dude hecarim needs bufs!&#039; and and other people would hope on and suddenly he gets buffed and is OP because nobody listened to the actual players.\n\nPeople use to think Rengar was terribly weak and he gets buffed, when the players would say he was fine.\n\nPeople cried for Azir buffs, when his players said he was fine. Nope, buffed and broken.\n\nPeople cried for Fiora buffs, same story.\n\nThe people who play Syndra, Katarina and such are -fine- with their champions, they are Masters and Diamonds with them. If you don&#039;t play the champion often, then you have no idea how the champion actually fairs.\n\nYou can&#039;t just buff a champion because they aren&#039;t popular, you should learn that from Lux.","replies":[]}
