R Urgot is the only champ with a suppress that deals NO DAMAGE! This skill should either suppress the target and channel damage, just suppress the victim and snare urgot so he can hit them,  steal stats like Trundle's ult like 40-60% of their armor, resistance, and movement speed, or rework the skill to just displace the target since the current skill gets him killed in teamfights.\n\nOther things he could use is a slightly smaller model since he's bigger than cho.\n\nMy issue with urgot is his bad combo of being a bruiser mixed with marksman since he doesnt do either role well, he can't soak up damage, he can't peel or cc the enemy, he can't really deal damage without combos, and he has bad positioning in fights. The best way to fix this is giving him more reliable hard cc so he can combo and so his ult wont kill him which makes me think that his w should fear enemies on 3 or so hits this would also give him a better theme with his skills and uggo looks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xengre","date":"2015-01-17T14:58:23.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never do this.
