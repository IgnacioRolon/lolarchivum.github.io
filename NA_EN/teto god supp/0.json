BUNNYFUFU?","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"FELLAS!!! \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n\nOk moving on from the most annoying aspect of the Bunny FuFu advertisement, \n(still wish i was a has been like bunnyfufu than a nobody like me, &lt;3 to you bunny)\n\nIs having a website pick your runes/summs for you technically a 3rd party program designed to give u an advantage?\n\nSo now players do not have to think, they do not have to wonder if certain runes will be good for certain instances in the game...\n\nNo, They just click one button, and their runes/summs get changed decided by a websites info...\n\nI understand, and know, there have been rune/summs check websites for years and years, hell, i used to use LOLKING, a LOT when i was new and didnt know what runes to go with. (mobafire was always wrong)\n\nBut at what point is just clicking a button and getting a challenger level assessment of your runes/summ and added for you a 3rd party program getting you an advantage over players who either do not know of this, or choose not to use this...\n\nSince i use u.gg to find runes/summs for champs in unfamiliar with, or want another opinion, its not much different from what i do...\n\nBut to give someone a BUTTON TO PRESS, to do everything for you seems too far...\n\nIn my opinion, this is crossing the line of the TOS, and causing a 3rd party, to influence and change your runes/summs, which is a bannable offence...\n\nWould removing that opition make it ok? \nI dont see why not, at that point its just the same as u.gg, or any other site to tell you what to use, and you can change them on your own...\n\nIm all for runes/summs websites to give you opinions, but to completely change them for you with a press of a button, seems to cross the line of the 3rd party programs influencing the game...\n\nAnyone else have any opinions on this?\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[]}
