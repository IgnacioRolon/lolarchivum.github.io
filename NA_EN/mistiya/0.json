Client will not start.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything worked fine last week.\r\n\r\nThis week I try to click my LOL icon, and it shows the patcher loading bar, and then vanishes.  The client never loads, (run as admin does nothing.)  If I try to click it again I get the \"this is already running\" notice.  I can see it running in my Task Manager.  It is NOT visible in the system tray like it normally was while patching.  It starts to generate an infinite log file called (date)_LoLPatcherUX which does not stop until the entire hard drive fills.  (It got to 40 gigs once, and I was very confused where the heck my disk space had gone before I tracked it down to a TEXT FILE in the league folder...)  \r\n\r\nI uninstalled the game.  This did not work properly, it hanged at 97% for twenty minutes before I ended the task and deleted the folder.  I tried to reinstall.  Install completed, but when I click the icon SAME THING.  Client does not load, infinite log file begins to generate.\r\n\r\nI am completely at a loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Mistiya","date":"2016-07-12T22:08:23.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for trying CrazFight but I followed those instructions and same thing happened.\n\nI was able to get into the log file to see what the actual error message was: \n\n000000.049|  ERROR| ClientWebSocketTransport: Error receiving data. select returned: 10038\n\n^this line repeats 10,000 times until my hard drive fills.  I don't know what ClientWebSocketTransport is but it looks like it's requesting something that's not getting through.  I am almost certain that my connection isn't the issue here, I run a wired connection with high speed internet and have no connection issues with any other program.  I tried disabling firewall/antivirus (running Kaspersky) but that did not solve the issue either, and Riot/League are listed under trusted programs anyways so I don't think that's it.\n\nAt this point the game is not even installed.  The patcher won't even give me the client, so I can't reinstall it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-07-09T23:13:11.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/YTYXWqNl-league-wont-open-after-clicking-launch-may-have-found-a-partial-solutionclue?show=flat&page=2 \n\n\n^ Maybe that will help O_o","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-09T22:25:02.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there is an unstable connection preventing the patcher for downloading necessary files; not a permissions issue.  My recommendation for this would be to go through our [Troubleshooting Connection](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.  Once complete, I highly recommend waiting a few moments during the patching process because it may need to re-scan all of your files to find and repair any corrupt data.","replies":[]}]}
