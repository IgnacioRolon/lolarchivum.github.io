I ran chkdsk in cmd as admin since that was the closest thing I could find, result said no errors.\nEvery reinstall I've tried (four or five now) has been as admin.\n\nStep two- Heimy's Workshop\n(note, i think it has something to do with the patcher so this seems promising?)\n\nPatcher isn't invisible, skipping that.\nReset Winsock as admin. (I had done this before.)\nYes I'm running things as admin.\nI cannot force a repatch as the install has never reached the point where the lol_air_client folder is created.\nNo game to run repair tool on.\nYep, UAC disabled still.\nDisabled firewall.\nIt isn't letting me install dotnetfx35setup and the file was apparently for vista or older computers so I'm not sure what to do with that or why that version of the install is what's recommended by the workshop.\nNot using wireless.  Have a strong wired connection and no issues with any other program, some of them very connection reliant.\n\nRestarted my computer at this point to finalize windows updates and winsock reset.  Same exact error process.  Tried disabling antivirus completely just in case. Same errors. Turned anti-virus and firewall back on because it didn't help and I'm not crazy.\n\nIf it is the .net thing, I have no idea how to fix that.  That's the only thing that I couldn't get to work properly.\n\nStep three- Connectivity\n\nServers are up!\nHave a wired connection.\nTried firewall stuff already.  Using Kaspersky and League is clearly whitelisted.\nGuys I hate to be upset here but these instructions are **VERY OUT OF DATE**.  No instructions for DNS for Win10.\nNetalyzer is running now, gonna have to wait for that to finish.\nPort Forwarding I need to wait for husband to get home since he has the router password.  I suppose this could be it, though it has never been a problem before.\nNot on a restricted network.\nNot on a VPN.\nNo instructions for DNS flush/Renew IP on win10.  I'm hesitant to do this anyways in case it messes up my permissions for other programs...\n\nStep four- Hextech repair tool\n\nChecked reinstall/clean uninstall.\nCompleted uninstall, reinstall starts.\nGet to the 'launch lol' prompt.\nLoL shield shows up, loading bar gets to about 75%\nVanishes without completing, starts the infinite error log.\n\nStill not fixed.\n\nI'm going to wait for the router password and see if that's the issue, if not I'll send the .zip over. :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-13T10:14:13.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could stem from a series of issues.
