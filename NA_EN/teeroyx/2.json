The first time I got in a game, I immediately noticed how choppy it was.\r\nI had previously been playing on medium-high resolution settings, with a consistent 75-115 fps. After these recent updates, my game rarely even flickers above 35 fps (it usually stays around 25). It will also randomly drop into the single digits, most frequently during teamfights (imagine trying to carry when your game is moving at 04 frames per second).\r\nI've tried pretty much all of the little tips Riot offers to increase fps, I've lowered my graphics/resolution settings in game, I've updated drivers, I've disabled the new \"game mode\" thing that comes with the Creators Update, etc etc... I've done pretty much everything.\r\nWhat else can I do to solve this problem?\r\nThank you,\r\nTeeRoyX","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-23T04:30:29.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you mentioned you've been through the steps in this [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) already, I don't want to trouble you with that. That game mode you mentioned will be forced back on when Windows updates, and I've heard the method of disabling it has changed as well, so double check that the Game DVR thing is turned off still. \n\nIf that's still not helping, hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they'll be able to work with you one on one until you get this fixed!","replies":[]}]}
