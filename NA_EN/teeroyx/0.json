I know its not great for gaming, but as long as I can run league on its lowest to medium specs, I'm happy. (I'd like it to be above 20 fps, at the very least.)\r\nIf that doesn't work, do you have any other suggestions for laptops that are under $300 and 14 inches or smaller?\r\nThank you,\r\nTeeRoyX","replies":[{"poster":"DimirWaterbender","date":"2017-02-03T23:04:13.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I would not get that computer.  You can find computers on sale from time to time that are better than that.  There are a couple of big concern points with this one.  The AMD E2 processor is a very basic processor.  You will likely get around 15-30 fps on minimum graphics settings.  Also, the 32GB drive is super small.  Windows will take up a good chunk of that drive, and league will take up most of what is left, so you will not really be able to store much of anything.  If at all possible I would look for at least an AMD A6 or an intel core i3 processor with a larger hard drive.  4GB of RAM should be acceptable.","replies":[{"poster":"TeeRoyX","date":"2017-02-07T04:30:00.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're going to hate me for even asking, but supposedly this computer could play it:\nASUS E200HA-UB02-GD\nI watched a video where a guy was able to play minimum settings skyrim on it. Tell me though, would a game of LoL just be painful on that computer?\n\nIf so, you mentioned better computers that are sometimes on sale. I'm willing to pay a little more (and increase the size of the laptop, if _required..._), what did you have in mind? Just give me the names of some relatively small, relatively cheap laptops and I'll do some more research.\nThank you so much for helping out.","replies":[{"poster":"DimirWaterbender","date":"2017-02-09T03:17:42.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly this one does not seem much better than the first one.  Maybe a little, but it still is not great.  As far as suggestions, I would keep an eye out for major stores like Best Buy, Office Depot, Walmart, or anywhere else that sells computers.  I know that sometimes they will run big sales that cut $100-$200 off the price of a computer.  For something close to the range you are looking at, you may find a computer with specs   \nclose to 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD, and an intel core i3 close to $300.  You just have to be patient and know what you are looking for.\n\nI am not trying to talk you out of this computer, as it may suit you well.  I cannot guarantee what fps you will get on it, as the specs are really low.  I know from experience what playing on 15fps is like, and I hated every second of it.  I finally upgraded my laptop after about 1.5 years of playing league.  i spent about $400 and got a good computer with a 750GB HDD, 8GB RAM, and an AMD A6 processor.  While it is nothing like my current PC that runs max settings at 120fps, it still ran 60fps on min settings.  I am fairly confident that you can find something that will run 30fps or even higher if you stick closer to the $300 range.\n\nAll in all, a few key points:\n\n1: The HDD is going to be slow because it is an HDD, but you want to have enough storage.  I am not talking about league in specific, a 32GB drive will hold league just fine, but you will not be able to store much else on it.  My recommendation:  500GB+ (only because you cant find 250GB easily anymore)\n2: The processor is the absolute most important part for what you are looking for.  The processor will determine the speed of the game and ultimately control your fps.  My recommendation: AMD A6+  or Intel core i3+  (Intel is generally better, but AMD can be ok)\n3: RAM.  This is not a huge concern, just avoid anything smaller than 4GB.\n4: There are other specs to computers that are not terribly relevant for your situation.\n5: You are going to have a hard time finding a small computer that is in your price range that fits my recommended specs.  You will have better luck looking between 13-15 inches.\n\nLastly, if you really want an 11 inch, i guess the one you showed would work, but I am a bit hesitant because of the processor in it.\n\nHopefully this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"TeeRoyX","date":"2017-03-02T05:21:27.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for your advice. I ended up finding a larger computer (like you said) that was $350: Acer E5-575 Signature Edition. I even upgraded the RAM from 4GB to 8GB, and... it works wonderfully. High FPS even on medium-high resolution settings. It is PERFECT.\nThank you for your response, it probably saved me :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ipols","date":"2017-02-04T09:40:13.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree except that you should note that 4Gb or RAM are enough for anything you could ever do on that PC.
