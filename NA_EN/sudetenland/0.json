I have zero voluntary leaves in the last few years and all of my left games recently are from a bug splat in loading screen that needs a repair then the game gets remade so i get a leave. if i had 3-5 more minutes before the remake i would be back into the game. It is extremely unfair that I am getting punished like this for bugs in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-02T21:03:41.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Racking up those penalties is frustrating, and I suggest no more queuing up until this is fixed up.  Let's stick to custom games for testing until you're ready to get back in game!  These bugsplats can be caused by bad game files or drivers.  Go over each step of the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to resolve this, and test it out until everything's solid.  Even if the leaves are not voluntary, they're treated equally because all leaves cause negative experiences for others.

The best argument I can steelman you is that leaving causes a negative experience for others, the punishment is for causing negative experiences for others, thus the punishment fits regardless of intent\n\nSetting aside that punishment is not even seen as a behavioral modifier by developmental psychologists anymore, punishment for an act without intent won't have any impact on removing future acts as such.  The best counterpoint I can think of to this is that the leaverbuster then prevents players who will just likely be kicked out by bugsplat from entering others' games.  But, if one believes that, they have to own up to the fact that they're on board with league simply removing players with worse connections or experiencing driver errors, etc. from the game simply so they don't interfere with others.  I don't see that stance being seen positively by the community, but if league does take this (the most rational mindset I can think of that fits your statement) stance, then they are being dishonest by not saying so","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2017-06-05T07:33:55.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im now getting 30m Leave busters from bug splats even after doing 2 games then bug splat and SLAM 30m leaver buster lock out.\n\nWTF","replies":[]}]}
