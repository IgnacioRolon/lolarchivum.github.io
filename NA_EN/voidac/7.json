If pro play was our balance focus you&#x27;d see a lot more champs with regular play win rates in the low 40s or high 50s.\n\n[Would that be so bad if the game was theoretically balanced and it was primarily a matter of player skill?](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/o8AXMUVu-why-riot-struggles-with-balance-response-to-riotceziumha) It's true that pro play coordination can't be fully replicated and DQ takes away the feeling of accomplishment/personal skill from ranked (at least for me) but even solo 5 teams I've watched on streams many times for Diamond+ ELO are quite coordinated.\n\nIt would certainly be more sustainable than doing balance work 1000x to have similar winrates all across the ladder. It would probably make Diamond+ a lot more diverse and players at the lower end would know that the game is balanced but they just have to work harder. I don't think that someone maining a low winrate champion in Silver is realistically not climbing because of the champion itself. Such concerns don't become meaningful until high Gold at the earliest imo and a player can always put a champion on the backburner until they think their skill has improved enough.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-09-09T03:57:52.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"normally its split, but the last few have been to set up for worlds with the rest (like 4-5 or so i think) ignoring pro play entirely.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Summonerrr 1","date":"2016-09-09T21:35:18.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aRm5KYRP,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-08T22:04:27.230+0000)\n>\n> We were looking into possible Brand buffs a few patches back because we felt he could be a contender for occasional professional play with slight changes.

Brand doesn't need much to be a worthy competitive pick. His damage just needs to be high enough to make up for the low CC and I'd guess that even a modest buff like 5-10% more AP scaling on E would push them to pick him sometimes. Ziggs is in a similar spot but probably weaker than Brand since he scales worse for teamfights and has much less kill pressure even when ahead of his laner. While Ziggs theoretically has better poke than Brand, the range disparity isn't functionally that different since Ziggs bombs stop when first hitting a target and won't go full range. Like Brand, he will just be poking the frontline but unlike Brand, his skills do less damage to tanks. Furthermore, Brand has 15 higher base MS so he can poke almost as safely as Ziggs. My point is that Ziggs isn't as overwhelmingly better than Brand in poke as it would seem on paper but Brand actually is far better in a teamifght all-in assuming his ult. got some bounces between 2-3 ablaze players. \n\nAgain though, even a decent buff like 20% more AP scaling on Ziggs' 26 sec. CD W will make him worth considering. Unlike Brand, Ziggs is also not obnoxious in SQ because there's so much outplay to everything he does (especially after the ult. not dealing bonus damage to minions). Brand is quite fair to play against but if your team screws up, it can often end-up killing you too because they bring the bounces to you. High burst champions with solo kill potential also just seem to snowball and carry a lot easier than poke, which makes them more frustrating. \n\nZiggs has a kit which will be stronger in competitive than SQ since he can help get turrets fast and has a little more CC (at least until Brand has Rylai's) as well as an escape (even if it's not reliable). As a result, if you don't see Ziggs in competitive, it means he's even weaker in SQ among highly skilled players. Brand is going to be easier to build a comp against like with an enemy taric, strong jg pressure, dashes to avoid ult. bounces etc. I have to wonder why you guys would consider Brand as the champion to push into 6.18 Worlds when there are other champions like Ziggs which can be pushed into competitive with far fewer consequences on the ladder in terms of performance/getting the whole team bursted/frustration etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"69469238DEL1","date":"2016-09-09T07:24:24.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I knew you guys cared, don't listen to the haters QQ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Holgranth","date":"2016-09-08T23:26:35.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is reworking or replacing his Ultimate on the table at some point?
