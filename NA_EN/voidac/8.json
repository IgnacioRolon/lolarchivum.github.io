Demacia, Noxus, Piltover, Zaun, Bandle City, Ionia. \n\nWith so many different cultures and ideals, Valoran is quite the colorful place. Now, since the mass retcon, how much of this world has changed? Are we sticking with the basic understandings of each nation/city? Let's go ahead and assume we are.\n\nIn order as listed above, let's talk about...\n\n**DEMACIA**\nA nation of pride and justice... and a crap-ton of body armor. While literally the rest of the world scrambles for new technology, Demacia is still just kinda...using swords (and a bit of magic). Yep. They have it programmed into their minds that Demacia is the best nation and that no one should dare cross them... (coughunitedstatescough). There fashion consists of blue, silver, and gold colors. Not much is said about any sort of religion. But they sure like to shout \"DEMACIA!!\" every change they get... so there's that.\n\n**NOXUS**\nThese guys. Opposite of Demacia. Think Nazi Germany and set it to overkill. While some still fight with swords and axes, others turn to science (chemistry in particular). Noxus is also home to many powerful mages. They seem to look at everything as a means to obtain power. Similar to Demacia in a small way,   they think Noxus is above the rest of the world. They usually have their noses in a lot of other people&#039;s business. As far as religion, maybe someone can fill me in on any religion going on in Noxus? Their fashion consists of... a lot of stuff. They don't seem to have any major representing colors. No uniforms or flags. But they have a lot of people with many different backgrounds, so maybe that's a contributing factor.\n\n**PILTOVER**\nThe City of Progress. Again, no really evident representative colors. But they pursue technology for the betterment of society. Sort of. So far they've shown they're really good at building guns, gauntlets, canon-hammers, and just... a bunch of things meant to hurt people... which is funny now that I think about it. They seem eager to invent something to hurt people as much as they do to help people. Which is ironic. \n\n**ZAUN**\nDirty, industrial, and full of people who... also want to help better humanity? (whaaat) Seriously. Viktor started out as a really good guy, inventing things to help people. But there's a problem with this city, it's as corrupt as my PS2 memory card I found the other day. People will cheat and steal to make a name for themselves, leaving others in the dust. Not everyone things this way, but you can only push someone so far. What if someone stole Ekko's Zero-Drive and took all the credit for its creation? Ekko would be downright furious. And that&#039;s the problem. You have a lot of brilliant people and a lot of bad people. Taking advantage of a young, naive inventor is a piece of cake in a place like this. As for color and fashion... lots of greens and browns. Lots of funky hairstyles, though.\n\n**Bandle City**\nLike Piltover for little furry dudes. They pursue technology and magic. Knowledge in general. No specific fashion (that we've seen. This applies to a lot of these). Lots of Yordles want to make a name for themselves, while some are actually pushed out of society. (Ziggs and Veigar) Other than that, they have a military and... that's all we really know. Some Tudor-style architecture. No real representative colors. Not much in the way of religion.\n\n**IONIA**\nWhile quite a few of my favorite champions are from Zaun/Piltover. Ionia is actually the most interesting to me. The style of their buildings, they're mellow lifestyles. It's like Tibet, and Noxus is their China (in a way...?). Lots of magic, and lots of invaders. I'd love to explore this land more. Peaceful pacifists turns activists, protesting the assault on their home. Others chose to rebel against the lives forced on them by their elders. Fearing for their freedom and wanting to become the best they can be, they lash out. \n\n**FRELJORD**\nIT'S FREAKIN' GAME OF THRONES UP IN THIS PLACE. It's amazing! I love the lore, I love the people. Unlike Shurima, this was done so well! Many different ideals, lifestyles and beliefs, and conflicts arising because of this. Ancient magic waiting to claim the world. Not much in the way of technology, however. They're kind of secluded from the rest of the world.\n\nThis is an amazing world. So much to explore and learn. These aren't even all the places to learn about. There are places like Mount Targon and Shurima. Man, if Valoran were a game like Skyrim, I'd play it for... well, the rest of my damn like. I'm STILL PLAYING SKYRIM. Damn game came out in 2011 and I'm still running around throwing fire at giants and sneaking around town guards. \nSorry, my point is that Riot has made an amazing world, rich with lore and interesting characters. I love exploring the world the champions come from. What molds them, changes them into the people we seem them as? Their ideas and beliefs. All of it. I WANT TO KNOW ALL OF IT. So let's discuss it.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-06-12T16:49:46.434+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is fun - I like it :)\n\n**SHURIMA**\nAs seen in Rek'Sai's [video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcB-FreSnG8)and [teaser ](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/reksai-scourge-desert)site, the common peoples of Shurima favor loose clothing in white, tan, and dark red.

I think there is a reason we haven't seen more technically adept Demacians or citizens with stronger ties to other nations - its atypical. The only example would may be Sona but she doesn't have much influence in Demacia. \n\nHowever, there are a lot of champions within the faction that break tradition. Shyvanna and Quinn, both were elevated to their position by royal decree. We see the price of conformity with Garen and Lux.  The previous being a paragon of Demacian values. The later being forced into military service by her family (if that's still part of the lore). \n\nIt should be noted that there are royal houses in Demacia. Laurent (Fiora), Vayne (Vayne), Stormight (???), Buvelle (Sona), Crownguard  (Garen & Lux), Lightshield (Jarvan VI) \n\nHere are some interesting theories I have about the houses and what may be going on in the nobility of Demacia. \n\n* **House Laurent's** reputation for dueling has been thrown into ruin. \n* **House Vayne's**matriarch and patriarch were killed by an evil witch and Vayne has devoted herself to a dark crusade \n* The lady of **House Buvelle** adopted Sona, leading me to believe that House Buvelle has no true heir \n* The** Black Rose and Swain **are working to weaken the royal family (**House Lightshield**) \n\nMy theory is that the houses are falling apart.

While we're at it, can I try? [excuse my language and formatting, I'm new here! Also some of the following may seem crazy. Please forgive me.]\n------\n\n**The Void**\n\nAn unspecified realm or dimension, filled with undescribable horrors that are driven by an intense hunger. Because of that, they seek out other realms (such as Runeterra) and invade them through various entry points (Icathia), absorbing whatever they can into the Void. They have a strict hierarchy where the stronger and more intelligent creatures ({{champion:31}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:161}} ) can dispose of the weaker ones as they see fit. They are also quite animalistic. Their bodies have many forms while their color scheme is purple, probably matching the inside of their realm.\n\nThe effect of the Void on outside beings is horrific. As seen with {{champion:90}}  and {{champion:38}} , the creatures afflicted with it are violated (mind, body) and then often lured in to further the Void's quest. The effects seem irreversible.\n\n**The Celestial Realms**\n\nNot much is known about them. They seem to reside in another set of dimensions, though unlike the thick of the Void, they appear to be more of specific realms belonging to the singular Celestial beings and their aquitances ({{champion:16}}  grove, {{champion:432}}  storage, maybe the Glade if Pix is tied to the Celestials). They are free from the rigid rules of this world, with space and time unlike that of Runeterra. \n\nThe residents of these realms are usually tied to the stars in some way, while also following some set of purposes given to them by the stars. Much like with the Void, their shapes vary much from the Runterran standard, and they feel a need to influence our world, though unlike the Void, it has a profoundly benelovent effect. They seem to be able to archeive great power, wisdom and immortality.\n\nThe people who have visited those realms are {{champion:16}}  patients and possibly {{champion:117}} (again, if Glade is in any way tied to the celestial realms). While the patients were simply healed, in the Glade, {{champion:117}}  had barely aged, and upon returning, it turned out that hundreds of years have passed in her absence. She also obtained or learned a set of powers mirroring those of Pix's.\n-------\n\n[As we can see, those two realms are almost polar opposites. They are almost the same but fundamentally different. Interesting.]\n\n[Btw Riot, it really would be cool to clarify what Glade is. It's bugging me and I may potentially end up looking silly in front of everyone xD But what is it? Is Pix a small celestial? Is he just a # magical race living in Runeterra like {{champion:72}}'s race? Does Pix have a motive for taking {{champion:117}}  away or was it for fun? I could make an entire thread about this.] \n\n[And was {{champion:32}} taken to the Glade in his song video, or a random magical realm?

Frankly, if there was not for Tristana and Corky, I would think the Narrative wants to delete Bandle and make the yordles nomads/scattered again.\n\nA thing that actually i would like to see - it would be interesting how a culture develops if the individual needs the company of his kin, while there is not too much in the immediate surroundings - but that i hope will never happen, since there is already a load of people that cares about the old lore and for good reasons wants to keep it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Voidac","date":"2015-06-13T08:22:29.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**LOKFAR**\n> \"An unforgiving barren tundra, Lokfar is a place where all creatures must vie bitterly for every resource.
