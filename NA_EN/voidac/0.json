Was looking at her skins when I clicked on Hextech Annie. The image didn't load and when I clocked again, he client faded to white a bit. \r\n\r\nNow I've got a 15 minute wait time. Now I don't usually dodge games, I know I have in the past, but I know I haven't dodged any recently. Why the 15 minute wait?\r\n\r\nThis is also the fourth time the client has crashed on me since the last patch. Usually when i'm messing around with Hextach crafting. This is the first time it's happened in a lobby.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T15:42:42.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this crash happening often or was it just that one time?  I've seen a few reports where some players have been crashing in champion select, and it turned out that third party programs like play.tv or overwolf were causing this and needed to be disabled.  I wasn't able to see anything that would give you a 15 minute queue, so I'm assuming that someone in your party may have had that penalty.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Voidac","date":"2016-08-19T19:17:56.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do not run any third party programs that affect anything with League. Literally all there is is Skype and Steam running.\n\nAnd no, it was definitely me. I left their lobby and tried a game on my own as they went on without me, I still had to wait the 15.\n\nFrom what I'm seeing, the client seems to be crashing literally randomly. It crashed on my today when I was switching music on google play in my browser.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T20:05:25.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'd like to help with your specific issue!
