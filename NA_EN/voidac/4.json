Just seems a tiny bit off. I like her coat and the vfx look great. The rest of her is fine. But... her upper arms just look like pringles cans...\n\nMaybe that's just me.\n\nBard tho. Those heals. Oh my.\n\nEDIT: Yeah, I looked at each of her other skins and the base. Other than the base and justicar, her upper arms have a little bit more to them. I don't mean to pick out flaws, I love the work the folks are Riot do. But, it's just... she's wearing a coat and... her arms... skinny as pringles cans in this skin...\nBut seriously, that's my only nitpick. These are some awesome skins and I can't wait to see the splash arts.

The idea behind this skin is for her to be Syndra dressed in snow gear, ready to go out and play, which is why she has her base eye color.\n\nIn addition, we didn't change her VO, so we felt her having normal colored eyes wouldn't fit with the personality she has. We wanted the hint of evil to still come through in the skin.

The resolution is absolutely terrible on Syndra's part of the splash. It's why her features don't look very good.
