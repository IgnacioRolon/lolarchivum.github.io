See whether pushing the 'Lissandra has different interactions with mana costs and casting' aspect can be accentuated more.\n\nI think it was fine to hold off.  No need to rush.  I do however have a few ideas (as do all Lissandra lovers), though some iterations may have already been conceived of and subsequently discarded by Riot's developers.  In that case please forgive my impudence.\n\nIdeas: \n\n1.   Durability is what I think Lissandra needs, over raw damage and mana.  She would make a fine tanky bruiser of a mage if she weren't so fragile.\n\n\tI am a huge fan of the Defensive Mastery Oppression.  I think a shield that activates on crowd control (akin to Mordakaiser) would be a bit excessive without a static cooldown built in.  However I think this could work:  \n\nPassive: Kneel: Every time Lissandra impairs an enemy's movement, damage dealt to her is reduced by .75% (at level 1)/1.5% (at level 6)/3% (at level 12) for 5 seconds.  This stacks up to 2 (at level 1)/3 (at level 6)/4 (at Level 12) times. This stacks additively with Defense Mastery Oppression.\n\n\tA bit extreme.  Helps her durability for a short period of time, and complements her short range.\n\nPassive: Seeker's Resolve: Being damaged by an enemy champion with impaired movement from an ability grants Lissandra 3 + (Level x 1 [at level 1]/1.25 [at level 6]/1.5 [at level 12]) Armor and Magic Resist for 6 seconds.  18 second static cooldown.  The cooldown is reduced by 1 second whenever Lissandra is damaged by an enemy with impaired movement from an ability.\n \n2.  Possible shield ideas. \n\n\tA weak shield that can be refreshed quickly, but Lissandra burns through mana even quicker.\n\nPassive: Watchers' Due: Casting an ability increases Lissandra's next ability's mana cost by 10 + (Level x 2).  When Lissandra casts her next ability she gains a 10 + (Level x 2) (+5% AP) health shield for 5 seconds.  No cooldown.  Does not stack. \n\n\tWho wants to hit her first?  More of a rattlesnake ability than an effective shield.  Powerful stun, but the stacks can be poked off to keep that from ever happening.  \n\nPassive: Coldsnap: Lissandra gains a 5 + (level x 0 [at level 1]/1 [at level 6]/1.25 [at level 11]/1.5 [at level 16]) health shield.  Lissandra gains a stack of Coldsnap for every second she does not take damage from an enemy unit (Max 5).  When Lissandra is damaged by an enemy champion within 550-range while having 5 stacks of Coldsnap, that champion is stunned for .25/.75/1.25 seconds and all Coldsnap stacks are consumed. 25 second static cooldown.\n\n3.  While I am not a fan of mana passives, I do think it necessary to keep in line with Lissandra's concept of a mana efficient caster.  \n\nPassive: Witchcraft: Damaging an enemy unit with impaired movement from an ability grants +50% Base Mana Regeneration for 5 seconds.  Killing an enemy unit with impaired movement from an ability grants an addition +50% Base Mana Regeneration for 5 seconds.  \n\n\tA risky option. Grants a large mana pool, but could disappear quickly.  \n\nPassive: Lissandra gains Level + (+100% (at level 1)/+150% (at level 4)/+200% (at level 8)/+250% (at level 12) AP) Mana.  The next damage dealt by an enemy champion is deducted from Lissandra's mana instead.  15 second static cooldown.   \n\n\tHelping her mana sustain in lane, and getting possibly getting back mana late game.  \n\nPassive: Hunt of the Ice Witch: Damaging an enemy unit with an ability or basic attack marks that enemy for 4 seconds.  Damaging the marked enemy with an ability or basic attack consumes the mark and restores 5 (at level 1)/7 (at level 3)/14 (at level 6)/28 (at level 9)/52 (at level 12)/104 (at level 15) Mana per marked enemy.  If the passive would restore more than Lissandra's maximum mana, the mark is consumed and no mana is restored.  Marked enemy champions have their Movement Speed reduced by 10% when moving away from Lissandra (range 800).\n\n\tTrying a different way to make her more durable.  Helping her early and late game, but this on is just as passive a passive as her current passive.\n\nPassive:  They will bow:  Every minute Lissandra gains a stack of They Will Bow, gaining +6% Base Mana Regeneration and +3% Base Health Regeneration. \n\n\tReworking current passive to make it feel a little more rewarding while requiring a little more work. \n\nPassive:  Iceborn: Lissandra's basic attacks grant her a stack of Iceborn (Max 5).  At 5 stacks, when Lissandra's casts an ability her next abilities cost no mana for 3/4/5 seconds and all Iceborn stacks are consumed.  13 second static cooldown.\n\n\tLissandra's damage is primarily achieved through her ice shards.  Giving her a free Shard every so often that could be immediately followed by the actual Q would help her scale well into the late game and would help her mana sustain in lane.  \n\nPassive: Impale: Lissandra's basic attacks grant her a stack of Impale.  At 8/7/6 stacks, Lissandra gains 175 bonus attack range (725 total range, 100 splash range), and her next basic attack is modified to deal magic damage equal to 70/100/130/160/190 (+65% AP) and slow its target by 16%/19%/22%/25%/28% for 1.5 seconds (25% damage against structures). The basic attack will then pass through the target, dealing the same damage to other enemies hit.\nNotes:  For the purposes of Runaan's Hurricane, attacking with Impale counts as a single auto-attack against a single targeted enemy, and as such will only launch a pair of ordinary single target bolts to nearby enemies.  However, the range bonus applies to all three bolts.\n\n4.\t Flavorful, cute, and fluffy stuff that should probably never see the light of Arclight Vel'Koz ever again...\n\n\tTrying to tie into her concept of a \"nimble\" mage.\n\nPassive: Bitter Cold:  Lissandra steals nearby enemy champions Tenacity by 50% (range 550). Passive: Lissandra steals nearby enemy units movement speed by up to 10%. Minimum 5% at max range (range 550).\n\n\t\"Nimble\" in a different way.  Faster spellcasting.\n\nPassive: Avalanche: Lissandra's abilities at max rank gain +30% Cooldown Reduction. Passive: Lissandra may have up to +50% maximum Cooldown Reduction.  \n\n\tEarly concept, thought that Nautilus' passive was more appropriate for Lissandra. Perhaps too powerful for a ranged auto attacker though.\n\nPassive: Ice Spears: Lissandra's basic attacks grant her a stack of Ice Spears.  At 12 stacks, Lissandra's next basic attack will deal bonus 4 + (Level x 2) True Damage and root her target for .25/.5/.75 seconds. This effect cannot trigger on the same targets more than once every few seconds.\n\nEr... that was a mouthful.  \n\nWell, come-what-may, I will continue to love my dear little Ice Witch no matter what passive she has.  The world will be buried in ice anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Acastius","date":"2015-05-09T11:51:25.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler, not sure if you'll stop by and read this again, but I figured I'd toss some ideas your way.\n\n**Background thoughts**\nSo, I've been trying to think about this a little, and I thought it'd be interesting to compare her passive to the passives of the other two \"sisters.\" (Using the new Ashe rework.)\n\nAshe's passive: On every hit, she slows. And she crits every target that is slowed.\n\nSejuani: On every hit, she gains armor and 'tenacity.' Refreshes each hit. (With permaforst's passive every hit/ability also slows.)\n\nOkay, so their passives are extremely similar - they slow on every hit, and then their core identity is accentuated. (More AD damage for Ashe, and more tankiness for Sejuani.)\n\nSo then the discussion become what's Lissandra's core identity. Each of the Freljord sisters have lockdown as the emphasis. So if Ashe is the CC Markswoman, and Sejuani the CC tank/jungler, it's fairly clear that Lissandra is the CC mage. But it's not the CC that is their core. The CC lets Ashe attack more, Sejuani tank longer/more effectively. Mages use their abilities, so Lissandra's passive tries to emphasize that by letting her get to use \"more\" abilities. (Because occasionally they're free.)\n\nThe problem with Lissandra's passive is it works similar to Ashe's old passive. It rewards non-active gameplay by being internally gated with a timer. It tries to make up for this by reducing the cooldown when you do what she's supposed to be doing, but it's still gated.\n\nSo, after that explanation of what I've been thinking, let me get to my suggestion\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Passive: Iceborn**\nLissandra's basic attacks and abilities apply a slow. (_A very minor slow added to the autoattack, and glacial path_)\n\nBasic attacks and abilities hitting a slowed target or killing a unit grant Lissandra a stack of 'Forbidden Knowledge'.  (Triple for champions, large minions and large monsters.) Once she reaches 16(?) stacks of forbidden knowledge, Lissandra's next ability cast (_that hits a champion?_) is free and 16(?) stacks are consumed.\n\n(_Lissandra can have a maximum of 50? stacks?_)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Why I thought this seemed like a good idea**\n\nFirst, I want to say that the number of stacks needed might be way too low. I think that's a balance issue that should be tested. My thought was that a perfect Ring of Frost or Frozen tomb in a team fight would allow her next spell cast to be free, right away. \n\nWhen it comes to the maximum number of stacks, I was thinking it'd be cool if she stored power by destroying minions/auto attacking and then released it once she was attacking champions. It comes from the idea in lore that Lissandra is a force that is biding her time but needs to be dealt with, and if you leave her alone she'll become unstoppable. This would encourage \"all in\" play styles more than poking, as poking champions would consume stacks you'd be building up.\n\nI wasn't sure how much power this gave her though. If she had more space in her power budget I was toying with the idea that once she reached max stacks she would consume half her stacks to greatly reduce the cooldown on her next spell cast. (Or perhaps give it a \"Syndra\" type bonus effect.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"AbodyHUN666","date":"2015-05-08T17:07:26.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you think about a passive which lets her go without mana regen if she is able to proc it?

Her passive is already pretty nifty in times of use and helps her mana sustain in lane. It also goes hand to hand with her short range and fits her thematic of a powerful being(she's a Watcher)obsessing a female body.

I'm not sure if they're still working on one; I suspect if they are, it's a bit on hold because other changes are more pressing (getting other champions into a good spot, since Lissandra is doing fine right now/recently).","replies":[{"poster":"CubedJustice","date":"2015-05-05T20:33:27.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huh.
