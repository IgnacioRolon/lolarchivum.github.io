They tend to avoid humans, even lone humans, and ones on reserves (used to human presence) are even somewhat sociable animals. The 'alpha to omega' pack structure is also only partly true- there is a lead wolf, but in general a pack is like a big family that takes care of each other. The only time a wolf is ever 'vicious' is when it's scared out of its mind! Otherwise, even when hunting, they're pretty calm and precise predators.\n\nTL;DR: Adult wolves are pretty cute too and probably wouldn't hurt you unless you scared 'em.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2016-09-15T02:32:10.244+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The ones on SR are corrupted.
