A Fire Elemental and bear-toting fire-child. There are other champs that use fire like Rumble and Karma (sort of). Actually, now that I think about it... that&#039;s about it. I guess the new GP sets things on fire now, so there&#039;s that.\r\n\r\nBut I think we need another fire-themed champ... or at least someone who uses the flashy element. Is it possible that a champ fitting this description may or may not be in the works? Or maybe a concept or something floating around? I love how I&#039;m asking all the questions no one can answer directly.","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Mackey","date":"2015-08-03T11:31:44.119+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"All was balanced in League of Legends.

(if we don't count Shyvana as fire themed and Annie since she isn't a REAL support...). Ive made a champion concept with a fire theme that could maybe inspire some ideas ^^ ( [Sham'a The Candle Maker](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/WFsEGrtc-champion-concept-shama-the-candle-maker) ) \nBut a fire themed adc would maybe have a flame thrower....that would be awesome...or maybe some kind of smith guy that throws hot coal...it's hard to come with fire themed ranged weapons that make sense and don't sound like some kind of skin...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yber Nando","date":"2015-08-03T10:59:00.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about a creature that spits fire? or a vandal with a slingshot, throwing away rocks wrapped by paper on fire? or just an artificer with fireworks? *throws random ideas*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Voidac","date":"2015-08-03T06:48:47.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I figured, and that's fine!\n\nNow, if it were up to me...\nWell, I think simply making the champ fire-themed would be pretty boring. They'd have to use it for more than just attacking or as an offensive tool/weapon. I'm thinking some kind of hextechnology might be in play here. If we're going marksman, I fear the champ might come out too close to Graves or Tristana since combustion and bullets and cannons. We can't just throw fireballs, that can be boring and we have people that do that. \nHowever, I like the idea of fire through hextech. But we have to do this carefully. Champion identities are very important, I think. When we look at champs and their inventions, they all have a particular set of items (unlike Viktor who has several because he's awesome). Vi and her gauntlets, Ekko's zero-drive, Jayce's Mercury Hammer. And I think adding too many gadgets onto the champion might take away from the identity. Maybe using fire for thrust, and attack using redirected thrust?\n\n(Just scratched a couple paragraphs where I rambled on about using thrust and fire focused through devices as weapons. Gonna wait till I get back to my desktop to continue this.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Enjoish","date":"2015-08-03T04:48:13.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suggested in a marksman post about having a marksman using a Fire whip which would be awesome!","replies":[]},{"poster":"shadowsaotome","date":"2015-08-03T13:36:39.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just spitballing here, but what about a marksman that used a slingshot that could have fire aspects?
