We don't support these kinds of modification, so I wouldn't know how to help fix this up aside from resetting your config to default.\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nFrom there you can rebind your keys, though I wouldn't recommend making unintended modifications as it's possible to run into these issues again.","replies":[{"poster":"Valeeva","date":"2017-05-19T21:51:34.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, sorry for the late reply but I figured it out too before seeing this post. I've been using these weird binds for years and never encountered an issue but I'll always bare it in mind.","replies":[]}]}]}
