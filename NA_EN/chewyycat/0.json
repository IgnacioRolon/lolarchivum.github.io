Sometimes when I go to click spells it won't work. Like I can click QWER but then the mouse won't click to release the spell. I know it's not my mouse or keyboard. When I click on escape to bring up the menu then exit right away the spells will work for awhile then they'll stop again. Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-02T03:47:50.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you may be experiencing some sort of *packet loss* or *high packet buffering*. Do you notice a delay in anything happening on the screen during your matches that this issue happens in?","replies":[{"poster":"chewyycat","date":"2016-11-04T21:52:53.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No :/ it seemed perfectly normal besides this issue. Riot support has recommended I try patching my launcher and fixing some config files which I'll do now. Hopefully that works!
