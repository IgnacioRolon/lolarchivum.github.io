My game does this sometimes and I find i can get things working faster If I close everything and reopen the game. So I exited and closed my client. Then I reopened the client and It wouldn't let me reconnect. It was like I wasn't in a game. I could queue up for another game and go through my profile and collection and go to the store. I was right in the middle of a great game and I don't want to get banned!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T00:38:32.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like that game went a little screwy server side. Most likely that game crashed for everyone since you weren't able to reconnect. In those cases, nobody will get any penalties and everyone can requeue for their next match.","replies":[]}]}
