There is already ad that gives mr {{item:3156}} so why not one that gives armor?","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-02-23T23:03:07.135+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because off the top of my head I think it would be an op or insta buy on most top lane matchups (obviously the ad vs ad ones) quite like hexdrinker is on any ad mid vs a mage.\n\nItems that give both offence and defensive capabilities are top tier in the early game.  This is why {{item:3751}} {{item:3044}} {{item:2033}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3748}}  are all great items top lane. Each gives both of a combination of tankyness, sustain and dmg. \n\nIntroducing a new item that gives ad/ar means the next buy would be a {{item:3751}}  or {{item:1011}}  and that would be the build path for 50% of the top laners from that point on. \n\nPersonally I think top lane itemization is in a decent spot right now (with some tank fiora, yi abuse cases as exceptions) and there simply isn't a reason to introduce an item like that.","replies":[{"poster":"coeurloyal","date":"2016-02-23T23:24:00.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly this. The point of open itemization is to force player to make a choice between 1) Damage (AP/AD) 2) Defense (Armor/ MRes) and 3) Utility. Because the game is technically won by damage overall, you will rarely see both damage and damage reduction on a single item. Most have one or the other plus utility effects. Having more offense + defense options would change the game into a pure stat check, which would be very bad. Items that have both tend to fall into debates on whether they are OP or not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Uncertainty","date":"2016-02-23T23:21:58.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay!
