I am posting to see if anyone else is struggling with Comcast. In game ping consistently jumps from 40ms to 400ms. It is the same old story: streaming, web browsing, and literally everything else works perfectly fine.... EXCEPT League of Legends. It just seems so strange. Feel free to comment. Like I said I was just curious if I was the only one experiencing problems with Comcast in the past week.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAlways Persist","replies":[{"poster":"Snarpon","date":"2017-10-27T21:38:47.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah man, Comcast is the worst sometimes.
