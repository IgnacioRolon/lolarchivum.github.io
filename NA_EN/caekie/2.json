You&#039;d just Q them, wait for it to fly, and just before it hits you use R and E to blow it up. You actually did less damage this way but it was much smoother and felt great to play.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter they changed her E to not trigger her mark, nobody played Akali anymore. She felt clunky as fuck to play and her E essentially became a useless filler skill. Some people just didn&#039;t even put a point in it opting for increased AR/MR from her shroud. They had to update her R, FIVE times to do some janky as fuck &quot;behind target&quot; placement bullshit to compensate for it. To this day she still feels like garbage to play compared to before the change.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this didn&#039;t change her damage potential at all. Competent Akali players were still able to do the exact same thing but with a slight lag compared to before. People still complained about her damage. But the people that did play Akali dropped her as it just didn&#039;t feel good to play anymore. Riot achieved nothing but pissing off devote Akali players.\r\n\r\n \r\n---\r\n \r\n\r\nThis change to Zoe&#039;s Q is essentially the same thing. People still get instantly oneshotted from a medium ranged Q into a target afflicted with her E anyway. Her damage in her most frequent scenarios have not been addressed at all and this change literally only affects the fringe cases of MAXIMUM range Q&#039;s which all but the fewest Zoe players even consistently pull off.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but max range Q&#039;s require a full 2 seconds of foresight and placement prediction. This made for actual skillful decisions on where to place the shot and hard reading your opponent to predict where they will go.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat this change does is just make Zoe feel terrible to play while not addressing any of her damage issues at all. They&#039;ve kept the skill floor the same but dramatically dropped the skill ceiling with this update.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo put it into perspective, it is better to simply run with your Q than to use your ultimate now for the purposes of range extension. Your net gain in range is shorter compared to shortcasting it with your ultimate, but you don&#039;t lock yourself into place for easy targeting with the inherent demerits of her ultimate. The ability to still use the rest of your things as well as side step completely outweigh the minuscule amount of range you gain when Q is used in conjunction with her ultimate now.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n \r\n\r\nTL;DR :\r\n\r\nRiot gutted her usability making Zoe feel like shit to play while addressing none of the actual damage issues.\r\n\r\nNovice Zoe players will feel no difference but pro Zoe players may as well play something else.","replies":[{"poster":"ThePikol","date":"2018-01-12T10:45:46.624+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":6,"body":"make a champion unfun to play as -> it's playerbase drops -> no need to balance a champion if it's not played much -> profit","replies":[{"poster":"Awoof","date":"2018-01-12T16:40:14.679+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ThePikol,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TEE5GWxa,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-12T10:45:46.624+0000)\n>\n> no need to balance a champion if it&#x27;s not played much -&gt; profit\n\nYeah about that... {{champion:74}}","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2018-01-12T18:16:27.829+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"There is no way in hell Heimerdinger could ever be balanced.\n\nHis entire design is based around \"you either can take out my turrets or you're fucked.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2018-01-12T18:20:04.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That or just dive past them and still kill him-\n\nThink there have been a few like that which is what promts him into going for zhonya.\n\nWhich makes things worse though.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2018-01-12T18:25:45.480+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Usually, as a Heimerdinger player, I love it when they try to dive my turrets.

This is very similar to Taliyah at release, where Riot changed her W cast to vector cast (correct me if I'm wrong) about a month or so into her release on live servers. This W change caused Taliyah mains to drop her as they couldn't readjust the way they cast her W, while other people could play her. This Zoe Q nerf means that her R is almost never worth using to extend her Q at this point, as it's just a warning to the enemy laner. \nThe only thing I agree with at this point was the change to where Zoe can't get a free hextech gunblade from creeps anymore.

Calm down, please.\n\n4. One player doesn't mean Akali has a severely high pick rate. According to LeagueOfGraphs, her pick rate is 5.2%.

Those that love the champion and play them every day feel discouraged because they feel like they have to re-learn all the skills and combos and play-style after they finally just finished learning them. This happened with Taliyah's w (seismic shift i think its called) which used to be a somewhat difficult skill/mechanic to master but was extremely rewarding. A small portion of people complained about Taliyah's strength and difficulty and then they completely did away with her double cast, slapped a vector casting on it and called it a day. This upset a ton of Taliyah mains and some struggled for months unlearning and relearning. Changing Zoe's an aspect of her Q's playability versus just changing the damage seems foolish to me. Why create this fun amazing champ with a learning curve (which is good, not everyone wants to point and click stun. people want difficult champs to play) and then take away their fluidity? Just nerf her damage like everyone has asked. Make her point blank Q damage not scale so much with AP, make her longer distance Q deal more like the original plan was supposed to be.
