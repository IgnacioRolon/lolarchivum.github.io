{"poster":"Caekie","date":"2018-03-19T09:33:01.809+0000","title":"You have trampled over the old design philosophies of league, and the imbalance they prevented","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":115,"down_votes":24,"body":"It&#039;s quite clear that the design philosophy of the current balance team is nothing resembling that of the earlier days of league, let alone just a few years ago. \n\nThis isn&#039;t to call out the current team for destroying the game, no, I actually adore some of the features that have been created and feel that they have made leaps and bounds on improvements for League of Legends. \n\n**However,**\n\nI believe that in the desire to move forward and improve the state of the game, that the design team has forgotten very core principles and balance states of the past that, quite literally, prevented the game from destroying itself.\n\nChanges that have been made to these critical areas have since created balance issues, **to then be fixed by even further changes, and then those changes causing more problems**, accumulating and spiraling out of control into the catastrophic state of balance that we currently have.\n\nMany of the changes both small and radical, were implemented with a specific idea or concept in mind. Most of them never actually resulted in the expected outcomes and at the time, had such little impact that the change did not matter at all. Forgotten and discarded, these changes were never reverted and as such served as the root factors for various future updates after they **DID** become problems.\n\nThe design team however, seems to have never took the step back to wonder &quot;why a particular item/objective&quot; is the way it is currently, rather they took the route to just adjust it to the current game state instead of looking back to it&#039;s intended purpose. \n\n#For example:\n\n{{item:3078}}  \n\n Triforce in the past was an item that gave an inefficient mix of stats that was compensated by the fact that it&#039;s passive trigger was a very powerful ability. Not every champion could use the hybridized stats of AP, critical chance, and constant spell triggers. But those that could, used it well.\n\nTriforce was then streamlined into an ***ABSOLUTELY BATSHIT CRAZY ITEM*** with a melange of stats that quite literally synergized with itself. Every champion that could use this item should use it, but those that were good with it, became absolutely insane. As a result of this one change, a new era of Triforce users came about and they** subsequently had to be nerfed to the ground** as they were way too powerful with this item. \n\n**What was even the purpose of this change?**\n\nThere was a very particular reason why Triforce was the item it was. It was an inefficient mix of stats **ON PURPOSE** because the item itself&#039;s passive is absolutely insane. So to compensate for that item&#039;s power, it had to lose some power in a different direction. \n\nYou guys did not even bother to revert the changes to the item either! Instead opting to keep it around in it&#039;s current over tuned as hell state as a literal mine field of balance issues should any one of the current or future champions become viable with it&#039;s use. There are so many champions at the moment that if they are able to optimize Triforce, are absolutely unstoppable with that one single item spike.\n\nPatch after patch includes changes to champions that are tuned to be able to optimize this iteration of Triforce yet you guys don't see that it's not the champion,** rather this one particular item that's causing them to be so powerful.**\n\n#Another example:\n\n{{item:3116}} \n\nHere is an item on the opposite side of the spectrum. Rylai&#039;s was an item that enabled certain champions to function with it&#039;s passive. It was fairly expensive for it&#039;s stats but the ability to add a significant slow to your abilities meant that certain champions could reliably apply their damage and actually function.\n\nRylai&#039;s was later changed to have a significantly weaker slow with the sole reason being that the new champion, Azir, could abuse it at the time.\n\n**Was the result of this change worth it?**\n\nSure you gutted Azir for the time being (hint, he&#039;s still being played without it lol) but everyone else that actually built Rylai&#039;s as a core item to function has then since never built it as the weakened slow was simply not worth it&#039;s price point when there are other much more usable items in the same vein of use. \n\nOr they simply just didn&#039;t build it anymore. The champions that do still build it are champions that relied on it so heavily that even with the nonexistant slow, they actually needed it to barely function and took a huge hit for absolutely no reason.\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\nAnyway.\n\nThere are so many more changes that have happened to the game such as,\n\n Bounty, Rift Heralds existance, tower protection, spree ending gold spread, death timer curve, runes, items, **GUINSOO&#039;S RAGE BLADE**, champion base stats, Baron buff, specific champion buffs, \n\nThat I could talk about but my post is already long. Let me know what you guys think.\n\n____________\n\nEdit1: \n\nYes, my writing got significantly worse after my initial claim on design philosophies and the supporting arguments did not fully capture my intention and does seem to come off as rambling and or vauge.\n\nLet me reiterate then,\n\nBasically, Riots design team in it's current form has this habit of  changing content for the game in an effort to improve it. \n\nHowever many of these changes sometimes end in a \"Okay that's cool, but why?\"\n\nTo put it lightly at least, some of these changes carry extremely huge consequences. To carry off my example of Triforce, what was the need to streamline the item? Triforce then becomes extremely powerful with several nerfs to pertaining champions and as such the actual change to the item leaves players going \"why\". \n\nThis was a clear change in design philosophy that cared little for the previous balancing principles of the past that kept Triforce in it's place, and therefore prevented the predicted, and already happened, nerfs to it's users.\n\nNow you can quite literally insert any other aspect of \"recent\" or \"modern\" League of legends, such as Rift Herald, Bounty, Death timer curves; You can see that these recent changes to said aspects have been absolutely differing from the design philosophies of the past and with it have ignored the obvious imbalances they prevented.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Get Ogre Here","date":"2018-03-19T10:20:50.640+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":55,"body":"I haven't even read the post and I agree with you.

Trist, Vayne and Twitch all do what the old assassins did, but better, and yet....where's Riot on this one?\nThey don't seem to be speaking out against it, how odd.\n\nThis tilts me more than anything since they screwed assassins over so mages and ADCs could have an easier time. However what they forgot to do was adjust mages and ADCs accordingly so that they didn't become too oppressive without any consistent natural predators anymore (let's be honest, the old assassins were the predators in the food chain). \nIt should also be noted that Riot isn't ok with burst damage....except the only way to bypass the excess amount of shields in this meta is by utilising burst damage. Except....assassins no longer have that, so again they're screwed over.\n\nWhy does Riot have this problem? Why do they hate assassins while not hating any other class? I don't think any other class has been screwed over as much as the assassin class has, and that's saying something since even bruisers are in a better spot than them. Even Aatrox is in a better spot than assassins and he's been out of meta for ages. \n\nTouching on what \"Get Ogre Here\" said, where does the assassin class sit in the \"circle of balance\" now? ADCs beat them, supports provide far too much peel, and mages have far too much HP following the AP itemisation update+loads of CC and waveclear. So really assassins only beat other assassins.....except they don't since the opposing support will always peel the other assassin off their assassin.

Most could not oneshot without first telegraphing thier play seconds before executing, to buy players time to respond. In contrast, an itemized ADC can kill squishies outright during those same few seconds - so why bother with an assassin?\nNot to mention that an ADC shreds tanks and burns through shields/heals, and aren't screwed over by stasis or resurrection effects like assassins. so adcs have none of the downsides of an assassin. Yet they can still delete squishies as well because they have range, and the fact that an ADC has to telegraph thier intention to kill you is no longer a downside when assassins are forced to telegraph the same. \n\nThis delay also makes it near impossible for assassins to even function because it provides so much time for support/tank peel/shield, and time for the ADC to lifesteal back to full health if you cannot literally burst them completely down faster than they can get off an auto attack. \n\nYes, assassins still have more tools for gap closing, but when the ADC can just attack-move into the whole enemy team and waste them while being near invulnerable to assassin dives, why would you ever want to play a Talon?\n\nThats why riot has been reverting some of the assassin reworks.","replies":[{"poster":"NocturnalSheild","date":"2018-03-20T22:21:28.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh i agree.

Yeah, you might not be able to save your ADC without great difficulty, but at least you stood a good chance of killing the assassin in retaliation unless they were super fed and had levels on your team. \nBut ADCs fear no one. They will kill you and then kill the people who tried to protect you. Maybe they fear lots of CC. But lots of CC would have killed the old assassins just as bad.

Why? Because outside of the jungle, they literally cannot function properly while being somewhat healthy. Seriously please show me an assassin that is better designed than Eve or Kayn right now.\n\nHere's what an assassin who goes mid needs\n\n1) Mobility, which more often than not translates into an escape due to how team fights work. No one wants a suicide bomber, the goal's not to make the team fight a 4v4, it's to make it a 5v4\n2) Burst, this one is self-explanatory, they're assassins\n3) Waveclear, because without it they'll just be pushed to their turret all game and do nothing\n\nAnd the problems lie with numbers 1 and 3.\n1) It is completely unfair when a character who can instantly kill you should you make a mistake or get ganked has access to a safe escape. But because they need to be even remotely functionnal in team fights, they have it in lane. The only solution would be to tie literally every assassin's escape to their ult, which limits the devs' creativity a lot.\n3) There is no way in hell you can justify an assassin having waveclear that is even remotely on par with the average mage's. Whenever assassins do have access to good waveclear, they are oppresive and overpowered as fuck, like KZ back in season 2 or Zed whenever he's good. They clear waves, stay equal in farm and are able to roam. Mages cannot easily follow an assassin that is roaming because if they get caught 1v1 they're dead. If the assassin has good waveclear and is balanced/weak, then that champion either lacks true assassin capabilities, like say Ahri who's a mage-assassin hybrid, or their numbers are simply too low. \n\nAnd so here we are, with assassins more often than not being either OP or UP, frustrating as shit or dreadfully underwhelming. They and bruisers are by far the most difficult classes to balance because they are usually in a state where they either lack exploitable weaknesses or their weaknesses are fucking glaring. Tanks don't do a lot of damage, mages are low mobility and low-ish defensive capabilities, supports need to enable someone else, ADCs are/should be squishy and *SHOULD* lack burst. I think jungler assassins are a lot better simply because they do what assassins should be doing, roaming, without having the need for overbearing safety and waveclear that their class should not have access to. That being said most assassin kits do not lend themselves well to the jungle, unfortunately. I long to see a League of Legends where Zed's waveclear is gutted but he's still viable, but I'm not sure how you can make that happen and clearly neither is Riot. So we'll just keep riding the nerfs-and-buffs train till we get to a point where you're not allowed to blind pick a mage ever.
