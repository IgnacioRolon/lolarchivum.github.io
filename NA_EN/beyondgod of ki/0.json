So i wanted to know if there is anyway to get better at ranked","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-07-20T20:45:09.705+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Practice, practice, practice.\n\nWhat role are you playing?\n\nIf you are dying a lot in lane, try to just focus on CSing. You do not necessarily need to fight your lane opponent at all. If you focus on CSing better than your opponent, you will be stronger than them. After you are confident your CSing skill is sufficient, you can work on weaving in harassment while your enemy is going for CS (but not at the cost of your own). You don't need to kill the enemy, just make them pay for each and every CS.\n\nThis is core to (most) every champion and will carry over to almost everything you play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"welovegag","date":"2016-07-21T02:22:37.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CSing is a 101lesson of playing strategic game. However, there are too many factors like champ knowledge (from what should be picked in favor of ur team comp and which champ u r good at); also i would suggest to play jungle as it requires the most map awareness and strategies in game. Of course people will be blaming jungler the most since their impact to the game is crucial, also i would recommend to play adc since the only job u need to do is farm at any stage of the game. If u r playing early game adc like mf, quinn; poke and trade of hp is important for u to secure ur early game. For late game adc like vayne, its recommended to farm at all times and trade as less as possible due to the mispositioning in lower tiers matchups; \nIn teamfight, it is most important to stay alive and dont get panicked, a lot of matchups where people will just rush into fight and loose focus on who should be attacking or when to use cc, ss and if u r playing as damage dealer, dont get caught just becoz enemies are low and decided to flash in; if u r support/ tank, try to do it in two ways: peel for ur damage dealer (mid or adc) or cc the enemy teams as much as possible by going all in. However, second method usually didnt work out well since the mechanics and knowledge of teamfight is poor in low elo. \nAlso, learn to understand what ur team can do in each stage of games (early game with shaco jungle is usually ahead of the enemy team but knowing how to end the game while ahead in early game is also important); if ur team is item-based or late game monster; try to sustain till late game so they can bring the most of the game and synergy.\nGood luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tr4f4lg4r","date":"2016-07-21T01:42:12.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont play ranked cuz i dont think im good enough yet, but i can tell you the things im working on to be a better player in general: \n\nCS: try to kill all the minions of each wave, if every 10 min you get around 100 cs you are doing well. \nMap control/awareness: ward constantly, not only your sides but if the jg forgot to ward objectives like dragon or baron, place a {{item:2043}}  there too, look at your minimap every few seconds and ping anything you see.\nTrade: if the enemy team its taking an objective, coordinate with your team to get one yourselves ASAP (if the enemy jg and top laner get top turret, you and your team get bot turret or a dragon). Dont let them have anything for free.\nCounterpick: if you cant win 1 v 1, do your best to freeze the wave close to your turret and leave him exposed for a gank. Capitalize every recall or roam of your enemy laner, shove the wave as fast as you can and focus on taking that turret without fighting.\n\nIts frustrating when you cant dominate your lane but in those cases i try to be of influence in the \"macro\" by focusing on objectives and global gold. If you already know this stuff, well you wasted your time reading this m8... if not, i hope it was helpful.
