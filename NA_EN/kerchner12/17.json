There are certainly those that outscale. He is reliant on his burst and has large base cooldowns.\n\nIt's no longer a reason to keep Renekton on the shelf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2016-01-25T14:30:43.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Renekton's fury system is a big part of it.\n\nIn the laning phase it's easy access to minions in which to generate 50~100 fury for his empowered abilities, meaning he gets to use his strongest abilities in trades and fights.\n\nOnce 35~40 minutes roles around, Renekton loses a lot of that ease of access.\n\nAdditionally, his only CC is single target and his ultimate's damage falls off hard once people have a bit of MR.\n\nAlso, tanks tend to be able to whether renekton once they have a few items but get destroyed in the lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-01-25T07:49:43.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"champions that fall off late game are ad casters that don't rely on auto attacks. not all of them. but many of them are better off for their team as tank as they can't even kill squishies in one rotation.\n\n\nrenekton does fall off late game pretty hard. because you have to build him glass canon to blow up squishies and if you go tanky you do no sustained damage as you really don't have any AA steroid of some sort.\n\nyou just snowballed in all of these if the other team caught up renekton would be anything special.\n\nthink of it this way. in a team fight your mele. and you do damage. what do you do? you dive in and try to get a kill. if you cant in one rotation. you'd just die.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnazzyTheMister","date":"2016-01-25T06:44:52.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when a champion is considered to \"fall off late\" it tends to be that at 6 items there are champions that are better then this champion and what makes a champion better at 6 items is if their kit has steroids in it. renekton lacks some strong tank steroids and is short range so if hes doesn't build some durability he is going to have a hard time dealing damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2016-01-25T05:48:00.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Renekton is meant to dive the back line and CC/heavily damage or even kill the squishies. To do this, he needs to build VERY tanky. What I see from you is a build that works low enough however against a team that can focus correctly shouldn't have too much of an issue. It's similar to almost full AD garen builds. Sure, it's gimmicky and can work, but as soon as you're CC'd, you'll get ripped apart.\n\nGoing off of this, the tank is meant to have some sort of heavy initiate. Refer to champions like Sejuani, Amumu, Nautilus, Thresh, Blitz, etc. These champions have a way to catch people out and force a fight whenever they deem fit. Renekton doesn't do that. Either he is this mega tanky Gator that dives your back line that survives 4-5 times as long as the normal champ would, or he's the very high damage gator that dives the back line and survives much less but has a chance of assassinating a squishy. The issue here, is getting to the back line. Renekton's slice and dice is VERY short range, therefore not giving Renekton that amazing pick or force initiations most tanks are known for having. \n\nSo basically, Renekton is known for his early game lane dominance because his kit allows him to out trade, and for free for that matter, most champions in lane. However, late game he's very limited to what he can do. He has no real mobility save for a couple small dashes, second being situational, and very predictable. Even his stun, that is a time consuming animation. In a 1v1 top lane it doesn't matter but when you're inside the enemy team, that's time you don't quite have. \n\nOverall, don't go off of personal stats when questioning an aspect of a champion. If it's carrying you through games, keep playing that champion until you simply stop climbing.

But I for sure will keep playing him until I no longer can. \n\nBest of luck to you this season, may you climber higher than last season!","replies":[]}]}]}
