I usually listen to music or chat while I league. It was really cool hearing them go off, and if you weren't paying attention, that was your fault. I know queue times are long, and I get alot of reading done while playing League, but when it switches to the champ select screen, you shouldn't be tabbing out. There's enough visual cues for you to see when you pick your champ anyway. That's a lame ass excuse.\n\nEdit: too many anyways.","replies":[]}]}
