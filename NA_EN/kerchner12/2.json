On one hand dmg would be good for fighting and securing kills, on the other hand his ult applies map wide pressure and the ability to contest objectives.\n\nSivir I like the utility ult because as an adc it means she isn't ult reliant to fight and the utility is the reason to pick / not pick her in comparison to other champs.\n\nMundo's ult is interesting because the Utility it provides increases his dmg output by letting him survive and stick to targets.  Taking a champ whose main dmg source is gated (Q) and boosting his dmg at the cost of less survivability means that he can neither burst or live long enough to make good use of %health dmg.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Milodic Mellodi","date":"2016-06-08T18:12:33.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those are both map traveling abilities, I think that's the only utility they offer. The difference is Taliyah's Ult can actually help (or hinder if not used right) when teamfighting because it closes off areas and helps isolate enemies from their team. Rek'Sai just travels...really quickly, which greatly benefits his kit, but that's all it does.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Milodic Mellodi","date":"2016-06-08T18:08:45.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like utility better because I main Tristana. While it does have both damage and utility (making it have 10085/70 cooldown, 60/51/42 under 40% CDR or 55/41.25/38.5 under 45%), its versatility is what makes it so great on her. You can use it as an escape (not as effective as her W though), to launch them under your tower for easy damage (risky if you need to W behind them to pull it off if they have a ready Support/Jungle already there), to deal huge amounts of damage with your E for the \"Buddy Bomb\" technique (this was made easier when her max charges on her E got reduced, but it's still really hard in normal gameplay unless you really know what you're doing), to push enemies into your allies (like pushing a mobile Champ into someone like Darius or Xin Zhao), and also simply to kill low-health targets. While it doesn't scale up with AD, it has 100% scaling with AP if you want to go Hybrid or AP. Point is, its utility-based versatility is what makes it so nice an Ult, and these are the kinds of Ults I prefer: Ults that have high utility and fit with the Champion's kit so well that it's like a higher-cooldown main ability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cub√≠x","date":"2016-06-08T17:06:37.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer utility ults for one main reason; Cooldowns. The main champ I play is Kha'zix and although his ult is good IMO, I don't have to count on it to get kills. I also play rek'sai or elise, etc. I don't like having to count on my ult to confirm a kill. Now not all champs with a damage ult need it for kills but it defintely helps them get most of said kills.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joman767","date":"2016-06-08T16:55:37.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on what it actually does.
