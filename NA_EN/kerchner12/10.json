I hear people talk about how they absolutely love x champion, and i want that. Maybe i just need some inspirations.

I always had good scores with her. Is the champ i control the best. I always have loved the \"Wind magic\" in all movies and games ( for a example, Avatar).\n\nI enjoy play Janna, i enjoy her kit, and i enjoy to have a ilimitated activables to play with. I like to aport something to the team, i love to save people, and i love to don't care about have to get kills to have damage. \n\nI don't know how much time have you been playing, but if u are new, probably you just need to continue playing to find something special. If you are a player who got a time in the game, is probably that you don't are a \"main\" player because u like to play all for the same.\n\nYes, Janna is my main, but i play all champs practically the same, i've played the same times poppy than zed, or zilean than ahri. I don't like to repeat too much to play a champ, but Janna is the one that i don't get tired of play with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Faneaorin","date":"2015-06-18T15:09:54.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main support i like controlling vision and moving wards (the strategic part of it) i also like champions that pack a lot of CC so that naturally lends itself to things like: Leona, Janna, Alistar and i like champions with healing abilities: sona, alistar and soraka (less so after her rework)\n\nForgot to include outside these i really like zigg's personality and lulu cause they are both very awesome","replies":[{"poster":"Rootworth","date":"2015-06-18T18:06:41.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soraka's winrate has increased after her rework.

Her kit overall is much much more powerful now and has more aggressive potential if she wants to go that route......

I'm not entirely sure what role/champ to main. And what champs to pick for fillers (I plan on creating a new account - so I'm testing right now).\n\nBut that being said, right now I main Blitzcrank support. He has an aggressive kit, and it allowed me to reach Silver 4 from Bronze 3 in just 3 weeks. However, since I face better players now, Blitzcrank isn't the greatest. People pick Leona support, or adc's like Vayne, Kalista or Lucian to counter me. So I'm wondering who I should move on to next.","replies":[{"poster":"Kerchner12","date":"2015-06-18T01:30:04.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your reply, bud!
