I know he used to be uber op when he first came out then his numbers where nerfed. I'm not saying he needs a rework like some other threads are saying, but maybe just some number changes? Or even skip the numbers and make his q uninterruptable. His kit is nice it's different from the other champs. He is an mADC but he seems weak compared to other champions.","replies":[]}
