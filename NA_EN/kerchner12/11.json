This is very frustrating for me because when I play w/my brother and we go over how he did after the game, I try to show him what he should build according to their damage type. But it doesn&#039;t work. Can you please fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Ed Vanders","date":"2015-07-01T17:41:00.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've noticed the same thing. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it doesn't fix it. I've looked and this is the first time I've seen anybody say anything about it. Very frustrating. Especially in ARAM when I get a champ I've never played and I'm trying to quickly figure out what to do with them before the game starts.","replies":[{"poster":"Kerchner12","date":"2015-07-01T20:30:11.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes! I forgot ARAM. I've done the same thing getting a free week champion and I'm trying to figure out what to do with said champion. I hope this gets resolved soon.","replies":[]}]}]}
