Ethernet, everything. The only work-around I've found is to use a VPN. This, of course, causes other problems. Most notably terrible lag in game. So I have to turn off the VPN before I get into game, which crashes the loading screen and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\nBasically, is Frontier a known ISP that has issues with Riot's servers, and if so (or regardless) is there a more elegant work around that I'm missing?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-25T23:16:44.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you aren't able to connect to pvp.net at all then something like a firewall setting could be blocking you from using that service.  Using a VPN could certainly cause some issues, but there is another way to try and re-route your network!  Go over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune things up, including configuring DNS which can help re-route how you reach our services.  Let me know if that helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Postal Twinkie","date":"2017-04-25T22:33:56.920+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remove all your Firewall exceptions for League and its associated programs, and then add them back in. It sounds like it very well is a Firewall issue and by using the VPN (which obscures the data and exits your system under the VPNs permission) you are working around your local Firewall policy. \n\nThe client update has caused some Firewall rules for certain people to seem to stop being applicable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Heraclies","date":"2017-08-19T01:27:36.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also have frontier internet and have problems connecting to pvp.net. if i use my computer with the same settings and everything on any other internet service provider, i.e. friends internet or when i am in college, league of legends works perfectly fine, but go back home and use frontier internet again and the problems come right back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Almost 12pm","date":"2017-05-16T21:02:06.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I just found  your post, I use frontier too and I'm having the same issue, my chat won't work.

The only way I can connect to PVP.net is by using a VPN or a different internet connection other than my home network.\n\nI should note that this happens on my Mac, my Windows, and my brother's windows. This is in no way isolated to my main (Mac OSX 10.11.6) computer. \n\n(as a side note, Riot's troubleshooting that was linked has practically zero support for macs, I was able to find other sources to do the tasks recommended, but the site itself was largely unhelpful for Mac users (which honestly I'm used to as a Mac gamer, but usually LoL and Riot is much better than most other companies in that regard).)","replies":[]}]}
