Firstly, I have played 1 Lee Sin game in like months (got a quadra, but it was a normal), same for vi. And for both nidalee and vi I already own the only skin I could want. \r\n\r\nMy %70 sale was on muay Thai Lee, which just has such a bad reputation as a skin I don't want to use it lol, and the rest of the discounts were %40 off or less. \r\n\r\nSo, all in all, not the best, but not the worst. I really can't complain about discounts even if I probably won't use them. \r\n\r\nI'm interested to know how everyone else's went, comment below and make me jealous!","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2015-12-17T09:43:48.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got a bunch of skins that I don't like and/or dislike/hate the champ they belong to (2/6 were Ashe skins, who I don't play, one was Riven, who I find incredibly boring and played like, three games ever on).
