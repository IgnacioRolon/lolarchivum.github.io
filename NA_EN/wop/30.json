I think he could be a good answer to alot of the &quot;OP&quot; champs right now, as he has the attack speed slows, as well as an amplification to the &quot;OP&quot; champs on his team, with his attack speed increase for an ally.\r\n\r\nAlso, although I&#039;m sure others have talked of this, but Rammus is definitely a good counter to all these super strong adcs right now.\r\n\r\nIDK, that&#039;s just my two cents.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2015-11-17T21:43:42.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shhh...

I am just telling you that I have had great success as support lately.\n\nGraves is probably the least effective ADC to couple with Nunu... but a Caitlyn, a Vayne, a Kalista, an Ashe, a Jinx or even a Twitch... will utterly destroy games with Blood Boil/Ice peeling. \n\nJungle Nunu is more about counter jungling and objective control for most of the game rather than buffing up the overpowered ADCs...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2015-11-17T21:22:49.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nunu needs a rework but there's no form of rework that can retain the coolness of his current kit unless ultimate applies his blood boil but then nunu's chasing and escaping with teammates wouldn't be as strong, iceball can't be changed right, and neither can consume  the giant f u to enemies. I love nunu's kit but only thing that could happen is maybe make his ulti a zone spawned and nunu can move around it? so it can still do it's damage but gives him  the ability to actually do something\n\nOther than that all nunu needs is a utility buff otherwise no rework is possible.","replies":[]}]}
