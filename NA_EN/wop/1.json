As you can see from the title, I am in need of your assistance. I know you have probably seen stuff like this all the time, or maybe not, IDK.\nMy parents want me to make a presentation (proposal?) about why I should be able to play League. I don't know if this is weird or not, but I need your help. I recently told my parents I wanted to play video games for a living (yes, I know every little kid wants to, sue me) I explained to them how it can be a viable career if you are willing to put in effort and time, but surprisingly this is not even their main concern, their main concern is that it is a MO game, and they are concerned for my safety online, and therefore they made me stop leveling my new account. I know about internet safety and all of that, which is why I will not even give my age to try and prove I know about it, but this is really a hamper on my dreams. Unlike other kids who just saw a few people can make money playing games and streaming, I have wanted to do this since as long as I can remember (like when I was playing SEGA a long time ago).\n\nWill you guys please comment reasons I should be able to play or 'pros' of League, and then some reasons why my parents would be against it or 'cons' and what I can do to ease their minds about said negatives. Please keep in mind I am trying to convince my *parents*, so shape your ideas in a way that would appeal to them, and if you are a parent, you insight is definitely welcome.\n\nPlease, help me to follow my dreams, and many many thanks in advance, because this means more to me than you may think.\n\nMany thanks,\nSkjar\n\nP.S. If a Rioter would comment ways playing League helped them along in their career, that would be spectacular.\n\nEDIT: Please upvote so others can help me too :D","replies":[{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2015-03-22T23:41:30.957+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One key matter of importance to consider when looking at any argument such as this is education. What can you learn from playing League of Legends? And there's a surprising amount of good stuff in there!\n\n1. Leadership skills\n2. Teamwork\n3. Organizational skills\n4. Time management skills\n5. Social skills\n6. Strategic and tactical thinking\n7. Problem solving\n\nAnd probably more, but that's all I have off the top of my head.","replies":[{"poster":"wop","date":"2015-03-23T00:52:19.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"wop","date":"2015-03-23T21:45:21.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"xX420n0sc0pzXx","date":"2015-03-23T13:01:15.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just because you dedicate years of your life to something doesn't mean you'll even become decent.","replies":[{"poster":"wop","date":"2015-03-23T14:02:03.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I understand this, but I know that I can be good enough to support myself, I mean, half of the streamers aren't that great.

I doubt your parents would even care about the age rating if you were close to 15.\n\nDont give your birthday date. But you can give an age so people have a starting point. Though if your parents allow you to facebook you should be allowed to play league.

You sad your dad works with sex offenders, then he should understand facebook/ any of those sire types are going to be a bigger issue. \n\nI think your parents are BSing you about their reason. They are giving you a safe answer that on the surface is easy to defend. You need to find out the real answer. To help get past this bring up face book or social sites. Also ask them how many news pieces are about League and safety issues. \n\nThen corner them with the fact if they want to help you grow as a person instead of hiding you they should prepare you for the real world by giving you the tools/knowledge to deal with those situations. Then when you are prepared enough in their eyes again the argument is non vaild. \n\nBut again i think they are bsing you.
