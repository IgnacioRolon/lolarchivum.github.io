Under normal circumstances, I'd be like \"jesus fkn hell\", but in party ip weekend, I will either say nothing, try to help us get back on track, or something like that.\r\n\r\n**Why?**\r\nIg honestly it's because once you form a group for party-ip weekend, you form a bond with them sort of. You guys are playing with eachother, and you all get more ip to by those runes that cost you a fkn foreskin. and while the motivation for being nicer to eachother may be selfish, it still ends up with people being nicer to each other.\r\n\r\n**So, you guys tell me, am I just a shallow person who will be nice to anyone for more ip, or are we ALL shallow people who will be nice to anyone for more ip?**","replies":[]}
