Yes, I know I'm gonna suck major tons of punctual kitten lice to start out with, and wut am I even thinking. But I do plan to practice on bots alot before I do anything drastic, because I do think I could get good at it \n(if I do it until Lvl 30, I'll have more Xp with the controller than with mouse and keyboard anyway)\nSo, for any people who have any insight into this whatsoever, can I please get some help/feedback?\nSuch as keybindings, or technical help\n\nThank you in advance again, here's a couple of boobies: {{champion:92}} {{champion:30}}\n\nEDIT 1: And if you didn't check out the controller, it has 4 extra buttons, or 'paddles' on the back, just for clarification ","replies":[{"poster":"Konanni86","date":"2015-03-25T02:42:32.109+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I gotta ask: why would you want to use a controller over a KB/M?
