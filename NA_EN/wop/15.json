I'm reasonably sure that you wouldn't be that far behind even if you mindlessly ran straight into a lane and tried to gank every time you revived, just because of the minion XP.","replies":[{"poster":"Phife","date":"2015-03-17T20:20:57.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was in a game once where my team didn't leash me so it took so long to do gromp that their ashe W'd over and stole it.\nI am lvl 1 0 exp, i go to do my blue, cause im playing sej, i wont die.... But then their enemy jungler comes over the wall and steals it, still level 1.\n\nI flashed away so i dont die and have no death timer, i go B with a machete and like 100g and buy out 4 pots. Go to my red and the enemy jungler is there, he gets it again. \n\nI am still level 1, i go to my golems, i get lvl 2 i go to wraiths they're gone cause i went to my golems. I go to wolves i am lvl 2 and halfway to lvl 3.

I've discovered a few of things.\n\n1) He doesn't NEED a leash. He's perfectly capable of soloing any of the camps. \n\n2) If someone wants to leash, I will let them, but within seconds I will start spamming the red \"!!!!\" to make sure they leave in time not to steal my xp\n\n3) If someone does steal your XP, it DOES put you behind. I had xp stolen from my blue buff and it put me a good 45 seconds behind \"Schedule.\" \n\n4) I prefer not to have a leash. I'd rather have a person set up by the river watching for an invade. If I can type quickly enough or they understand my pings, I'll tell them to wait and let the invade happen. Then they can come in behind after I smack the invader around a little and they're stuck in a flank.\n\nIf all this happens as it's supposed to, I will 95% of the time secure the first 2 dragon kills. \n\nEDIT: 5) Dragon does NOT win the game. It helps, but it doesn't win. I know this because I usually have the dragon down by 4:00, and the second dragon down before 14:00. This is assuming I didn't have a bad leash.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WukongMain","date":"2015-03-17T20:13:35.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly as a jungler main..\nif my camp got solen xp wise, id recall buy some pots, go do a mini camp like wolves or even do scuttles they dont bite back.\nrepeat this till you're level 3.\nand GANK. you're too behind to afk farm.\nso use your cc to GANK.","replies":[]}]}
