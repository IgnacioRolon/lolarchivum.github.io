I know, some people are like &quot;HE HAS 7ULTS AT LOW MANA&quot; but seriously, it ain&#039;t too great. It is a medium range skill shot with very low damage, especially for an ult. \r\n\r\nTo put it into perspective, his R at rank 2 is the same damage as his Q at rank 3, and his Q is an AoE skillshot. His Q also has better scalings for AP and similar AD scalings. His Q also provides vision, and is arguably way more useful than his Ult in many situations.\r\n\r\nNow, every 3rd shot on his ult does 50% more damage, so this does increase it&#039;s usefulness, but it is still not that great. If his ult had a short knock up (like 1 second max) it would make it more useful, and more like an ultimate should be. \r\nEven if only his enhanced one had a knockup, and th eothers had a short slow or something, it would make it better, and more of an Ultimate ability.\r\n\r\nThank you for listening,\r\n\r\nif you are a Corki player, please upvote so Riot can see!\r\n\r\nHave a good day! {{champion:42}}{{champion:42}}{{champion:42}}{{champion:42}}","replies":[{"poster":"Colgate Gator","date":"2015-04-10T14:15:46.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Posting on a lvl 17 troll bait.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garurumon","date":"2015-04-10T14:13:45.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good troll thread 4.2/0","replies":[]}]}
