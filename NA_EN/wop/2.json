So let's ask for something more realistic.\n\nRefunds can only occurs with RP purchases.  All IP purchases are non-refundable and use the current 3 token rule.\nI really think that Riot would have more sales if they allowed a 50% RP refund to people to test out skins or champs for 1 non-ranked game within 24 hours after purchase.  If you don't use that champ/skin in a non-ranked game within 24 hours after purchase then there are no refunds; however, after the 1 match a pop-up comes up that asks if you want a 50% refund.  Once you say no, then it is yours.  The other kicker is that once you say 'yes' to a refund you can never get a 50% refund on that same champ/skin again.  So it's not like you can just alternate games with the same 2 champ/skins and get a refund.\n\nIn summation:\n\n- refund of RP only\n- allow a one-time 50% refund per champ/skin \n- must request a refund after playing a non-ranked game within 24 hours of purchase\n- can only be used once per champ/skin\n- allowing people a partial refund will create a larger pool of players that spend real money on the game","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2015-04-21T22:53:41.865+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"The \"Hot\" page is based off recent views, not number of upvotes.\n\nAs to the actual topic of the post, this has come up periodically for the longest time, and I guess Rioters have gotten tired of saying the same thing every time it does. https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ This page has their refund policy on it, but not really the reason it's so rigid. The general reason, regardless of company, is that getting a return is undesirable for them (they have to reprocess the payment, and in case of material goods - which don't pertain to Riot's in-game content but still - they have to get the item back into condition to resell, or just toss it), but not being able to return anything ever is undesirable for the consumer. Thus, most, if not all, companies will make a one-time compromise with consumers, then proceed to put their foot down and never change the policy again.\n\nThis isn't really a bad thing, especially when you can preview content, whether that's by community videos or by a store-provided changing room. If Riot had the server space, I'd say to add something akin to a \"changing room\" for those people who can't get a good feel of skins without actually playing them, but at the moment, with all the other work they're currently undergoing with the servers in various regions (especially the plan to move NA to a more central location) that might be an unreasonable request.\n\nI'm not from Riot, so I can't say they definitely won't turn around and hand out some more refund tokens, but this is why I look at it as unlikely to happen.\n\nEDIT: If you sort Boards by \"Best\" instead of \"Hot\", two separate posts asking for additional refund tokens are on the front page right now.","replies":[{"poster":"rampaging poet","date":"2015-04-21T23:16:30.543+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Looking at the refund policy, you can only receive IP or RP for a refund.

Somehow shortly thereafter I discovered that the skin just came out and wasn't on sale (I think there was a forum thread about it where they acknowledged the bug), so I petitioned Riot via support ticket for \"[a refund of] the sale price difference in RP or [for] the transaction to be voided.\" After initially responding with a copy-and-paste response that didn't apply, they offered me a \"one-time exception\" and a refund of up to 3 purchases that occurred within 30 days.
