The difference in damage output at level 18 is completely unnoticeable, especially since Kalista naturally attacks slower than her auto speed if she is using her passive.\n\nAll in all I'd consider it a wash.  No reason to worry about lost attacks from standard build because in any realistic situation you're going to be using your passive so much that it's not important.  It's not worth going for builds that aren't berserker grieves because you don't break 2 attacks per second until level 18, and the grieves give a very important early game power spike.  BotRK is very important as well for the life steal and active.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Delphinium","date":"2015-05-05T15:29:53.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The first build is more likely for vayne if you remove {{item:3085}} .\nSecond build is for kalista.","replies":[{"poster":"wop","date":"2015-05-05T15:48:55.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would you build Infinity Edge though, or would you build Phantom Dancer?","replies":[{"poster":"Delphinium","date":"2015-05-05T15:54:42.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Prefer PD then IE.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-05-05T16:05:33.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally I either go double lifesteal (BT + BotRK) with runaans or I go IE PD without Runaans.

Maybe 1.8?\n\nWell my math my very well be wrong but...\n\nBase attack speed on Kali is 0.658. Level 18 she gets 56.1% free from scaling. Runaans adds 70% and BotRK adds 40% and 3 attack speed quints add 13.5%\n\nSo it would be 0.658 * (1+(1.796)) = 1.84 attacks per second rounded up\n\nWith Berserker Greaves added in your attacks per second would be: \n0.658 * (1 + (2.046)) = 2.00 attacks per second rounded down\n\nSo it's a really fine line.  Why not just build Berserker Grieves and take AD Quints?  Or drop a single attack speed Quint for AD even?  That would put you below 2 without having to change the build at all.  \n\nObviously there's a sacrifice either way.  Berserker Grieves give a really nice early spike in power when you have Bloodthirster because of their attack speed, you'd miss that if you went swiftness or merc treads.  The attack speed quints have more value in the mid-late game than the AD quints, though it couldn't really hurt too much in lane phase.  Hard for me to say. I'll leave it to smarter people.","replies":[{"poster":"Scented CandIe","date":"2015-05-07T04:58:55.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm nowhere near as theory-crafty as others, but from personal experience I feel the early AS from the quints allows you more freedom early game to grab some damage, either from an early vamp or a second Doran's.

With those quints and graves you can build straight into bloodthirster instead of BotRK which gives you a lot stronger and safer early game.\n\nI rarely build second dorans though, generally would go longsword + potions before I did that since I'm building a vamp scepter anyways.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AwesomeChad","date":"2015-05-05T20:20:34.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So in this case, only the 1st build is effective. You made an error in the second build building {{item:3085}}  and {{item:3031}}  together when you don't have any other crit chance items. Keep in mind that {{item:3031}}  only gives 20% crit chance. That means that your build is very ineffective for building such an expensive item only to get few crits off if you're lucky.\n\nSo here are 2 builds i highly recommend as a diamond kallista main:\n\nBuild #1:  {{item:3072}}{{item:3006}}  {{item:3085}} {{item:3035}} {{item:3153}} \nSo with this build, you get the highest snowball potential off because you're obviously stacking mutiple rends in teamfights and this build focuses on maximizing your sustain and dmg per autoattack (meaning the dmg you deal from your autoattack + hurricane bolts). Note: you swap {{item:3072}} with {{item:3153}} if you feel like you need more early game \"self-peel\". This is the more standard kallista build.\n\nBuild #2 {{item:3072}}{{item:3006}} ( {{item:3046}}  OR  {{item:3087}} ) {{item:3031}}  {{item:3035}} \nNow this build improves the functionality of infinity edge because you're building an attack speed item that gives extra **crit chance**.  Sure, your autoattacks are only single target dmg now but your single target dmg is heavily increased with the 250% crit strike dmg mutiplier.  Again, you may swap out bloodthirster for botrk if you feel like you need self-peel or are expecting alot of late game hp tanks.\n\nIn the end, I prefer the first build because it provides a very big power spike when kallista gets hurricane. I'd recommend this build if you're snowballing   since this build can easily fall off in terms of dmg. The 2nd build is much more expensive however it secures your dps and provides better late game scaling because of the crits.","replies":[{"poster":"wop","date":"2015-05-05T20:24:39.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks :D I understand now the IE isn't great on Kalista, ty for explaining\nDid you check the link?

Heres why:  Hurricane does the job of applying 3 rend procs to 3 enemies in a teamfight with every autoattack. Once kallista's attack speed reaches a certain point, her attack animation is going to be much faster than her leaping animation. Taking that into account, its impossible to utilize all of kallista's attack speed if you're going to leap around with every autoattack.\n\nSure, riot will need to fix it in the future but for right now, hurricane still serves its purpose on kallista.
