Teach me a way to do that.\r\n\r\nAssuming it will involve {{item:3087}} {{item:3031}} ,\r\nis there any 4 items that would get this to 2.5 As and 100% critical chance?\r\n\r\nor of course any combinations not including them would be cool too.","replies":[{"poster":"ImTheOneWhoCrocs","date":"2015-03-14T14:44:51.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IE and Statikk already give you 80% crit chance, add crit chance quints and AS marks, run 21/9 masteries (with the AS bonus on crit one), build GA for little tankiness, then Botrk for sustain. Only way to obtain that AS without sacrificing MS and AD is adding 2 zephyrs. You will have 2.496 AS which is like having 2.5. \nI do not find this build viable for late game, but if you are relly ahead in midgame, with this build there should be no endgame.","replies":[{"poster":"wop","date":"2015-03-14T23:28:24.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty for your input :D\n\nI actually found a [useful site for builds and stat calculations](http://www.teryd.net/)\n\nI figured one out with  \nBerserker Greaves, Phantom Dancer, Statikk Shiv, BoRK, Infinity Edge and Zephyr\n\nwith all Attack Speed Quints and Marks, \n\nand 21/9 Mastery set up.\n\nIt's got 2.5 Attack Speed and 100% Crit Chance, as well as 260 AD (without crits) 225% crit damage With an Auto Attack DPS of 1530\n\n[Here is that build](http://www.teryd.net/?app=buildcreator&b=Yasuo&l=18&i=184,177,191,68,190,55&r=5247,5247,5247,5247,5247,5247,5247,5247,5247,5316,5316,5316,5316,5316,5316,5316,5316,5316,5289,5289,5289,5289,5289,5289,5289,5289,5289,5337,5337,5337&m=4111;1,4112;4,4122;3,4132;1,4134;3,4142;3,4144;1,4151;1,4152;3,4162;1,4211;2,4212;2,4221;1,4222;3,4232;1&s=6,4&t=0&) please check it and see how you like it :D","replies":[]}]}]}
