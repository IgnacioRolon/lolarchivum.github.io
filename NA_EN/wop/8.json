I don't get why there are diminishing returns, since 1.5k MS is only about 4-5 times more than other peoples base movespeed, and it only lasts for like 3 secs. So Riot, what is the reason?","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-03-25T22:06:56.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> diminishing returns make the build so much less effective\n\nPrecisely. If there is 1 \"all superior\" stat, it would make sense to only buy that stat, right? Well that is boring as fuck, and can only detract from the game. Caps and diminishing returns prevent stacking something to be OP so they don't have to make flat nerfs across the board to it.","replies":[{"poster":"ELABYED25","date":"2015-06-26T21:14:08.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Valkyrie Witch,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=coRcb2Ei,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-25T22:06:56.874+0000)\n>\n> Precisely.
