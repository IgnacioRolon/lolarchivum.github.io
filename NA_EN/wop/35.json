Not even dropping below 50% when she was free to play in normals which is usually a time win rates drop a good amount and in ranked in basicly all the ranked elos she consistently has over a 50% winrate. Lolking counts the winrate of all lanes though. Also, your looking at plat+ which Is a very small percentage of the game's population so I don't think your statics are 100% accurate to the current situation. 10.55 percent of the entire ranked population exist in Plat or higher to be exact.\n\nEdit: Added more detail.

Saying \"they *could* be building AP\" is the same as saying that LeBlanc *could* be building AD. She isn't, and neither are these tanks. \n\nThose builds are directly from champion.gg, either the most popular build or the highest win rate build, depending on which one gives more AP. They're more representative of what those champions are actually building than claiming some of them are building Runeglaive.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-12-04T23:18:48.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"take those builds with a grain of salt because they recommend things like double banshees veil amumu. Saying they _could_ be building tank is the same as saying they _could_ be building AP. Builds are a choice. As is how much AP constitutes an AP champ. You are employing either the no true scottsman fallacy or moving the goalposts here depending on how you try to argue your next point. \n\nHint: that winrate probably means someone did it once for lols when they were really ahead and won while no one else has built that because duh.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-12-05T01:18:09.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually, it says how many people ran the build (the builds are out of all the games that got to 6 completed items).

Champions who's primary build path isn't tank, but actual AP mage.
