Hoping to see some improvements in that department)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Beoridas","date":"2015-08-22T21:14:49.347+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"why everytime i check these kind of threads--i feel compelled to check the elo of the OP and its silver 5 and under?\n\ni mean is he winning for a 20 dmg increase? minus mitigation?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-08-22T21:01:47.511+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lmao someone struggling against Darius.
