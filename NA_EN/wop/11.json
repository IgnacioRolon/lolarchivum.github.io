My problem is that my laptop charges only if the charger is in a certain position. This has caused me to be Leaverbustered 2-3 times now, because my laptop will die during a lengthy game if it is not charging. Do any of you have any way that I can try? Some say it may be a problem with the connection to my motherboard or something like that, while other say it may just be the power cord itself.\r\nComputer: Gateway NV 5302u\r\nIDK what other specs to give, tell me what you need if you are willing to help me play this game!!","replies":[{"poster":"azrolator","date":"2015-04-14T04:17:32.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edit: You could also just go buy a new charging cord if you aren't feeling all that frugal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"azrolator","date":"2015-04-14T04:16:30.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this problem I thought my thing was bad where it went into the laptop so replaced it and turned out it was the charging cord. If you have a cord to anything, like speakers, chargers, etc. then you might very well have a wire inside that has torn. There are a lot of cheaply made cords and even decent ones can get damaged. I think when it needs to be in a certain spot, it is because the wires have become broke apart and only touch when you move the cord in certain positions.\n\nWhat I do is use a knife to cut open the cord near the end where it plugs in the laptop. Carefully so I don't cut anything yet. We are looking for wires that have bent and are now broke or tiny bunches of wires that have torn. Sometimes you can even feel it if you tug on the cord near where it plugs in and it can feel like it is giving a little bit. Then I twist the damage wires back together, might have to cut some of the stuff covering the wire to give yourself some room to work, and tape them up with electrical tape. Make sure that is is all wrapped up well so it will stay together and also taped up enough so that you aren't going to have bare wires come out and electrify yourself. I just did it myself a couple weeks ago on my laptop cord, have done it on many other cords and wires since I buy cheap crap on ebay.
