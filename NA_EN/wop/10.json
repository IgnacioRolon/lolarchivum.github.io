I'd personally love to add it and I get excited at the idea - but ultimately it has a very real risk of causing more harm than good. As a player, if I were to post something that I'm expecting feedback on and see that the thread has been seen I'll end up feeling even more ignored (and that's dangerous).\n\nAs stated here, sometimes Rioters will browse topics that aren't relevant to their specialization and so they can't realistically comment on every post. I really don't want to cause, say, the art team extra headache simply because I wanted to view what people are talking about :(","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-03-26T01:33:57.760+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"and this is why I like my \"fist bump\" special upvote idea.\n\nRioters would now be able to vote normally, or press the \"fist bump\" icon to let players know that not only has the post been read, but the rioter in question really liked/agrees/supports the subject matter of said post.\n\nThe opt in nature would help to alleviate some of the feelings of being \"passed over\" by giving the player a cool fist bump logo/border that shows support while indicating that a rioter has been reading in the general vicinity.
