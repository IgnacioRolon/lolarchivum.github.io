All you need to do is wait for them to blow hard CC spells first and then dive in and stunlock everyone. If you're engaging in a scenario where you'll be stunned for a long time then just soak everything up with W basically and carry on, your ADC should be autoattacking the entire time anyway","replies":[{"poster":"Aeolian Melodies","date":"2015-10-24T17:33:33.414+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leona is quite simple at her core; if you are struggling with her, likely it is because you are struggling to see what's a good time to engage and what's a bad time to engage, as it is probably the hardest part about playing an all-in tank support.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=IronSolariLeona,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=pQV04tkR,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-10-24T10:29:34.271+0000)\n>\n> -HP scales very well with her.\n> -She's an all-in champ so only go in when youre sure you can trade well.\n> -Late game her job is to catch people out with her R>E>Q or CC as many people as possible in a teamfight (preferably an enemy tank in your backline or the enemy carry)\n> -MAKE SURE TO HIT HER W \n> \n> Janna, morg, thresh, and lulu cant really stop her when she's ready to blow everything on the ADC.

Learn to recognize opportunities to get a pick (not bait) and try to roam when you can too.  leona is really strong when she has an extended laning phase because her roams are so powerful.  In teamfights you can engage very well with Leona but unless no one else can engage for your team it is more often better to save your CDs to peel for your carries when it gets to the teamfight phase of the game.  This is because her CC pulls her in and if your team isn't spot on with timing (they get little over 3 seconds to react properly on picks) they can easily miss their chance to capitalize on your play ending up with you way out of position and probably dead.  If you are talking with them via skype or teamspeak...go crazy!  Otherwise I would recommend playing safe and peeling unless you're sure that R is going to end up with a dead enemy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GwingMaster","date":"2015-10-24T15:16:28.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love Leona so much. My favorite champ from the day I first tried her on a free week two years ago. I don't play ranked so I can't offer much in the way of high-end strategy but I can offer a few tips:\n\n-- Roam and Ward. Leona's a great champ to go roaming to the mid lane for a surprise gank. If your adc is backing and you have the ability, try coming in behind the enemy mid laner and lock that dude down. It'll surprise the hell outta the enemy and Leona is an awesome ganker with all her cc. You don't have to stay in bot lane! You should also try to ward enemy jungle where possible. If you and your jungler can catch an enemy jungler alone in the jungle, they're dead. Leona is a pick champ as well as an engage champ - anywhere you can get your team kills, that's where you should be.\n\n-- BE THE BOSS. So many Leona's play way too safe in lane. You're tanky as hell and should scare the bejeezus out of the enemy ADC. Unless you're directly countered in lane, you should be aiming to zone aggressively and attack.\n\n--Take Q first. A lot of Leona's amazingly take W within the first two levels. Don't do this. You're E-Q combo at level 2 is really really strong in most matchups. E is useless in most contexts at level 1, so take Q at level 1 and E at level 2. Make sure your adc understands that you want to hit level 2 and go in so you're not yoloing by yourself.\n\n-- Zone with W off cooldown. Especially if you get an early kill. If you manage to get kills off your first major engage you should absolutely wreck lane and draw jungle pressure. Leona is snowbally - once you get an advantage, push it hard because it's gonna be really rough for the opponent to kill you off.\n\n-- Passive Weaving. Way too many Leona's ignore the damage on their passive and end up losing fights by tight margins as a result. Time your abilities carefully to allow your ADC to proc the Sunlight marks as much as possible. Don't just mash your face on the keyboard all at once. Trust me, your enemy isn't going anywhere.\n\n\nBuild suggestions:\nSince Leona is a champ that's going into enemies a lot, you want stuff that allows you to survive large bursts of damage, engage fights, and disrupt the enemy.\n\n{{item:3401}} Face of the Mountain (obviously)\n\n{{item:3800}} Righteous Glory - it gives you mana, tankiness, and engage ability. It's basically a perfect item for you and should probably be built almost every match.\n\n{{item:3190}} Locket of the Iron Solari - Some people prefer Banner of Command, but Locket suits Leona's all-in style a lot better. The active allows you to survive the front-end burst in teamfights.\n\n{{item:3143}} Randuin's Omen - Really really awesome item on her because the active will be super effective assuming you're right in the thick of things.\n\n{{item:3068}} Sunfire Cape - Free damage! I only build this when I'm definitely ahead in the game, but if you have the gold to spare it's pretty awesome.\n\n{{item:3075}} Thornmail - Leona's usually have a lot of armor, so this item is cost effective.\n\n{{item:3001}}  and {{item:3102}} are both reasonable magic resist items\n\n{{item:3116}} Rylai's Crystal Scepter - This is hilarious if you've got the gold. It's actually not all that bad on you but it's really best when you're far ahead. The amount of cc you get form this is ridiculous.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brockinroll","date":"2015-10-24T07:22:17.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play a lot of leona, she is a strong support and is good at creating a kill lane.
