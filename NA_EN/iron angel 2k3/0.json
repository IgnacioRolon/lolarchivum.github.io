A REAL rework and VU. This skin proves he can be awesome looking, but his kit is horribly dated and is one of those kits that if you make it strong its going to break the game, and if its not strong he's useless.\n\n@KateyKhaos I know you're on GD right now!\n\nIs there any hints or timeline for Morde? He probably needs it more than almost anyone (Taric and Poppy being the only people that need one just as badly than I can think of).","replies":[]}
