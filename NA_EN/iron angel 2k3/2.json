It died about the same time the forums did the move. What we have left now is a kitbash of furaffinity and /a/. This is not a \"culture\", especially when all you people do is fight the moderation staff and deliberately bait them, then cry and whine when they finally ban you. Is the moderation staff inconsistent and touchy? Sure. But the fact of the matter is, if you don't break the rules, chances are you'll never have to deal with it. There are a few cases of bizarre punishment but those are few and far between.\r\n\r\nBut you people can't do that. You can't just read the rules and follow them. You have to keep on pushing Riot and breaking the rules, then when you get punished for it you lash out. You're a bunch of children who run through the grocery aisle knocking everything off the shelf, then when Riot puts you in the cart you shriek at the top of your lungs.\r\n\r\nSo I don't know what you expected. Did you think Riot was going to just roll over for you? Change all their company policies, change their rules, change everything, because you just refused to do what they said? No, anyone with any common sense would have told you (some did) that they would just pull the plug. Best part is they already did it once. I guess you just thought they wouldn't do it a second time because reasons?\r\n\r\nWe couldn't go one day. ONE DAY. Without having a Tahm vore thread posted. Really? And you wonder why Riot sees no value in this place. There is nothing left here of value for them. None of the threads that actually entertained them are left. Theres no more information. All they see when they come here is infighting, circlejerk wars, fetish porn, and all of you wallowing in the shit you've excreted all over the forum.\r\n\r\nA year ago I'd have lit my torch and gotten my pitchfork right along with the rest of the community. But not now. There is nothing here worth saving. Thats why Riot isn't trying to save it, and are just deleting it. And frankly, after seeing the type of content that gets recycled and the types of people on here, I agree with them. Go back to furaffinity and /a/ with your shit, I don't even know why you're here.\r\n\r\nDid Riot fuck up GD when they did the move? Maybe. But GD was already in a downward spiral before they did. That was just a nail in the coffin. But now GD is a garbage bin, whats done is done, and now the trash needs taken out.","replies":[]}
