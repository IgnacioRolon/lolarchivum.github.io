I'm a Silver 2 player who's looking to get to gold or higher. But for some reason, I always get very scared to queue up. I don't want to play ranked with friends because I'm not a boosted animal, but I'll play it sometimes with them. Even if it's with friends, I always get so scared and anxious when I queue up. Maybe it's because unlike Normals, there's something on the line and if I lose, it's a bigger consequence. Sometimes I get freaked out if people start to flame me and feel like I'm not good enough to climb.\r\nAnyone have any recommendations about dealing with this fear of ranked queue and and prevent myself from tilting?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T04:22:21.638+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Competitive play is prone to causing these types of emotions. When I play ranked in League or competitive in CS:GO, my palms get pretty sweaty (mom's spaghetti) and I sometimes feel like my heart rate may be reaching dangerous levels, but it's really just nerves. Some methods for calming these nerves that work for me are listening to music that puts me in *the zone* or having some of my favourite snacks close by so I can snack away during teleports back to base.\n\nI hope one of those work for you, please let me know if you have any questions.\n\nP.S.

My teams are so abusively bad it's not even fun. Whether it's a 0/10 morg or a 5/20 yasou screaming about how I should go all in with them or what. Lower ranks are cancer and honestly RIOT does a VERY POOR job ad educating lower ranked individuals about how to play at any sort of decent level.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2016-10-12T02:12:17.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm I am not sure but really normal draft is basically the same as ranked... just without the whole LP and rank thing at the end game screen\nSo there isn't really any need to care so much about it after all in game is the same and not like rank actually matter all that much?

Currently this is close to two games a week because of Uni and Stardew Valley updating. Mostly though if you just play one or two ranked games and know that you're not going to overdo it it's not too bad losing one game isn't that daunting, especially if you've won recently.","replies":[]}]}
