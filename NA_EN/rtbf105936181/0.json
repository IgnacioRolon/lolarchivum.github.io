In this game I didnt respond to my teammates perma flaming eachother untill 18 minutes. My botlane was perma flaming our Evelynn jungle, and suddlenly they went on me because I tried to farm for lategame instead of joining teamfights as 1/7 tryndamere(mind you that this is a normal game at lvl 16). \r\n\r\nI honestly dont understand how anything that i said could be considered antagonizing, and also, all 5 people in this game got banned (I got IFS about their bans immedieatly at client). I wish riot could present chat logs for the whole game aswell, for contexts sake. \r\n\r\nAs I said before, the first comment &quot;can you stop argue and play ty&quot;, was 18 MINUTES into game after constant arguing between our botlane who was losing and getting camped, and our jungler who refused to help them. \r\n\r\nThe one im responding to is my midlane who flamed me when my nasus killed her and i didnt tp fast enough. Also mind you, this is 1 out of 40 games. Thats 0.2% of games i&#039;ve been reported for.\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: can you stop argue and play ty\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: ?\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: Why should i?\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: idk i dont see you roaming top to help me so why should i tp\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: &quot;bronze&quot; this is low lvl blind pick im playing to have fun not to tryhard\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: u werent even im my team i didnt speak a single world last game xD\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: I said one thing in client and u responded\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: like literally i have said nothing all game untill now either\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: and u have went full on ad hominum on me\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: im farming for late\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: and honestly you first ganked top at 17 minutes when im against a nasus so..\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: anyways tired of this flamer team so muting all have fun\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: no idea why ur flaming me eve\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: watch gold after game and wait 10 minutes and u will see why im farming\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: we&#039;ll see\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: still no reason to flame like botlane does\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: bg wp\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: report me for what?\r\n13137kAtaX0XoZeD: trying to farm after getting camped by kha?","replies":[{"poster":"WukongMain","date":"2018-05-16T07:34:40.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"all these are these bans justified posts are all the same\nposts the chat log from 1 game and expects us to defend it.\n\nYou didn't get banned because of that game. You got banned because of a pattern of bad behavior. This just happened to be the game that tossed you over the mountain, It's all the other games that made you climb the mountain to begin with.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf105936181","date":"2018-05-16T07:38:54.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then why is that the only game that is listen when i log in? Normally people have 2-3 chat logs to post, mine only have one. So quite obviously this is the only game ive been reported on. If a riot employee sees this thread please varify this\n\nEdit: mine only have 1 chat log listen on the IFS when i log in on my account*","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-05-16T08:13:17.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It shows 1-3 recent games that contributed to you being punished. If you took a short break before playing or the last few games you didn't glame or get reported then it will only show 1 game even if there were more. This is because a lot of people don't remember games from that long ago.\n\nAlso, basic math error in your opening post. 1 out of 40 is 2.5%. Not saying that the argument holds any water, since any negativity or toxicity is bad for the game, but I just wanted to throw that out there.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sir Prepuzius","date":"2018-05-16T08:19:34.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can't see how this is worth a punishment honestly\nunless\n- you argued when in reality nobody was flaming you (??)\n- it was only the tip of the iceberg\n\nstill, seems harsh to me","replies":[]}]}
