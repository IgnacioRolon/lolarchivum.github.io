The current patch is 7.1 and i have downloaded and installed it. I want to backup the current LOL folder with the current 7.1 patch in USB Drive. Assume that after I format my computer I copied the backup LOL folder back to my PC and the live patch is 7.3 (that means i skipped patch 7.2). Now if i need the game to run again on my PC do I need to download both patches 7.2 and 7.3 or just the latest patch 7.3??\r\n\r\nThanks In Advance :-)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-18T19:09:15.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The patcher still needs to scan your game files and check for updates when you launch League, so saving a patch to a usb might not work well.  It's likely that transferring the folder back can cause the patcher to scan your game for corruption which can cause a bit of a delay.  Your best bet would be to let the patcher do the dirty work, which will get you to the current patch regardless of what version you're on.    I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
