I used to play in many competitive league related events and even had the chance to go up against TSM&#039;s roster back in early season 2. In season 3 I retired and have been coaching off and on depending how busy I am running my business in real life. I have about a week off and am looking on to take on 1-2 students. If i am impressed with the progress of the student I would be happy to keep the student longer than 1 week. I am happy to coach on roles other than ADC and support but do keep in mind, It would be a learning process for me as well. My season rankings for those who are interested are Season I - 1920  Season II - 2340 Season III - Diamond 2 Season IV - Diamond 1 Season V - Diamond 3\n\n**Please answer this questionnaire and i will add you in game if you qualify.**\nName - \nRole(s) - \nReason you are seeking coaching - \nWhat would you like to improve on - \nAge - \nWhat would you expect out of a coach - \nTime Zone - (You can just put your country or state if you do not know your time zone)\nSchedule - (Are you willing to follow a set schedule for coaching)\nQuestions for me -","replies":[{"poster":"Best Jrod NA","date":"2016-09-15T05:04:50.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name - Best Jrod NA\nRole(s) - ADC\nReason you are seeking coaching - League has been the one game I haven't been able to become good at easily it's what keeps me playing and frustrates me at the same time lol\nWhat would you like to improve on - I'd like to improve my landing and knowledge of the macro side of the game. \nAge - 25\nWhat would you expect out of a coach - someone who pushes me to be better not like man you play better than your elo I want a coach to be like that's not how a diamond player would play it do better.\n\nTime Zone - (You can just put your country or state if you do not know your time zone).
