Let me elaborate. \r\n\r\nLast game i had a singed who traded 1v1 with Irelia first kills, then she killed him again, and he went afk for the next 15 minutes, now i was playing kassadin surviving in lane with swain farming where i could, botlane going even and so on. But since this guy left we lost the game immediately and we tried to hold on but it was futile.
