We on social media and the tech team offer our condolences on that stolen TV =(.\n\nThat might be happening if the in-game resolution isn't matching what the tv is set to. Let's do a quick config reset and that should hopefully help out, but hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if this doesn't seem to help at all.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
