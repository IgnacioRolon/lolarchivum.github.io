Never been punished by the league system, did not abandon games been playing since season 1. To make things more interesting, I can't even create a discussion or reply to threads with my main account. (But it works fine with my smurf account.) :(  Last time I logged in was only 2 weeks ago, please. I am really frustrated and do not want to start another main account again.\r\n\r\nMy router is properly port forwarded, DNS is set correctly, no anti-virus blocking it, same with no firewall blocking either. (Otherwise my smurf account would have the same issue)\r\n\r\nPlease help an old veteran. I have never had this issue and it will most likely make me quit the game if I can not log into my main account.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-18T05:39:28.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What error are you seeing with the login?
