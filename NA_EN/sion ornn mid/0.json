(thats what im reading here ^)\r\n\r\nSecond question, why don't we have a complete list of which champs can perform which roles, and with which builds?

He was reported in a minimum of 57 games within a single month (likely many more) for doing something that when shown to be a repeated pattern of intentional behavior is absolutely deserving of a permaban in my opinion.\n\nI totally get that it's a lot easier to use automation to detect chat that breaks the rules, but the differences in what you can get away with action wise vs word wise are mind blowing and completely unacceptable. The fact that it took this long for him to be temporarily banned for this should be a huge embarrassment for Riot and a clear sign of a broken system in dire need of fixing. At the absolute minimum it shouldn't be that hard for an automated system to at least flag certain games with reports for manual review based on someone saying certain phrases that are pretty indicative of someone flagrantly admitting to trolling in the chat. Trolls bragging that they're trolling in chat (and believe they'll never be punished for it) is not that unusual.\n\nBanning people who aren't actually breaking the rules is absolutely horrific. The cleverest of trolls will likely always be insanely hard to catch, especially with anything automated. I am not asking for the impossible. Random people in this thread figured out what he was up to just by looking at what little they get to see in a few games of his match history... Riot can clearly do _much_ better than it is. Cases like this make it look like Riot is barely even trying. I don't know what the problem is, but I'm gonna be nice and assume it's not a lack of effort on your part.

Going by your argument of 'it depends on when you get the CS,' when 40 minutes has passed approximately 382 minions has walked down a lane, and if you spend the laning phase being an actual support, it's literally impossible to get 303 CS at 40 min without having taken it from 1-2 players on your team from the beginning of the game.\n\nIn his second game as AD Xerath, he has 270 CS at 36 minutes. His mid laner has 50 CS and OP spent almost all of his time on mid lane. As an AD Xerath, you don't have the wave clear or mana to sustain yourself for long, so he has had to last hit with basic attacks.\nEven if he started to farm post-laning phase, he wouldn't be able to reach 270 CS at 36 minutes, especially not with a non-scaling kit.\n\nSame with the Malzahar game, 205 CS at 28 min means only 260 minions would hav walked down a lane, and even though Malzahar is a great farmer, it means he has been CS'ing as a support right from the beginning, in his mid laners' lane and possibly in his ADC' lane as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2018-04-04T09:25:44.425+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":16,"body":"It's not that simple, you don't just stay in one lane all game.\n\nI have noticed that my CS score has a huge spike if the game goes late, because I'm usually the one keeping the lanes pushed out hopping around the map.","replies":[{"poster":"kargish","date":"2018-04-04T09:43:31.292+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't listen to what I said","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MuffledGarbage","date":"2018-04-04T17:33:54.059+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Upvote if you're waiting for Tantram to come in and {{summoner:11}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2018-04-04T01:31:51.442+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"ima call bs on the games you linked because the malz and janna ones seem off while you have a 0/5/2 malz and a 1/11 xerath game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kanzler","date":"2018-04-04T13:44:36.208+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Should have been a perma.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-04-04T01:28:11.808+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":4,"body":"At a glance I think it's a ban worth reversing.\n\nUpvoting for visibility.

Maybe back in season 1 you could do that but since then the game has developed and both the players and RIOT has made it so that the most effective and best to win a game of LoL is to play the current meta(including roles). What do you do in ranked? try your best(at least in my opinion you should) to win the game, and obviously you want to play using the most optimal and highest success rate methods aka the META.\n\n> We see this kind of gameplay in One for All.

YOu start on Lvl.3 now and you get gold, exp and items much faster. You don't  really have to farm, ward, lane or do any other fundamental things to ensure a win, You could 5 man mind from min 1 and it would not be a big deal. That is the point of these RGMs. Its like an off day at your work or school where everyone has a fun time while ranked can be considered a normal work day where you have actual duties and responsibilities.\n\n> This is where things get dicey.

Everyone likes to spend time with someone that knows how to party and have a fun time but no one wants to work with someone that is always avoiding responsibilities and doesn't really work in the office.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
