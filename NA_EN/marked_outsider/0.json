IT! IS! NOT! ME! This does not happen on ANY other games at all. Every single game I get packet loss, not fps lag, not ping lag, packet loss, I can move my character, spells half the time don't even show then just randomly appear or i'll not see them at all then just randomly take the damage! there's a delay on almost everything I do and its getting to a point where I don't even want to play anymore. I've re installed the game, even changed internets I'm on. When selecting a champion in the champ select screen It takes literally four seconds for it to go through after I click it, same with summoner spells. Someone please help me. {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Marked Outsider","date":"2017-03-13T03:59:56.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://youtu.be/dcOHMi-j2WY Brief description of what I experience every 2-10 seconds every game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2017-03-12T22:45:54.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there!\n\nI see a lot of people talking about experiencing packet loss in LoL. I myself have experienced it time to time, and I do agree that over the past few months it has gotten worse. I do however insist that you please do a quick run at http://www.pingtest.net/ and post your result. League is a finicky game, and it uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for a lot of features to send and receive packets. UDP, unlike TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is generally unreliable and makes no guarantee whatsoever that the packet will be delivered, while TCP will deliver all packets in order, unless the client disconnects. UDP does not reliably check for disconnects, so instead you rely on a \"timeout check\", if any. Once the server or client doesn't hear from the other for a certain amount of time, it assumes that you have disconnected and tries to re-establish a connection with the opposite side.\n\nNow, as you probably deduced from what you read above, UDP has a tendency to drop packets when traffic is extremely high. Sending hundreds of packets per second (pps) with UDP is generally not the best idea if you want to deliver all those packets, but in a lot of cases, losing a few doesn't matter. Now, the problem with LoL, is that we're seeing significant packet loss during games. Things like movement packets and attack packets being dropped, and update packets for minion/monster health are being dropped, leaving confusing scenarios. This is not only frustrating, but is becoming increasingly more apparent to users. With the way LoL works, losing a small amount of packets will not cause any immediate problem with the gameplay, or force you to disconnect. This is one of the advantages of using UDP over TCP. TCP would disconnect the user in the same scenario, as it requires that packets be delivered and acknowledged before moving onto the next one. So, for larger games, using UDP for the higher-traffic systems is preferred. This does make them more prone to packet loss, but in small instances it will not affect your gameplay.\n\nLoL staff has noted this as a problem with their upstream provider, which isn't at all unlikely. A problem between the server and you with UDP packets could mean loss of a large percentage of the packets without any notice to either side, which is something they have to address (and probably are addressing.) This becomes apparently only to you when you see things going wrong in the game, while the server just assumes that you didn't send the packet. The most you can do is ensure that your connection is optimal for playing LoL.\n\nNow, that's where the link I gave you above comes in handy. That test will give you three very important factors about your connection quality:\n\nLatency: The time it takes for a packet to be sent and a response to be retrieved. An optimal latency for LoL is between 30 and 125 ms (milliseconds). Anything higher than that will introduce noticeable lag and possibly packet loss caused by your system getting clots of packets at once and discarding some to avoid blocking.\n\nPacket loss: Inherently caused by high latency, but also caused by upstream/downstream issues with your ISP, as well as faulty hardware, wiring, and drivers. You want a 0% packet loss. Any loss, no matter how small, is a huge problem with your network setup.\n\nJitter: Jitter is the inconsistency between the travel times (latency) of each packet. Generally, it should take approximately the same time (give or take a few milliseconds) for each packet to travel out and for a response to come back in. If your jitter is higher than around 15 to 25 ms, you will see problems when playing the game. You can play with a jitter value as high as 100 ms, but you will see slight issues. Jitter is another indicator of problems with your network setup, and, again, is caused by anything from your ISP to your hardware, wiring, and drivers.\n\nAnother important point is that a wired connection is significantly better than a wireless connection for gaming in many cases. You will usually see much better results from a wired connection than you will on wireless, assuming your wiring is good (or your wire is good quality, if you bought one.) It is also important to note that with wired internet, the shorter the wire, the better the quality of the connection. Wireless behaves similarly. The closer you are to the access point, and the less obstructions there are between you and the access point, the better your connection quality will be. Often, your device will show a meter with your wireless signal strength. This is usually a graphical representation of the power of the signal from the access point, but does not accurately depict the actual quality of the connection. A strong connection does not imply a good one, and that is one of the downfalls of wireless networking. Something as simple as the wireless channel you're using can significantly impact the quality of the connection. On that note, it is important to remember that there are only three major wireless channels: 1, 6, and 11. Every channel in-between those overlaps on the two on either side of it. For example, channel 3 overlaps 1 and 6, and channel 8 overlaps 6 and 11. Thus, any channel other than 1, 6, and 11 can decrease your performance by adding much more interference between you and the access point.\n\nOther than your preference of method of connection (wired vs. wireless), the major things that you can do to improve your connection are to update your drivers, check your wiring/wireless access point position, check your configuration, and make sure your modem and/or router is performing as it should.\n\nTo check your wired internet, assure that all cables are plugged in tightly, and that you're not using long cables when they are not needed. If your modem and router are two feet apart, do not use a 15-foot cable to connect the two. You're adding latency where it is not needed. Aside from that, ensure that your modem and router are configured properly. Look up a guide for your specific modem/router model online, or ask someone technologically inclined to check for you. If you have someone who can, check that the firmware is up to date for the modem/router.\n\nFor wireless, ensure that you are on the least-populated channel in your neighborhood out of the three major channels. Use WPA2 instead of WEP whenever you can, since this will prevent people from both attempting to hack into your network (WEP is severely vulnerable) as well as using a more efficient means of encrypting your traffic.\n\nFor your own devices, ensure that they are configured properly. Make sure your operating system is configured appropriately and that your firewall is correctly configured so that it doesn't interfere with LoL during your playtime. Make sure to correctly forward ports, and close all other programs when playing LoL. Anything from a download in the background to something like a video/audio stream or chat can use a large chunk of your network bandwidth, or even use all of it. Many people who listen to internet radio do not have an internet plan capable of doing that and playing LoL, and therefor experience lag in their games.\n\nI've seen many cases of people blaming bad connection quality on Riot, and I've done remote assistance for around 20 people to check their setups. Less than 5 of those cases ended up not being something that was on their end. The majority of the cases were problems with the setup in the home (wiring and router/modems were the major problem, but hardware/drivers were a few cases.) while a select few were problems with the ISP that a single phone call resolved. Please, do a test using the site I linked, and use this information to decide whether or not this is something that you can fix yourself, before you jump to conclusions about what's happening.\n\nHopefully this is helpful. Feel free to ask questions and I will try and assist you.","replies":[{"poster":"Marked Outsider","date":"2017-03-13T02:44:03.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrazFight,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=PKBRYp8N,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-12T22:45:54.582+0000)\n>\n> Hi there!\n> \n> I see a lot of people talking about experiencing packet loss in LoL.
