Is this a problem with my pc or the client? (I always use low graphics and tend to do nothing else but LoL while playing)\r\n\r\n--How exactly does the new client make things easier to create? (e.g. new features)\r\n\r\n--The client seems to be slower than the legacy client when it comes to loading things. Is there a plan to fix the loading times?\r\n\r\n--Are there plans to put spectating back into the client??\r\n\r\n--When you get kicked off the internet or something happens that causes the new client to close, it takes almost twice to three times longer to get back into the game. Are there plans to fix that so it&#039;s like the legacy client where we can jump back in?\r\n\r\nThank you!! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-09-12T15:54:21.488+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"- The new client doesn't have an impact on the development of new maps and game modes.

I like to have knowledge of how things are developed and how we as a community can help :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zurkrem","date":"2016-09-12T14:18:09.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also not a Rito employee, but I too have an answer for you:\nThe new client will have all the features of the current client (spectating etc.).\n\nEdit: I think you meant \"Inquiries\" and not \"Inquisitions\"","replies":[{"poster":"Inquisitor Kane","date":"2016-09-12T14:32:05.112+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zurkrem,realm=EUW,application-id=2E4zVIwd,discussion-id=bRzrWMu9,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-09-12T14:18:09.781+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m also not a Rito employee, but I too have an answer for you:\n> The new client will have all the features of the current client (spectating etc.).\n> \n> Edit: I think you meant &quot;Inquiries&quot; and not &quot;Inquisitions&quot;\n\nI approve his Inquisitions so all is good in my books :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Inquisitor Kane","date":"2016-09-12T13:05:08.128+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm no Rito employee but I think I can answer 2 questions:\n\n- New client is supposed to be better, faster and cleaner than the old one so I am sure they will clean up their sht and lower CPU usage in the end.\n\n- Spectating is important feature so it should come back. If I remember correctly someone even datamined replay system therefore I believe spectating is coming back 100%.","replies":[]}]}
