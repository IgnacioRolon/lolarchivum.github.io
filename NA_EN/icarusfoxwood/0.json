See where im going with this, Ya you'd be able to defeat the purpose of people who RWT to get such things, but you'd also be devalueing something that we have as \"Veteran\" players. Granted Riots now 95% more about the money then they ever were and I do see this eventually happening as a marketing and budget thing..... But please for the sake of the game and players who actually like to have something that shows off the time and effort we put into this game... If you re-release CS riven and all the other I mentioned Why not just release all the victorious skins... Make me feel worthless for getting gold in season 1 for my strain to grind to gold back then.... This completely is a big F you to myself and any other veteran player... Don't you want the new players to be like \"hey man I never seen that skin!!!\" and \"Man if they got that skin or Icon from back then and its so rare and cool now and were only able to get it from having it back then!! man I hope in a few years I have something cool you could only get once!!\" Get my rant/argument?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bakerduncan","date":"2015-07-19T00:52:35.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a topic that I feel somewhat conflicted about. I find the idea of some skins being available for one time only and never sold again interesting. You can see the person with the skin and admire it in all its limited glory. The only problem I have with Championship Riven not being released again is that they re-released Championship Thresh. If the Championship skin was only available for that one season and then never again I could understand that they wouldn't want to re-release Championship Riven. Since Championship Thresh was re-released though, I find it a bit silly that they would make Riven's impossible to obtain. That's just my personal opinion. And if you're willing to quit a game because a skin is re-released that's just childish.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-07-17T01:48:33.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's usually around Oct-Nov.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SeriousAerox","date":"2015-07-18T18:29:41.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"DONÂ´T Sell Championship Riven !!!! it must be a skin who only the older Players got !!! because all idiots buy then this skin and the older Players will be pissed and stop playing !","replies":[]}]}
