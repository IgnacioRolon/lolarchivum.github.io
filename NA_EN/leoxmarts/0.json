First I'd play in my main accout that is in the brazilian server, to get to know the mechanics and all the champions and everything else about the game, to get experience and get to love the game as I do now. Then I started searching for ways to get to PBE. I guess PBE in Brazil is not possible yet, and I don't want to transfer my first original account and mix with PBE, so I read about it and created a new account in the North America server. Now I just reached level 30 and I still don't know how to get to PBE. Everytime I click the link you give me, it takes me to the Blitz and this message:\r\n\r\n[Error: 500 ·\r\nSomething’s gone hextechnically wrong.\r\n\r\nMaintenance golems are working to exterminate the problem.]\r\n\r\nI really enjoy the game a lot and really want to be part of the PBE so I can help you in some way and it's going to be  good to me too. I don't know what is needed to join, I thought I had everything, so please, help lead me to this.\r\nI'm 24 yo, lived in the US for a year, so I speak and understand english. I'm living in Brazil now, hoping to work with games someday. I have a NA account level 30 and I'm pretty sure I have a good attitude in game so far in both accounts, what else do I need??\r\n\r\nTell me what I need to do to get to PBE, considering the link doesn't work for me somehow, and then please accept me! XD\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for the attention, \r\nLeoxSoldier (BR)\r\nLeoxMarts (NA)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-03T17:11:21.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I don't have any visibility on PBE for BR.  You can sign up if you have an NA account as you mentioned, but we can't expedite or force applications.  The error you're receiving is likely due to your navigation to the site.  It seems like you are attempting to sign up for the PBE via another region URL, but need to use the one for [NA](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/). You'll need to sign out completely then sign in from the NA page first, and visit the [PBE ](https://pbesignup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/pbe)link.

I just signed up for it, I hope I get in, thanks!! :D\n\nLet me ask you this now: \nAs I said, I have my main account in the BR server and I signed up my NA account to PBE. Do I need to keep playing in the NA account in order to get a better chance of getting into PBE?? Considerably?\nI read that the selection takes in consideretion the experience of the player with specific champions and mechanics depending on the current PBE cycle, and my true experience is only shown in my main BR account. There is nothing in this new NA account, I just got level 30 in two-three weeks, don't even have IP, runes (only tier 2), not even enough champions, just a few cheap ones.\n\nThanks again, \nL.M.M.","replies":[]}]}]}
