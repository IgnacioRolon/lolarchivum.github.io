I tried everything and it didn`t work, so i \"rolled it over\", since it wasn`t affecting a game a lot. Then, after a few more matches, game won`t work at all. Here is how it looks:\r\nI started a custom match (i was testing if the bug is still present);\r\nNormally picked champion and started the game;\r\nBut it opens a normal loading screen, but in window, instead of fullscreen, and not only that, it is \"not responding\" and after a few pointless clicks over mouse and keyboard it tells me: LoL cilent (TM).exe blablaba is not working and that Windows` pointless attempt to fix it;\r\nBUUUUT\r\nThat is what happened before my test match.\r\nWhat i tried here is to wait for it, randomly clicking the screen (idk why), and this happened:\r\nThe game DID uncolor, but it freeze. And after a few more minutes not moving from 0% i declared it will RIP and closed it, but without error message.\r\nI hope you can do something about it (please don`t tell me to reinstall the game XD).\r\nBest regards.","replies":[{"poster":"GamerEvolved","date":"2016-08-31T21:20:15.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorr, the thing is fixed, idk how, i was \"pressing random buttons, but in command panel XD\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-31T20:42:36.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not exactly sure what could be going on, but I'd like to help troubleshoot.  Are you using 4K at all?  As a first step, 4K is not something that we currently support so you'll have to reduce your resolution.  Second, if you recently updated Windows 10 I recommend disabling the [Xbox Game Bar ](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html), which has been causing the game to freeze for some players.\n\nFinally, you may need to adjust your dpi settings to fit everything properly.  To do this:  Right click the LoL icon -> Properties -> Compatibility Tab -> Check the \"Disable Display Scaling on High DPI Settings\" Box.\n\nI hope that helps!  If not, throw some more details at me and screenshots to help.","replies":[]}]}
