A attack role class can destroy you like nothing if you dont know how to play her . even for people who know how shes pretty hard to learn. thats the reason why i think Lissandra its a small rework on her range. she's a really fun champ but the range on her is killing me its good for face to face but when you're playing someone like Zed who can out range you like nothing makes it kinda hard!","replies":[{"poster":"DocRedgrave","date":"2014-09-13T19:22:37.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lissandra's entire concept is a close-range mage specializing in initiating teamfights with her CC and locking down targets. She functions best against mid laners who are melee. This is how she was designed and there is no rework needed for it in my opinion. I'd also like to remind you all that unless you can think of a better passive for Lissandra there's no reason to change it.","replies":[{"poster":"PokladnicaZla","date":"2014-09-13T20:02:01.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"She will get her passive redone.","replies":[{"poster":"DocRedgrave","date":"2014-09-13T22:44:47.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Redone into what?

She does not need a full rework, she merely needs a better passive and maybe some buffs to her tankiness, particularly early game (giving her high base HP but poor scaling would be good for the early game while leaving her squishy late game unless she goes tank).\n\nWhat I want Riot to do is to push Lissandra to the role of a ranged AP tank. She has all the tools she needs to be an initiator and an AoE crowd controller for her team. Her kit is amazing and satisfying, but she needs to be pushed more towards \"AP tank\" and less towards \"generic AP mage\".","replies":[]}]}
