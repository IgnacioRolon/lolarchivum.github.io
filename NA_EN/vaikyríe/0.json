This was the last game.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s basically what happened: you know, everyone always have moments that their brains fart and do not function correctly, including mine. I messed up my combo one time, which caused myself getting rooted by Xayah and their Fiddlestick =&gt; of course I died. But then just after that one death, the Jhin adc on my team started flaming me, told me I was trolling, saying Zyra should not lose lane against a Fiddlestick and Xayah, and that Zyra have to win early game because she is useless late game (which game me some major question marks because I definitely know that Zyra can one-shot squishies late game; I don&#039;t say I know Zyra best, I only speak from my experience). \r\n\r\nNaturally, Jhin and Zyra push lane right? and we were not an exception: we pushed our lane. Then I saw the other team&#039;s Riven were on the way from mid to bot to gank us so I back up, then I got flamed for &quot;doing nothing&quot; when I had wards put down, and poked their bot lane without stealing Jhin&#039;s minions (if you want to check match history, it is up there).\r\n\r\nThe Zed and Jhin also told the other team to report me, but things were fine for me on the other side because their midlaner, Ahri, and I were in the same team the game before this game, and she knew I was not trolling.\r\n\r\nLong story short, in the end, I got flamed really hard by the Jhin and the Zed. They said they would report me and the Zed also told me to go f*** myself when I told them the stats showed that I did way more than them (damage, wards, crowd control, etc.) and even when our toplaner Nasus was crying for help, no one helped him (including the jungler) but myself.\r\n\r\nI know I have enough honors that the two reports are probably going to do nothing, and I know that you guys are probably going to tell me that this is a norm on PBE and I should get over it. But honestly, I don&#039;t mind some reports once in a long while (perks of being a support main: you usually get honored), but after this incident, I strikes me as a League player in general, not just PBE, that many people (I say &quot;many&quot;, not &quot;all&quot; nor &quot;majority&quot;) make it so difficult to play the game peacefully, and the toxic part of a community can become very overwhelming, making players (especially Supports) feel helpless when they try to do their best. \r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.: And it also makes me wonder if Riot can somewhat control players behavior MORE in PBE because PBE is about making the game better and support each other. There have been a lot of toxic, throws, trolls, afks just because &quot;it&#039;s PBE, who cares&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{champion:143}}","replies":[{"poster":"Dancing Foxx","date":"2018-03-23T23:50:57.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I got yelled at last night as Lulu because our ADC kept walking in front of minions and the enemy team had a blitzcrank.
