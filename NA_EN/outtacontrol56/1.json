It feels like you're curious about creative process, and I love process talk. \n\nSince you posted this on a Sunday, the answer is 0 pages this week ;)  \n\nLet me also state that I am speaking about my own process and not that of any other writer on the champ team or within Riot, nor is it emblematic of Riot's process.  Others may have a different POV or disagree on thoughts on the matter. \n\nWhen writing novels or screenplays, counting pages to measure forward momentum is a clear indicator of progress towards something complete. But page count  alone does not a good story make. I've found this even more true here on the Champ team, tracking page count as progress isn't a good indicator. We also use many different programs to write (excel, word, final draft, white boards, post it notes, torn up scraps of printer paper, IA writer on my phone on the toilet, Writerduet, my trusty moleskine, that old composition book, legal pads, and one time, a bar napkin), so that makes the true answer to your question harder to gauge. \n\nToday, I've written one page so far, but it's a research page where I'm trying to find a character's voice and motivations, to feel them out. It will never see the light of day and nor should it. But it's gas in the tank to get me closer to the story of this character, to unraveling who they are and understanding their point of view. It's hard for me to read what's already been written about the character and apply it, my style simply doesn't work that way. I gotta take characters out onto the open road and test drive them in order to get a feel for how they move/talk/feel/act/etc.\n\nLast week, I wrote about 9 pages of script-format work, about 3 prose style pages, about 3(ish) excel pages, I cannot and will not say for what, because it's possible none of what I wrote will not be released. Almost all of writing is rewriting, and most of rewriting is throwing away, whittling down, or simplifying. \n\nOn average, if I have to toss a ballbark number, I'd say between 10-15 pages. As Jaredan pointed out once, a lot of that is work on story sketches (think narrative concept art) which is meant to inspire the team. It's probably the best part of my job as it affords me the opportunity to take a lot of risks and write outside my comfort zone (in my case this comfort zone is screenplays and short minimalist fiction). I've written first-person shorts, poems, fables, mini-plays, and straight short stories. I believe how you tell a story is just as important as what the story is about and all stories are character vehicles. Each medium means I have to think about the character differently and opens up a lot of possibilities as to who they are and how they're viewed by others.","replies":[{"poster":"DamienSolta","date":"2015-07-14T15:59:30.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FauxSchizzle,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=RPWPEZ9i,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-13T17:14:13.689+0000)\n>\n>It feels like you're curious about creative process, and I love process talk.\n\nVery cool info. A lot of the new character fluffing content seems to make use of more diverse mediums (the videos, comics, music videos, etc). It makes me kinda sad that there is a ton of cool (if very unpolished or whatever) stuff that gets done to help people develop their ideas that never gets seen. Some of that behind the scenes stuff is so cool (and a lot of it is never seen for a reason, I know, but whatever it's still cool). Especially since it can be hard sometimes to get a lot of that nuance and depth from only the things that players get to see. I know good storytelling is showing not telling though.\n\nI bet a screenplay for that A New Dawn cinematic would be kinda funny to read.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OuttaControl56","date":"2015-07-14T04:08:37.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Curse the Sunday loophole! \n\nThanks for the insight, and for the response! I'm not completely blind to the artistic struggle of trying to illustrate a narrative, and the amount of concepts and ideas that are thrown into the trash, dug back out again, edited, thrown into the incinerator, rewritten, trashed, finalized and completed. I had some really good teachers who taught me the wise tenant \"writing is rewriting\". I just have an fascination for the narrative department because of the work that is done there and the world that they have spent about 5 years creating that I just loooove.\n\nIf I could ask one more question, it would be this: Attitude/Narrative-wise, which champion is your favorite? \n\nTo help you along, I'll answer my own question! I like stepping into Kassadin's shoes: an arrogant man made humble through his mutation, yet frustrated at Runeterrans and their lack of attention to the Void and its ever-growing threat. To every other champion he'd be pretty sullen or impatient at their lack of perspective (or in the case of the Void creatures, absolutely livid). Sullen or disillusioned as he is, though, he is still a one-man/mutation army standing between Runeterra and an endless feast, and for that he is the most heroic champion to me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Impetual","date":"2015-07-12T09:07:28.857+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"Sadly, I'm pretty sure they won't answer you.\n\nFrom what I hear from Jaredan, I'm pretty sure that the Narrative team (which may or may not exist as the Foundations team) isn't actually assigned to develop Runeterra.\n\nFrom what Jaredan's said, it sounds like writers are assigned to specific teams that are work on champions, events, and maybe locations?\n\nIt sounds like the Story of Runeterra is being written around what the other teams are doing. In other words, the Narrative team just plays catch up and tries to write lore that fits whatever the other teams are producing.\n\nIt sounds like quality lore isn't much of a priority anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2015-07-13T18:10:19.978+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Sadly, im pretty sure they wont answer you\n\nCheck again Pal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xhader","date":"2015-07-14T04:24:55.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't know why you're being downvoted, I got the same gist out of what he said.
