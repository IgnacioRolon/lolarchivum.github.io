I followed the fix by riot, and it worked fine. But, as i played games after the fix, every single game suddenly started to have intense packet loss lag. Ive tried restarted computer, internet, dns flush and none worked.","replies":[{"poster":"Preprevenge","date":"2017-06-16T22:48:00.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://gyazo.com/061ba06b56002aea6421965fb176cc9a\n\nAll the games I've played regardless of game type have an issue where the game freezes and then resumes after a second or two. I've run the game with and without a vpn and still am getting issues. However, I never had an issue with packet loss prior to the patch and nothing else on my end has changed.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-17T04:19:27.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you're having some packet loss issues as well. Reach out to those tech guys with your network logs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) as well to see if we can help or not!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-16T21:06:52.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's go ahead and double check for packet loss since you already mentioned thinking that might be the main problem. Grab the latest game logs that had this lag and pop it into this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). It'll be able to tell us for sure what kind of lag you're experiencing, so take a screenshot using something like Gyazo and post it here for us to go over together!","replies":[{"poster":"Cant Flash Death","date":"2017-06-17T01:37:35.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://gyazo.com/c5284fe145de63b74bf66af462658298\n\nprobably related too: in the client it sometimes greys out the play button and says there is no connection and i should restart the client. Since the patch, ive also occasionally had it to where my friends list disappeared, or i would appear offline to others and wouldnt connect chat but could still invite by typing name and play games","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-17T04:18:31.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooooo yea that packet loss is probably the culprit. Hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and throw them your network logs that you used with the log reader. They'll be able to look over those and see if there's any way we can help on our end!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Preprevenge","date":"2017-06-16T20:31:17.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also having the same issue, I've tried reinstalling the client as well as using a vpn. The vpn helped a bit as my character would still move during the packet loss but jungle camps disappear and then appear once I stood still at the camp for a bit.\nI've only experience this issue with the newest update and don't think there should be any issue with my internet connection as nothing has changed on my mind save for the newest league update.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated as this update has made playing the game extremely difficult and unenjoyable.","replies":[]}]}
