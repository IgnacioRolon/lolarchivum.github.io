I currently have all the champs, so I no longer have a favorite one. However, when I first started the game out, I became an instant fan of the void thanks to literally playing Cho' for about the first 100 games. The reason for this is quite funny. I'm not sure why I played Cho' FREQUENTLY, but something about him made me enjoy playing him over and over again. Again, I don't know what it is. However, I guess you can say it's gratifying to grant you and your team kills when you don't miss his Q W R or W Q R combo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Runes Reworked","date":"2014-10-27T22:10:10.658+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:55}}  Why?\n\nShe has crazy burst and is very versatile because she's able to jump in, deal lots of damage, and when someone dies, she can make the decision to continue getting kills or get out and it requires good decision making to play her at a competitive level. You have to decide when it's time to jump into the fight and when to get out which is something that can make or break a Katarina player.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sticky Bandit","date":"2014-10-27T19:42:06.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I first started playing the game about 10 months ago, I was a Soraka support main. That was all I could play, and I was >30. A few weeks out of being level 30, I played my first ranked game with Soraka support. My ADC started boots and pots, rushed an Atma's, and fed. After that I decided I didn't want to play with a shitty ADC again, so I became an ADC main. I fell in love with Vayne and Jinx. After a few times being forced into top lane and feeding hard, I took the time to learn top lane, and started really liking that. I then found out that most top laners I liked couldn't carry a game, so I went back to AD Carrying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GetToTheLantern","date":"2014-10-27T19:34:18.490+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would have to say {{champion:22}}  cause she was the first champion I ever played with and I fell in love with the concept of her bow then I saw her queen ashe skin and knew this was the game I was gonna play and the champ I was gonna play.
