That'd be focused on making her more distinct from other assassins and giving her healthier gameplay - power level/viability isn't a reason for us to rework a champion.\n\nOh god yes.\nAs a long time Akali player(she was the first true assassin I bought)\nlet me tell you my thoughts on her current state.\n\n\n\nThings I Like\n\n-using shroud to duck in and out of stealth to make her a duelist. This has a very unique playstyle compared to how most other stealth users just using it for SUPRISE ambushes{{champion:107}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:35}} or getaways(seriously this is a really fun playstyle. DO NOT REMOVE THIS AND REPLACE IT WITH SOME GIMMICK.)\n-sticking power with ult kicks. Seriously no other champion in LoL has this much sticking power it sorta makes you wonder why Akali even needs a ranged skill.\n-the amount of burst damage an Akali can deal in the mid-late game but with gaps to fight back. alot of Akali's power is packed into Q, once Q gets popped your enemy can fight back until the CD is done. 3 seconds is alot of time in LoL . not only that but a pink can also be dropped\n-being able to sustain against enemy champions with use of her shroud to avoid incoming damage. \n-her sideboob's ;-)\n\nThings that I DONT like\n\n-Q being free nonstop harass .similiar to {{champion:80}} {{champion:55}}  no one likes this laning pattern of spamming poke especially if its resourceless\n-insane sustain she gets against minions once gunblade is done. She can Trade all day then fall back to her creeps and heal to max very quickly.\n-AD isnt as good as AP inside her Twin Disciples passive.AP gives you massive amounts of damage while AD gives you spellvamp(which can be capped) This wouldnt be that bad but none of Akalis other important skills with AD.Simply put there is not enough appeal for attack Damage.\n-E feels like a brainless waveclearer using it will cancel your auto and reduce theoretical DPS.(I think Zeds ShadowSlash is a obejctively better skill because of how smooth it is and how it doesnt interupt auto's) overall just a very filler skill\n-level 6 all in power Just like Old nidalee Akali is one of those champs that tends to auto win lane at level 6 .This is a remnant of Earlier seasons champion design. This can be easily fixed by changing the amount of shadow kicks she can use (2/3/4 shadow kicks?)\n-akali having so much innate damage that she can get away with building tank and still dealing enough damage to take out the enemy carries.\n\nThings I would like see enhanced\n\n-W granting something outside of simply stealth(maybe have it apply a blind   or reduce vision?) because getting this one skill is Akali's lifeline in a teamfight.\nE- give it clear purpose outside of waveclear.\nPassive-Ad should give something other than spellvamp. Hybrid or AD Akali should be a thing especially considering thats what Assassins are Itemized around.\n\n\n\nOverall I really like Akalis design.\nStriking from the shadows dealing a ton of damage and then hiding again. Unlike most assassins who have a real GO BIG OR GO HOME playstyle Akali has options .Akali can escape from a bad situation by shrouding herself and booking it or by jumping to a enemy minion.The most unhealthy parts of Akalis kit is that sometimes it feels like she deals TOO much damage  and once she gets ahead going into lane becomes a death sentence  just like Old Fiora or  really good Riven ,Tryndamere players.Overall Akali needs a rework more in line with Quinn. Where not much is changed but instead abilities are amplified or enhanced with some functionality changes.\n\nSo when the time comes and the big remakes come in please remember this post.","replies":[{"poster":"Yaku The God","date":"2016-05-20T21:20:19.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well in my opinion I don't play Akali tank, or assassin. I play her hybrid fighter. The AD scaling on her passive with some ap too, is pretty useful for both sustain and the on hit magic damage? Plus she shreds turrets with a hextech and guinsoos (her passive on hit magic damage actually works against turrets). Buying resistances over hp is more important for her seeing as she can be built to rely on sustain as a fighter. But yeah just my playstyle, I love Akali and I don't play her AP assassin, it's less fun and in comparison it's not as powerful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ehaugw","date":"2017-07-24T22:50:58.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been almost a year since the Assassin Update, and I am still waiting\n\nThe fact that most mobile champions can kite \"the unkitable\" is very frustrating. This is because the combination of the R nerf (2 sec CD and slower travel speed) in the assassin update, and the E nerf two and a half year ago. If I play against an Yasuo for instance, he can simply E away while I R, preventing me from getting of the hilariously slow AA, to proc my Q. The same goest for most other mobile champions, like Ahri. Even if I manage to dodge both her Q and E, I will still not land any damage on her, because she can R away from my AAs.\n\nRight now, she is very hard to succeed with at mid, because of her ult CD. The lane is simply too short to kill anything unless they play extremely risky. If I take Akali to top lane, I normally face a traditional top laner, who easily solos me with better base stats, and contribute WAY better in teamfigts.\n\nFinally, I find it idiotic that her new passive revolves entierly around AAs, yet her AAs are insanely slow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2016-03-08T05:27:49.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Any thoughts on what you'd want to change with her? I personally think her E is the worst skill of her repertoire, and that she should just get something new. There's also the fact that her passive is just... bad design. No gameplay, and it's just bonus stats for getting hybridized. Come on, you can do better than that.\n\nAnd, on a non-gameplay side, I'd like to see her lore get updated. How does she fit into the Shen/Zed/Jhin story? Why does she hate Zed so damn much? Is she actually sleeping with Shen or not?","replies":[{"poster":"Yaku The God","date":"2016-05-20T21:15:42.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see Akali's passive, and I love it, buy stats....
