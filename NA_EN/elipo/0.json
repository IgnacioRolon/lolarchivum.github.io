My fps are too low to play, I have to close the game open it again with the legacy client in order to play. I play the game on low settings, I use the beta client withouth effects but it doesn't fix anything and I haven't seen any improvement with new pattches release, so does this mean you guys arent working on this issue? Does this mean once you make this new client the only client avaiable I'll say good bye to this game? Am I really the only one with this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-24T22:23:47.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weird!
