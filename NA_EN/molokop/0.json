He has a GOOD computer without any problems.\r\nWhen he opens the client he sees the league logo, but then after ~10 seconds it closes and nothing happens.\r\nWe tried to run it as an administrator but it still doesn't work, it just sometimes shows \"Repairing\" and after it finishes it doesn't fix the problem.\r\nWe checked online and we couldn't find a way to fix it. We also restarted the computer, tried reinstalling multiple times (the EUNE download which is the best for us) and just waited so it will maybe fix itself after a long time. Any help will be acceptable! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-15T02:46:05.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm typically when you see the logo for a split second you can adjust your permissions or run it as admin and that'll fix it up. Since that causes the client to open and then start a repair which just fails, it kinda makes me think something might be blocking some of the game files tbh. \n\nDo me a quick favor and disabled any firewalls or antivirus you might have running, and try opening League as admin again. You may still need to repair, but there's a chance that your antivirus/firewall was blocking the game files from being repaired correctly!","replies":[]}]}
