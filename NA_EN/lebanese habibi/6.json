The thing that shows that it is fake is the link. If you look at the link it isnt really the real League of Legends website link.\nIf you click on one of the boxes on the top such as \"Home, Boards, News, Game, etc,\" the link completely changes from the scam site and you get directed back to the real site. That's how they convince people that it's not a scam. Dont send the link too others and if you or even your friends entered any account information in the scam site look for anything unusual with your account. Be safe out thereüëçüèº","replies":[]}]}
