I've looked at older threads and the answers there do not help my case.\r\nAny other help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"sad and addicted","date":"2017-10-16T18:51:14.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking at the processes tab in task manager, league just dies after a couple seconds into trying to load it up.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-16T22:28:25.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like your League might have updated and doesn't have all the right permissions in place for it to open correctly.

Perhaps it was already opening but in that case it would have had the pop up saying \"League is already open do you want to close the first window\" or something like that. I guess my computer can't handle league opening despite it doing so many times before. Regardless I hope your client doesn't do this thing again.","replies":[]}]}
