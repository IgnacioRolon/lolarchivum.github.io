It just pisses me off seeing people saying it's a horrible game with no reason apart from \"I don't like it\" or 'I think it's cringey\". If you look at the big picture it really isn't that bad, and I hope this can quiet some of those people down.\r\n\r\nThe argument I hear most often is \"The game is cringey.\" Now this is a very valid argument for someone in their mid-high teens or older to make, because (in case you couldn't tell by the silly skins and bright colors) it's a game geared towards younger audiences. Of course you're not going to like the gimmicks if you're above the age demographic. It's like saying Dora is a bad show because you think it's too childish. Of course it's childish, it's a kids show. If you want to play a Battle Royale game geared towards more mature audiences, play literally any other Battle Royale game. (PubG, H1Z1, Bo4, etc.)\r\n\r\nAnother thing I hear a lot is that the game is too easy. I have one word for you. \"Building\". I'm more impressed watching my 13 year old brother in a build battle on the Xbox in Fortnite than I am watching professional League of Legends players most of the time. The skill cap in Fortnite is absolutely insane if you watch someone who's really good at it you'll see. This even diverts the demographic to slightly older audiences because it's gonna be easier and more effective for someone older to perfect building than a kid to. It's just that a lot of people won't give it a chance and say it's bad by default because it's not what they're used to.\r\n\r\nAnd whenever someone says the game is dying, I want to slap them. Some reports say that Fortnite had 78.3 million players in the month of August alone. (that's a lot.) The game has potentially reached it's peak, which games will always do, but it's definitely nowhere near dying. Epic games is way too good for that.\r\n\r\nWhich leads to my next point, Epic Games is a ridiculously creative company. The incorporation of building alone was (obviously) great, but all of these things they're doing that I can't even keep up with (the rifts, the cube, new places all the time, wtf happened to loot lake), Epic games constantly keeps the game fresh in really creative ways, as well as making amazing looking skins. (for the most part.)\r\n\r\nTL;DR: From a non-Fortnite player, Fortnite is objectively a good game. You can dislike it if you want and say \"I fucking hate this game\", but it's simply not true to say \"This is a shitty game.\"\r\n\r\nNow for the downvote parade. :D","replies":[]}
