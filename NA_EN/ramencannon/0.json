Unfortunately I got hit with the Leaverbuster (understandable) but now my Queues all have a Red Exclamation Point Hazard Symbol next to the Queue timer. I understand being hit with the leaverbuster and put into a Low Priority Queue, but every night Ive been put into Queues for hours at a time. Literally two nights ago, I Queued up for a normal summoner rift draft pick, and I fell asleep, then woke up with the queue timer at over 600 minutes! Insane right?! I got ten whole hours of sleep, who'dve thought. But really, a 10 hour queue period seems excessive to me and I really don't know what to do. Tonight, I Queued up in a game against bots and I've currently been in queue for over 30 minutes.  I've ran the Hextech Repair tool, reinstalled LoL, Opened and closed it, and restarted my computer. Honestly I just want to play League again, and if there's a fix then Id love to hear it. \r\n\r\nAlso I know I'm terrible, be gentle pls &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-10T18:06:05.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is an abnormal wait time, and I think your network might be losing comms with the matchmaking service.
