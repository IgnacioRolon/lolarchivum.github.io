He even told me he scripts to a certain rank then sells it. He's diamond 2 now after he hit masters and sold the account. Different summoner sand a 25 loss streak with different champions as well. I demoted off him a month ago and have been monitoring how he's still active . He has two other friends who have a total of like 5 accounts they script on . I've reported al of them... As for be intent feeder in my last game, he's still playing knowing he did it once in the past month so it won't affect him .\n\nAnd yes I've reported everyone on my other smurf.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BLACKLlVESMATTER","date":"2016-08-17T00:31:48.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vanishh,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=BadzLTll,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-08-17T00:27:20.561+0000)\n>\n> Oh wait .
