You acknowledge Ivern is \"very much on the strong side\", but I don't see how pickrate factors into that overly much.

He admitted that Ivern is on the strong side and they are always reviewing him. But pick/ban rate definitely is a factor in how quickly they respond with nerfs/buffs. If someone is being picked in 40% of all games with a 30% ban rate and yet still has a 60% winrate Riot are going to react to that champion quicker than one that is picked 1% of the time with 0.1% banrate and has a 60% winrate, as the former champion is affecting far more games.","replies":[{"poster":"Dessem","date":"2017-03-22T14:18:15.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> They didn't say they were going to completely leave him alone.\n\nHe didn't say it, but the implication is there: Ivern is **always** reviewed, but never acted upon. This review comes because he is on the strong side.\n\nThus. Ivern is strong -> Riot reviews him -> Riot decides not to nerf him -> Ivern remains strong -> Riot reviews him -> Riot decides not to nerf him -> Ivern remains strong etcetera.\n\nI ask about it because it looks like Sotere is saying that they know he's strong, and they continuously review him, but pick/banrate is apparently a big factor in their decision to allow him to remain as strong as he is. This is why I'm curious in what way these rates factor into balance changes.","replies":[{"poster":"The Sword Saint","date":"2017-03-22T18:25:24.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's more that it costs professional developers, testers, balancers, etc. time and effort to look at how to best tune a champion to make sure they move towards the heealthiest direction while hurting how fun they are to play and their thematics as little as possible.

Ivern is strong, that is true. But he's strong in weird ways.\nBeing able to easily clear the jungle in a meta where the jungle eats you back is very strong. Kindred and some off-junglers (like Taliyah and Sol) suffer because the jungle does too much damage. Not only can Ivern withstand the jungle (since it likes him), he can come out of his first and second clear with much more health than other junglers like Vi or Shyvana.\n\nHis strengths are this:\n- Easy for non-junglers to pick up\n- Lots of CC\n- Very good clear\n\nHis weaknesses are:\n- He's weird. Really, _really _weird. His mechanics on his W and Q are very, _very_ strange (with W hurting more than helping a lot of the time). Teemo and Rengar can use his W bushes against him.\n- Susceptible to invades. If an Ivern isn't paying attention, the enemy jungler can easily clear his camps while he's off taking the enemy's. This ruins Ivern's clear and makes it hard to catch up.\n- No damage. Even if you're building full AP, Ivern does very low amounts of damage when compared to actual AP junglers like Zac.\n\nHere are some tips when you're going against Ivern:\n- Yes, he does spend mana and health to set up camps. Predict his movement pattern and intercept him during the second half of his first clear. You can kill him easily.\n- Damage of any kind interrupts his Passive channeling, meaning Teemo, Cassiopeia, and Malzahar can make it so he can't Q in to steal a camp.\n- Daisy's AI is bad. Really, really bad. If you see her glitching out (which happens a lot), take advantage of it. Also, Daisy is manually controlled for the most part, meaning that Ivern has to direct her to you in order for her to hit you. Don't be afraid to wail on him with Daisy out, she's not like Tibbers and won't start attacking you immediately.\n- Kill him first. Ivern will be the supportive heart of a team, with defensive items like Redemption, Locket, etc. Treat him as a support (which he is) and prioritize him ahead of tanks and such.\n- Ivern and his team can't see inside his bushes, meaning they're safe to hide in.","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2017-03-22T09:45:30.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just for the dmg, u tried on hit ivern?\nIt freakin wrecks shop.\n{{item:1419}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3022}} and probs a {{item:3078}} in combination with his W absolutely shred everyone.\nManaged to 1v1 a quiin who had over 20 kills with only the razor, guinsoo and mallet","replies":[]}]}]}
