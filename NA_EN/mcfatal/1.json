This was in the early days of chromas, and iirc was a choice made because there was Pool Party Zac (blue) coming out, base Zac (green) and Special Weapon Zac (purple). Not sure why red wasn't chosen here, but it was to give another option in terms of color. Buuuut, orange and yellow are pretty similar. :x","replies":[{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-08-30T22:39:52.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo katey you on the art team right?

THanks\n\nI work on skins, and subsequently ward skins, yup! Having text in the game is a bit tricky, since we need to localize it for all regions. :c Making a sign like this for a ward is a bit out of the question. \n\nYou're right - IP sales aren't forever. This current sale goes through September 8th. We do plan on having several IP sales a year, though. I'm not sure which chromas will be applicable each time around for 2k IP each, but we'll have everything listed out the next time a chroma IP sale rolls around. :)","replies":[{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-08-30T23:40:42.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm you're totally correct about the localization.
