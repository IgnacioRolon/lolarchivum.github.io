I finally responded and it turns out that his entire team were playing in a queue together. So of course my response got reported. \r\n\r\nMy point is, league needs to be less harsh on reports that come from duo/trio/quads/ and full teams. Sometimes they just gang up on that one person, and if you get that many reports its instant restrictions. It's just not fair to be the one person who isnt part of their group and then get punished for itl.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-04T04:36:43.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah man, that sounds pretty lame =(. There's not a lot I can do to keep a 5 man premade from deciding to gang up on you, but it's not necessarily the best display of sportsmanship to fight back against your own teammates.\n\nI may have struggled with this myself at first, but it's best to learn not to fight fire with fire. In the future, try to stay calm and report them in the post game lobby, get your sweet revenge by reporting them!","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-08-04T11:38:39.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my bro, Tantram has said many times in PB boards that multiple reports within the same game don't increase the chances or speed that someone gets punished.\n\nMight want to update your answer database.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-05T03:37:13.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm....I'm not sure where anyone said multiple reports in the same game *did* increase the punishment chance?\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-08-05T14:25:27.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Darth Acinorev,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=2MLn3cIr,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-08-04T03:38:02.430+0000)\n> \n> My point is, league needs to be less harsh on reports that come from duo/trio/quads/ and full teams.
