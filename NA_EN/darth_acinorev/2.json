I accept the match, it loaded, i clicked a champion to ban and then it freezes when it says 27 seconds. It's happened twice in a row. I lost LP for it. I'm now at -4 in silver 5. If i get demoted for this I'll be so pissed! I had a 5 minute wait timer for the first freeze, and now on this second freeze I have a 22 minute wait time! Riot, fix please! And give me back my LP!!!!!!!! This is so unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-08T01:52:19.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the time you'll only see those freezes in champion select if your network is having a hard time communicating with our servers.
