It was because of my toxic personality. I saw it coming that i would be banned because they had suspended me for 2 weeks twice. I now understand that if i want to play the game i will need to stop with my attitude. I spent alot of money into that account \nbecause i was foolish enough to not realize its a game and i really could do better things with my money.\nI spent around 500 dollars on that account ( not joking. ) and as you can see by that,i was really into the game. Mostly bought skins.\nI wonder that if now i have learned my lesson and are much more mature and less salty about everything,is there a way \nto get my account back?\nIf i email riot games and explain to them almost the exact same thing as i said in this post,could i have a slight chance of getting the account back?\nThanks for reading this,and as i said i dont want any people to try to lecture me when replying to this post. It isnt \nnecessary and it wont help anyone.\n\nAgain,thanks! {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}\n\nBtw,if this is posted in the wrong section then feel free to move it.","replies":[{"poster":"Last avatarname","date":"2017-05-23T14:59:25.543+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately there is no way to get your account back after getting perma banned, sorry.","replies":[{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2017-05-23T15:09:45.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.

Perma means permanent there is no getting the account back, sorry. I've spent much more, and i do what i can to keep my account, muting is defending yourself, flaming is retaliating.
