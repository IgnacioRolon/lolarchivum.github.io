It turns off queue noise in addition.\n\nIdeally there's some setup to only hear:\n\nQueue popup, 10 second timer in champ select, game invites, whispers/messages. \n(and maybe when someone joins the party)\nAka: notifications. Without all the miscellaneous flair/ui noises.\n\n\nAlso, how did no one at riot realize that the third checkbox for sound is redundant? If you have the \"enable sfx\" and \"enable music\" unchecked there's literally no sound already...\n\nAnd what inspired the inability to access friends list while in champion select??","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2017-04-25T05:52:07.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't.","replies":[{"poster":"Cheat Engine zZz","date":"2017-04-25T06:09:02.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rineyy,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=jJrAfj8t,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-25T05:52:07.569+0000)\n>\n> You can&#x27;t.\n\nThen why am i forced into this garbage?
