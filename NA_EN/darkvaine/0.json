Your network can still degrade over time or might be unstable enough to take a while for your transition to go through.  Meaning, you can still have problems reaching specific services even though everything else might be okay.  \n\nIn this case, go through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tighten things up.

Once it's over, it will reppear on screen.  When a match ends, a few things need to happen:\n\n-  Your client needs to know that the game has ended (which will remove the reconnect screen)\n- Transfer your connection from the game server and back to pvp.net services\n\nA strong and stable connection will ensure that you get to where you need to go smoothly.  Your client should not be closing out between games.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
