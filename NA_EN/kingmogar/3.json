We can help figure out what caused those crashes so that it doesn't keep happening. Until we get this figured out, make sure to test all changes in custom or practice games to avoid those penalties. \n\nWithout having too much context as to what was happening when your games crashed, it's a little hard to figure out what exactly caused it. I'd suggest starting with the steps in our [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) since you specifically mentioned the game crashing. Hit me back if those steps aren't seeming to help at all and we can dig a little further with ya!","replies":[]}]}
