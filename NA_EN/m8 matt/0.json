Try running a quick repair through the client options, and if that doesn't help go ahead and try a config reset with the steps below! Let me know if neither of these work though!\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
