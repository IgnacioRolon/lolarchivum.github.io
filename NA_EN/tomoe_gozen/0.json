So it was pretty tough to claw my way out of a certain tier/division and it took a lot of games just to see progress. In any case, at that point i also started playing Eve more and i already used the account i made a few years back (in the end of January, 2013) to start learning to play jungle a lot more, with just Eve. It was an \"Eve only\" account.\r\n\r\nThat Eve account is this account.\r\nI played Eve at that point, when the Magus jungle Enchantment was still in the game and was soon replaced by the Runeglaive. And so Eve also took a nerf after nerf to reduce her strengths in pro play, which left her pretty much viable only as a tank. So much for \"Eve only\" strategy. My first ranked experience was way better than what i had on my ex-main. In just 10 provisional games, i've jumped in Gold, which was my, at that time, current standing on my ex-main. So i've ended S5 in Gold 1 75 LP on the ex-main while on my current, i've ended in Plat 1, 49 LP. That was almost a whole tier above what i couldn't get out of previously and of course, that short of low Diamond. In S6, i've ended it in D4 13 LP, which was a prideful moment for me.\r\n\r\nMy old account had also a lot of champions i didn't care about, which to me was just crowding out the actual picks i wanted to be playing with and combined with the bad ELO, the switch was relatively easy to make. I've notified my friends of the switch and that was pretty much it. My activity there stopped as i've moved to greener pastures.\r\n\r\n>---\r\n\r\nBackstory over, let's get back to the issue.\r\nOn mu old account, i have skins dating back to 2011, which means the moment EU servers opened up for the first time, i moved from NA to avoid painful lag. That account is at least 9 years old. I've been a League player from the start of S1, so that's 10+ years in total? I've probably played in the beta but i don't really remember what happened to that account at all.\r\n\r\nSo fast forward to the end of S5, where my ex-main is 5+ years old, i gathered a small collection of skins, since that was basically the time when i started caring about how my champions look. 2014 and 2015 was the time where i got the most skins, at a whopping 5 skins a year. In the end, my current Collection has 17 skins there, and DJ Sona is one of them. Not to mention Judgement Kayle, a currently unobtainable skin as well as Victorious Morgana.\r\n\r\n#So i asked Riot support if i can transfer my Collection from my inactive account to my current main account.\r\n\r\nI didn't want skins i bought just sit and collect dust so i wanted it all under one roof.\r\n_**They've said no.**_ Which was the expected outcome, because i already asked this question a year or so before BUT for a Freljord Icon. I've gotten the same response but didn't feel like pursuing the matter further as it was just an icon. I liked the icon but it was honestly too much effort to write this up and spend a few days talking to support back and forth, only to be met with the same response. So i dropped the matter.\r\n\r\nHowever, fast forward a few days ago and now, the stakes are higher for me.\r\nAll of the Collection i've amassed over the years (skins, icons, wards, etc) is my time and effort invested in this game so i don't want to see it go to waste. I don't play on my old account anymore so i want my Collection to be moved to the account where i've been playing for a few years already. It is reasonable for me to expect that, given ~110 euros worth of content there (combined with purchases and event rewards), this moving of my Collection should be approved, right? **Well, the answer was still a resounding no.**\r\n\r\nTheir response to this was \"if we did this, it can be exploited\".\r\nIn what way can exactly this be exploited? I own both accounts and i just want my stuff i bought, under the same roof. This shouldn't be a problem, at all. As an analogy, consider these two accounts as two different storage units and i have stuff in both of them. One storage unit has not been opened for years while i check the other one regularly. Instead of me paying for two units, i get the idea that i should just put all the stuff in my smaller unit into a bigger unit, to not have to pay for the other unit and that i don't have to make two trips instead of one, between the units. So the manager comes up and says: \"sorry, you can't do that. I know this stuff is all yours but everything has to stay where you've put it, originally\".\r\n\r\nThe analogy is a bit of a hyperbole but you get the idea.\r\nI'm not being allowed to move the stuff i own to my active account, even though i own it. Riot Agents did apologize for not being able to help me and called this an \"inconvenience\". Well, this is a much bigger issue than an inconvenience.\r\n\r\nAlthough they haven't said it, it's also what they don't say that's important.\r\nTheir inability to help me can also allude to the two possible \"workarounds\" to this problem:\r\n\r\n* ##I can just play on the other account, if i want to play with those skins\r\n\r\nEssentially, everything i do on a specific account is tied strictly to that account.\r\nEXP, missions, chests, keys, champion mastery, events, Ranked, match history, purchases, etc. Not only do i have to switch accounts just so that i can switch a skin BUT this also doubles my time and effort (my workload) by wasting my time here, where i have to invest the same time on my main, if i want to actually progress there. OR\r\n\r\n* ##If i want the same skins, i have to PURCHASE them again\r\n\r\nLet me be clear on this point.\r\nI already own these skins but since the Collection transfer is not being allowed, i'll have to buy them again! Well, that does seem like an anti-consumer practice in the making, doesn't it? \"I know you own it and that your accounts are in a good standing, buuuut... tough luck, kiddo\". This is an absurd situation. My analogy still works in this case. Now i have to basically purchase everything i have in the smaller unit again and then put it the bigger one, where the issue of me still having two units and stuff in the smaller one, still not being resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as a reminder, in May 2013, Riot offered an NA to EU account merger, to allow players to essentially transfer their champions and skins to their already active accounts on EU servers. I suspect they've done this so that their progress and time invested in the game wasn't just being thrown in the trash, after having no choice but to play on the only available server there was at the time (NA).  I didn't have much champions there but i nonetheless accepted the offer too. So we know this is possible, they've done it 6 years ago.\r\n\r\nI'm not asking for a merger, though.\r\nI'm asking for my Collection to be transferred. I don't want to close down my ex-main account simply because that account was there from the very start (at least from 2011). It has been a testament of me as a longstanding League player, which is in itself a 10+ year long journey and is a pleasant reminder of my longstanding passion for this game. It would be a shame to lose it.","replies":[]}
