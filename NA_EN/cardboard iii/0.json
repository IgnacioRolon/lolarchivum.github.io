I took feedback from several platforms including boards (these boards and PBE), Reddit comments, and YouTube comments.\n\nThe result? It was about 50/50. \n\nSome players really liked the hair because it fit in with the thematic of PROJECT:, or they liked that her hair was different in this skin as compared to her other skins. Other players wanted hair hair down, similar to how she has it in her other skins. \n\nBased on the feedback, we made the call to keep the hair the way it currently is. We agree that the pushed back white hair is more cohesive with the PROJECT: thematic. This is the hair that you'll see on PROJECT: Fiora once she goes live, there will be no additional changes made.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoultakerKatana","date":"2015-08-28T04:34:57.951+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was with you guys on the fiora rework and we  won but this is stupid . as a fiora player this skin is so good.
