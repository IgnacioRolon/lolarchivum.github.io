Yesterday I encountered one for the first time of my knowledge and he completely carried the enemy team and there was nothing we could do to stop him. The Fiora was advertising himself and being a smug jerk about it. If you go back and read some of the messages he admits to boosting and his sudden ability to dominate all of his games no doubt proves that he is a booster. Please riot if you care for your fanbase people like this need to be banned as soon as possible. Thank you for taking time to read my rant. \r\n {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-09T21:38:34.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best way to make sure that we can take action against people boosting is to hit that report button in the post-game lobby. By doing that, you not only alert us to the player but also the game it happened in which gives us some proof to work with.","replies":[]}]}
