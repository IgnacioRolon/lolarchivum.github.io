If you're on the updated client, you should see an option for Store right next to your [IP/RP balance](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752824-Reward-IP-XP-System-Breakdown).  You'll be able to check the price of champions through there as well as some other goodies.  Let me know if that helps, and good luck on the Summoner's Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"gold4 gatekeeper","date":"2017-04-14T06:55:33.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you bro.
