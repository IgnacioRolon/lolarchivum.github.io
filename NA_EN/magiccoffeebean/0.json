Issue was not fixed last time...","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was told to send screenshots and everything and Riot never fixed my broken Ticket Submissions.  \r\n\r\nAlways results in \"Ticket #0 still open or needs resolve\" when no ticket is open.  Solution might be to clean out old tickets or remove them from my account to clear this glitch.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't fixed the last 2 times I mailed about it.  My mail still unanswered from zendesk or whatever.  Mailed multiple support avenues I've used in the past to no avail.\r\n\r\nAppreciate it if Riot would email me or fix this issue on my account.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-16T16:50:33.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's an odd error, and it would be tough to locate your ticket or ticket history without a number.  Was it from the account posting now?  You can reach out to us anytime through email instead, via support@riotgames.com.  This way we can correspond over email instead of the ticketing center!","replies":[]}]}
