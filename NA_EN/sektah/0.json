Goodbye /:","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"I would like to start off that im not going to try and bash Riot. However i do have quite a lot of things to say about the game. I really hope some sort of riot employee sees this and understands where im coming from.  I first joined in February of 2014 when i saw my brother playing Cho Gath against a Miss Fortune in a bot game... i thought it was the coolest game ever and i want to play so badly. i started on my dads old computer with the screen half out of the laptop and playing with a track pad. i didn&#039;t care because i didn&#039;t really care how well i was playing because i was having so much fun. i went through 3 computers and friendships because of league, and i stayed because i was never bored and always had a good time. The reasoning paragraphs will be from most impact to least impact \r\n\r\n**GAME CHANGES **\r\nThe lovable fun game changed around season 5... right after the Nidalee rework to be exact. i wasn&#039;t salty or mad at riot for doing it and i dont hold a grudge ever since, i just realized that things are going to change through my time playing this game. in season 5 the map was changed which was a drastic change for me... it kinda took away the &quot;retro&quot; feel to it and the &quot;map that i grew up on league playing&quot;. I didn&#039;t necessarily think the map was ugly, i just didn&#039;t want it change because i feel like it wasn&#039;t a NEED. The next change that lowered the fun--o-meter was the late season 5 adc update.. back then i was a silver ADC main trying to carry myself out of silver and i loved the adcs, Caitlyn Mf, and Ashe were my favorite. Only for all of them to be &quot;improved&quot; in one way or another (Ashe being later i believe). I knew deep down that they needed to be updated, but where i was at the time (silver 2 or 3) it wasn&#039;t needed. My most hard one that really bummed me out was the assassin update, i see why they did it, but that fucked my main (Katarina) right in the ass. Not that she became bad or that she wasn&#039;t keyboard mashable, its because they changed ANOTHER one of my loved champions to fit into the meta.  that also took away the old champions that i used to play in season 4 who i thought were the coolest! and had fond memories of. I feel like this was the number one reason for deciding to leave, having the champions and game that i loved being changed for &quot;meta&quot; or &quot;just needing to be changed&quot;. My last point is the Splash art updates. I totally get this one, art and looks get insanely out of style, and need changing, but i do miss the old icons/splash arts. (examples, Ahri&#039;s old art, Akali&#039;s, Shyvana&#039;s, Katarina&#039;s, Talon&#039;s, Rengar&#039;s, Caitlyn&#039;s, Janna&#039;s, Cassiopeia&#039;s most of all)\r\n \r\n**META**\r\nif this is the only paragraph that a rioter would see, i would be happy since this is the one i really want to have focus on. I could go on and on about this... but every game has it, and every game will, it will never leave but just shift and change in some way. If u know me or ever seen me in game im the opposite of a meta slave, i do off meta things... Nidalee Mid is my main right after Kat since i want to feel that old Nidalee like i had in season 4 /: . in fact i have a Midalee guide on mobafire. I love playing lux support, Ashe support, Taliyah support, Elise mid, Nami Jungle, and thats just to name a few. I feel like Meta is to involved in the balancing of maps, champs, items ETC. Of course it will be tied into it some how i know that... but they try to make champions and items more fun and more WOW like if u know what i mean. I feel league has become boring mainly because of champions being constantly tweaked so that they are not to powerful in the meta. Unlike league where very few champions are broken, in DOTA 2 all heroes are broken, and thats their balancing system, which works... having every hero broken as hell so that they are all good and none of them are falling behind. \r\n\r\n**COMMUNITY **\r\nIm not going to type here and say ive never been a dick to someone, but i can proudly say i have never been penalized in any sort of way due to toxicity. I know Riot has tried their very best to try to keep league less of the worlds most toxic gaming community, but they can only do so much... they reward nice people as much as they can, and punish dicks as much as they can but people are still such assholes. I played Smite, Overwatch and DOTA for a while and when i came back to league (recently) i was astounded how bad this community is. \r\n\r\n**RIOTS LACK OF EFFORT ON PLANNED AND PROMISED CHANGES**\r\nSome people may call me a hypocrite because this kinda goes against my &quot;game changes&quot; paragraph but idrc. Riot has many times promised reworks and changes that they have failed to present to us. One example is the Sion rework, if im not mistaken they promised this in season 1 or 2.... when did it happen? around October of 2014 (late season 4). Another example... the Urgot rework, they promised this for a very long time... yet they kept putting champions in front of him on the update schedule, i think he was the most needed and should have been rushed extremely quickly. A more recent one, is the Akali rework... i really wish that i could site this information but i dont expect people to believe me but there are many threads on reddit saying that riot has confirmed it and some of these are from 7 months ago... Lastly the Evelynn rework, i think we all can agree that Evelynn is in a DESPERATE need for a change, yet riot continues to put more, and more.... and more... champions in front of her on the update schedule. I get that they cant work night and day getting these done but they promise something and tell u when its going to happen but they never go thru with it...\r\n\r\n**Conclusion **\r\nLeague is not fun anymore, for me at least and MANY older players. Im going to finish out the season so i can end in platinum but after that i probably wont touch this game unless they fix it. I have spent $1550 on league and have spent 2,813 hours on league (117 days in total). This game is broken, not in the Overpowered sense, but in the &quot;it needs fixing&quot; sense...","replies":[]}
