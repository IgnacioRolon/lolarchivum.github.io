Plus, in a game where Techies exists, you can't count on exclusively short games anyway.\n\nThis is purely Riot shooting for the fast action angle like HotS decided to go for, except unlike HotS it didn't start that way so it had to develop in that direction over time in front of everyone who saw the change. I don't buy the \"It's all for China!\" angle, or DotA2 wouldn't be popular there. This just looks like blaming a common bad guy nobody will try to defend, honestly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LightswornLance","date":"2019-11-23T22:15:00.134+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I wouldnt mind this so my stupid soloque teammates would realize elder is actually worth doing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"boricCentaur1","date":"2019-11-24T03:10:06.643+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":7,"body":"A auto win are you trolling? Do you actually understand how much 20% is late game since it's not a auto win, BARON IS STILL BETTER if you want to close games out.\n\nLike damage sounds good but there you realize that's all it is basically. \n\nLike maybe try think before making a post. Since it's not a auto win unless the enemy is afk.","replies":[{"poster":"Zonetoxic002","date":"2019-11-24T03:54:32.574+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You must be a tank player because with all the damage in the game right now everyone but a tank player gets 2-3 shot late game with elder that turns it into 2 shot and any assassin 1 shot","replies":[{"poster":"boricCentaur1","date":"2019-11-24T04:09:54.516+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"LOL tanks get hit the hardest wtf. Yeah so you people don't actually understand how numbers work got it.\n\nSo most non tank champions die at around 400 to 500 hp that isn't lot, think about how many times you survived a late game fight with less then 500 hp as a mage since you don't. Most adcs auto for a higher amount that late. \n\nIt's is bad but it's not op or a auto win at all. You can win a team fight vs a team with the buff.\n\nAlso if you are getting one shot my a assassin more then 30 mins in you're afk. \n\nLike you really don't seem to have a actually understanding of the game.\n\nNot to mention you can zhonya's it, or kindred ult stops it. So there is ways around it too. Lot of ad champions get GA making it less useful.\n\nIt's a great buff to give a team a comeback or give a edge on a team fight. But for the most part baron is WAY better at ending since when you are that late and what to end it's most likely because of a hard time pushing not winning team fights.","replies":[{"poster":"Zonetoxic002","date":"2019-11-25T01:51:37.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your GA means shit when you explode once at 20% and the again after you respawn with 20% health with 1 auto.  Not to mention its a GREAT comeback mechanic cause now you dont actually have to fight your way back into the game you can just steal it and two shot the entire enemy team to win..... and your telling me I know nothing about the game get a life.  The ONLY thing this is intended for is professional play thats all.  and if you believe any other way your blind.  Solo Q is just that solo Q teams dont work together in solo Q so dragons should NEVER have as much impact in a game as they do.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
