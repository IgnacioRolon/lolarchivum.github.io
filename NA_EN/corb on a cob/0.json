I live in Washington state and normally hover around 55 ping.  But about 6 months ago my ping started to vary from game to game. Some games i would get a constant 55 ping, while others I was stuck with 67-70 ping. I always check to see if I have something running the background that would be causing the high ping but there never is.\r\n\r\nI was okay with dealing with the 67 ping, but 85 ping is the last straw for me. I have no idea what is causing this. I have also checked my download speed and it is still very high at 200mbps. I can't think of anything to do so if anyone has anyone has any insight on this please let me know. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-02T18:12:31.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that's a bit higher, and sucks that it's been consistent.  :/  Your network could just be going through some wear and tear, or your ISP might not be routing you to the game server properly.  These can all be factors regardless of having a great internet speed, it won't do much good if there are snags getting in the way.  Try out the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and rule out some possibilities.  Test it in a custom game, and let me know if you run into recurring problems.","replies":[{"poster":"corb on a cob","date":"2017-12-02T19:05:15.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have tried all the steps I can from your link, but sadly nothing worked.
