As long as you keep winning more than you lose, your MMR will rise to the point that the system will start evening out your earned/lost LP per game.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I don't think is a true statement. Your MMR gains/losses depend on what side you're playing. Blue is the lower average MMR team, purple is higher. If you win as purple you're \"expected\" to win and gain less MMR than you would have if you were blue. Likewise, a loss on blue causes you to lose more MMR. Assuming that premise is correct, you could win more than 50% of your games and go down in MMR:\n\nLet X be the amount of MMR you gain from winning on purple where X > 0\n\nLet X+ε be the amount of MMR you lose from losing on purple where ε > 0\n\nLet N be the number of games played where N > 0 and N is odd.\n\nLet W be the number of wins on purple and L be the number of losses on purple where:\n\nW = N / 2 + 0.5\n\nL = N / 2 - 0.5\n\nThus the MMR gained is:\n\nδMMR = W*X - L*(X+ε)\n\nδMMR = (N/2+0.5)*X - (N/2-0.5)*(X+ε)\n\nδMMR = X + 0.5ε - N*ε/2\n\nThus the following statement is true:\n\n2X/ε + ε < N implies δMMR < 0\n\nSince X and ε are constant while N is not, the above statement will eventually be true for sufficiently large values of N. **This means that you are winning more than half your games and going down in MMR**.\n\n---\n\nBut wait, that's an unrealistic scenario! You don't really play all purple games so that doesn't work. Except the argument can be extended to every day scenarios. Here's that proof:\n\nLet X be the amount of MMR you gain from winning on purple and lose from losing on blue where X > 0\n\nLet X+ε be the amount of MMR you lose from losing on purple and gain from winning on blue where ε > 0\n\nLet Wp be the number of wins on purple\n\nLet Lp be the number of losses on purple\n\nLet Wb be the number of wins on blue\n\nLet Lb be the number of losses on blue\n\nThus the MMR gained is:\n\nδMMR = Wp*X - Lp*(x+ε) + Wb*(x+ε) - Lb*(X)\n\nNow let's say Wp = Lp = Wb = Lb. This is saying you have a perfectly even distribution of wins and losses among the sides. Now let's say you play one more game on purple and win it. Thus:\n\nWp - 1 = Lp = Wb = Lb\n\nAt this point:\n\n* You've won more games than you've lost\n* δMMR = X\n\nWhat we want to do now is keep the total number of games won and lost the same while reducing δMMR. We can do this by either taking a win out of blue side wins (Wb) and into purple side wins (Wp) or by taking a loss out blue side losses (Lb) and into purple side losses (Lp). Doing so will subtract ε from δMMR, represented by:\n\nδMMR = X - ε*S where S is the number of times you've \"shifted\" a win or loss.\n\nX/ε < S implies δMMR < 0\n\nSo we just need to do this enough times so that X/ε < S. But we have to be certain that we actually can do this enough times:\n\nIn the scenario where Wb = 0 or Lb = 0 we can increment all counters by 1. The MMR gained by the purple side win will cancel with the blue side loss, and the MMR gained by the blue side win will cancel with the purple side loss. As a result of the 4 new games your MMR hasn't changed. Now we can shift the distribution of wins, hit 0, add 4 more games, rinse and repeat.\n\nAgain, this means that **your MMR gains are negative, even though you've still won more games than lost.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"vC48YNoGbJ","date":"2015-03-28T23:29:17.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dArtagnan,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=JkE1ZAgU,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-27T21:23:24.538+0000)\n>\n> Hello FunboxTha3rd!\n> \n> First, before we talk about anything else, I want to be clear that OP.GG is a 3rd party site and may not always have the most reliable information.

I know this first hand. All you can do is play your best, as you improve so will your chances to win and therefore your MMR will rise.\n\nSome additional advice from an extremely seasoned veteran of the current MMR system... don't even think about MMR. You cant see it, you cant calculate it, and it is pointless to try (trust me, I have tried). The best way to go about it is out of sight out of mind. The less you think about MMR and even LP gains and losses the better you will do.\n\nThings to keep in mind as you play:\n- There will always be 1 team that wins and 1 that losses, sometimes your team wins and sometimes it doesn't. just how it is.\n- Try not to compare yourself to others, the more you do the more frustrated you will get.\n- Play the way you like to play, but still be flexible. try to have a few different champs that fill each of the roles a team needs so when the team needs something you are ready to fill in the gap.\n- Don't try to play like the pros. learn what you can from replays and streams but don't try to imitate them, it usually just ends badly. the pros are pros and you are you. do what you are good at, not what they are good at.\n- And the most important tip i can give is HAVE FUN! if you are not having fun playing ranked, stop. play a different game mode, take a break, do what you have to do so that you can enjoy the game, not get angry at it.\n\nOn a side note, those gains and losses are pretty common once you have \"normalized\" (played enough ranked games for the system to be able to evaluate what your current skill level is). also those websites that say they can tell you your MMR are all full of crap, do not even bother going to them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yo soy Kevin","date":"2015-03-28T03:12:16.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe 19 wins is not enough for your super awesome potential :D\nkeep going","replies":[]}]}
