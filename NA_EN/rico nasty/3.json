I have a long ways to go before getting really good at this game.\r\nBut since I do so well in normals, I thought hey, why not go to a ranked game?\r\nBut I ALWAYS lose in ranked games. My scores are atrocious, sometimes I feed, sometimes other people feed, and I usually lose lane/my jungle.\r\nCan someone PLEASE give me tips apart from warding, runes, masteries etc? I know all the obvious stuff.\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-05-17T23:39:12.384+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can solve your issue right now. You normal MMR is really bad so you are playing against below average players. This is letting you think you are decent.\n\nThe way i can tell your MMR is bad is that you have 0 completed rune pages, and claim to win games still. \n\nYour already in bronze so it does not matter if you continue in ranked. You need to rush basic runes pages if you want to actually advance though.","replies":[{"poster":"Rico Nasty","date":"2015-05-18T00:06:38.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh?

In ranked i recommend you get some easy champions to play so that it makes it easier on you, Annie, Pantheon, Kayle, Garen (you get the picture) allows you to think more about what you gotta do instead of skill shots and what not. Overall tips, Obj>farm>kills   12 cs=1 kill try to farm the best you can. try not to die over 3 times a game it will help you but dont play too passive sometimes its okay to die for the team. Learn how to trade in lane (get advntge over killing their mana or their health) everything else i would have to go in depth and talk about for you to fully understand but i can tell you it works  http://gyazo.com/17d7e9eb91866a10d2e37a54dde00481","replies":[{"poster":"Rico Nasty","date":"2015-05-18T00:07:30.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-05-18T15:53:20.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"first of all you shouldnt begin playing ranked until you have a few hundred wins in normals. it takes a long while to understand all the ins and outs of how to properly play league. Runes and Masteries are important.  A simple AP page would be ..... these are all greater runes of course ..... Magic penetration Marks, Armor Seals - or health per level Seals, Magic Resist Glyphs - or Magic Resist per level Glyphs, and Ability Power Quintessences. Playing in ranked is more about understanding strategy than it is about endlessly killing enemies like its team deathmatch. I suggest reading some guides on Mobafire. Thatll help you to understand champions and exactly how to use each of them competitively","replies":[{"poster":"Rico Nasty","date":"2015-05-18T20:44:40.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just created an AP rune page, thank you!\nThe thing is, I already have a few hundred wins in normals... and I think I understand most League strategies (but I don't really know).\nBut thanks for the advice!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Live2LetDie","date":"2015-05-18T00:09:32.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Runes and mysteries can all be found with a Google search.
