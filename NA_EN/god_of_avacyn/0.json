It is the type of thing parents tell their children about to scare them into following the rules. &quot;If you don&#039;t eat your broccoli, the Yajadek will come and eat YOU!&quot; Stuff like that. It&#039;s believed to be an urban myth. I was kind of inspired by the Babadook.\n--I picture people referring to this champion not by &quot;Yajadek&quot;, but rather &quot;The Yajadek&quot;, like &quot;The Boogeyman&quot;. I didn&#039;t write The Yajadek every time, but just know that is what I was thinking.\n--Probably pronounced &quot;YAH-hah-deek&quot; ( The J makes an H sound.)\n--Most League of Legends characters generally are referred to as &quot;He&quot; or &quot;She&quot;, but seeing as the Yajadek is neither and is a mysterious unnamed monster, I refer to it as &quot;it&quot;.\n-- Here is an idea of what I picture when I think of The Yajadek. The picture is of a Boneclaw from the Dungeons and Dragons Monster Manual.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/iv4EZLn.png?noredirect\n\n**In Game**\n--Yajadek is a melee assasin-type figure, slightly tankier than other assassins. It is best suited for top lane due to It's immense 1 on 1 fighting abilities. \n--Early game, Yajadek is pretty good, due to It's abilities to scare the enemy into not engaging in early 1 on 1's.\n--Late game, Yajadek can be a formidable foe when under pressure. If you are in an all out 5v5 fight, then Yajadek can be a nuisance, doing tons of damage when It's passive is procked. \n\n---\n**Passive: Aura of Terror.**\n--When Yajadek is damaged by an enemy champion, it gains a stack of Terror. Stacks last for 4 or 5 seconds. DPS abilities, naturally, cannot give him more than one stack. Upon reaching 5 stacks, Yajadek activates Aura of Terror, lasting for 6 seconds or so. As long as Aura of Terror is active, it has empowered abilities.\n--After Aura of Terror is activated, his passive goes on a short cooldown, during which it cannot gain any stacks of Terror.\n\n_The whole idea here is that Yajadek is a terrifying being, so naturally, other people are afraid to approach him. This should be emulated in his gameplay through his kit. People either have to poke him down very slowly, or be absolutely confident they are going to win against him in a trade to go in._\n\n\n---\n**Q: Violent Nightmare.**\n--After a very short channeling period, Yajadek sends out a could of Violent Nightmares in a skillshot, stopping and damaging the first enemy hit.\n--This ability has a very long cooldown, but whenever it gains stacks of Terror, it lowers the cooldown. The cooldown is also lowered when it performs basic attacks against enemy champions, kills an enemy unit, or casts another spell. If Violent Nightmares either kills an enemy unit or hits an enemy Champion, then the cooldown will be lower than normal.\n--Aura of Terror bonus: Violent Nightmare will make the target Feared for a short duration. It also can hit multiple enemies.\n\n_This ability is It's standard poke ability, but it has to be very active in order to keep using it and poking with it. If you can afford to be very aggressive during laning phase, then the ability can snowball the pressure put on the enemy laner. The Fear is also a great crowd control effect because when enemies realize their blunder and are trying to run away from an engage, you can fear them for longer than a normal ability might allow. This highly encourages people to just turn away and flee._\n\n\n---\n**W: Monstrous Markings**\n--Yajadek creates a fiendish rune on the ground near him. After a second or two, the rune becomes invisible. The rune can last for 1 minute or somewhere around there. Yajadek can only have one rune at a time, so if it casts this ability again, his previous rune is destroyed. The rune does NOT grant vision, and you can&#039;t place it near turrets.\n--If Yajadek clicks on the rune before it casts a spell, Yajadek can cast it as if the rune was himself, even if it is nowhere near it. Unlike Zed&#039;s shadow, only one ability is cast here.\n--Once you cast a spell from the rune, it lasts a few more seconds, in which you can cast more spells from it, but then the rune is destroyed. It kind of is a one-time use scenario. Leveling this ability probably increases the range at which you can cast it and decreases the mana cost, and possibly the number of seconds the rune persists before it is destroyed after you use it.\n--Aura of Terror: Any spell cast using the rune will deal a certain percentage more damage, possibly even as much as 100% more.\n\n_This ability is all about mind games with your opponents. If you strategically place your rune, you can last hit them if they are low, even when they thought they were safe. This also makes terror capacitor extra scary because they could end up taking a bunch more damage if they head in the wrong place. Mainly, this can be very effective if you strategically place your rune, and it also adds to the whole &quot;your opponent is scared&quot; style that this Champion&#039;s play style is built around. It also combos phenomenally with his ultimate. Make sure, if your rune is in the fog of war, to ward near it, because it will be pretty useless if you don&#039;t._\n\n\n---\n**E: Torture's Embrace**\n--Yajadek lashes out with his claws in a cone in front of him. Enemies struck are damaged and Rended for a short duration. Yajadek&#039;s basic attacks and Q will deal more damage to Rended targets, as well as slow them. \n--Aura of Terror: When Aura of Terror is active, all Rended targets will take some pretty heavy DPS.\n\n_I see this as his main source of Crowd Control. The Fear on his Q is great and all, but that is only if enemies are actively attacking him. To chase people down, this is the ability it will use. You can also get some pretty heavy damage with your E-Q combo, which can be used to secure kills when people who are very low walk near your fiendish rune. The animation may be a bit strange when cast using the rune, because it will seemingly be claws appearing out of nowhere. It could, however, also be a cool animation._\n\n\n---\n**R: Call of the Boogeyman.**\n--Yajadek marks a target near him. After a period of time, maybe 3-4 seconds, it will leap to his marked target, dealing heavy damage. (During the 3 second channel, it is free to move, attack, etc). You CANNOT cancel this ability once you have marked a target.\n--Aura of Terror: No special bonus, but when Aura of Terror is activated when Call of the Boogeyman is on cooldown, then the cooldown is significantly lowered.\n\n_This ability has the potential to be insanely terrifying and really good. If a target ghosts to get away from you, or you are predicting that they will flash over a wall, you can mark them to ensure that they will not escape those three seconds later. The downside is if you mark an enemy, they can run toward a tower or a safe place, and there is nothing you can do about the fact that you will jump to them. This ability can have pretty much a global range when paired with your W, as you can imagine. The lowered cooldown on his ultimate is the most effective incentive here not to trigger his Aura of Terror._\n\n\n---\n**Lore**\nRuneterra is home to many diverse cultures and beliefs, with many different lifestyles, architecture, and language. The diversity in religion leads to many different fascinating legends about life after death, a higher power, and the origins of life. Many fascinating ones, but none of them thought to be true. Such was the case for the old Nursery Rhyme about the Yajadek, a monster that hid in the shadows and kidnapped naughty children. that was sung to children in many small towns in order to keep them on their toes and to try and keep them from causing too much trouble. The rhyme goes like this:\n\nThe windows are shut, the dog doth snore\nThe fire is out, shut firm is the door.\nThe house was all quiet at this time of night,\nYet dangers are lurking just out of sight.\nFor young Sammie, the child, restless is he,\nAnd decides to exit his bed and be free.\nThe mischievous child, how would he know?\nNight creatures are lurking outside in the snow.\nA scrape &#039;gainst the door, a whoosh of cold air,\nOf putrid flesh doth the air reek,\nAnd a voice can be heard:\nYajadek!\nYajadek!\nYajadek!\n\nMany other verses are written, each ending with the scrape &quot;&#039;gainst the door&quot; passage. Some families recite it to their children nightly to keep them from waking them up at midnight, so they can finally get some good rest. Yet there are always rebellious children, aren&#039;t there? Such was the case of a young boy named Lansel. Unbeknownst to Lancel&#039;s parents, he was tainted from birth with a powerful magic few have. Had he been more careful, he could have grown up to be a great sorcerer. However, he wanted nothing more for his father to stop harrasing him with stories of strange monsters in the dark. Every night he wished for his father&#039;s stories to backfire: for this monster to come after his Dad and not him.\n\n One of the nights, after his father had whipped him, he got more mad than he had ever been in his life. This anger unleashed the magical power he had inside of him, and little did he know, his wish was about to come true. That night, while he was asleep, the door creaked open, smelling of putrid flesh, and in stepped the live incarnation of The Yajadek. Yet the Yajadek did not turn to kill the father, no, he did what he did best, he went after the naughty child.\n\nThat night, Lancel was awoken by an eerie sound above him. He looked up to see a twisted symbol of a monster with long claws, with a toddler in its mouth, yet it quickly dissappeared, and Lancel thought he must have been dreaming. Yet then he heard a strange sound again, an eerie sound that seemed to be originating from his own ears. Just as he heard it, right from where Lancel had thought he had seen a strange image, The Yajadek emerged, and slaughered Lancel.\n\nNow, The Yajadek is very much alive, unbeknownst to most of Runeterra. Not thinking, not feeling. It&#039;s only purpose is to cull out the children it believes deserve to die.\n\n---\nThanks for reading folks!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Raxistaicho","date":"2016-11-18T02:25:04.017+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, ccos review for you!\n\nHmm, tanky assassin? I'm interested to see how this gets pulled off. \n\nPassive: The issue with this passive is that while it's potentially fine in 1v1 situations, it's useless in team fights. Unless Yajadek is way tankier than any assassin has a right to be, it'll be dead by the time it's obtained 5 stacks, unless those are coming from a tank or support.\n\nQ: What's meant by \"stopping\" the first enemy hit? Is it stunning? Assassins really SHOULDN'T have cc on their kit, but eh, we'll see after I've looked at the rest of this. It looks potentially spammable if Yajadek remains in the heat of combat. That's generally not a particularly useful thing for an assassin, since assassins just want to dump their combo on a squishy, kill them, then either get out or kill somebody else. Unless Yajadek - again - is tankier than an assassin should be, he won't have the time to reset this skill.\n\nAOE fear on an assassin is insane, but there's that whole \"he'll get blown up\" problem.\n\nW: Not terribly useful depending on the range, as in most situations all this'll really do is let Yajadek cast abilities from another location that isn't likely to be that far from where he is to begin with. \n\nE: It's a pretty simple ability but it's not bad with his Q and attacks, allowing him to chase after an enemy relentlessly. Honestly this is probably his ability that I like most so far.\n\nR: Absolutely useless for an assassin. The whole point of an assassin is to mislead and outplay enemies, this skill which screams for all to see, \"I'll be attacking this guy in a few seconds >D\" just gives the enemy team a very clear window to prepare to kill you. \n\nOkay, so final thoughts? Yajadek's not an assassin. He's some sort of weird cross between a diver and a juggernaut. He lacks burst outside his ultimate but he has strong-looking sustained damage, his engage tool makes his intentions very obvious, and he has to get beat up to achieve full power. \n\nWhat I DO like about his kit is that, aside from his W which is kind of random, his whole kit just reeks of this sort of impending monster that's going to chase you down and murder you and your attempts to fight back just make him stronger. Kinda like Nocturne but slower and more torturous in his methods. I suggest you drop the notion of him being an assassin and advertise him more as a diver, and make a new W (ideally something with a defensive angle to it, as he lacks built-in survivability), and you'll definitely be in business for a better concept :) Good luck!\n\nOne thing though, you definitely need to try to make up some numbers for your kit. Try looking at similar champs and get a feel for what makes them balanced or not.\n\nJust off the top of my head:\n\nQ - Try looking toward Nocturne's Q, but remember that the damage should be lowered since Yajadek's can cc you.\nE - Maybe something like Rengar's new Q. Not sure what to suggest you look at for the damage increase, try reading up on this: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Damage_modifier\nR - Reminds me of Vi's ult, maybe look at that for a start. You would definitely want to make it a bit stronger since Yajadek lacks cc and his comes with a delay.\n\nLore:\n\n... Jeez @.@ that was legitimately creepy. Short but it was a pretty good read and it actually got me to shudder. I didn't know what to expect but reading about a monster that deliberately targets children is a bit alarming! Nice job on the lore. I think ^^;\n\nHey, since I gave you a review, could you do me a favor and review my concept?\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/Nf7AW1qn-champion-concept-lyra-the-flashing-sword-witch\n\nThanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrugsForRobots","date":"2016-11-16T20:04:31.384+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll review this guy soon, I've only just skimmed through his abilities, but just let me say: I look at this guy and the idea of the 'stealth juggernaut' comes to mind.

I'd definitely be interesting to see Riot's take on the idea and what they do to make it their own - more belonging to the League universe. I like the idea of its long hands / claws, and of its tankier-than-other-assassins feeling, but I really, really want this guy to do something with invisibility (beyond just having an invisible trap.)\n\nI don't like this passive for a number of reasons, but don't take it to heart. I'm not a fan of stacks as a form of design, and the stacks of Terror doesn't appear to do anything on their own. Their only purpose is to act as a trigger for his Aura of Terror, which isn't its own real effect either, being  some bonuses to his other abilities.\n\nYajadek's Q and E are OK. They're functional but IMHO, I don't think they create the _feeling_ of an assassin. They do damage, but I don't think they really let him outplay or outsmart his opponents.\n\nBut then we come to his W, and while I think you're onto something here, what you have isn't good and I think I can prove it isn't good.\n\n* It's invisible, which makes it a trap, but it can't be 'popped' or 'sprung'. Enemies can walk all over it, it'll still remain there.\n* It doesn't grant sight, thus requiring your champion to resort to committing a ward just to be able to use the staple ability of the kit (I get the feeling you wanted this to be his unique ability?) or limiting it's casting location to your teams ward covered areas.\n* It doesn't interact with enemy champions at all.\n* It doesn't do anything on its own.\n\nI'm also skeptical about the targeting required when he clicks his Mark. He clicks it and then sees the targeting reticle coming off of the Mark instead of himself?\n\nI get that he can use it to snag some kills from miles away, but it just seems really awkward and kinda useless. Maybe I'm missing something, but if what I see is accurate it's like his entire kit falls apart for me. \n\nHe doesn't really have a way to gank, outplay, or assassinate anyone. He can definitely get picks if your enemy facechecks a brush with him inside, and harass / poke / bully with the extended range his W gives his Q and E, and with his R if he ever gets ahead he can stay ahead thanks to his delayed Vi ultimate. I think it's so strange to have this Mark which seems to encourage a sort of poking / harassing playstyle, yet on the other hand, we need him to be fighting enemies so he can get his Aura of Terror going and make the most of his E and basic attacks. The R, by it's very nature, its function, is basically saying ignore your W and that strategy / gameplay entirely. Maybe that's what you were going for?... But isn't that the problem with champs like Jayce and Nidalee? Extreme range on their poke, combined with their ability to become a melee diver at will!\n\nIDK, this is all just my 2 cents. I like the core idea behind Yajadek, but in terms of kit design I would've gone another direction. No hard feelings.\n\nGL in the CCOS!\n\n{{champion:35}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Osamu Tezuka","date":"2016-11-16T08:35:10.693+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yajadek is a pretty interesting concept. It fills in a spot that kinda sorta is already lived in by Nocturne, but is just unique enough to be different than the shadow demon, which is impressive.\n\nYour lore is impressively well done. I like that you took the effort to make a nursery rhyme and really fleshed out your champ's identity, so that's pretty solid. On to your abilities.\n\nPassive - Interesting concept, but I'm not sure how a player would feel about basically needing to take damage to be at their character's strongest. I can see how strong this could be early to mid, but in the late game? You'd be dead before you got all your stacks. It's different for characters like Olaf, because he has a way to sustain himself in a fight where he takes a lot of damage and Olaf is sorta meant to take damage anyways. I'm also not sure how well this fits with your lore and character overall. I get that you want to make people wary to hit Yajadek, but if Yajadek is too weak to respond even when it's at full stacks, what's the point? Aura of Terror has to have some sort of way to gain back the damage he took or mitigate it in some way to really be effective, or just change the way you gain stacks.\n\nQ - Solid, but I have some concerns. An AoE line-skillshot fear is pretty insanely strong. Pretty much every fear that isn't associated with an ultimate is single target. On top of that, having the cooldown (even if it's long) reduced by autoattacks? That's a bit much. I can't really tell how strong/overpowered that would be without numbers, though, so I'll leave that at that.\n\nW - An interesting concept. Sort of reminds me of Illaoi's tentacles and obviously Zed's shadow clone, but it's different enough to not step on any toes. I've got... pretty much no complaints about this one. I like the idea you have here, but I do need to know: How does it interact with Yajadek's R?\n\nE - Also, another good ability. I can't find any problems straight up with it, but that might be because of the lack of numbers. Damage and cooldowns could really change how I, and other people, consider your champion. Again, I'm more curious than I am concerned. Does Rend also apply to allied champion's attacks?\n\nR - It's simple, but fitting for your character. I assume that Yajadek can be attacked/affected by CC while in it pouncing animation? Otherwise, I can't really think of any way to counter this ultimate, which would be a little lame. But that might be biased, as I'm not the greatest fan of instant, targeted gap-closers. (Old Talon upsets me, but Warwick just makes me sad to look at)\n\nOverall, Yajadek has a solid kit all around save for a few concerns about balance that I had. The passive is maybe a little on the weaker side (I can only imagine how sad watching a Yajadek getting run down by Jhin/literally any high burst champion would be). For the rest, I'd seriously suggest adding numbers such as damage and cooldown to your abilities. Those really help readers understand your character at a deeper level. And finally, you've gotta settle on what your abilities do. Just some clarification on what exactly they'd do if Yajadek were in the game, basically, get rid of all your \"maybe\" and \"probably\"'s. \n\nOtherwise, good job! Good luck in the CCOS.\n\n(P.S.
