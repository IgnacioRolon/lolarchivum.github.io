But I wan&#039;t to know what is closest to Talons actual look, his splash art, his ingame model or this identikit? Now his splash art shows him off as a pretty &quot;normal&quot; guy (at least someone that wouldn&#039;t look too out of place without his cape and hood) at around the age of 20-30. His ingame model is pretty similiar but he looks a bit younger imo around the age of 16-20. And the identikit has a weird doublechin and makes him look like a 50 year old grunt that should probably eat a bit more (I don&#039;t know, he looks like he&#039;s undernourished). Now, what is closest to him? I mean the last one is just a identikit and that different look could have just put onto it to make it more identikitish (god that word) but I just want to know.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-08-22T05:37:22.373+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://dmnskinner.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ns16a.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2016-08-22T08:04:29.884+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Blue Rajah","date":"2016-08-22T13:19:40.601+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You literally made me burst into giggles in bed and I woke up my girlfriend.
