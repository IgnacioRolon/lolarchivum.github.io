I mean all we wanted was a GU and we got an amazing VU with it.\n\n(Also: Since the bilgewater event is gonna be BIG it only makes sense that the only two pirate champs deserve their time to shine as they are underloved, nothing gets people pumped up like a fresh coat of paint on something)\n\n(Final Edit: And, they work in groups to finish these projects so it seems to me that GP was more important with the event tied to him)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-07-07T22:09:02.419+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was literally the second champion to be VU'd, right after Janna. Granted, compared to champs like Pizza Feet Taric and HUEHUEHEUEdakaiser, yes, he was far, FAR better off than they were.  However, if they're going to all this trouble to rework his kit and give him a new passive, E, and visuals to match, then it'd only make sense to throw in a VU, since they're already changing so much.
