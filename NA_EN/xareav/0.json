I&#039;d like to sum them up in a single, hopefully troll-free thread (haha yeah right).\n\n1) There is a serious problem in ARAM w/ the overwhelming advantage that certain pokers (Ziggs, Lux, Xerath, Sona, etc.) have when played well.  This is exasperated by people making smurf accounts and only buying pokers or other ARAM-uber champions.  It is worth noting that having a good tank can often trump this, as this data (courtesy of http://lolbuilder.net/news/aram-champion-distribution shows):\n\nChampion               Win Rate            Play Rate\nSona                        63.21                 1.08              --> POKE, heals, mobility\nHeimerdinger          63.17                 1.62              -->  POKE, stun, turrets\nKog&rsquo;Maw                 62.74                 0.55              --> POKE, ad/ap versatility\nZiggs                        62.32                0.83              --> DEAR GOD THE POKE, why are people rerolling him??\nGalio                        61.56                0.28              --> Ult/counterpoke\nLux                           60.5                  1.34               --> Poke\nSion                         59.16                0.67              --> RAWR\nFiddlesticks            58.55                1.32               --> If you don&#039;t understand this, you won&#039;t understand anything I say.\nMaokai                    57.86               0.42               --> He pokes, he tanks, he dives, he aoe&#039;s... why reroll him?\nVel&rsquo;Koz                    57.83               0.55               --> Poke and ult.  If people learned to use his q it&#039;d be higher.\n\n\n2) There are certainly champions that everyone rerolls in ARAM because of the nature of having a single lane.  In other words, while there are good champs, there are also very bad ones.  You can find lolbuilder&#039;s full list of data at the link below, but in brevity here are the Hall of Shame inductees:\n\nChamps with 45% of lower win rates in ARAM (in order): Eve, Akali, Kha&#039;Zix, LeBlanc (which blows my mind), Rek&#039;Sai, Tristana, Aatrox, Fizz, Elise, Lee Sin\n\nI would note that there is a weak correlation between win and play rates.  This means that a lot of people just \"don&#039;t get\" some of the champs that are the best at ARAM, or are so concerned with getting poke they overlook (reroll/dodge) things like - gasp - counterpoke.  Note that a win rate above 50.00% means that on average, this champ will win in ARAM.  People complain about poke, yet reroll diving tanks and other counter-poke.  Everyone wants to be the hero with the big stats instead of team players, and this means that lots of less glamorous champs with WINNING records don&#039;t get picked.  A few excerpts:\n\nChamp_______________Win Rate______Play Rate___Comment\nYorick________________54.78________.23 \nSejuani_______________50.42________.25________ADC can't get to squishy poker?  Dive/stun/ggez\nNautilus______________52.86_________.26       \nGalio ________________61.56OMG_____.28______This is the fifth highest win rate in ARAM, but no one plays him.\nMaster Yi_____________49.83(wow)_____1.84_____Everyone fears/targets, Yi, but on average he loses.\n\n3) OMG get to the point n00b.  My point is that there really is a problem - ARAM smurfs, poke balance where the pokier team often wins, and champs that simply aren&#039;t balanced around the ARAM concept.  Snowballs are a viable fix for that, HOWEVER there are a few changes I&#039;d recommend to stop them from utterly dominating every aspect of ARAM play the way they do currently.\n\nA)  Range.  I think everyone can agree that Blitzcrank has sufficient range for great openers.  Slightly more range that Blitz would be fine, but current range is dominating gameplay.\n\nB) Cooldown.  20 seconds.  Seriously??  How about 90?  That&#039;s still significantly lower than all other summoner spells, but it stops EVERY SINGLE PLAY from revolving around snowballs.  Now only half of them will.\n\nC) Synergy.  This isn&#039;t so much a new reason as a justification for the previous two.  Blitz, Yi, Katarina, Galio, Malphite... all of the top picks for LotPK have amazing abilities that rely on setting up the perfect moment to use them.  Snowball every 20 seconds takes the skill out of the setup and turns Yi into the faceroll champ people think he is.  \n\n4) Snowball fixes ARAM.  Poke is no longer the only viable option (though data shows it wasn&#039;t before...), and there should be no more GGs at champ selection.  But 20 seconds and 999999 range is turning ARAM into LotPK instead of fixing the problem.\n\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"L4T3NCY","date":"2015-04-30T21:02:22.152+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":14,"body":"Well thought-out feedback that is nice and easy to read. I love it, good work. ^_^ You're right, poke & sustain are certainly King & Queen on the Howling Abyss. It's a function of the map's shape, where there is simply a lack of strategic options or choices.\n\nNot sure I agree on _\"tanks often trumping poke\"_ being necessarily supported by that particular data/link you posted. That data shows the 10 most popular champs all having tons of risk-free poke and/or sustain (an interesting indicator of player perception around strong champs on HA). Your point on some champs being overlooked is true though, Galio is _VERY_ strong on HA (he has excellent poke to go with his anti-poke), yet no-one plays him. o.O It's true that in ARAM games with high MMR players, if it can be dragged out long enough, there's occasionally a situation where the tanks can prevail. Those games are the outliers though. Diving deeper on your posted win-rate link (and win-rate is still a _terrible_ way to measure champion strength, but let's entertain it for this example), **out of the old 'Top 25' champions in ARAM, 23 had amazing poke and/or sustain.** :/\n\nGiven that Mark/Dash has only _just_ been implemented, we'll keep a close eye on it and are not against tweaking it at some point if necessary. :D RE some of your tweak suggestions on the Mark/Dash:\n\n**Range:** The range is intended to be beyond the edge of standard poke, as the spell doesn't reveal its value until activated (damage discussed below). The missile speed is also the slowest in the game (on par with Morgana's Dark Binding yet has a smaller hitbox), so it should be the easiest skillshot in the game to dodge.\n\n**Cooldown:** This is something we're looking at. I don't see it suddenly becoming a 60sec cooldown, but something slightly longer than now could be in order. It currently sits in the space of _\"use this spell when it's off cooldown\"_, and we'd like it to be a little closer to, _\"if we're going to have a fight soonish I might hang onto this\"_. We'll keep an eye on it.\n\n**Damage:** The damage is designed to be negligible. At the moment it seems to be felt the most at early levels, which is something we could always look at. Really though, dealing 200 dmg every 20sec or so @Lv18 (assuming you even hit) is nothing compared to what a Xerath or Ziggs pumps out every 10sec. Any tweak to the cooldown will be a further nerf to that too. The damage is mostly there so you feel is at least does _something_ and can score those swag snowball kills if they're running away on 45HP.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-04-30T21:46:50.460+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=L4T3NCY,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pw1VGG24,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-04-30T21:02:22.152+0000)\n>\n>\n> \n> **Cooldown:** This is something we're looking at.

Don't we see ignite/exhaust/flash being used even with their long window on cooldowns? So why would a poke/engage move that is 1/5th the time of flash be bad? 4 mins of cooldown on flash, I think 60 ATLEAST on dash would be a good move.","replies":[{"poster":"L4T3NCY","date":"2015-04-30T22:21:45.295+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":13,"body":"In short, **reliability**. Regular summoner spells are **reliable**. Ignite _always_ does X dmg, Cleanse _always_ works and you'll _always_ flash to where your cursor is. Mark/Dash has the very real possibility to do _nothing at all_. \n\nObviously once you've tagged someone, the engage is guaranteed (whether or not it was a good idea to go in, not guaranteed :P), but the skillshot had to be landed first. Even then, the telegraphing snowflake and the travel-time on the dash makes it much weaker than a flash, as you can see them coming, giving you reaction time.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-04-30T23:35:19.209+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"I guess I disagree with you on the \"reliable\". When you have 5 enemies (not counting minions) in a small congested map like Howling Abyss, almost all skill shots have a REALLY good chance to land. Add in the insane range on Dash, and a cooldown at max of 20 (less if you hit and take it) it is no longer a \"skill\" to land. Really it seems, over the years that Riot thinks it's hard to land skill shots. I don't agree to the point I believe Riot thinks, but what \"skill\" is there to land in an ARAM? You say reliable ignite (can be healed/shielded through), flash (but you had to put the cursor part in there because of fail flashes). But they have a cost, up to 5 mins on flash. Ignite falls off late game unless it's used to stop a regen champion like Mundo/Vlad. And still it has a 3 and 1/2 min cooldown. Dash has 20.... (at it's worse). \n\nRiot always makes a big point of having strenghts/weaknesses. To the point it has basically joined \"soontm\". But what is the weakness of Dash? If you don't take it, wait another 20 secs and drop it again. No need to worry about \"skill\". It would be like giving Lee Sin no energy cost on his Q. Oh it's a \"skill\" shot. Not when you spam it with out penalty. \n\nIt is rather sad that this went through without any thought other than \"hey they loved it on Poro King\". \n\nI LOVE the idea of Dash. It's great, but has NO counter play in a map the size of HA. It's range needs reduction, and it's cooldown needs to go up.","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-05-01T01:38:27.550+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"*Clap Clap Clap*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DynamiteGazelle","date":"2015-04-30T23:43:31.397+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ok, let's assume that everyone is going to take this spell now (because why wouldn't you?)\nI keep seeing everyone saying \"just dodge it\" or \"it's not reliable because SKILLSHOTZ\"\n\n20 seconds = 3 shots per minute\n\nAverage ARAM game around 20 minutes. 20 x 3 = 60\n\n60 x 5 players = 350 shots\n\nJust dodge 350 long range skillshots per game and you're fine, right?

I can't think of a situation more toxic in League, and I've played against five {{champion:17}} at once.\n\nSnowball is helping topple this toxicity. Is it too powerful? Yes, I think it definitely could use some tweaking. Should it be removed? No, not unless someone can come up with a better solution to the poke/sustain problem. Even if you don't agree with snowballs being the solution, you must agree that poke/sustain champs are a problem that needs to be dealt with in ARAM.","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-05-18T14:15:26.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BastionKross,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pw1VGG24,comment-id=000a0005,timestamp=2015-05-10T13:58:38.444+0000)\n\n> \n> Snowball is helping topple this toxicity.

Dodging it when people can dash to creeps and then engage means there is very little way of playing around it. I know several players who have played mostly ARAM throughout their entire time playing LoL, myself included. Although the summoner is fun with some champions, it totally ruins most AD and AP poke champions games. They are virtually useless on HA now.\n\nARAM was not perfectly balanced before, but it was far more balanced than it is since the introduction of mark/dash. I strongly believe its introduction was done far too hastily. Warmogs/Bloodthirster were just introduced, allowing for more sustain and counter play to poke champs. Why not wait and see the impact of these items without Mark/Dash first.\n\nAs many have said before, the cooldown on Mark/Dash is ludicrous, the range is insane, the damage is higher than what would be reasonable, and the sight given also provides a lot of extra utility vs many champs. Every other worthwhile summoner is either 180s or more. Mark/Dash is currently available 9-15x as often as these summoners. It just breaks the mode, and makes many players who played predominantly ARAM no longer want to play the game.\n\nHonestly, a 90s cooldown would probably still make it the strongest summoner for any melee champion, including flash. Nobody would ever stand for this summoner being introduced to SR, it just completely changes the balance of the game. Please consider that ARAM is a mode many players love to play, and Mark/Dash makes the mode a complete joke at the moment. There is essentially no place for ADCs or APCs in ARAM anymore, brawlers win every time if played properly.","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-05-09T00:11:06.862+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VasheSky","date":"2015-05-05T05:39:26.499+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is my first post, just because I felt that riot just ruined everything I love about ARAM!!!!!!!!!!! \nRaise cd of snowball to 90+ sec!!!!!!!!!!!

If your comp has a poke disadvantage, just start with some defensive items, and use minions. Don't engage yet.\n_[Non-topic related random tips, if I may:\nEnemy team has a Lux? No problem, grab a Rejuvenation Bead, a Null-magic Mantle, Boots and 5 potions. You'll have another Bead worth of levtover money, if you need, plus you'll be already on your way for an Aegis.\nEzreal? Just boots and using minions. His w isn't even worth mentioning.\nNidalee? Again Null Mantle. Even Negatron, for example if you're Diana, or someone else who would benefit from Abyssal Scepter.]_\nPokey comps only work early in the game, let's say pre-6. The main reason they keep being on top after that point is because the opposing team gets discouraged as soon as they hear Nidalee + Ezreal. If a lvl10 Amumu gets poked down by a lvl10 Ezreal, it's not really poke's fault.\nTaking away this by throwing in snowballs is making it impossible for squishy comps to even have a chance early on.\n\nSecond, about the usual \"just dodge it\" that should be the magic solution.\n- Mark/Dash isn't polished enough. Its hitbox is nowhere near its actual size: you get hit by a snowball even when it hasn't touched your character yet.\n- A random enemy Jax, Katarina, Amumu, Trundle, Alistar or whoever you prefer doesn't even need to hit you; dashing to a minion that's near you, and that \"didn't dodge\" the poro toss, is enough for your HPs bar to quickly fade.\n- Following this previous point, if Jax dashes to a minion, jumps on you and stuns you, dodging any eventual incoming snowball from the rest of his team becomes troublesome.\n\nThird; Dashing makes you untargettable until you're sticked to the target champion. If you're an Udyr with Bear stance active, or if you're a spinning Jax (you can wait up to 3 seconds before Dashing, more than enough to have a stun ready as Jax), or simply an Alistar, the moment you've reached your target with Dash, you can instantly CC it. It's nearly impossible to be stopped, before that happens.\nYou can flash out once in 5 minutes from that, but the same threat is already back after 20 seconds. At max.\n\nAs a tank, you don't even need to build Righteous Glory anymore, since you have free engages anyways.\n\n**TL;DR for this:**\n1) Mark/Dash doesn't solve ARAM issues, since it addresses the wrong ones. Free engages from fog of war weren't really needed.\n2) It doesn't take effort to land a snowball, nor it's \"easy\" to try and dodge it.\n3) It offers little to no counterplay.\n\nJust to point it out, my favourite ARAM champion has always been Poppy with Heal + Ghost. If I get a Nidalee or a Sona, I try to give them away, because I don't like their playstyle.\nSo no, I'm not crying because I want \"poke comps to be on top\".\n\nThis spell can work indeed, though. Some things I could suggest:\n- Make Mark/Dash available to a maximum of 1/2 people per team.\n- Fix the Snowball object size / hitbox unmatching. (Please do.)\n- Make it blockable by Spellshields/Walls.\n- Alternatively to this, make it deal no damage and not proc passives. I mean, it's already frustrating enough getting hit by one as MF, atleast leave her her speed bonus to try and die under turret.
