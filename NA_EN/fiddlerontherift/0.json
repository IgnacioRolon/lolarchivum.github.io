Now, to some degree I understand that I can&#039;t have vision everywhere on the map, but I do think that the places that should be warded relentlessly aren&#039;t (tribushes, river bushes, and when you need to crossroad jungle wards). Whenever I say &quot;I have no vision guys, I&#039;ll stay back&quot; or &quot;I thought he was the only one there, I didn&#039;t see anyone because it wasn&#039;t warded,&quot; I get mad ridicule.\r\n\r\nSome respond with &quot;we can&#039;t ward everywhere&quot;,&quot;Why couldn&#039;t you ward it?&quot;, and &quot;Just because I&#039;m support it doesn&#039;t mean I have to get a sightstone item.&quot; These responses have the same answers to them, but I can assure you that these responses aren&#039;t coming from players who try to ward well. \r\n\r\nAnyways, on a scale from 1-10 how critical is it to ward and why?

You'll usually place these in bushes near the lane that are touching the river and other entrances to your lane. You'll probably be placing these down the most often. Sometimes, you'll need to place down wards in the grass within the lane, such as when facing a hook enemy like Blitzcrank or Pyke. These wards will save your life by giving you precious seconds to back up before the jungler hops out of the grass. \n\nThe second, and the most powerful, are deep wards. These wards are placed further along the river or in the enemy jungle. They not only let you know when an enemy is coming to gank, but helps your other teammates track the jungler's movements around the map. These are the ones placed right outside the enemy raptor camp, blue and red buff, or in the bits of grass that skirt the the inside wall on the opposite side of the river from the raptor camp. You need to have lane priority in order to push these safely, i.e., you need to have shoved the wave into the tower before you can go place them, but they let you know when it's safe to push up or when you need to back off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MankeyMadness","date":"2018-12-16T23:36:43.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like a 14.\nSupports kept not buying sightstone so the baked it into your gold item so you HAVE to. \nUnfortunately riot has enabled kids to not buy gold income items by not making it a bannable offense. \nAt least ranked, in normals I dont care much.

You also need to work on paying attention to the minimap and using pings to alert teammates of danger you see that they may not (and pay attention to their pings as well). Lack of vision and tunnelvision is the number one cause of being ganked!\n\nWhile there are optimum spots for dropping wards, if it is very unsafe to get there you may have to compromise and ward where it is safer to do so, and regain control from there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taswell","date":"2018-12-17T14:43:54.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wards win games","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-12-17T14:40:04.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"9, if not a 10.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2018-12-17T14:28:27.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you've no vision near where you are standing then you're putting yourself at risk and your chances of winning at jeopardy.

If you do not have a red down somewhere on the map then get one and put it down somewhere on the map. There are few reasons why you shouldn't have a red ward down.\n\n1. It's late game and you've reached full build, preventing you from purchasing a red ward.\n2. The ward you placed down was destroyed and you are occupied with farming (safely), capturing an objective (safely), or engaged in a fight (you are 100% certain will end in your favor).\n3.

There isn't really a between for them. If they're winning, they are likely to be less humble and fail to recognize any \"master\" (a Hegel reference to freedom and independence). If they're feeding, they fail to ward either because they've given up mentally, lack of opportunity, and/or not knowing where to. The reason why I mention not knowing where to specifically for these champs is because they're usually an easy target and warding can only do so much for them if they warded lane/river bush or the lane tribush. The only benefit I see it for is for your jungler or laner at that point and you might as well become a support/utility-like player until you can get back on your feet. \n\nI think warding the tribush for the lanes is a must with a pink ward, and depending on how your opponent plays you should ward the river brush for camps or the lane brush just to be safer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dope Solo","date":"2018-12-16T23:44:31.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How dumb is your team? ie.

Map awareness + Warding is the way to go.  No need to risk SS trying to ward when your playing from behind, your better off staying in lane and freezing. Move up get tri warded (top,bot) or jungle entrances (side bushes are nice for mid lane, but better river vision is better for teammates and gives more time to react to enemy roam/jungle. Personal preference, take it as an oppenion if you wish.)   How ever dying for vision and losing obj defeats the point. \n\n\nTldr. Ward smart. Spamming wards for vision score is worse then putting out good wards less frequently. Supports should always upgrade to t2, you can skip t3. Rest of team should snag a red ward from time to time as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-16T23:29:50.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes\n\nWarding is a team effort, you ward your bush, then flame your team because they dont ward theirs.\n\nVision is also a strategy game - you can usually guess where someone _could_ be, based on where they are not.
