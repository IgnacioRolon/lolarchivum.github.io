Through every well reasoned post there are 100s of others yelling about some minuscule flavor of the week trend. Its always the short term visions that gets favored and not the long term. \n\nSo only now after several years, the general population are now experiencing what I and a few others have warned about. Almost to the T. \n\n* More and more champs coming out with overloaded kits that are almost impossible to balance without changing how they function \n* Mechanical skill aka muh outplays being favored over decision making and team composition\n* Less item diversity excluding ADCs\n* Balance changes to champs that only revolves around everything but the actual issue (Top lane \"tank\" Viktor being the most obvious atm but thats another topic)\n* Preferring to \"shake up the meta\" forcefully rather than naturally through proper balance\n* Streamlined decisions over personal choice\nect ect\n\nIm not even trying to toot my own horn because I find no joy in doing this.
