He doesn't stealth from across the map to kill you, so proper warding should save you.  You can also stick with your team to reduce his burst.\n\nRengar on the other hand can jump in and stand a decent chance of killing someone even in the middle of their team.  While this grows steadily less effective with teamwork, it remains an extremely toxic focus for a champion.","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-07-12T13:25:39.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Rengar on the other hand can jump in and stand a decent chance of killing someone even in the middle of their team. \n\n{{champion:107}} {{item:3020}} {{item:1402}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3157}} \n\nGroup up.

If he catches you with taste their fear you might lose a chunk of hp but you still get a chance to run as they have to finish what they tarted. Kha's stealth is also short, he might get 2-3 procs per ult but he has to go in and out of them, he doesn't cloak from up the river and come all the way down to the bottom of it to avoid all your goddamn yellow wards. Also kha uses mana which means that he does have to manage it, whereas rengar is manaless AND gets free ferocity stack mechanic that only makes him stronger once he reaches the 5th one. Kha doesn't get free jumps from every bush, he gets ONE jump that is not targeted but a ground placed skillshot, where the compensation is that he gets to reset it on a kill as a reward for doing his job well and only if he upgrades his jump, which is the one thing that really makes him likeable over rengar since he actually has an initiate and escape mechanic. Kha is mechanically more challenging than rengar, but if used well he can duel well which can allow him to outplay rengars.\n\nannoying wise, rengar is top tier annoying due to over-rewarding simplicity.","replies":[{"poster":"Dïo Brandö","date":"2016-07-14T17:59:54.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kha and Rengar are mechanically the same, they both have to utilize their jumps to be the most effective, Rengar has to manage his ferocity when he wants to kill someone, Kha has to manage using his passive when he uses his ult. Rengar can only use his jump once after using his ult unless his target JUST HAPPENS to be in a bush. Rengar only gets a heal if he has 5 ferocity and if he uses that, he loses utility and damage output while Kha gets the heal if he is near the explosion.\n\n They are practically the same champion just with minor differences, which as a Rengar main, what I love about both champions. I am not biasing my opinion in here, I am stating facts about both champions that I love to play. Yes Rengar is annoying, I know this from experience, but coordination from your team, a fed Rengar can be easily dealt with.\n\n*Ik, solo que doesn't have much coordination but still*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dïo Brandö","date":"2016-07-14T17:50:04.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kha does get a practically free heal if he hits something with his w and is near it, and at least Rengar doesn't have a 260% bonus ad ratio on his q...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"karruck","date":"2016-07-12T13:19:37.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:107}}  I do so love squashing bugs.","replies":[]}]}
