Once  Befriended the poro will follow the campion (limit of 10 poros following a single champ. Poros fed after 10 will just disappear.). A Stacking speed buff (fuzzy skates) is granted for each poro.\n- When a champion dies their poros become neutral and scatter. \n- Poros can not enter a fountain, back, teleport, flash, or follow with like-flash abilities. When the bond is broken in this way the poros will stay in place but will become neutral. (hint: break bonds in a safe place to horde poros or transfer them to teammates. ) \n- Another buff may be gained based on the number of poros a single champion has following them. \n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3 - increased xp  and gold per 5\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;        5 - increased armer, magic resist, health regen, and \n   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      mana regen. \n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;       8 - increased AP, AD, attack speed, and CDR. \n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;       10 - increased damage to structures. Basic attacks  \n         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     deal 10% of a structures max health. \n\n -Poros are afraid of turrets receiving turret damage will cause poros to become neutral and scatter. \n- To befriend the Grand Poro a champion must have 3 Befriended Poros. The champion will channel the Grand Poro, feeding him 5 poro snacks. The Grand Poro emits a massive speed buff aura (Cuddle Sled) . If the bond is broken with the Grand Poro he will slowly walk back to his spawn point and cannot be befriended until he returns. \n- Enemy minions will transform into poros befriended by the enemy teem if they cross over into the pasture.\n-  Befriended poros will remain in an enemy pasture if they cross over. The pasture cannot be entered by enemies if the final turrets or all inhibitors are up. \n- The Grand Poro can only enter enemy bases. \n**\nWinning:**\n* The game is won when a team moves 30 poros or the Grand Poro into the enemies pasture.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-10-17T21:04:55.268+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"You had me at 'poro'. :3","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-10-17T21:33:17.406+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You had me at 'poro'. :3\n\n… and then again at the second mention of \"poro\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fires of Justice","date":"2014-10-17T21:11:04.405+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every ten minutes Volibear spawns and goes after Poro Snax","replies":[{"poster":"Space Bum","date":"2014-10-17T21:29:42.905+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Silly bear, snacks are for poros!","replies":[{"poster":"UncensoredAngel","date":"2014-10-17T23:50:53.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"General Keith","date":"2014-10-18T00:06:25.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"replaces dragon","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yaknose","date":"2014-10-17T21:30:47.109+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am very much in favor of poro-based game modes.

I think the bug was that the mustache is coded as a separate object attached to the poro, and that the huge poro was just made invisible rather than removed, and nobody ever thought to add a trigger to make the  mustache become invisible. Few people play ARAM on the PBE, and few people ever manage to get everybody to feed the same poro, so it's easy for the bug to have made it to live. I'm pretty sure it's changed by now though.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hi lm Kalista","date":"2014-10-20T14:56:10.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG PLZ SOMEONE DO THIS","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Lady Loki","date":"2014-10-20T10:49:36.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A Poro game mode...
