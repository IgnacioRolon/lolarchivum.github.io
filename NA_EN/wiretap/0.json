I&#039;m in silver, so it&#039;s whatever.  It gets picked away from him.  He goes Quinn support.  Sure.  Calls for invade, 4 people show up.  He then vaults over wall and feeds 1v5.  When asked why he says, &quot;cause I want penta.&quot;  Then proceeds to starve his adc, not play to win at all, and  not try to win the game at all.  Obviously wont surrender at 20, and for some strange reason neither will our Gnar.  \r\n\r\nWhat can you do in this situation?  It&#039;s not like Riot will ban him, they will just see it as silver fuckery.","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2018-10-07T22:12:48.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:267}} Hi!\n\nUnfortunately I had to edit out the name of the person you are talking about as it violates our [Universal Rules](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/ITFIpNUE) regarding Naming and Shaming. That being said, the best thing you can do in these instances is use the in game reporting system after your match and give a detailed reason that you believe this player has violated the rules.\n\nBelieve me, I can understand frustrations at these types of situations but that is the best way to  handle it. Riot  has lots of tools are their disposal to make accurate calls at whether players are trolling or otherwise in a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Wiretap","date":"2018-10-07T22:28:01.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He has a 5%win rate, and he hasn't been banned yet.
