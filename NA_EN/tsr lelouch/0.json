Please exit the client and re-open it to try again.\"\r\n\r\nI've tried to reinstall LoL and all the recommended set up on the Hextech repair tool. i tried to renew my ip and flush my dns but still the same problem.\r\n\r\nBest Regards.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-08T22:30:56.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This error can happen as a combination of security settings blocking updates and a failed install.  My suggestion here would be to first go over the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure  League is allowed to update without issue.\n\nThen grab the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to perform a clean reinstall and get you to most updated files.  I know you did this already, but this time your permissions will be setup properly!  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
