{"poster":"Elastoid","date":"2014-05-04T10:13:17.885+0000","title":"@RiotRepertoir -- Let's talk about the direction of  the much-needed Nidalee rework","subforum":"Champions & Skins","up_votes":29,"down_votes":7,"body":"[I made this thread in the forums,](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4483347) but I realized your posts on the subject were in the community beta, so maybe that's a better place to try to reach you. Heard you're the one fixing Nidalee. Good, she needs it.\r\n\r\n1) You can't reduce Nidalee's spear's hitbox without drastically nerfing her. Still, her current hitbox/visual ratio cannot stand, because *it frustrates players when they are visually certain they've dodged the spear, but they haven't.* There are a couple threads on this -- [SaltyTeemo4Life's seems to have grown the most traction](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4470144).\r\n\r\nEven if you see Nidalee as perfectly balanced, the least you can do is visually update the spears to reflect how big they are, because there's no philosophical justification for something as frustrating as getting chunked or killed by a Nidalee spear that anyone watching would say you'd dodged.\r\n\r\n2) Nidalee's transform mechanic is archaic. As you observed, she doesn't need to use cougar as part of her regular kill pattern. That's simultaneously lame and sort of necessary, because she can't be a cougar pre-6.\r\n\r\nShe's the first champion created with multiple forms. There are two other champions with a shape-change available only at level 6 -- Quinn and Shyvana. Neither of their new forms grant new abilities, and neither of them are able to use their new form at will. The new form is basically a stronger version of them -- well, Quinn goes melee, but she gets way faster and can do that cool skystrike thing. Anyway, Nidalee's transform isn't like that at all.\r\n\r\nNidalee's transforming seems more on par with Jayce and Elise -- having six abilites and no true ultimate. The problem with that is that Nidalee is the only one of those three who must wait until level 6 to access these abilities. It actually makes little sense for her.\r\n\r\n3) Her non-Javelin Toss abilities could use a look. Soraka has a .35 AP heal on a 20 second cooldown. Nidalee has a .7 AP heal on a 10 second cooldown. Nidalee's traps have an AP ratio comparable to Teemo's traps (.4 on Nidalee, .5 on Teemo) and Nidalee's come with a 40% MR reduction so they can potentially do more damage. The 40% armor shred means that with the cap of 40% armor/MR shred from the offensive mastery and Void Staff/Last Whisper, an enemy will effectively only have 36% of his defensive stats. A tank with 250 armor is reduced to 90 for the sake of actual damage reduction. Ouch.\r\n\r\nThese abilities are so good that most of the time you see Nidalee actually USE her cougar form only when a) she needs to move faster, either to chase or escape, or b) she needs to clear a wave. In combat, the majority of what Nidalee does is in human form. These abilities are also frustrating to play against -- her damage output from her spears alone is comparable to other mages, and yet she has so much utility in Bushwhack and Primal Surge to go along with it.\r\n\r\n4) As an aside, her six abilities have three names. I got killed by a Javelin Toss, not by Javelin Toss/Takedown. She's not even level 6 yet, she didn't use Takedown. What is this?\r\n\r\nWith all that in mind, Nidalee needs a rework, and I'd like to make suggestions regarding the *direction* of that rework.\r\n\r\n1) **Fix her spears.** Give them a new hitbox, and make sure the visual size of the spear matches the actual size of the hitbox. If you do nothing else, you MUST make sure, visually, the spears and the hitbox match. \r\n\r\nThat said, I strongly disagree with the direction you've expressed interest in pursuing with her spears:\r\n\"At this rate, I wouldnâ€™t expect Javelin Toss to undergo fundamental changes to its mechanics. *It will almost assuredly remain a 'deals more damage at greater range' ability,* and it will hurt to get hit by.\"\r\n\r\nWhy is that? That aspect of the spears has a lot of ridiculousness attached to it. \r\n\r\na) It makes little sense in her kit -- if she has to go into melee form to execute, champions are ironically the safest from her the farthest they are away. If she hits a long-range spear to bring you low, her only option to finish the kill is to try to hit another spear.\r\n\r\nb) It makes even less sense in terms of the overall health of the game. Given the projectile speed, the spears that land at max range are the ones that champions have ample time to dodge. Sure, there's the possibility that the champion is rooted or stunned, but there's also a very high instance of spears hitting faraway champions by accident (or, more commonly, hitting champions who THOUGHT they'd dodged them). It also means that in sieges, Nidalee's damage is most insane when she's completely safe, and likely in the fog of war, so the spears are difficult to see coming. You guys nerfed the Jayce poke because having that much damage on an 8 second cooldown was sort of ridiculous. Nidalee's got more damage -- albeit single-target -- on a 6 second cooldown.\r\n\r\nc) It makes even LESS sense in the reality of your game. Sure, I understand the spears are magical, but I'm still not sold on a spear that GAINS momentum after it's thrown. Its power and accuracy would decrease at a distance.\r\n\r\nOverall, having the spears do more damage from farther away is a mechanic that sounds interesting, but in practice brings with it a large set of problems for both the player using it and the player having to adapt to it. Now, it's the single most defining part of Nidalee's identity, which would at first make someone want to avoid changing it. Don't go with that feeling -- why is it that a champion with a shapeshifting mechanic has so much of her identity wrapped up in a single ability in her default human form? Having the focus shifted away from that one ability and moved towards the shapeshifting would be a good thing.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I'd strongly consider making her spears do more damage up close, and have that damage start to decay around 600 range. Sure, this makes her poke less potent (but the game got better when you made Jayce's poke less potent), but it also makes her up-close danger much more significant, as she can chunk you hard while in Pounce range. If the damage doesn't decay too significantly, then her poke will still hurt, she'll just need to get a little get closer to chunk a carry down to 30% health with a single spear, which introduces some counterplay at that stage besides five banshee's veils.\r\n\r\n(Another, less drastic possibility that occurred to me later was having the spear do damage like Elise's Venomous Bite -- doing flat damage, but also percent missing health damage that scales up. If a Nidalee spear did execute damage, then her kill potential is still quite high, but sieging, she won't bring a carry from full health to 1/3.)\r\n\r\n2) **Give her transform at level 1**, like Jayce and Elise. This would be a huge buff all on its own, so it'd require the rebalancing of a real rework -- right now her largest weakness is the lack of wave clear pre-6 -- but it's a good idea. Nidalee was a transform champion made when you guys weren't sure how to do transform champions. Jayce and Elise are just more polished. Take some of the ridiculous power in Nidalee's human form abilities and move it to her Cougar stance, giving her more reason to use her Cougar stance in a prolonged fight.\r\n\r\nThis allows you to move more of her power freely into her cougar form without crippling her as a champion with a dismal pre-6 game. It allows you to shift (har har) the focus of her identity from spearchucker to shapeshifting predator. It also opens up new and exciting avenues of gameplay -- you'd see people taking her into the jungle, where she can be more of a prowling predator.\r\n\r\n3) **Envision her using her full combo**. Primal Surge is great in lane, but when you think about it... she uses a heal in ranged form, then goes to melee? She's more likely to take damage in melee form, isn't she? Jayce and Elise have a nice flow to their combos, where one ability clearly follows the other and you can use all six in a single engage (and most likely get a kill). Nidalee should have something like that, even if for no other reason than \"it's fun.\"\r\n\r\nA better reason, though, is that if she can't use her full combo in one engage, then you have two possible instances. First, where she doesn't NEED her full combo to get a kill (the current state), meaning she's powerful enough to reliably get kills with one or two abilities (in this case, one), and then the rest of her kit is either useless, or extra, added power that does other things for the team. In that case, she's overloaded. The second instance is where she can't get kills without using her full combo (this sometimes happens, when she's underfed), which means she'll have huge difficulty getting solo kills, because her kit is too clunky to fit together. This is what happens when she lands a max range javelin to bring someone low but can't complete the kill because at max range, she's too far away to get to them in cougar form.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2014-05-05T20:49:51.998+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi guys,\n\nUnfortunately, we're not ready to disclose exact details on the rework, but I wanted to drop in and let you know that I've read this and comment on a few things.\n\n> her current hitbox/visual ratio cannot stand, because it frustrates players when they are visually certain they've dodged the spear, but they haven't.\n\nIt's absolutely frustrating when skillshots that appear to have been dodged hit, and we're looking into making this better.

I'm going to go ahead and disagree with you a couple times, though.\n\n> It may seem this way,* but point-blanking a skill shot for huge damage is a far worse variant of gameplay.* \n\nIf we were looking at Nidalee in a vacuum I could maybe agree, but given the number of champions whose point-blank skillshots do lots of damage, I've got to question that. Buckshot does 170% damage up close. Jayce can throw an accelerated Shock Blast at someone within autoattack range without much difficulty. Arcanopulse has a large range but isn't any less of a problem when used at close range. Ditto for Mystic Shot and Zap!. Same goes for Bouncing Bomb. These skills have long ranges, but they're much more difficult to dodge at close range, and they don't lose any damage up close.\n\nSure, if Nidalee's spears did 575 +1.62 AP at close range, that'd be a problem, but the idea isn't to keep the values the same and just invert the area of greatest threat. It's that, since you're reworking her anyway, you might as well change this mechanic to be more agreeable, for all the reasons already mentioned.\n\nIt seems to be a mechanic that's fundamental to the game that damage needs to have a risk/reward element. Having the spears scale up as they travel means Nidalee's damage output is highest when she's least at risk to take damage back. If the damage she's doing is at all significant, that still represents a huge problem, and if it's not significant, then you might as well dump the skill entirely.\n\n> Spears will likely continue to gain damage from range, and I can assure you the damage of the version of Javelin Toss we're playing internally is much more tolerable to the enemy.\n\nI can't stress how strongly I disagree with that decision. I could well be proven wrong, but again, I contend that making Nidalee's damage greater when she's not at risk to take any back is a broken mechanic. It severely limits counterplay and means she can continue to do risk-free damage, while trying to deal with her represents a huge risk to the enemy team.\n\nThe conventional wisdom for dealing with Nidalee now often means finding a way to close on her -- a tall order, given she's usually at the back of her team -- because her damage output is smaller up close. Making spears do more damage close up gives the enemy reason to stay away, but gives her reason to come close. Also, it puts her more in line with other champions who also do more damage when they get closer.\n\nThe other thing I have to mention is this:\n     \n> [Giving her transform at level 1] is something we've given quite a bit of thought to, but haven't come to a firm decision on yet.\n\nGiven the vast power swing that would come with giving her transform at level 1, I would think that's one of the first things you'd have to come to a firm decision on. Giving her transform at level 1 changes so many things, not the least of which is she becomes a viable jungle option, meaning so many aspects of her core gameplay need to be revisited. \n\nIf allowing Nidalee to transform at level 1 is being seriously considered, I really hope you come up with a decision about that first. Obviously, I think it's a good idea -- it seems essential, in fact. If you want her to use both forms interchangeably, you have to budget close to half her power in either form. If she can't transform at level 1, that would mean she'd have to be unbelievably weak pre-6, which is why there's so much power in her human form kit, which is why she's the mess she is now.\n\nSeems to me that merely making the spear damage \"tolerable\" makes this whole rework sound like a numerical nerf that takes a lot of the damage out of Javelin Toss but leaves the core mechanical issue still very much alive, which doesn't seem like it'd make anyone happy. The Nidalee players would be upset that her damage was nerfed, and those playing against her would have the same problem that they can't get to her to stop her max-range spears -- only now, it's less of a problem unless she's fed.","replies":[{"poster":"Sagee Prime","date":"2014-05-08T16:40:34.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> If we were looking at Nidalee in a vacuum I could maybe agree, but given the number of champions whose point-blank skillshots do lots of damage, I've got to question that.

Nidalee's Javelin Toss at max range can do damage equal to her entire cougar combo.\n\nJust imagine that Nidalee lands a 575 damage Q and then jumps in as a cougar hitting pounce and swipe for a combined 225 and 300 damage and finishing off with takedown for close to 600 damage.  That is about 1700 damage that Nidalee just pulled off in about 2-3 seconds worth of time and that is if she has 0 AP or bonus AD.  There is considerably less counterplay in that imo and it makes her much harder to balance out.

Long Range Damage Compositions will counter this and damage resistance will in turn, counter LRDC. it is not particularly problematic of the champion. applying disadvantages to any champion while they are effective against the meta becomes particularly problematic when they are no longer effective in the meta they are now at a pronounced disadvantage overall.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-05-06T07:42:43.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">    Her non-Javelin Toss abilities could use a look\n\n>Agreed.

Also - the 40%pen+vision onthe traps need a serious shift, free voidstaff+last whisper is just way to strong and disallows tanks to clean up traps for their team (or renders them unable to engage vs nidas siege for another 8sec after stepping in a trap once).\n\nAlso:\n\n\n\n>    Give her transform at level 1\n\n>This is something we've given quite a bit of thought to, but haven't come to a firm decision on yet.\n\nI think allowing her to have catform at lvl 1 would be the most important thing for a sucessful rework, as it smoothens out her powercurve bigtime. Right now thereÂ´s almost no melee that can survive an all in at lvl 6/11 vs nid, as her basedmg on cougarform is ridiculously high at those lvls, so youÂ´re even punished for closing the gap 1v1. And as her ultimate works exactly the same as Elise or Jayce thereÂ´s no reason to make her wait till lvl 6 at all (other than some false sense of nostalgic for her outdated design).\n\n\n\n>    That aspect of the spears has a lot of ridiculousness attached to it.\n\n>It may seem this way, but point-blanking a skill shot for huge damage is a far worse variant of gameplay.

The stated counterplay is \"dodge the spears,\" but right now that's hard to do, since the spear doesn't match the hitbox.\n>Especially, I think the spear should have two hitboxes: one (half the current width) straight down the center of the spear, does the current damage. The other, along each side of the spear, 1/4 width, does 1/2 damage. The effect: **if the spear only grazes you, it only does half damage.** I think this makes sense both gameplsy-wise (you should be rewarded for partially dodging the spear, but if you get head-on nailed, that's your fault; at the same time nid doesn't feel useless because she can never land spears (like would happen if you *just* reduced the hitbox. It also makes sense intuitively: if a spear doesn't hit you head-on, it's not going to hurt as much.\n\nI think you could just make that change, and nid would stop being toxic, and you could put some power back into her ult (give her back bonus defensive stats in cougar form! You want to encourage nid to go melee!). However, if we're assuming she needs more changes, I'll continue to address your other points.\n\nI'll talk a little more about spears, and address your last points, at the end of this reply.\n\n2) I agree with you here. Because nid doesn't have a pre-6 ultimate, her human form abilities (especially heal) need to be strong enough for her to survive in lane. This means that once she gets her ultimate, her human form abilities are still strong. Nid is squishy, so going cougar for anything other than mobility and executes is just too risky.\n>Giving her a lvl 1 ult would allow you to give small nerfs to her human form abilities, specifically heal, and especially if Riot gives her back the MR/AR in cougar form (which they should).\n\n3) Here's where I disagree with you. First, the shroom comparison.\n>Let's be clear here: Teemo shrooms deal double the base damage of a nidalee trap and, most importantly, *their damage is not why they hit like a truck, anyway*. They hit like a truck because they slow and deal DoT, and there's this pretty mask that Teemo likes to buy..  Furthermore, though the shroom restock CD is higher than the trap cd, teemo can store 3 at once (teemo doesn't have to spam traps on cooldown or risk them going to waste), and Shrooms last on the map for 10 minutes where traps last for only 4. Finally, traps are visible!\n\nSecond, the Soraka comparison\n\n>Soraka's heal CD is reduced by 2 each time she hits an enemy with starcall (once per starcall). So Soraka's heal has a similar in-combat cooldown to nid's. Soraka's base heal is 25 lower than nid's at max rank, but is 1% more powerful for each 2% of her target's missing hp, her heal can actually have up to 100 more base and only 25% less AP ratio than Nid's (meaning: they heal for the same at 400 AP each). This means that Soraka heal can be useful even if she builds tanky (this is also due to the rest of her kit), but in order for Nid to be useful she needs to build full AP. This means she's still going to get popped in a fight, where raka will stick around to continue healing people. Finally, Soraka's also gives a crap ton of armor. These things all combine to mean that nid's heal is better out of combat, during seiges, but raka's is better in combat.\n\nI need to end my post here because I'm hitting a character limit, but I'll continue in a reply.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-05-04T15:20:12.328+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1b) I think nid's spear is core to her identity for two reasons: because it's her bread-and-butter skill, and because it's the only super-long-range skillshot that does more damage with distance (Jinx's ult doesn't count; it's not spammable, and it is an execute). I think it is a necessity to stay true to this identity - look at the response to the skarner rework, which failed to do this. So the better question, I think, is to look at \n*how we can keep this identity while making nid healthy.* I think it should work like this (I'll put in fake numbers, because it's easier to read that way, but obviously the numbers would need to be tweaked, probably nerfed):\n\n* Nid's spear deals 150 (+ 35% AP) damage, which increases up to 300 (+ 100% AP) at max range.\n* When the spear hits, it applies a mark to its target for 5 seconds.\n* When nid is in cougar form and uses takedown on a marked target, it detonates to deal an additional 500 (+ 150% AP) (- damage dealt by spear, before resistances) magic damage.

That said, Nidalee can place her traps at 900 range away, they can hit multiple champions, and they shred armor and magic resist. That means during a siege, Nidalee can throw a trap from far away to eat the enemy's armor and MR. Teemo's traps can do damage from Liandry's sure, but building MR counters that. Nidalee's traps take 40% of your MR off the top. If she has void staff, and Teemo has Liandry's and Sorc shoes, then with 250 MR, Teemo's traps will damage you as if you had 220 MR, and do 31% damage to you. Nidalee's traps will damage you as if you had 90 MR, and do 53% damage to you. And she can do that at 900 range.\n\n2) It's true that Soraka gives armor, but Nidalee gives attack speed. Soraka's heal scales off her passive, but even with that, healing a teammate with 3 health left, it does only 52% of her AP -- still much less than Nidalee's. Starcall has a 2.5 second cooldown, meaning in 10 seconds she can cast it four times. In ideal circumstances (successfully hitting enemy champions), she's reduced its cooldown by 40% (8 seconds). In other words, in ideal circumstances, she can *almost* heal as often as Nidalee (for as much as 52% of her AP -- about 3/4 of what Nidalee can heal). Also, sure, it gives a crazy amount of armor, but only for two seconds. That, and with Nidalee trap/Last Whisper, the armor she gives is reduced by 64%.\n\nEven if, for some reason, I were willing to grant that Soraka's heal is better at saving someone's life (I'm not -- Soraka heals less per second than Nidalee does), Soraka's able to heal just one person in the time it takes Nidalee to heal two, meaning Nidalee's heal is more effective in saving multiple teammates, unless you bring Soraka's ultimate into the mix.","replies":[{"poster":"Kosmicosis","date":"2014-05-05T19:50:59.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gonna be that guy.\n\n\"Starcall has a 2.5 second cooldown, meaning in 10 seconds she can cast it four times. \"\n\nIncorrect.

Nidalee spears don't leave the opponents with meaningful choices, as they can't GET to Nidalee. You're having loads of fun, because what can the enemy really do? You're faster than them, so it's really hard for them to catch you, and obviously if you're throwing spears while being chased it's easy to turn around.

The only exceptions are when Nidalee uses her Cougar form for wave clear or escape. \n\nI therefore think the best approach would be to remove some of the power from human form Nidalee (who *arguably* shouldn't be as powerful as she if pre-6 anyway) and put more strength into her cougar form.\n\nOtherwise I'd keep her spear as is, and have the damage be reduced dependent on the target's hp %. In other words as her target loses hp she does less damage with her spears. It would make her spear effective as a \"first strike\" tool and still creates threat. However to finish a target Nidalee would need to engage that target with her cougar form.\n\nI'd put a limit on the number of traps she can place (currently it's 13 traps without CDR and 22 traps with CDR) I'd have it set at a max trap of 3 (similar to Caitlyn's traps). It's all sorts of insane that Nidalee can spam her traps as much as she can particularly considering they last 4 minutes! and have one of the longest standard ability debuff duration in the game. Also that debuff is up to 40% armor and Magic resist reduction, that's huge!. That destroys the effectiveness of any tank that stands on it.\n\nI'd change Nidalee's heal to a self heal. I feel this wouldn't change much of Nidalee's identity. I realize it would be effectively removing a support champion from the small pool of support champions but I feel like she's generally not played as support anyway. That nidalee heal is way too strong as it stands (imo). It's got a huge AP ratio, a pretty significant attack speed buff on it, and the rest of her kit isn't that good for a support champion (imo). Particularly since her cougar form does nothing to help her support. It's entirely useless for support Nidalee. Without massive changes to her cougar form, support Nidalee isn't worth keeping (imo). It's half a champion, much like Solo Queue Nidalee. Although, there's potential for Solo Queue Nidalee to be more: Support Nidalee (imo) never will be (not without massive cougar form changes).\n\nOtherwise I think Cougar forms needs some solid buffs. I think after the changes to her human form have taken place there's more than enough room in her \"power budget\" to give her some solid buffs to her cougar form. I'd seriously considering giving Nidalee her Cougar form at level 1 (particularly since it may open up Jungle Nidalee ... which feels like it might be a good fit for her theme). The changes to her spear would mean she can't just \"spear from the jungle\" and pick up easy kills but it also means her spear would be useful (hopefully not \"too\" useful).\n\nAnyway, that's my thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Svensational","date":"2014-05-07T23:07:50.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disagree that Nidalee in the LCS isn't toxic, to be honest.
