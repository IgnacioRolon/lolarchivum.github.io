These champs are VERY strong against a Zed. IF you can't beat Zed with these champs then plz uninstall. {{item:3157}} and {{item:3140}} helps. It is pretty fair that Zed should be OP since he's the 3rd hardest champ to play in League of Legends. I dare you to play Zed and 1v1 an Ekko and see if you can beat him cuz I doubt you can.","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2015-07-16T21:03:05.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Beau Nuggetz","date":"2015-07-21T22:09:00.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:92}} is the hardest champ and she's OP. {{champion:67}} is the 2nd hardest champ and she's OP. {{champion:429}} is the 3rd hardest champ and she's.......meh....sorta OP.
