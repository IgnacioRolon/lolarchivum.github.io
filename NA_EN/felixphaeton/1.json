I've noticed that some people fixed the issue by switching to a different mouse.  I'm using a Razer Orochi, and the delays start happening around 10 minutes into each game.  One person was having issues with his Orochi as well, but fixed it by swapping to something else.\n\nThis issue is extremely frustrating for all affected, but whining about Rito won't do any good.  \n\nIf you're getting this issue, please post what mouse (and/or keyboard) you're using, and if you have other mice, tell us which ones work properly!  The info might be useful for Riot, helping them push out a fix faster.","replies":[{"poster":"Misys","date":"2015-01-30T16:10:37.671+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"$5 mouse/keyboard from walmart.
