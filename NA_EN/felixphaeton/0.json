Do whatever you want to win no one cares.\n\nRank doesn't matter because the important metric is MMR, e.g. how good you and your opponents are, how much game sense they have.\n\n> I play ranked, not normals. I don't play for fun, I play  to win while having fun with the most effective tools I have at my disposal.\n\nAnd my point was that the builds work even at higher ranks. If they hadn't, I would have tried harder to imply that they don't.\n\n> I'm just saying that  as you play ranked the kind of stuff you're doing will stop working at probably silver and for sure at gold 4+\n\nI honestly doubt it.\n\n> Keep in mind you're playing normals. Not everyone is trying as hard as you, and don't care if they lose to your builds.\n\nExcept I don't \"try\" at *all* in my games. I just have fun.\n\n> Just remember in ranked you're eventually gonna have to stop those awful builds my friend, but in normals do whatever the hell you want. Hell even build that shit in ranked, you certainly won't go far with that. \n\nI've had my friends do it. In gold.\n\nThey, and I, have a 100% ranked winrate with them.\n\nAt least, last time I checked. Admittedly I haven't checked in a while.\n\n> Checking at your na.op you're losing to people both unranked and in bronze. \n\nOf course I do. I don't play somebody unless I want to play them.\n\nI value having fun during a game over winning.\n\nSo I don't play ranked games, because I know a number of people actually prefer seeing their numbers go up.\n\nSo I don't play really hard, because then I can relax more.\n\n>I don't think you'll make it to higher silver ( no offense )\n\nWell it'd be hard to get into a higher Silver than Silver 1; which is where I got placed last time I actually did ranked games.\n\n> When you want to climb lolking and teamsolomid are waiting with good builds (usually) for you.\n\nNope.\nI'll stick to making my own builds, even when I get to playing ranked games.\n\nBecause... making the builds is part of the fun.\n\n> BTW  just because you're playing with people \"high\" ranked in normals doesn't matter. \n\nWell, it's good I wasn't talking about those games when I gave my examples.\n\nI was talking about making my friends play using my build, not play *with me*.\n\n> Once again just remember I'm trying to go for the best way possible because I'm a ranked player. \n\nAnd I'm saying-- and all I've been trying to say-- is that there are a lot of things that work that one may not think work at first.\n\n>Keep having fun man, I'm not trying to call you shit, just your builds :)\n\nMy builds are unique and fun-- and **win**.\n\nThey can't be \"shit\" as you've described them twice if they are effective and win games on a semiregular basis, right? I mean, if a build has a 50% winrate, that's **expected**, so what about a ~60%?\n\nAdmittedly that's the average across a whole bunch of builds that I've made, but it is somewhat a relevant number... right?","replies":[{"poster":"Joquan","date":"2015-05-05T00:38:50.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to your na.op.gg you were season 4 bronze.
