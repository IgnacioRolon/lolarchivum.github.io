Why do people still get both? Am I messing out on something, if so, what?","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2017-04-09T13:14:36.664+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since it is not a named passive, the unique merely prevents the same item stacking with itself.  It will still stack with any other {{item:3114}} item.  If it was Unique - Healing Power - 10% bonus healing/shielding (or something), it would not stack.  However, since it is not named, it doesn't prevent them from stacking additively.  [Wikia ](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ardent_Censer) confirmed this as well.  See the \"Lifeline\" passive from {{item:3156}} and {{item:3053}}.","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2017-04-09T13:17:22.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plus {{item:3107}} is just so damn efficient that even if you do not have shielding in your kit, you get that item anyway.  Every support gets {{item:3107}} (except the AP mages like {{champion:63}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:143}}).  Even {{champion:89}} will get {{item:3107}}.  It is just so good that even just buffing only locket {{item:3190}} is absolutely fine.  Its inherit synergism with its own active is amazing.","replies":[{"poster":"Anastaecia","date":"2017-04-09T13:22:30.343+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get {{item:3107}} on {{champion:143}}  as 3rd item if slightly ahead and 4th if even or behind.
