But today was the first time ever that my mouse decided to lag and move slowly in a ranked game match. Previously all my other matches that I've played, there hasn't been a problem with my mouse. I restarted my laptop. Mouse was working fine and up to speed. I logged back into League and reconnected, it became slow again. like the mouse was broken. When I alt+tab and delete into the Task Manager, the mouse continues to run slow while league is up. but if I remove it, it works fine again. Anyone know WHY this is happening all of a sudden. It's not my mouse, or my laptop. Or the connection from my mouse to my laptop. It has to be with League. I'm Tilting.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-21T17:40:18.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your mouse acting up could be caused by a few different factors like the hardware itself, sensitivity settings, or configuration in-game.  What happens if you try another mouse entirely?  Do you have any software installed that goes with your mouse brand?  How do you sensitivity options look in-game?","replies":[]}]}
