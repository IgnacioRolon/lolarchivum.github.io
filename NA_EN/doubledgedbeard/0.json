Sometimes when I'm playing, something happens in the game which makes the environment extremely un-enjoyable.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, I'm subject to punishment if I leave a game. This basically means that I cannot leave games. No other game I've ever played forces me to keep playing when I'm having a bad experience.\r\n\r\nWhen wanting to leave, and being forced to stay or risk punishment, it makes me feel trapped, like I'm being punished and abused, even when I've done nothing wrong, and all I want to do is stop playing.\r\n\r\nWhy do you not allow players to leave a game if they're having a bad time?","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-01-25T05:00:49.796+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"> How can I leave a game without being punished?\n\nPutting it bluntly; you can't. If you leave matches in-progress, you run the risk of suffering LeaverBuster penalties.\n\n> Why do you not allow players to leave a game if they're having a bad time?\n\nBecause you leaving makes the match way less fair for the rest of the players- giving at least four other players a bad time, just because you had one.\n\n> When wanting to leave, and being forced to stay or risk punishment, it makes me feel trapped, like I'm being punished and abused, even when I've done nothing wrong, and all I want to do is stop playing.\n\nIf PVP sometimes stresses you out to the point you want to leave matches in-progress, might I recommend stepping down to bot matches? I imagine you're less likely to run into stressful situations, and even in the off-chance you do, it won't be a huge loss for the team to be down one member. You'll still incur punishments, though, so bear that in mind.\n\n---\n\nUltimately, the reason you're required to commit yourself to a match from game start to game end is because you signed up to play a game with four to nine other players - all of whom want an equal match. You ditching them just because you start having a bad time makes _them_ have a bad time. If the matches are stressing you out to the point you want to leave, try to find something in the match to make it more enjoyable - or, as I mentioned earlier, step down to a less stressful difficulty/gamemode.\n\nAnd, of course, if it's the other players in the match that are making it unenjoyable, mute them. If they're flaming, spam-pinging, or emote-bm'ing, use the respective mutes. But you shouldn't screw over your four other teammates, and potentially ruin the game for up to nine other players just because you stopped having fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2018-01-25T05:00:30.774+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're committing to finishing the game. One person leaving a game of League ruins the game for everybody else.\n\nOther video games can be more forgiving, because leaving a game doesn't hurt the experience of others as much. If you bailed on a battleground in WoW, for example, the next guy in queue simply replaces you. But League needs to crack down on leavers, because the game simply isn't designed to accommodate them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-25T04:56:03.685+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because you ruin the game for everyone else.

It sucks from both angles. The match isn't fun if you're fighting 4v5 because you're at such a huge disadvantage. And the match isn't fun if you're fighting 5v4 because there is no challenge to it, you're just going through the motions of trying to end the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thehuntsman04","date":"2018-11-09T12:56:55.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i dont know if its just me but i hate it when a friend calls me on discord or a bad song comes on spotify, you just have to deal with it. and that you cant just click open discord for 1 second and go back without risking penalty. if you want to do this you have to leave the game. do your stuff and reconnect. risking a penalty. witch sucks cause you cant even go to youre home page","replies":[{"poster":"Velkoon","date":"2019-05-15T03:16:05.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thehuntsman04,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=K5eoHlZN,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2018-11-09T12:56:55.848+0000)\n>\n> i dont know if its just me but i hate it when a friend calls me on discord or a bad song comes on spotify, you just have to deal with it. and that you cant just click open discord for 1 second and go back without risking penalty. if you want to do this you have to leave the game. do your stuff and reconnect. risking a penalty. witch sucks cause you cant even go to youre home page\n\nWhat?
