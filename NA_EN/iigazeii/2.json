You land a sleep on the enemy carry who is out of position, but she starts her cast time before the sleep actually starts and rocket jumps away _while asleep_. \r\n\r\nFor virtually every other form of CC, it would be a skilled use of the cast time, since she would have to buffer the ability before actually getting hit, predicting that the CC will land and preemptively escaping from the bad situation. However, in the case of Zoe, her sleep is on a delay after landing. It actually shows a timer at Tristana&#039;s feet so she can time her jump perfectly, every time. There&#039;s no skill, awareness, or prediction involved at all. The game all but spoonfeeds her a perfect getaway from Zoe specifically.","replies":[]}
