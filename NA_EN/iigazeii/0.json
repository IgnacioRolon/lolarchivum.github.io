People quickly discovered that this was a key taken from Fiddlesticks, and that key had disappeared from Fiddlesticks' splash art. \r\n\r\nNow, the new Fiddlesticks is a demon locked inside a cage, with a collection of keys around the scarecrow's neck. Mostly likely, keys it tried to unlock its cage with, but failed to find the right one. \r\n\r\nWe also know that the Aspect of Twilight (pre-Zoe) gave mortals the knowledge to trap the Darkin in their respective weapons, so trapping dark entities in objects is something Zoe knows how to do, probably. The devs also said explicitly that the name \"Fiddlesticks\" was a like a name a child would give to a monster...\r\n\r\nDid Zoe _make_ Fiddlesticks? Or at least, name him and trap him in his current form? \r\n\r\nTHAT would be a sick lore tie-in.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2020-01-15T19:02:26.105+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":2,"body":"Fiddle writer here.
