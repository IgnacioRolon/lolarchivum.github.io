All you need to worry about are the players. Your job is literally to hit players with abilities and auto-attacks, while they're busy trying to hit minions. Isn't fighting people the fun part? Why wouldn't you want to start the game slinging spells and setting up kills, rather than PvE? \r\n\r\nI get it, not every player finds enchanters appealing, but there are plenty of other supports that aren't about that. You can just as easily support your marksman by bullying the enemy botlane and zoning them away from the minion wave as you could shielding and healing.","replies":[]}
