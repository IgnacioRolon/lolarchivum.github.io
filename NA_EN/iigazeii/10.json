She had a 29% win rate as support. It's extremely hard to use walls/get around minions to get off enough E's to be useful, and Paddle star also has to get around minions. Her bot lane play is and always has been more predictable than her mid play. Also, adcs generally don't just \"give\" Zoe the Bubble minions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ach3ck","date":"2018-11-18T22:14:05.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have you played zoe support\nplay it then fix this comment","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-12-04T08:30:25.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If a mage has a long range root or stun and burst then they can play support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2018-11-19T18:05:03.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zoe going bot as support is sorta of a mage problem right now, not so much a Zoe Problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-11-19T09:27:26.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you think Zoe's going bot as a support...what I would say to that would get me dinged by mods but just note that your feelings should be mildly hurt rn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2018-11-19T04:11:59.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her W gets way fewer shards because she would need to steal CS from her carry in order to get a large portion of them. Her \"great CC\" is single target, has a huge delay before it goes off, and breaks on the first instance of damage they take, meaning champs who want to get large numbers of small hits in like {{champion:96}} or {{champion:498}} or {{champion:22}} would barely get any use out of it, not to mention that it's on a much higher CD than something like Morgana Q or Lux Q or Brand Q.\n\nI've always made the argument that a {{summoner:7}} or a {{summoner:3}} or a {{item:3107}} are worth losing 14-21 gold, but that can add up quickly. Her E going through walls is also very fun to play with in botlane, but 9 times out of ten I'd rather have an instant, lasting root or stun for my ADC to take advantage of or be saved by.\n\nThat being said, I'd love it if Zoe was a viable support. I've posted before about ways they could change her W to make it more balanced for both mid and support roles. You could also make some sort of change where only abilities popped her E, or something like that that made it harder for her allies to screw it up for her. Idk it's just an idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kda akali","date":"2018-11-18T21:59:23.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would actually be better for the game tbh, with two people in a lane you can have someone block her q's for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PlebonicEbonic","date":"2018-11-19T03:28:40.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ive seen her in supp a few times. her low mana costs are bullshit, and she's spammy cancer. not to mention that sleep is a guaranteed fucking kill every time it lands.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zeppelins circus","date":"2018-11-18T21:06:56.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:161}} And yet nobody remembers the spaghetti monsters mains who were pushed out to support.\nPity the tentacles.","replies":[]}]}
