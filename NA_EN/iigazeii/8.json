She has extremely long range, powerful burst damage, and the unique ability to copy summoner spells and get free ones off of her enemies. She can feel oppressive since she can stay super-safe with her range, and you can't push up to her and depend on summoners to get you out because she'll just use them right back. I love Zoe, but I think the frustration involved in playing against her could use a pass. \n\nHere's a solution: Move Spell Thief to her R, and Portal Jump to her W. \n\nWhat this would do is gate Zoe's ability to pick up summoners behind level 6. She wouldn't be able to cheese through laning phase with a free Ignite or Redemption taken from a minion, and she wouldn't have the movement speed/damage from Spell Thief to enhance her own summoners or get out of a bad trade until later on. She'd be an immobile mage with no escape for the majority of the laning phase, making her early game a clearer weakness and giving opponents the opportunity to shut her down early more easily. \n\nSomething like this: \n\n**Spell Thief**\nW >>> R\nBonus movement speed: 30%/X/70% >>> 25%/50%/75%\nBonus movement speed duration: 2/X/3 seconds >>> 2/2.5/3 seconds\nTotal damage: 75/X/195 (+40% AP) >>> 75/135/195 (+45% AP)\n\n**Portal Jump**\nR >>> W\nCooldown: 11/8/5 seconds >>> 13/X/5 seconds\nCost: 50 >>> 80 mana\n\n**Paddle Star**\nBase Damage: 50/X/170 >>> 42/X/170 \n\n*(This small damage nerf to her early Q damage is to make up for the fact that she gets the increased range, and thus, increased damage, from Portal Jump early on)\n\nShe'd get her iconic Portal Jump ability earlier in the game, but the higher mana cost means she'll run herself OOM if she just spams long-range Qs to play it safe. Without the free summoners from Spell Thief for the first five levels, enemies would be free to make early plays with their summoner spells to get a lead, and she wouldn't have an easy way to get out without burning her own summoners. She'd be a normal lane against an immobile mage early on, without the safety net of extra summoners to smooth things out for her. \n\nAdjustments to how balloons spawn (since she won't really be getting them much from laning. Maybe have them spawn on every cannon, so she has lots available in the late game?) might be in order, but overall, I think this sort of change would be exactly what Zoe needs to be fun without being as frustrating. Having that clear, early game window to shut her down would put her in a healthier state.","replies":[]}
