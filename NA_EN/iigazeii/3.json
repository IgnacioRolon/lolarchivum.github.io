It could build out of the jungle starter and Zeal, giving crit chance, a bit of attack speed, and maybe bonus damage when critting monsters.\r\n\r\nA heal/shield power jungle item would be an interesting option. Ivern would actually finish his jungle item, and I could see other supportive junglers like Nunu taking it. \r\n\r\nI also think the red enchantment could use some love. Compared to the rest, it's rather bland. It only gives raw stats. Giving it a bleed effect or armor shred or something would help make it feel unique.","replies":[]}
