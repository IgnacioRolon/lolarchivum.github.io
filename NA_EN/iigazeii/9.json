They&#039;re the ones with magic after all. \r\n\r\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, this would make having access to Spell Thief a lot more consistent, especially during the laning phase. The most recent iteration of Zoe has issues with waveclear, which will likely be exacerbated by the upcoming waveclear changes. Restricting the Spell Thief drops to the caster minions means Zoe will have an easier time getting it to drop. They&#039;re squishier and don&#039;t draw the attention of the other minions as quickly, so if Zoe wanted to, she could focus on the backline minions to get her spell to drop.\r\n\r\nIt would be a very subtle buff to Zoe, but I think it would make her feel a whole lot better in the early/mid game.","replies":[]}
