(i.e., a red silhouette, similar to an Oracle Lens)\n* Whenever you land a basic attack or ability (excluding damage-over-time) on an enemy champion, ~~reduce your Trinket cooldown by 1 second and increase the duration of any of your active Wards by 1 second~~ **EDIT: pause the timer of any of your active Wards or Lenses for 2 seconds.**\n* The placement range of your Wards is increased by 20%, ~~and the vision radius of all of your Wards and Lenses is increased by 20% while you are within 1000 units of it. ~~ **EDIT: the vision radius of all of your Wards is increased by 50% if you are within 200 units of it.**\n\nIn response to the many recent vision nerfs, this is a vision-focused keystone that improves your ability to track the movements of your enemies and keep wards up on the map. \n\nMomentary obscured vision allows you to see the location of enemy champions after they leave your sight as well as the direction they are moving, letting you get an rough approximation of where they are headed as well as opening up the potential for landing skillshots on enemies trying to leave or hide in a bush. \n\nThis keystone also rewards you for staying in combat with enemy champions, letting you increase the duration of your wards and cut down on their cooldown by trading blows with your enemies. This increases your vision uptime considerably. \n\nFinally, you would be able to place Wards a bit further away than other champions as well as increase their vision radius if you are relatively close to them. An Oracle Lens is always on you, so it would always benefit from the increased range. \n\nThis keystone doesn&#039;t provide any direct combat benefit, but would give you a lot of additional information if you are smart with your ward placement and keep eyes on your minimap. This is geared primarily towards support champions due to their focus on vision, but would also be useful for ADCs since it lets them place wards at a safer distance and help their support with vision more, and for junglers, as they extra uptime on Oracle Lenses gives them more vision control and opportunities for surprise ganks. Any squishy, immobile mage who needs to have vision control around the river would also get a lot of use out of this rune. \n\n**EDIT: I really appreciate all the feedback! I've made a few adjustments to the concept to try to address a few issues people had with it.**\n\n**First, the trinket CDR was very strong, especially combined with the increased uptime. The additional wards would make it a must-pick in pro-play. I've changed it to instead pause the duration of any active Ward or Lens for 2 seconds. This increases the uptime of the wards you have placed, but doesn't give you the opportunity to move up your vision. This improves the wards you place in the laning phase significantly, since they are relatively static, but doesn't let you place any extra wards over the course of a game.**\n\n**Next, I've adjusted the vision granted by standing close to your Wards. The old version basically needed you to stand inside the radius, which would give you a rather big area to work with. This updated version makes the vision radius much bigger, but only if you stand in a much smaller area. Basically, the effect is that you stand on top of a ward to add your vision together. The amount of vision in terms of area coverage is roughly the same if you stand on top of a ward, or are standing totally outside of its radius.**","replies":[{"poster":"AscendingHope","date":"2018-11-13T19:10:11.112+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"Very good concept and would really like this but riot just has a boner for a blind map","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frog goes moo","date":"2018-11-14T09:41:47.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds cool as heck. Everything except for \n\n\"Whenever you land a basic attack or ability (excluding damage-over-time) on an enemy champion, reduce your Trinket cooldown by 1 second and increase the duration of any of your active Wards by 1 second.\"\n\nSounds really good. I think it should be \"every basic attack or ability lowers your ward cooldown by .5 percent and thenit caps at 20 percent\" because ingenious hunter exists and it already reduces trinket cooldowns (this includes wards and oracles) by 45 percent I think. So combine that with visionary and you'd get a 65 percent cooldown on wards. But if it doesn't cap, and it's unlimited progress, then some people could even achieve a 0 second cooldown on basic ward trinket.","replies":[{"poster":"One Quacky Boi","date":"2018-11-14T10:38:47.845+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you misunderstand how it's supposed to work.

Not to mention that going Inspiration primary severely limits your ability to dip into powerful options like Bone Plating, Triumph, or Sudden Impact. \n\nPlayers with sufficient game sense to track the enemy jungler and manage their wards or skill in lane to afford extra Control Wards would have a fair shot at having similar map knowledge while still having the benefit of more combat-oriented runes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CaptainMÃ¥rvelous","date":"2018-11-15T00:45:50.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=demoted to iron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AdbY94l1,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2018-11-14T05:10:13.969+0000)\n>\n> This would probably become just about the only picked keystone in pro play, so Riot won&#x27;t add it.\n\nThis.

I like the idea, but it doesn't offer much in terms of non-pro play. \n\nIncreasing the size of the vision isn't a good idea because player's have learned to play around vision range, and it would kind of suck to completely negate the chances of a skilled jungler pathing perfectly around your wards and still getting you despite your vision, i like the idea of it giving a higher placement range, that's pretty cool cause you can ward a bush from a safer distance. But this keystone needs to give you something, or, at the very least, this shouldn't be a keystone at all, it's not powerful enough to be one outside of it's guaranteed pro-play abuse.","replies":[{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2018-11-14T20:18:22.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree, because of champs like {{champion:84}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:555}} etc and general bush strats.

The Inspiration tree has zero runes that give you more damage. It's all utility.
