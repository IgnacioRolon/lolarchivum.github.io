The total damage could be the same or even greater, but this would encourage her to set up minion waves appropriately to get all three bursts or actually land her CC so that it blows up three times on an enemy. This gives her opponents more time to avoid the brunt of the damage from her Q, and overall rewards skillful use of the ability.","replies":[]}
