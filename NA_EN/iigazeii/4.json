It's just that some ADCs scale so hard with crit and AD that they don't even need anything else. Despite the gold lost over the unique passive, 3-4 IEs gives you better results than a legit build.\r\n\r\nI think a bit part of the problem lies in the fact that very few abilities scale with attack speed. Building AD not only increases your DPS from autos, but also increases the effectiveness of your abilities. \r\n\r\nI don't think IE needs nerfs, and doing something like making the crit chance unique is only a bandaid solution. I think crit/AS itemization and the champions that build it needs  another pass so that stacking IEs isn't objectively better than building other items.","replies":[]}
