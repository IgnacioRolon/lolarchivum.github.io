Because without it procing her Q , akali's E may as well be removed and akali coudl have 3 skills. Cause all akali's E now is , is  a really bad version of Zed's E. And doesn't mean much at all. Im all happy for the nerf to her R. Perfectly fine, but changing her E to where it doesn't Proc her Q anymore almost makes it worthless.","replies":[{"poster":"Lichblade","date":"2015-02-11T04:52:30.282+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot isn't going to revert the E nerf because it will reduce her counterplay.\n\nAll that I can say for now is that her E spell needs to be a spell that gives her power in an unreliable way.\n\nFor example a skillshot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Are","date":"2015-02-11T06:22:05.906+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"She's okay without her E. Before season 3, E couldn't proc Q. It wasn't so bad. You just have to play smarter now.\n\nThe real problem is her R nerf. Her niche is to be able to catch out mobile champions and stuff, but now she has an extremely hard time catching up to them. It's really difficult reaching Caitlyn and Kalista now. Really frustrating considering what Akali is intended to do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NorthernDruid","date":"2015-02-11T08:04:02.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Forget that, rework the ability entirely to something which adds to her kit independently.\n\nAnd empowered autoattack or a short, wide cone skillshot would be cool.\n\nAnything which isn't instant damage to anyone within range is good.\n\nEspecially if it gives some utility debuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-02-11T04:47:51.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I say revert the E nerf, change it to magical damage, reduce the ratio on her Q, and make her AA animation not suck so bad after pressing R. That'd pretty much balance her properly. Her passive could use a nerf too though... over 40% spell vamp from just a Gunblade and some runes is insanity.","replies":[{"poster":"NorthernDruid","date":"2015-02-11T08:03:42.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know, it's like, why should she get a bit more than a third of it for free just from an otherwise not very impressive passive? It's not like runes+gunblade, which anyone can get, makes up the majority of it anyway.\n\npeople need to stop whining over Akali's passive granting her 13% spellvamp when building AP.\n\nInnate sustain abilities is a part of a lot of champion kits, get over it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-02-11T06:36:11.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have 3 stacks of ult for a reason here, and I'm not just talking about taking down escaping kills....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-02-11T04:30:30.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"revert her E and nerf her passive.. like wtf do people read that shit? lol its pretty insane","replies":[]}]}
