For example, champions are built by a core group of a designer, writer and artists, with lots of help from engineers, audio, insights, QA, production and so on. Each team is really collaborative and basically owns their own space. They get feedback from other teams, but there aren't a great deal of hoops to jump through. Each team has a group of leads to provide guidance for that team, and then some teams are organized into larger teams and so on. Meddler for example is the lead designer on gameplay, which includes teams like live balance and champion design. I am the lead designer on League as a whole. That doesn't mean I am in charge of League per se - there is a leadership team that includes an art director, a head of publishing and so on. We have a team captain who makes the final call when there is disagreement.\n\nI describe my job as being equal parts: 1) making sure the design of League is high quality, 2) working with the other leads on the direction and vision for the game overall, and 3) managing the design department. My day to day is mostly meetings, to touch base on how projects are going, to give feedback, to try and solve prioritization dilemmas, to dogpile onto crises and so on. \n\nI am shifting to spend more of my bandwidth trying to communicate effectively with players. We feel like we've slipped in our comms and talking to you guys is something I am very passionate about. Players are really where I get the energy to do my job, and try and inspire the rest of the team to do great things that will make you all happy.","replies":[{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2016-07-16T21:09:14.634+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thx for taking the time to answer my question.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-07-17T16:40:06.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another thing I would add is it seems like you guys over design a lot of new content, making them needlessly complex. Often the most simple solution is the best solution. \n\nThis issue occurs in various places, two notable examples are abilities and the hextech crafting system. \n\nHonestly many of your skills / abilities are needlessly complex, adding passives, stacks, and other mechanics just to make the skill more complex, but not necessarily better. An example is tariq's new Q. Why does it need a stacking mechanic, it's just bloating the ability description and not really adding much to the gameplay. \n\nHextech crafting is another example. You guys over designed the fuck out of this feature ( in my opinion). You guys can still simplify it to make it more satisfying. Features shouldn't require a manual to use.... They should be intuitive. If you need to have instructions for it, I feel like you guys didn't do a good job of making it simple and easy to learn and use. \n\nKey fragments, multiple essence types , gemstones. I believe you could have created a much better and refined product if you stuck to the core and didn't add so many complex bells and whistles. Any product that requires an instruction manual is over designed. \nHowever im not a designer obviously, maybe you guys have a reason for introducing overly complicated mechanics and features. I think that simplicity and intuition should be important factors when designing anything. \n\nCheers bud.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OtakuGaming","date":"2016-07-17T14:55:34.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know the question is off topic. But tell me please how split are the opinions on how well balanced the game is at its current state around the whole teams? I have the feeling that you guys actually try to acomplish some sort of balance for sure but sometimes you overbuff things and gutt things so hard that they are just a waste of time to be used any further. Is there a plan to make all champs some kind of niche/viable even for competitive or just high elo. I have heard that in Dota 2 about 100 champs got played in competitive while we see here like mostly 50 out of like 140. Are there any plans on making league equal and balanced in a some kinda called end state? Im pretty glad that you started answering so many questions.

New champs/ updates are usually ON POINT and very high quality. For me the most important part of a new champ is: how cool they are, and how fun they are (in that order). \nThere are a ton of improvements to be made elsewhere though. Game UI, Masteries, Items, Runes, can be made more satisfying with some work. Ability descriptions need to be streamlined (too bloated), and there has to be a better experience for beginners (I'd be curious to know what percentage of the playerbase consists of 'new' or 'causual' players). I like what you guys are producing, but I know you can up your game even more (comparing you to heroes here). \n\nYou have to admit that Blizz has way more polish than league. They beat you in many categories: animated Champ Select, Try (sandbox) mode for any hero/skin (with unlimited cool-downs/ levels), Map design, Champion satisfaction(especially with supports), and the pace of the game (there is no 'boring' moments in heroes such as laning/last hitting for 20 mins etc. Often in LCS even the casters sound bored... Never a dull moment in Hots though) \nWhich is weird because that game is farily new compared to you guys. That means they must've planned all these features while the game was being concepted.... really good analysis done by their business team eh?    \n\n2)  You should share with the players what your 'vision' is for the game overall. I dont think you've ever shared what you envision this game to become, or what your goals even are? Whats your endgame here man? We'd like to know where this game is heading as well, and what your overall plans/ goals are for us. \n\n3) Seems like every employee works in the design department. Artists, writers , designers, balance etc. Are there Rioters NOT in design? \n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n\nOverall I'm probably liking League more than Heroes ATM. I think this is because of how many Champions there are in League. Every game I play a new hero, and i'm having a ton of fun. Each game feels different and fun.... Plus I like you guys better \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} Keep up the good work","replies":[]},{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2016-07-16T21:16:31.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who ultimately decides direction?
