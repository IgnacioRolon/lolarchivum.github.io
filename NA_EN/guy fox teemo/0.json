In terms of pure numbers it was at one of its weakest places in its lifetime (though now of course it's much weaker), but the environment around it was still such that it was an important item despite its weakness. In fighting games, the meta shifts radically over time, even long before updates were a thing.

Beta testing is important, but it's not the be-all end-all, especially in a product where updates are pushed out every couple of weeks. Performance is important, and that's no excuse for lazy development, but in preseason at least there's not really a good reason to place the same priority on that as bugs.\n> \n> really not getting your points, you seem to be agreeing with what im saying while saying what im saying isnt helpful? making no sense to me atm honestly\n\nI'm saying that you're complaining about a thing you can contribute to without contributing to it, and you're doing so in a way that's rude, condescending, self-important, and unconstructive. You're also complaining about how PBE is run without having actually played on PBE. You're further demanding that I give you data that you have access to if I want to disprove a point that you're not backing up with anything concrete. Even setting aside the problem with disproofs, that's a bad way to approach it.\n\nI should probably be done replying to this thread, though. I'm getting annoyed, and it's not really helpful.

Yes, some of it will become a bit clearer as people get used to it, but a lot of it won't. For example, runes that give you adaptive AP/AD based on your % health or whether you're in river, or give you lifesteal/AS/out of combat MS per unique takedown. Or something like the Legend line, which gives you a base of free stats plus more stats based on takedowns/CS/epic minion kills.

And League had, until recently, been trending in that direction. Corki now has 7 bars under him to indicate ult charges. Annie now shows how close she is to max passive stacks. Visual clarity is the key.\n\nBut so many of these new runes are invisible power. How do I know if the opponent took Waterwalking? I have to wait for them to walk into river and see if their stats go up.

How did Riot expect mages to lane against AD opponents when they decided not to compensate them earlygame for the removal of armor runes? Did they expect every single mage to take Resolve as a secondary tree and pick Iron Skin? Yes, they got a piddly 30 extra base health but that does not compensate for losing around 13 armor (what were the stats on armor yellows again? They were so ubiquitous that I last checked their stats years ago...) and getting extra health/ level does not help you earlygame against a Zed or Talon. Also towers are so ridiculously weak I don't know whether to laugh or cry about it.\n\nNow, I know that projects like Runes Reforged are massive and impossible to pull off flawlessly. I work as a professional tester and have picked up a thing or two about software design through the years, so I know how difficult stuff like this is to create.

The problem lies in the %'s and what's offered. You gave AD dealers AD to get back up to their \"regular\" state after gutting runes. Then, most AD dealers take trees which give them either more power, effects, or flat out AD/AP (adaptive) on TOP of the buffs to \"restore them\" to a regular state. \n\nOn the flip side, there's little to no options to REDUCE or mitigate damage, and no, +5 armor/MR is not the \"Go to\" finger pointer. Do you realize, % wise, how much damage +5 armor even would even reduce? Stack that with +5% armor at the beginning of the game for being FORCED to pop a potion or have some sort of innate sustain to get the effect. I could mitigate damage more with the runes offered in the previous system that I ever could here.  \n\nIn fact, take any tank champ into the game and play it out. In last season we had an option for +5% armor/MR in Masteries RIGHT FROM THE START OF THE GAME, and in addition we could choose to stack  more armor, scale our health, get some CDR, it felt like I had OPTIONS. \n\nOne of the most viable aspects of this system that I feel is overlooked is the fact that I don't feel like I'm _making_ choices. If you're NOT a ADC/Assassin, I feel like you're forced down certain paths simply because even with the megar bonuses offered, you are forced to take those paths because without them, you're not viable at ALL. \n\nAP, Junglers, and non-damage supports are left in the void as well as many other champions. \n\nEspecially as a tank, I don't feel like I'm _making_ decisions or have that many _**options**_ available to me. \n\nFor example, a better option in the resolve tree would have been something like this:\n\nGain 15 armor, but deal 10% less damage for 10 minutes.\n\nOR\n\nGain 15 Magic resist, but deal 10% less damage for 10 minutes. \n\nOR \n\nAfter 10 minutes gain 8 armor AND magic resist + 5% armor and magic resist.\n\nOR\n\nGain 20 armor AND magic resist, but deal 15% less damage to champions and monsters for  the first 15 minutes of the game.\n\nOR\n\nAfter 5 minutes, for each minute passed, gain 1 armor and 1 magic resist.\n\nThis gives me more options and actually makes me FEEL like I'm making a choice with clear consequences or benefits so I could choose to walk in more tanky or wait and get clear benefits and losses for each choice, depending on how long I think the game is going to go.\n\nIt also makes it more viable to go into certain match-ups or survive longer. These are arbitrary examples, but you can see my point. The whole system is missing things like this. Instead there's 3 options at each level, multiple of which are not even VIABLE for the \"class\" or champ you're playing, so you basically go into 1 rune selection, maybe 2, just because you ARE the class you are, and the runes only work for you. \n\nIn conclusion, there needs to be more choices, more keystones so there's more options for a lot of different classes. Right now I feel like there's the typical 1-2 paths that can be played for most champs, if at all.\n\nWith more keystones and choices, you'd encompass a large variety of champions and offer a lot of mix-match benefits that could expand the game more and offer a metric ton of different ways to play champions because you have more options available to you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2017-11-09T16:18:03.578+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, most posts i see complain about damage overall beeing to high and/or snowballing beeing even worse that befor, which is not bitching about something specific beeing OP but about the new system overall offering to much damage compared to tankiness and creating a to snowbally enviorment, which is a legit complain.\n\nAnd while it's natural and no a big deal if single champs/runes and interatctions are OP, it's still important to call them out and fix them as they make it hard to asses the overall impoact of other changes.\nIf 1 or two masteries are broken and cause the damage influx that people complain about, then it's important to bring those masteries in line so one can see wether it's really just those out of line masteries or a generall issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-11-09T14:29:31.645+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Giving feedback on the current balance of the game _is_ constructive criticism, though, as pointing out the excessively snowbally nature of matches, overly high damage, etc. does give Riot something to work with.
