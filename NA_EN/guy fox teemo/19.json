I'll add that I had this opinion immediately when the new system came out, not just due to autofill.\n\nAnyways, in the old system, you were expected to be knowledgable about every role. At least have 1 or 2 component champions in each of your off roles. In the current system, after a year of playing only two roles, there's no such expectation. Everyone believes they're okay only knowing 2 roles, and thus being put in to a different role is unfair to them.\n\nMore directly though, autofill is worse than immediately switching to old draft.\nIn the old version, teams could communicate their role preferences and people could make reasonable choices as how to form the best team. \nIn the new version, teams can still do this potentially, but there's this big flag where everyone has an assigned role. You COULD give up your role and play support since it's your third best role and his fifth, but why should you? You were assigned your favourite role - you don't get it every game. Heck, you filled support 3 games ago! \n\nTo give a comparison, consider a bus with all of the seats taken when a very elderly woman steps on. There's a mom with two little kids in the 3 seats at the front, a disabled man sitting opposite them, and then a bunch of healthy young men sitting in the forward-facing rows behind. \n\nLogically, any of the young healthy men would give up their seat to the elderly woman.\n\nNow, consider that those two 3-seat sections at the front had signs over them indicating that they were for priority seating. All of the young healthy men aren't taking up the seating for the elderly woman. The healthy mother is taking up such a seat though. Perhaps none of them will get up as they all expect the mother to move for the elderly woman - even though all logic would dictate that the mother should be sitting with her kids (who both are young enough to need seats). \n\nYou could argue that this isn't the case in real life - but please remember that we're talking about a video game with a bunch of immature teenagers. It wouldn't be hard to get 4 of them in a game where at least 1 would give up his \"seat\" if there wasn't a sign, but won't when there is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2016-11-26T17:31:48.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sayeth what?....\nHow dare thou utter such vile black magic speak on this board.\nBegone with you spawn of {{champion:17}} \n:-)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Muted Summoner","date":"2016-11-26T17:28:40.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was more like who was 1st in line/pick got dibs unless someone said mid or feed.\n\ngenerally the last 2 were support and the other last role and they had to fight over which one didn't want support, unless some magnificent bastard said fill (and meant support) or support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dehitay","date":"2016-11-26T01:46:19.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a bit of a difference.
