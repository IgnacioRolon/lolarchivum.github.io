Which include:\n{{champion:103}} E, {{champion:32}} QR, {{champion:34}} Q, {{champion:1}} passive QR, {{champion:22}} R, {{champion:268}} QR, {{champion:432}} QR, {{champion:53}} QRE, {{champion:63}} Q, {{champion:201}} QR, {{champion:31}} Q, {{champion:119}} E, {{champion:60}} E, {{champion:9}} QE, {{champion:105}} R, {{champion:79}} R, {{champion:120}} R, {{champion:40}} QR, ok I got bored trying to list all abilities, but you get the idea.\n\nHer ultimate damage could've been avoided on primary target with shields and heals. Meaning counterplay in form of:\n{{champion:12}} heal (with +armor and mr, it would've only been viable in s6 with the new masteries, in past seasons ali didn't do much other than intercepting her ult and ult himself), {{champion:131}} W, {{champion:245}} W, {{champion:9}} W, {{champion:3}} whatever skill is his shield, {{champion:40}} RE, {{champion:43}} RW, {{champion:10}} R, {{champion:117}} RE, {{champion:99}} W, {{champion:37}} heal, {{champion:16}} heal, {{champion:50}} heal, {{champion:44}} heal\n\nNext, her ultimate could have been counter builded with {{item:3157}} viable for AP champions.\nNext, her ultimate could have been avoided by champions such as: {{champion:60}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:17}} \nAlso counterplayed by {{champion:23}} and {{champion:26}} {{champion:203}} (released after fiora rework).\n\nHmm, there's more.\nFiora's entire kit was about auto attack so, {{item:3047}} reduced her damage by 10%.\nAnd finally, her steroid was an auto attack speed burst. Which was easily stopped by Attack Speed slows such as: {{champion:75}}, {{champion:54}} {{champion:20}} \n\nFuthermore, she had to run though the enemy team to reach her targets. So, AoE zone control was highly effective, such as: {{champion:20}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:112}} \n\nI'm sure I've forgot a few more ways to counterplay/counter build the Original Fiora.\nBut the point in case is, the community made it seem \"toxic\", not that the champion was as such. There were plenty of ways to play against the original Fiora. Now, since you guys bitched so much about it, have fun dealing with % max hp true damage and can block any cc, go counter play that.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2016-02-13T16:40:45.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old Fiora was toxic as heck.\n\nThose displacements to stop her q, is the root of your argument. If you didn't have one, you were screwed. She would q to you, or q the minion wave then q to you, then her e would allow her to stick to you hard. Then she would ult, whether it was under tower or not, you would take damage.\n\nNow let's say several people had displacing effects. Timing displacementioned effects are incredibly hard and would result in her most likely getting to you.\n\nIn teamfights, all she had to do was get to one person and ult, just one. Because then she'd most likely have a ravenous hydra and her ult would hit everyone. Not too mention if she was almost dead she could heal from it and come back at almost full hp.\n\nIt's obvious you're salty about the fiora rework. But let's not kid ourselves, fiora was toxic as heck. Snowbally, no counterplay character. Her rework is brilliant, it just needs some tuning.","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2016-02-13T17:17:25.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unlike you, I mained Fiora.\nYes, I could Q aa Q aa E aa R on a lot of champions that disrespected me on top lane. And that's how I got feed and snowballed.\nBut the truth is, there were just 3 match-ups Fiora had an edge on top lane: {{champion:17}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:150}} .\n\nEverything else, I had to outplay the enemy.\nOld Fiora also had no escapes. So, every time I went for an aggressive move, I had to be sure it works well.\nDo note that for s3 and s4 we didn't have \"free wards\" either.\n\nSo, lets look at popular match-ups for top lane back in the day:\n{{champion:58}} - was raping Fiora with his damage, sustain and stun.\nThe ONLY way to SURVIVE (that means not dying and not falling at under 50cs difference) of the enemy Renekton was for you, as the Fiora player to PARRY every single one of his stuns when over 50% ferocity. The stun which is almost instant and acts as an auto attack reset. But that Fiora was not this Fiora. What you would've block was the attack times 3 of his stun dmg (you would still get stunned and eat an E and Q on the face).\n{{champion:54}} - yes, good luck killing the guy that gets damage by building armor. Oh, he also has an attack speed slow and all your damage comes from AD\n{{champion:92}} - 1 instant CC that could interrupt 1 Q damage, a shield that would block the second Q damage. And still empowered auto attacks and 3 more gap closers.\n{{champion:57}} - again, you do no damage to this guy and he just heals for days\n{{champion:24}} - the split push hero, he blocks your ult with his dodge. Your Q aa Q aa E aa combo had like 12 seconds cooldown his auto attack dodge/stun had like 16s cooldown. You had a 4 second opening from time to time to get feed pre lv 6 and try to win. Otherwise you got rekt.\n{{champion:31}} - you would've never kill this guy. To begin with Q aa R was not enough damage to kill him. why Q aa R?\nBecause if you tried to Q aa Q aa E aa R. You would've eaten a silence followed by a knock up, a huge slow and true damage bite execute.\n\nDarn, most matchups (since few people played teemo, gnar and jayce) where skill match-ups where you had to outplay the opponent. Make use for small oppenings to get a kill. It was exciting.\n\nYes, Fiora was \"unhealthy\" because people refuse to counter play or counter build against her.\nFizz was(and still is) doing more fucking damage with his E than Fiora could do with her ult if both of them can land it on 5 targets. And  Fizz has it on 8s cooldown while Fioras was on 1 minute. Of fucking course I'm salty about it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-02-13T09:40:47.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as he doesn't end up as .... horrible to play against as Fiora.\nI'd hate it if I had to hate Mordekaiser, his concept is so awesome.\n{{summoner:31}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"blfUvZ8Ybu","date":"2016-02-13T01:11:28.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kh√¢mul","date":"2016-02-13T01:06:51.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not at the size of fiora or his R will be like ; steal %life as true damages...
