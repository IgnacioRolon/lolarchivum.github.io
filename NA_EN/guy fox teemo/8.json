I'm just saying with how unbalanced the game is normally, mirror mode turned out to be a TON of fun by actually forcing the balance into it for a change.  I had an 88% winrate during that mode.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mestm","date":"2015-09-30T04:43:07.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Are you serious?
