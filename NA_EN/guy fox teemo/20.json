From racism to sexism and everything in between. The more we fight for it, the more impossible it becomes. Reason being is that society is \"fighting for it\" in the worst way possible. I personally think that we should stop using the mentality of \"protest\" and make it more like \"progress\" where every little thing getting better is acknowledged more towards the overall goal.\n\nI like to reference a quit smoking ad. One less cigarette is a victory and every victory counts. (I'm not sure if that's the exact quote, but it's the same idea.)\n\nMedia really doesn't help. You always here about how some white cop shot a black civilian and then they leave out every detail OR they give immediate details and fail to follow up to possibly admit that the initial details given may or may not have been wrong. Not only that, but you hear every bad thing that ever happens all over the world.

Who in the world has told a woman that her looks are all that matters?! I personally wouldn't marry a woman for just being beautiful. But your logic here is, that if a woman is sexy then she is suddenly an \"object\" and somehow everything else doesn't matter. You can hardly tell how a woman is like just by looking at a picture of her. I'd defenitely prefer to get to know Ahri, or a woman like her body form and/or beauty, rather than talk to some out of shape/ugly/not as appealing woman. The same way every woman would prefer knowing more about some hot guy rather than some creep. Women sometimes feel insecure about their bodies. That's it. Feminazis just make up terms like the \"subject-object\" dicotamy, ignoring that you can play that exact same game with anything else, including the \"employer-worker\" dicotamy and objectification on men being objects.\n\nWhen a man sees an image like this he doesn't think \"Hah, she's just an 'object'! She ain't attractive for shit!\", no. He thinks \"Damn, she's hot! Wish I could get to know her and...do other things with her.\"\n\nIt's just biological that men find hot girls attractive. If you don't like women like this (tho if you're a straight guy, I highly doubt you don't), then fine, that's your preference. But I'm pretty sure we both prefer a smart and nice lady that looks like that rather than the same personality in an uglier body. That's just biological and saying that it is sexist to acknowledge that men are way more sexually attracted to this image rather to some \"normal, serious and uglier\" woman is absured. And it's nothing to be ashamed of.","replies":[]}]}]}
