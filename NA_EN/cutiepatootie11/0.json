My old laptop was a Lenovo Ideapad s210 touch, and the keys stopped working on it, but I don't understand how that tiny crappy little laptop, where I didn't have to disable half the stuff in league could run league better than my new one.  Any suggestions on raising my frame rate?","replies":[{"poster":"NowQ","date":"2017-05-29T01:04:26.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I know it's alomg shot, but check your power options. Set it to high performance. On new laptops it is set to balanced when plugged and to power saving when unplugged, it stops your laptop from using all resources. Shoul find power options bottom right corner (battery logo) or by typing power options in search bar in start menu.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-26T21:17:20.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WeeGaffer has a couple good suggestions.
