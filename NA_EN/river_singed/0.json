Real life is gonna murder ya lol\n\nI'm always mildly confused about statements like this.\n\nAre you not conversing with real people? The internet isn't on some foreign plane of existence. The rules are actually there, not just in someone else's mind. The things you do on the internet can have an effect on you outside of the internet as well (unless you're completely willing to ignore all the cases where people get in real trouble for the things that they do online).\n\nBesides, following the rules of the establishment predates the internet. If you break the rules of a bar, store, someone's house, etc they can toss you out. They also get to make the rules, behavioral included, to follow in their establishment.\n\nIf you can't handle an establishment making/enforcing rules then maybe you should be concerned about how you're going to handle real life. Because you're going to have to deal with a lot of rules in a lot of places, often changing depending on the locale.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5d0x4allx0","date":"2020-01-25T21:29:08.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a good laugh at this part: \"how to absolutely lose control of a game - a book by azir\"\n\nBut honestly be thankful all you got for that was chat restrictions.
