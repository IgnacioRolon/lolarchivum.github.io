I do have a list of port forwarding for both and I did do the League tutorial on port forwarding and nothing happened. I also looked up on setting up port forwards but most of the tutorials do not use DD-WRT on youtube so it was slightly confusing to translate to DD-WRT.  There is a support ticket that I am currently getting resolved as well, this is just for assistence with the trying to get this shit to work and if I need to add anything. Also do I need to restart my router every time I add or remove a port?\r\nThanks in Advance\r\n-Kanjimaru","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-01T02:32:25.957+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes these VPN's and port forwarding and be a little tricky. It looks like one of our tech guys has started helping you in a ticket, so you're in good hands there. They'll be able to go much more in depth than I can on the boards, so keep working with them through that ticket!","replies":[{"poster":"The Lucky Slushy","date":"2017-04-01T04:04:06.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is doing a Great Job. Your tech guys really do know how to help people by just going through simple diagnosis stuff, and moving through the motions like how a pitcher who is doing really well in a baseball game. Hopefully We can find a solution this stuff is pretty advanced to me. I am just going to enjoy this break from the salt mines till either I figure what is wrong or until a solution is found that does not require me to go all {{champion:254}}  on this and just break the VPN to where no one can use the internet here.","replies":[]}]}]}
