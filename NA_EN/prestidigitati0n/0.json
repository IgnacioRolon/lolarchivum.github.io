When the game launched, the window is too big, I can't see the full picture of the game. The most annoying part is even the option menu is too big, and I can't even scroll down to click \"Okay\", so I can't make any change to things like resolution, fullscreen/window. I tried to change the resolution of my Mac, but the option is still too big for me to make changes. Is there a way to change sitting without launched the game?","replies":[{"poster":"MarshmallowBob","date":"2017-03-07T18:07:57.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try CMD and - at the same time to shrink the client size after opening the client -- this will work for the updated client, not the legacy one. \n\nLet me know if that works for you!","replies":[]}]}
