Rank borders that actually show a relative measure of your skill are only visible to your allies. Summoner icons rarely ever show your skill level. I think anyone who's played for a while knows that ~~skinsgetwins~~, Even if they have championship skins, that still doesn't mean they're good at that champ. Honor badges are a bit different. They were all meant to signify someone has good conduct, but the red one is often used to say \"you played well,\" BUT people can play a lot of aram and get ribbons and shit for wrecking on Urgot, Kat, etc. No fear needed.
