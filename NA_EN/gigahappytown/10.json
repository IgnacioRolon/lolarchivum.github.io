Little bit history, Lee Sin's ability to ward jump was a glitch. It was never intended to be that way and this can be seen in his design. Imagin Lee Sin without ward jumps. He is a much different champion with a lot less mobility. But instead or removing it(well they did bug fix it only to undo it right after if I am correct) they embraced it and made it a key part of Lee Sin's kit. They liked the interaction enough that on the Kat rework they made it so Kat could ward jump, where as before she could not.\n\nRiven's animation canceling is not a bug, it's not a glitch, it's an unintended feature. She, from my understanding, was not released with animation canceling in mind, but once it really came to light Riot embraced it and balanced around it rather than cutting it. If Riven could not animation cancel she would just not be very good at higher elo in many cases. But say they have to buff all her numbers by 5% to compensate her she would be more powerful in lower elo where people don't animation cancel. Canceling gives better players tools to make plays while effectively nerfing sub optional Riven play that is seen in lower elo. It makes her less face roll to play.\n\nSo TLDR, animation canceling it a healthy thing for Riven, and it is not a bug or glitch. If your pissed at Riven and think she is BS, I'm not saying your right or wrong in that, just that your looking at the wrong part of her kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Gigahappytown","date":"2015-12-03T20:10:47.928+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":8,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PotatoMine,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kMYRwfcU,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2015-12-03T19:40:56.814+0000)\n>\n> Riven's animation cancels are a lot like ward jumping.
