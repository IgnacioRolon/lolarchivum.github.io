It can be as simple thing as they losing their Toplane. The Toplaner flamed the Jungle they were are Inbred. This report didn't come through.\n\nOr 2 premades flaming and gossiping the entire game, despite being carried and every kill you make was a KS. They die, you are trash, because you didn't save them when they went in 2 vs 5. You can save your Toplaner but they ping you not to do it. You listen, you lose. \nSo at the end game I muted them, knowing what I read through early and midgame so I can type a concrete report.\nThe report didn't came through. \n\nSo this leaves one to either go to preban Tyler1 mode or to quit Leauge for its low social standards. \n\nBut yeah, let's lose all social standards.","replies":[]}]}]}
