So, low and behold, every time I've tried to get into a game, it's crashed.\r\n\r\nWorks fine on the champion select screen, but when it goes full screen to take you into the game, BAM, send that error report!\r\n\r\nSo, hoping there's a fix. On the second game that I've ' Abandoned ' due to this bug, and attempting different ways to fix it.
