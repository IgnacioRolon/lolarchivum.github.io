Today I try and login and I get prompted to  \"name summoner\"  WTF Where is my summoner?  I tried entering the summoner name I already have and it said it was already taken.  So I entered a new one, thinking maybe they just needed me to rename it (the my summoner name as kinda gross).  I did, and Its a brand new summoner...How do i get my summoner back with my lvls, champions and IP/RP etc.???!?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-10-02T05:00:31.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Elias85!\n\nI can only imagine your \"WTF?!?!\" moment when you tried to log in!  I have seen cases like this in the past, and rest assured, your account was not reset.  Typically this occurs when you enter the wrong Username into the Log-in screen.  Essentially, you created a Smurf account in the past with the Username you are entering, but never actually logged into the League of Legends client to pick a Summoner Name for it.  Your Level 18 account still exists, it is just under a different username.\n\nIf you need help remembering it, please do not hesitate to reply back, and make sure that you provide your original Summoner Name that you remember being used on your Level 18 account!","replies":[]}]}
