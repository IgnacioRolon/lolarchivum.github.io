One of our friends cannot join because it says \"(player name) cannot join the club because he hasn't played a game\" but when he has played several games. This happens when we invite him to the club. My friend is a level 8 so I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it. All help is appreciated. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\n-MySlicLife","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-19T22:09:20.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure about this one, unfortunately.
