What do you think? Would you like to see it on a support?","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-03-09T20:28:00.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not really a good support ability tbh unless the support has a way of gapclosing and holding the enemy down alongside it, and if it's made to have similar numbers to what Morde has, then it'll be op. The only reason it works on Morde is because he's immobile and is designed to share a lane with something like Blitzcrank so he can't really use it fully himself.","replies":[{"poster":"thefatlazycat","date":"2019-03-10T18:34:12.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I suppose","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-03-09T16:14:03.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see why you like it.
