This is really frustrating since everytime I crash it increases the time leavebuster bans me for. Usually, the things that cause the game to not respond are clicking on one of the champion's icon (it pulls up the champions stats, abilities, lore...), editing masteries and runes, and changing skins. Also, in the ranked champion select, sometimes the HUD gets screwed up as everything is all over the place. The minimap isn't where its supposed to be, you can't see any champions or your runes and masteries and summoner spells. Overall, again, I don't know if it's just me but I would appreciate it if you would fix this {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-16T21:20:51.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems that you may be experiencing a connection issue that is preventing you from participating in champion select or downloading assets while in-game.
