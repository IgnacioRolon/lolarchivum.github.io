That'd be kind of interesting, but they'd have to buff every evolved ability to compensate probably. Though evolved Q seems more like waveclear machine, while evolved W seems like the burstier option, and evolved E seems like the kiting option. She'd also likely need to go attackspeed+AD or attackspeed+AP. meaning she'd always have evolved E.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eranell","date":"2018-10-10T15:40:54.686+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"First neft that is due on her is to make allies unable to apply her plasma stacks.

The only champion on which this sort of feature truly worked on so far IMO is Sej because even if she doesn't have to apply the first stack of Permafrost herself it has to be a melee champion with an auto attack which isn't always easy to pull of.

I don't think the concept itself is problematic, and I don't think it needs to be removed from Kai'Sa. I think she would be a lot more reasonable with number tweaks, like reduced base damages, increased scalings, and allowing her abilities to evolve at numbers other than 100.","replies":[{"poster":"Moonshade","date":"2018-10-10T18:06:25.580+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to see her passive changed a little bit to make her less of a lane bully, make it kinda like a Braum Passive: Allies can build stacks on enemies but You have to apply stack #1. Maybe change it at level 6 to remove that restriction so you can use your ulti for long range dive/engage like its designed for. Heck maybe even change it so her whole \"Allies apply Plasma\" effect of her passive is tied to her ultimate, so it won't work until level 6, that way her early game is weaker and you have a greater window to try and put her behind","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BugsLivesMatters","date":"2018-10-10T10:37:05.412+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Quality content right there my good sir.
