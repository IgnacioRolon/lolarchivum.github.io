They both suck, and I'm sorry you have to deal with it, but hopefully you at least mute the players once they start in, and report them post-game.\n\nFor receiving flak for your screenname - it's kinda just a thing of Yasuo and Yasuo mains having a bad rep. Yasuo is one of those Champions who, due to his high skill ceiling and moderate skill curve, attracts some unfortunately toxic players to main him.\n\nOf course, not everyone who mains or plays Yasuo is toxic by a longshot, but, for some reason, katana-wielding swordsmen seem to attract some bad folk. Dunno why.\n\nFor receiving flak for your build - you're building Attack Speed on Gnar, which, in and of itself, isn't a bad build, it's just really uncommon. Gnar may be a tank/bruiser primarily, but he is also a marksman, and his kit does facilitate both tank and marksman playstyles, albeit, for obvious reasons, the tank style is much, much more popular.\n\nDon't let people discourage you from building what you want, though. If you want to build attack speed and capitalize on your _Hyper_, go for it. Nobody can force you to play what they want. so if they start chewing you out for building AS Gnar, just mute them, report them post-game, and enjoy your 100% _Hyper_ uptime and damage bursts.","replies":[{"poster":"ImGodlyatYasuo","date":"2018-02-16T01:35:46.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But isnt morgana a hard champion too why dont people hate her? Or what about darius or illaoi those players are like gods always 1 vs 3ing and stuff why dont people hate them as much:?","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-02-16T09:01:06.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of those three, I'd say that Illaoi has the highest skill curve, with Morgana close behind. Darius is, without a doubt, the easiest of them.\n\nThat said, people do hate Darius, and there are quite a handful of people who hate Illaoi, too. Though, the majority of them are oft on the receiving end of a 1v6~ tentacle beatdown, so, I digress.\n\nUltimately, you'll probably find that Champions who fall under \"high skill curve/ceiling\" and \"so easy a five year-old could play it\" generally have a rep for toxic players. Examples include Yasuo, Riven, Kalista, and Ezreal for the former, and Master Yi and Darius for the latter.\n\nAlthough, in my experience, people's hate for certain Champions is variable, and always subjective. Some people could hate the Champion for their kits, others could hate them for their playerbase, and some altogether could hate them for some inexplicable reason.\n\nWhatever the case, the endpoint is still the same; those people who voice their hate just need to be muted and disregarded.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2018-02-16T02:54:22.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao that's pretty hilarious. Man if you're being real, you've got a lot to learn. Seems you don't even know the basics and that's rough... are you building attack speed and damage on AP champs? Do you even know What AP is? Given that your bro trolled you, I doubt he's gonna teach you how to play, so you better go watch some videos n shit or something.
