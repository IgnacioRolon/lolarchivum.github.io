My apologies if it has but, MOVING ON\n\nWith Garen&#039;s rework coming up in the next patch it got me wondering how his W would scale in other game modes that don&#039;t have heavy emphasis on CS-ing like on Summoner&#039;s Rift.\n\nUsing ARAM as an example, CSing there tends to just be a happy accident from pushing the wave back at the enemy, and practically impossible for a melee champion [Garen included]. this makes his scaling W practically useless.\n\nSame goes for Dominion but, lol Dominion\n\nWould he get similar treatment like Gangplank does with generating Silver Serpents over time? Where Garen just poops out armor every minute or so?\nOr will he just get thrown under the bus for these game modes?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-17T00:35:06.935+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be straightforward, I dropped the ball on this one and it didn't really cross my mind or get suggested to me until after the branch cut.

For champions things like \n\nThis champ has a unique theme. \nThis champ has a unique kit and playstyle. \nThis champ has a lane that they can call home. \nThis champ is fun to play as. \nThis champ is fun to have as a teammate. \nThis champ is fun to play against. \nThis champ has strong and weak phases of the game (early mid late). \nThis champ has effective trading patterns. \nThis champ has counter-able trading patterns. \nThis champ is a counter to specific champions. (list them)\nThis champ is countered by specific champions. (list them)\nThis champ works on dominion. \nThis champ works on aram. \nThis champ works on TT. \n\nI don't mean to gripe on your or other rioters because overall i feel like you guys hit most of these points most of the time but sometimes you guys overlook what should be foreseeable problems. Putting a 15-20 question barrier to putting content on the PBE could save some frustration for the community on occasion. While it might be frustrating for the dev who wants to see their content go out if they can't answer basic questions like these then maybe their content isn't ready to go out....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-08-17T15:27:11.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"could you guys get some BIG posters into riot HQ reminding you that there are other maps than Summoners?\nI think it was rather unneeded that GP got a compensation on that maps 1 patch after the release, despite multiple people mentioning his problems on other maps on PBE already.\nAnd i'm still waiting for a small adjustment on Devourer in TT, like 3 stacks for captureing the altar...faster paced map, less stacks aviable on the map, doesn't make much sense to me...or just a devourer that needs less stacks to complete but also offers less damage, as a completed sated is pretty scary for skirmishes, which happen alot in TT","replies":[]},{"poster":"SKOBODO","date":"2015-08-17T08:15:42.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could that something be stacks over time? Just increasing the scaling carries with it several issues. In ARAM, Garens that get to farm are going to be stronger than Garens that don't, which could cause some trouble. Some Garens might get frustrated at their team for \"stealing cs\" and lash out at them.\n\nIn Dominion, having it scale with cs might force Garen players to push top in order to keep up, but proper Dominion gameplay is more about fighting in the jungle and ganking bot than pushing top. Good Garens usually average around 20 cs per game or so in Dominion. Furthermore, bot lane Garens might become too strong if the ratio per minion is increased, since bot laners actually do get a lot of farm. We've seen it happen before with bot lane Thresh.\n\nThe GP solution seems to work fine. Give Garen some stacks over time and he'll probably be in an okay spot, without being overpowered or awkward to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aezeraith","date":"2015-08-17T03:42:56.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aE5jIgiJ,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-08-17T00:35:06.935+0000)\n>\n> To be straightforward, I dropped the ball on this one and it didn't really cross my mind or get suggested to me until after the branch cut.
