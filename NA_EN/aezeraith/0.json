Or is it just, tough luck sorry unintended nerf?\n\nEdit: Also to all the people saying \"GOOD HES OP NERF\" thats not the point of this thread, I'm not complaining if hes OP or to buff him, I just wanted to know if Riot was aware of this interaction. \n\nJesus people","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-11-14T05:15:16.123+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thresh being more vulnerable to the revised Last Whisper set of items is something we're aware of and watching, but not something we felt needed to be pre-emptively compensated for before the preseason release.

A few thoughts:\n\n•SAME AS IT EVER WAS.   only one maybe two at most per team are likely to be built.  In a heads up duel situation late game vs an ADC or top/JNG.. thresh was already unfavorable in most match ups.\n\n•BE FLEXIBLE.   I like to balance my thresh as per every game.  Once in awhile I'll build dmg like a BOTRK, or Maw of Mal.   You won't be any closer to killing Mundo, but your getting sustain and damage.  \n\n•DONT STRESS JUST BE THRESH.  After early / mid game you might not be able to mix it up trading autos and such.  STACKING ARMOR WONT remedy this now just like it didn't before.  You need mobility, you need map awareness, you need your team.  And let's be honest lucky skills shots or skilled luck shots.  Hook flays under tower.  Good engages.  Lanterns.  Bread and butter 101.\n\n\n\nIf you are the only tank yes the changes hurt.  I'm thinking Ninja tab's, frozen heart are a decent fix for armor PEN.  Dead mans plate to replace the mobi boots.  All done.  \n\nTLDR. Don't gripe that the meta became unbalanced.  Predict the Meta, change with the meta, trailblaze a new meta.","replies":[]}]}]}
