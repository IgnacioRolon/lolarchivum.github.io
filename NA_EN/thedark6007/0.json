Pretty much the only way it's going to happen is if you actually STEAL from them...and even then, it's not a PERMANENT ban first of all, and it's only from that one store/INCREDIBLY difficult for them to enforce (kinda like Riot being unable to stop the people they ban from making new accounts)\n\nYou can get banned from LoL if you tell the person flaming yourself OR your teammates to stfu, and/or just generally shit on them...and on that note, idc what any of you say, it IS possible to make trolls stfu and stop just by talking shit to them and making them realize what a piece of shit they are. I've seen it done countless times.  Sure, it's some sort of twisted vigilante 'justice' lol, but it works and you can't argue that. (Not saying it works ALL the time, but if it's bothering other players they can simply mute very easily)\n\nAll I'm saying is that they are fighting a futile battle. It's literally impossible to end trolling lol...I literally compare this to the war on Terror. You can't fight a war against terror and ever actually 'win.' All Riot is doing is sending in drone-strikes, and creating 'home-grown' trolls, because more often than not, the people who get banned end up going on some sort of 'crusade' out of spite, and make it their mission to show Riot what toxic ACTUALLY is.
