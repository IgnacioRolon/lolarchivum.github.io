(ex. blitz lands 1st hook 20mins in and says hes carrying or leona running 1/2 the map away from anyone, flash spearing and says u dont follow up","replies":[{"poster":"FullmuteAll play","date":"2018-02-28T04:46:55.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ever heard about offensive supports ? {{champion:432}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:89}}  etc\nI am not sure what is fun about full utility supports like {{champion:117}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:40}} . But as for offensive and playmaking supports you can win games playing them, I don't agree with the statement , that supports can carry, but you are able to win games playing an important role in this.\nYour example is biased and made for the purpose of highlighting uselessness, while far not all blitz land 1st hook in 20 min , far not all Leonas running 1/2 yadayadayada.\nYou have to have a skill to make plays.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-02-28T04:40:45.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best way to climb is to shotcall and make sure your team gets fed. Jungle and supports do this best, just junglers have WAY more map presence.\n\nThe difference being supports keep the 4 knuckleheads on the team alive to hopefully succeed \n\nOR\n\nAre the ones to pull the trigger for the 5v5 fight. Also because map awareness. If you play ones like soraka or shen, its a must.\n\nIts basically just that thankless role, because getting people leads isnt usually something thats noticed. Another reason is because when you switch from a more \"exciting\" role, you dont feel like you do much of anything other then stand behind the \"gifted\" adc and keep them topped off. Most obviousley with soraka.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-28T04:39:06.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play support because draft 2.0 made mid main unplayable.\n\nSo i just play mid in botlane, carrying the shit out of the unsuspecting ADC pretty often.\n\nMost traditional supports dont have highly visible impact, it is hard to see how well they are doing, especially for a player that has no support experience.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hencho101","date":"2018-02-28T04:23:33.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Support can be fun to some people. The TRUE support mains enjoy seeing their team succeeding, they don't want any kind of credit. They enjoy being able to save anyone they want and they enjoy not having to worry about last hits or getting the kills. And their late game is MUCH less stressful than the ADC or Mid. And the supports who want ALL the credit, well... those are the good support mains. Sorry to anyone who does this, but... The players are usually meh at the game and support is the only role they can play and not feed their assess off in any other lane.","replies":[]}]}
