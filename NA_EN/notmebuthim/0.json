I've had multiple games where I've been practically camped by the enemy Jungler. So much so, that I usually change my mindset from \"I'm in a 1v1 laning phase\" to \"I'm in a 1v2 laning phase\".\n\nOne would think and/or believe that with the enemy jungler being top side almost all game, my other lanes would use [or be able to use] that to their advantage. But alas, somehow the enemy bot lane is always getting fed, during these times. This ensures that the enemy jungler can continue to camp me since, for one, they have that stupid \"catch-up\" experience crap so no matter how long they stay in my lane, they'll still be able to farm enough camps to be on even footing. And two, they don't have to worry about their other lanes because they're already getting fed on their own.\n\nI've tried everything to remedy this. Requesting \"flank\" wards bot-side (and actually following through), warding my river so the enemy mid can't roam to me, freezing my lane in hopes that it will help me farm against 2 people, etc. But nothing ever works. Bot Lane still dying repeatedly.\n\nNo matter how I try to ignore it or hope that it's something else, it always comes back around to:\n\n\"Did your Bot Lane get fed?\" ---> \"Yes? Well, then you win by default.\"\n\n\"Did your Bot Lane feed?\" ---> \"Yes? Well, then you lose by default.\"\n\nIt's the only reason why I only play Top Lane on rare occasions. And that sucks for me, because I enjoy the themes of all the Top Lane champions. I honestly miss the ol' days of Top Lane where you started on that island as Chomper from The Land Before Time, and left that island as Godzilla.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stormshadow3503","date":"2017-08-14T16:00:56.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"....
