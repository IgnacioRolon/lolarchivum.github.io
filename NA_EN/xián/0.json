I have 14 cores and I need 18 because 7 for the Ekko border and 11 for the Yasuo skin shard. Also, I have 2 augmented fragments which is annoying me because I only need one more. If there aren't any more ways to get project cores what should I choose?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-09T23:48:29.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you grab the Disruption cache that came out today? I'm assuming you did because you mention the Yasuo skin shard, but I thought I'd ask just in case.","replies":[{"poster":"Xián","date":"2016-08-10T00:19:32.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I did.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-10T15:39:34.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got it. So other than spending RP to purchase augmented caches to get more PROJECT cores, there's no way to get more at this point. I really like the PROJECT Yasuo skin, but if you're an Ekko main, you may want to unlock that loading border since it's a limited item. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions~","replies":[{"poster":"Spiff0r","date":"2016-08-14T18:03:53.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"at this point..... so in the future there will be a way, just with IP? or something to receive in the store with IP would be great. I always am sitting on tons of IP that isnt used, this Core deal was a good idea with the purchase of IP also","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
