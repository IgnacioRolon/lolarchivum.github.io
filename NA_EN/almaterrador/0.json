When we were selecting champions I received several times (almost like in a spam way) that \"An error ocurred, bla bla\". When the countdown timer reached 0 the game didn't start from me so I decided to close the game. When I try to log back in the client stuck at \"Authenticating\". I tried to log in with the legacy client, nothing. I have to add that I was speaking with my friend through Discord while I was having this issue so I had an internet connection. Fastforward 20 minutes the game is about to end and I can't log back in. As soon as I log in into the League of Legends webpage, the client launches the game an can finally play. Two minutes later I lose the match and get leaverbuster because of this.  Which logs am I supposed to read in order to find out what went wrong? Is there a way a can get \"pardoned\" from getting leaverbuster {{champion:32}}  ?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-18T17:40:55.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a network problem that lost sync during champ select, and now having trouble specifically reaching our authentication and game servers.  I'm not sure that your specific issue is exclusive to the updated client, so I would recommend going through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your network is in good shape.
