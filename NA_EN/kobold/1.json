Hopefully we will have a fix soon, but this is one of those pesky problems that would take a substantial amount of work to address (the thing that causes this issue prevents other, more serious bugs I believe) and the although this can be frustrating to have happen, there are other more serious bugs that are higher impact.\n\nIn the future if you can tag issues like this with [GAMEPLAY] in the title and follow the guildelines [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/lFlBYLgA-how-to-report-a-bug) I will be able to sort through bugs and get work towards getting them resolved faster.","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2014-09-24T07:21:38.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"can't you add an EXCEPTION for sightstone specifically?","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2014-09-24T11:35:36.091+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":".... if programming was this easy...","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2014-09-24T19:49:22.078+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":".....it really is?\n\nDo you even program bro?\n\nYou would basically take the old code for the undo button, and do this:\n\nif(item == sightstone) {\n<insert new exception code here>\nelse {\n<insert old code here>\n}","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2014-09-24T20:42:35.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, calm down.\n\n\nEvery thing is made of functions, and functions into functions. If you reread the red post you can see that the main problem lies in this interwining of functions: if they do something to the undo function, posing that it' s only a single function for example' s sake,  they need to tuch all the other ramificated functions, that by their own prevent even worse bugs. Exceptions like you say might be done, probably, but with very and very high costs in performance and chaos in the code, so that it' s a move that needs to be done only for critical, game breaking bugs.\nNow i don' t know how and how much is interwined the undo function, but i guess neither you do. And if a professional that works right on the project tells Riot Afic of this situation in this way  i don' t really think how you can even be barely more right than him.\n\nIf you just want to sit behind your screen and say that at Riot are just lazy, then you are welcome to do so but don' t expect somebody to follow.","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2014-09-24T22:06:13.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure the \"more serious bug\" that is being prevented is \"using the undo button to refresh active items or GA by selling them and undoing it\".\n\nAs a programmer and a gamer who has seen several game bugs, without knowing anything else about the code, that would be my first guess.\n\nAnd I'm not just sitting behind my screen and saying that Riot is lazy.
