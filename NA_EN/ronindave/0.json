When you get reported after a game, you never get any kind of notification. And you are never able to say anything in defence in the trial. \r\nI think that this is a feature that needs to be inmplemented. When you get reported you should be able to see a notification, simmilar to the one you get when you are honored. And one you click in it should show you the details of the report, not the name of the person who reported you, but the reason they have had given. And there should be an option to add a pledge of your own, if you fealt that the accusation was not fair, which would be visible in the trial case. \r\nIn adition to making the trial more fair, it would encourage positive behaviour, since you would get an immediate feedbak when you upset someone and you could adjust your bahaviour accordigly; and whats more reading a genuine reaction to your negative behaviour would be more &#039;real&#039;.\r\nI have been punished by the trial once with the low priority queue. And I did not really take anything from it. I did not know why I was punished and the verdict probably came a lot overdue, so I really did not remeber the incident I got reported for in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-23T10:12:30.471+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"LPQ's arent given for negative behavior, they are given for leaving games.\n\nThings like afking, never connecting, or disconnecting for a signifigant ammount of time even if you come back.\n\nThere is no reason to allow a defense in the trial because it is judged objectively by the automated system. If you are innocent the case is thrown out.\n\nYou are shown chat logs when you are punished through it, up to three games of recent games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2016-10-23T19:44:49.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're serious? Okay, so by that logic, if an armed robber goes into a convenience store and steals all the money out of the cash register, he should know when the police are informed of the crime so he can go down to the station and plead his case.\n\nSeriously, you make me laugh.\n\nThe rules are simple. Don't cheat and don't treat people badly. If you cannot follow those rules then you don't belong in this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-10-23T13:52:52.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with being able to see why you got validly reported and thus may help change behavior early even before a punishment (though it can give opportunities for toxics to game the system and know what they can get away with).\n\nYou don't need a trial system with how the automated system works.","replies":[]}]}
