I also know a couple other people who got them who had never had them before, weren't toxic people and weren't flaming those games. My question is, has the system suddenly got a hell of a lot more strict? If so, why weren't players notified of this? Never have I see a post saying \"this is what is considered toxic\", which I think should be advertised if this is how strict they're going to be. Not once did I insult anyone this game, and I was continuously positive towards the non-toxic team members. \r\n\r\nWith my chat bans, I was playing Ahri mid. Throughout the game I was constructively communicating with my teammates, all except for an Urgot top, who was constantly flaming me throughout the game because I chose to help bot instead of top.\r\n\r\nSide notes: \r\nIgnore the first couple messages, I was joking around with a premade.\r\nWhen I said \"aHrI yOu ArE nOoB\" I was quoting Urgot when he called me a noob, right after i got a triple kill or something.\r\nThroughout the WHOLE game, including post-game where he said he was going to report me, this guy was saying I was trolling, calling me a noob, saying I was trash etc. I think at one point he started insulting my personal life too, but I don't remember 100%.\r\n\r\nI got chat bans for this:\r\n\r\nPre-Game\r\nPartyWolfGaming: Relatable name\r\nPartyWolfGaming: The amount of times ive died just to get a ward\r\nPartyWolfGaming: this damn ward scoring system is deadly\r\nPartyWolfGaming: ner wards\r\nPartyWolfGaming: nerf*\r\nIn-Game\r\nPartyWolfGaming: yeah his bollocks stink atm\r\nPartyWolfGaming: can smell them from across the room\r\nPartyWolfGaming: sweaty league\r\nPartyWolfGaming: i pinged it\r\nPartyWolfGaming: wtf\r\nPartyWolfGaming: dude\r\nPartyWolfGaming: i was pushed up with a massive wavbe\r\nPartyWolfGaming: wave\r\nPartyWolfGaming: im not missing on 2 levels to help your suicide mission\r\nPartyWolfGaming: wp bot\r\nPartyWolfGaming: i will help when i can bot\r\nPartyWolfGaming: 0/2\r\nPartyWolfGaming: \"aHrI yOu ArE nOoB\"\r\nPartyWolfGaming: i ss\r\nPartyWolfGaming: that should be enough\r\nPartyWolfGaming: i was on my way top\r\nPartyWolfGaming: but first i defended my tower\r\nPartyWolfGaming: stop questioning my judgement when you are feeding\r\nPartyWolfGaming: vi top\r\nPartyWolfGaming: ty jinx &lt;3\r\nPartyWolfGaming: what\r\nPartyWolfGaming: i was pinging you to tell you corki was coming\r\nPartyWolfGaming: youre welcome kiddo\r\nPartyWolfGaming: why\r\nPartyWolfGaming: meh\r\nPartyWolfGaming: bad call\r\nPartyWolfGaming: mb\r\nPartyWolfGaming: ?\r\nPartyWolfGaming: i said mb\r\nPartyWolfGaming: and i said mb\r\nPartyWolfGaming: i know it was stupid\r\nPartyWolfGaming: thats why i said mb\r\nPartyWolfGaming: why do you have a problem with me\r\nPartyWolfGaming: then chill out\r\nPartyWolfGaming: 2/5\r\nPartyWolfGaming: wp\r\nPartyWolfGaming: hahahhaah\r\nPartyWolfGaming: the 3/7 suicidal urgot is calling the 15/1/8 \"trash\" constantly hahahaha\r\nPartyWolfGaming: then why am i 15/1/10 and you are feeding hahahaha\r\nPartyWolfGaming: gg wp\r\nPartyWolfGaming: report urgot for flame please\r\nPost-Game\r\nPartyWolfGaming: 16/1/12 and only S- :C\r\nPartyWolfGaming: haha please do urgot\r\nPartyWolfGaming: nice to see you get banned :)\r\nPartyWolfGaming: silver 3 tbh\r\nPartyWolfGaming: not far off you kiddo\r\nPartyWolfGaming: 3/7\r\nPartyWolfGaming: 10K more damage than you\r\nPartyWolfGaming: i carried your arse :*\r\nPartyWolfGaming: xdxd\r\nPartyWolfGaming: u feed all game\r\nPartyWolfGaming: this is so funny\r\nPartyWolfGaming: hahaha\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease tell me if the system has changed and if I deserve chat bans and if so, why.\r\nMuch appreciated :)","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-04-11T21:51:12.824+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"What in the world is happening with some of these posts that get up and/or downvoted 20 times in 30 seconds?","replies":[{"poster":"Lejía tuttifruti","date":"2019-04-11T21:52:50.121+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mafia?","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2019-04-11T22:22:41.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I second that vote.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Death Rex","date":"2019-04-11T22:21:57.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yakuza","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-04-12T00:10:07.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there's a new upvote site or something.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Boltonator","date":"2019-04-11T23:29:22.342+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Saying in /all chat to report someone is considered report-griefing/inciteful actions.
