Maybe he could be changed a little, but I love his core kit now.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-09-04T08:28:46.982+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"We don't have any plans to change Blitz at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"Flash to KS","date":"2015-09-04T18:44:14.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, Meddler.
