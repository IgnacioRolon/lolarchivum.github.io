I played a few times over the years but never really get anywhere.\r\n\r\nI spun up LOL today and it was crashing just as the game was supposed to start.  Every time I hit reconnect, it would do the same thing.  Apparently I am in a \"bad queue\" now?  wtf?\r\n\r\nSo I uninstalled, updated my drivers, deleted the game folder, rebooted.\r\n\r\nI think there are two applications... one is the launcher and one is the game.....\r\nAfter reinstalling  I was getting a blank dark blue launcher, so I ended the task and noticed orphaned processes in my task manager, so I killed them.  After restarting I got a small updater screen that looked like a designer from a different company drew it and BIG \"PLAY >\" button that looks nothing like the rest of the application.  After clicking \"PLAY >\" the launcher never loads....\r\n\r\nRan the launcher as admin and got ANOTHER update in the top left corner of the 'normal' launcher.\r\n\r\nWhat is this garbage?  Doesn't this company have just ONE job -- to make LOL?\r\n\r\nNOTE: Before reinstalling, yes, I did mess with the game CFG file.  And that brings up another gripe -- Why can't I change the game graphics from the launcher?  You can change absolutely EVERYTHING else.  So, I have to load vs AI games to test.  I can't even test on replays because all I have is vs AI games in the past and the game won't let me replay them.\r\n\r\nHow does any of this pass quality control?  I've honestly never seen anything like it (not a good thing).  I'm not posting this in \"bug report\" because a quick Google search will tell you that nobody at Riot takes the time to fix these reoccurring bugs with the 1+Billion dollars they have to make ONE game.","replies":[]}
