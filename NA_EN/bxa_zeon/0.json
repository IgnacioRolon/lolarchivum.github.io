There haven't been any server side interruptions today as far as I'm aware, but there's a pretty good chance that this might be happening from packet loss. \n\nIf you could, check out this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) using the logs from the latest game that lagged and take a screenshot to post here for us to look over together. That'll let me know if the main issue is packet loss or not, and tell us how we should troubleshoot.","replies":[]}]}
