Whenever I'm playing and just walking around, I go from 70 ping to 150 for like 3 seconds and then it gradually falls back to 70, then in another 3 seconds it shoots back up. That's not bad, I can play with that. But when I'm playing, I Swear to god it's like I'm being lag switched. Every action I see on my screen, every attack, minion movement, enemy movement, anything makes it jump straight up to 1000 then I can't do anything but move around for like 6 seconds. I swear it's the weirdest thing. I can't explain it well, but when it happens, the minions are still moving, but they just keep doing that attack action even when they aren't attacking anything. If a turret, minion, or champion is killed while it's happening, they'll be standing there doing a running action if they were running, or an attack action if they were attacking. Just repeating that same action till my ping is back. Also, the turret keeps its red dot on an enemy even if the enemy is dead, or just standing still doing nothing because that's all I see while I'm lagging. I can't be the only person who experiences this. I use to be just fine, good ol 70 ping. And other games I play get good ping, internet runs pretty fast (my wifi isn't that great) and this pisses me off so much.\r\n\r\nI remember one time in particular during a fight, I was playing alistar and right when I w'd, everything was completely still. They moved to where they clicked, then stood there doing nothing, or were just standing still the whole time if they didn't click anywhere to move before I lagged. And so then I right clicked on mid lane on the map, seeing if I could move, but I couldn't. Then after about 10 seconds, I moved to mid lane super fast like I had 10000 speed, then teleported back to where I Was when I lagged, then teleported back and was all good and jolly till my usual lag spike. My team won the fight and we ended up winning cause the enemy ff'd. But I really wish this would stop, cause it's been happening frequently, and I really don't think it's my ping. I feel like the enemy is lag spiking me. This was long, and if you read the whole thing, thanks, and peace. ;]\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-10T17:11:48.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you still have these latency issues if you bypass your wireless connection and try a wired (ethernet) connection directly to your modem?

But I really don't think that's the problem, when the lag only starts when there is a lot of abilities, spells, etc happening. It can't be using much internet to load the actions. I think it may have to do with packet loss, maybe the actions that me and other people are doing don't go back to me (Not really sure how it works).","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-11T17:06:13.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you have some time, I definitely recommend working through that connection guide to see if anything changes.
