Stay focused on keeping cool and you'll get your rewards back**.\"\n\nAs I remember correctly I've had issues with Nvidia graphics card driver in the past and it caused me to not join in to 2-3 games so I've got low priority Queue but I've never got chat restrictions or anythong else. But that's some weeks ago, I am playing everyday and every 2nd game I will always get honor or two so what's up with this.\n\nCan some Riot employee look at this or I should use support ticket ?\n\nPhoto: https://i.imgur.com/HrCsXYI.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-19T20:33:25.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) penalty would not cause this, but a behavioral occurrence can.    You can also receive a reform card with related logs upon relogging.  Looking into this for you, it looks like you received a set of chat restrictions which prompted the honor reset.
