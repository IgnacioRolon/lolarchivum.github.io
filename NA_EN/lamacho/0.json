Cheap developers.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-20T16:32:19.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, we can help here!  All of these issues that you're explaining happen for different reasons.  The black screen is most commonly an indication of your network struggling to reach the game server, so it can't download any assets.  The steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide should help fix that up.\n\nIf you're also having bug splats, let me know, as it sounds you have quite a combination of different issues.  I can definitely see that being frustrating!","replies":[{"poster":"LaMacho","date":"2017-09-30T17:06:24.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I downloaded adwcleaner and when scanning 7 problems/viruses appeared, so I cleanned them and sure some sites  load faster and LoL runs a bit faster too :D\n\nBut that didn't fix my issue. For example yesterday, I played 2 ranked flex with my 2 friends just fine. When one of my friend went sleeping, we hit the solo/duo Q and suddenly after the loading started working it just did that again... Black screen with only my cursor visible and after the loading was done I could hear sounds from the game...\n\nI have no idea what's going on and my brain just don't get it.\n\nOnce rebooting PC fixed this for a while\nUpgrading graphic drivers fixed this for a while\nALT + ENTER fix this just for window screen\n\nBut nothing can fix it for good. I am really desperate right now since I have low priority Q on 2 accounts already because of this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-30T17:29:51.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, sorry to hear this issue is still happening for you.  :(  I know you've tried a lot of steps, so let our tech team help you out directly.

My bad for pointing at Riot, sorry.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
