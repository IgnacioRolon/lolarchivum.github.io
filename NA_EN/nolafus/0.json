Ornn should get his unstoppable back and have his max hp damage reverted to current hp damage his cooldown on w should not be touched. Leave him in that state for 2 weeks he goes back to being a troll pick then you can touch other parts of his kit like giving Q and E ap scaling or giving e ad scaling. Removing the 1 second charge up from his e that he can be knocked out of his e  (either that or lower its cooldown) let ornns q travel faster upon cast things like that are what ornn needs not damage changes to damage and taking away his utility. his kit is just clunky and bad out side of his W  and it doesn't scale well either that made him win early lane some times but when he did he couldnt keep ahead because only his q scaled with ad and only his ult scaled with ap while his w didnt scale with anything but levels in it and his e 1 didnt hit hard even if you hit both parts and its armor and magic resist scaling was and is horrible","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BALDG1VEN BOOMER","date":"2018-02-03T18:24:49.874+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"How often does Riot revert nerfs they give?

Think Ryze and Azir for example, they don't have the most appealing of winrates, but you consistently see them picked at higher elos. The reason Ornn is oppressive in laning phase is aside from zoning off melee champions from farming with his W, the brittle debuff after he applies it lasts far too long. That is a six second window where you, early on, will most likely be unable to trade efficiently against Ornn or farm without pressure at all. Remember that it also does a burst of percent max hp added onto the amount of damage the W itself applies. Tanks should not be so oppressive early game.","replies":[{"poster":"vgamedude","date":"2018-02-04T04:15:37.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dreadlocke101,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wXMpHE4W,comment-id=000b00000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-02-04T01:50:05.574+0000)\n>\n> Winrates don&#x27;t clearly define how strong a champion is.
