It took a long time there because it took awhile to take an xray of her paw because she was in so much pain. They don&#039;t know what&#039;s the matter with her and she doesn&#039;t have a broken leg so it&#039;s probably something else. In the meantime she is on anti inflammatory medication and pain killers to see if that helps her out. I&#039;m still nervous about her because it&#039;s nothing as simple as a broken leg.\nI got to pet a lot of dogs today at least. \nThanks for the support guys, I didn't read your comments until I just got back home now.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Vlrq5XE.jpg","replies":[]}
