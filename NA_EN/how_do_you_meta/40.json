They love me and all, but they are just some of the worst people to deal with. They have constantly abused me, stole money from me, and kept sabotaging my future in so many ways that I don&#039;t want to relist them again. \r\n\r\nMy parents are like pizza or league of legends: you crave for it and unconditionally love it even though when you get it you regret it and its not worth it and all you are left with is feeling awful.\r\n\r\nI think that the sooner I am without these vile people, the more I can focus on what makes me me and carve out a brilliant future that I have been already working on by myself for awhile now.","replies":[]}
