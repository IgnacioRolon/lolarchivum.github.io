That&#039;s 8 days of food for me, thank you Whole Foods. \n\nEating healthy and organic isn&#039;t as expensive as people make it out to be, maybe it was because it was just a bunch of veggies and meat and not premade food and I cook my meals instead.\n\nIn other words, $3.75 a meal for healthy wholesome goodness that is cheaper than fast food.\n\nEdit: It's at least cheaper in my area, I live in a different economy than some of you because of MA inflation, I cook my own food, and I am talking about eating healthy food at reasonable prices.","replies":[]}
