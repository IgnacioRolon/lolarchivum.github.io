It has been affecting gameplay and other people on my teams are also complaining about it is well. It is really hard to play around teleporting champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stephiroth","date":"2018-07-23T20:22:45.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"We are working on it :( Unfortunately this issue has been extremely difficult to pin down.","replies":[{"poster":"EyesOfTheFox","date":"2018-07-24T20:11:30.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it possible these bugs are related to the new cursor? There seem to have been a lot of bugs introduced during that same patch. Bugs including but not limited to the scoreboard no longer mirroring even though the option is selected.

It's pretty deep down tech, and we fixed a lot of issues with it during the dev cycle but there's definitely issues like these that have been uncovered :(\n\nWe're working on fixes for both of these!","replies":[{"poster":"EyesOfTheFox","date":"2018-07-25T13:18:36.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response!
