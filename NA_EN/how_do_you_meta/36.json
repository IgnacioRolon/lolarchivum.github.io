They can be in trinkets or maybe rito will let us buy wards again or we get another item slot for just wards/these enhanced wards that we can buy? \n\nWe can have the colors of the wards give a small tint to the wards or just color the center stone of the classic wards and their eye circles, it doesn't have to be harsh changes of color, except maybe black/white ward skins where the ward skin is blacked/whited out a bit.\n\nSome suggestions:\nBlack Wards: Places a stealthed ward that explodes if another enemy ward is in it&#039;s radius or placed in it&#039;s radius, destroying itself and all wards in the area. Ward&#039;s cannot be placed for 20 seconds in the explosion radius.\n\nWhite Wards: Enchants an existing ally ward on the battlefield, increasing the ward&#039;s vision radius. When the enchanted ward gets destroyed, it will be resurrected in 30 seconds without the enchantment.\n\nYellow Wards: These wards scream (mandrake wards) when a unit walks by them, revealing them in the process for a couple seconds, they do not provide vision though unless they detect intruders.\n\nOrange Wards: The visible wards&#039; vision walks in a small circle around the area they were placed, the ward is still in place.\n\nPurple Wards: Humongifies a ward, increasing it&#039;s size and slightly increasing it&#039;s vision radius, adds extra duration to the ward and gives it an extra hit point or two.\n\nRainbow Wards: Places a randomly colored ward onto the ground, if it is an enchantment ward it will enchant a green ward.\n\nFeel free to add your other suggestions for ward colors.","replies":[]}
