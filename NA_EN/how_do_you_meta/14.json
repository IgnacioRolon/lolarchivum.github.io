I also went on a road trip with my dad to return a Barnes and Nobles Book, it was unsuccessful but we had fun.\n\nI went rock climbing in a new place today.\nI expected more rock climbing but I was super tuckered out after 2 hours of 50 feet above ground rope obstacle course marathons. It was extremely exciting to climb around suspended rope courses and do stuff I never thought I could such as climbing a rope upside down with my legs or zip lining.\n\nI also made a new friend at the post climbing party! Today has been an awesome birthday :D","replies":[]}
