I think it is degrading and inhumane to restrict people from drinking water or going to the bathroom because they expect them to never use the facilities.\n\nIf this is going to become an ongoing problem, what do I do? I need to drink plenty of water, I already had a kidney stone last year, I don't want another one, I shouldn't even need to find an excuse to use the bathroom or drink water. Just because I use the bathroom doesn't mean I am not productive or working hard, it just means I have to piss.","replies":[]}
