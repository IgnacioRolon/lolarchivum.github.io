I shall block them both ping and text. That is what the muting option does. It cuts relationship between teams.

Do you realize how many disagreements people have, and how many people actually just shove blame, because they don't want to be blamed themselves? You trust them to be able to decide who deserves to be shamed? So when you get outplayed, they should make you feel bad for it, and that's a good thing? Idk, sounds like that would just spawn flame wars and arguments over who did what, when and why. In the middle of a match. No thank you. I think there are too many sensitive, insecure people for that to work. Keep your mouth shut and play the game please. That sounds much more productive than dwelling on mistakes made in the past.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Almo","date":"2017-10-16T15:47:34.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ahris,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=TsZGERB7,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-10-15T15:51:32.900+0000)\n>\n> I know some who mute others simply because he doesnt want to hear anything from him even though he said nothing toxic. \n> \n> Those people are refusing to communicate with team and defintetly reportable.

He also specifically said that he mutes \"Toxic\" people. He does not mute his team at start and even if he does that is not banable. You can communicate with pings.

It's perfectly fine to mute and refuse to respond in anyway.
