What I care about is when people try to believe that their own subjective opinion is the right way of life and that people who have their own lives are bad and try to witch hunt them.\n\nI would rather have my future children (if any) be Lee Sin \"mains\" than have them become drug addicts, alcoholics, smokers, or die of the next STI the Illuminati thinks up of next and injects into a few unsuspecting sexaholics when they are getting their \"flu shots\" to start the next epidemic to force funding charities to donate to their cause to continue controlling the world or god forbid they actually watch Reality Television and become brainwashed into thinking they can be movie stars or whatnot in order to be shipped off to Hollywood to have their organs and lifeforce harvested so the Illuminati can keep Angelina Jolie live past 500, but that is my opinion and if they do those things I will try to help them if they ask for it and if they refuse it it is up to them to make their choices, I can't force someone to not do something or do something and telling someone not to do something can only make them want to do it more, I will be sad if someone gets hurt out of it but at least I would have tried to help.\n\nThere is no \"right\" way to live life, whatever you like and floats your boat is fine with me because each person is a different individual and it is none of my fucking business on what they like and it is not like I can change their minds, unless you are harming others physically with acts of terrorism (instantlocking doesn't count), as long as you can function and provide for yourself and others if needed, you are fine.","replies":[]}
