No victorious skin had that much effort put into it as much as a current 1820 (sorry Magnificent Twisted Fate) RP or ultimate skin. I mean the hextech skins are worth hundreds of dollars and they are just 1350 RP quality skins that are exclusive. The only skin with any remote effort put into it was victorious Morgana and no one uses that skin because ~~no one plays her~~ she has a surprisingly really great line of skins (and delicious splash arts). Victorious Elise, Janna, J4, and Sivir had basically no more effort put into it than a 750 RP to 950 RP skin. Maokai had some effort put into it but it wasn&#039;t anything stellar. \n3. It&#039;s exclusive loot, there are still thousands of scrubs who can&#039;t get out of silver\n4. You get border trim and potentially a victorious ward skin which again is free\n5. Riot is not going to put too much effort in giving away a 100% free skin because what is the point in spending that many resources on something that you have absolutely no gains back from it\n6. You won&#039;t quit league of legends because you played 1600 games to get a free skin. You might on the other hand be banned from league of legends if your attitude is just as whiny and obnoxious on the forums/reddit about getting free content. Unlike the obnoxious missions that ask you to play a 5 man melee team on SR for 5 tokens, you just have to be decent at this game and climb a ranked ladder.\n7. You don&#039;t even play Graves, so why are you complaining at all?\n\nSeriously it's like this every year and somehow people are still surprised.","replies":[]}
