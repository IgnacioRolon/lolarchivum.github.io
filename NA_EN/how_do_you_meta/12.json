I will be going to the vet in an hour. It was so painful to visit her and see her on the floor with only wiggling her tail slightly when I came to her and pet her. I held her in my arms and tried my best to put on a brave face in front of her and kissed the little white spot on her head (she's a shih'tzu and has that blaze) and she tried to lick my nose back. This isn't the first time she was in agony. A couple years ago she almost died from pyometra and that made me cry for weeks and I let her sleep in my bed.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/7OCpxsb.jpg","replies":[]}
