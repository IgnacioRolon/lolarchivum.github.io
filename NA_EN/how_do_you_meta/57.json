Likewise I could have built BOC, but my team has no trouble pushing and it again offers peanut HP and MR.\n\nI could have built Banshees, but that item is shit in ARAM, there are spells flying around the map at all times so it will always be popped. \n\nSpirit Visage gives me 500 HP, 10% CDR, 70 MR, and 150% base regen, while the unique passive does not stack, those give me all the stats a beefy tank like Tahm needs for only one item slot.","replies":[]}
