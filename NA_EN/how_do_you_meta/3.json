Usually, sound issues can be caused by driver issues or bad game files that need a repair.  Just in case, it wouldn't hurt to download the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and perform that repair.\n\nThere could also be an issue with your settings specifically for replays.  A config reset might be able to help with that:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nLet me know if those steps help!","replies":[]}]}
