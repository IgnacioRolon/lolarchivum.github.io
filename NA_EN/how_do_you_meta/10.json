You just comment on someone's achievement of good behavior. Makes me and everyone else think you honestly aren't concerned about the players.  I feel like I'd be honour five at this point if I had a self mute option.  Just a little strange that people have been suggesting for 4 or 5 seasons and I haven't read any statements from a riot employee about why they won't implement a self mute option.  This game is highly competitive and team based, seems like if you knew you might get upset that game a self mute would prevent any raging from someone who just wanted to play this amazing game you guys have created.\n\nI love league of legends, but I'm not perfect.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zeskgames","date":"2017-09-05T22:16:14.218+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S22_DuaoHCU","replies":[{"poster":"How Do You Meta","date":"2017-09-05T22:18:30.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hah its the imitation of Evangelion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XVI Jake IVX","date":"2017-09-07T01:46:45.145+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Congratulations! :D {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-09-07T20:28:29.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know the feel, buddy.
