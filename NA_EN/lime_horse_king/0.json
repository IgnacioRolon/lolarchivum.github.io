I understand that and accepted my 14 day ban and decided to try to fix my toxic behavior. Today i just got off of it, and played about 10 games in a row, and had a horrendous losing streak. Even when i got really fed, we still lost. And around game 10, i was pretty tilted as you could imagine. And i said some choice words (not cursing, nothing really bad ((i can show chat logs, while i agree i was toxic, and i should have muted them, but i was really tilted and they were flaming me pretty hard))) I due apologize for this gieveous error in my ways, and i have been actively trying to not be toxic. In all my other games even through painful losses i didnt say anything. I am rather poor, like almost homeless, and i pour all my spare money into this account, ive maybe put in like 200 dollars over the 1 and a half ive been playing. If you would reconsider my ban, i swear to god ill never be toxic again. If im on a losing streak ill just stop playing, but this game is the only thing i really have to do. And if i lost this account, i lose everything ive been saving up for. Truly i understand i was an asshole, but please try to understand my mindset at the time was terrible. And i didnt really flame that much, i just got mad when i got camped (after already losing lane). If not, ill just have to quit league, which isnt something i want to do. I just want to fix my behavior and have a second chance.","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2016-10-12T13:33:22.546+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry dude, they don't un-ban people unless an error was made, and in these logs, you broke the rules.\n\nIf you want another chance, Riot is okay with you just making a new account, but this one is gone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bruised Ego","date":"2016-10-12T12:41:13.600+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good grief. I hope this teaches you a lesson. No, your account will not be unbanned. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works. Based on the chat-logs you provided, you definitely deserved what you got. I mean, jesus... you hardly said anything that would contribute to your team's victory. It was all negative talk from your end. Additionally, it's not just \"a few bad games\". I'm pretty sure you can only get perma banned for toxicity after a long pattern of abuse. Didn't your previous temporary bans teach you anything?\n\nIn any case, don't waste your time here trying to get a second chance. Make a new account and reform.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-10-12T12:21:06.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat logs. And also, the whole purpose of punishment is to teach you not to do the bad behavior again. If you only lasted 10 games, it didn't work, and you should probably re-evaluate how you behave in games and also don't continue playing if you're upset.","replies":[{"poster":"Lime Horse King","date":"2016-10-12T12:23:37.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me grab them. And yes, i know thats what i should do when i start tilting. It was a idiotic behavior of me to say anything to them i should have stayed silent and quietly got rekt. And i am currently re-evaluating my behavior, but as you might understand, tilt is a strong and hard thing to fight when it comes over you. Much like anger, it takes a while to control.","replies":[{"poster":"Lime Horse King","date":"2016-10-12T12:29:00.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Game 1\nLime Horse King: Yo can i like

I get it i had a bad game, but come on, i dont get how i was so toxic in comparison when at first i was just trying to get some kind of help from my teammates. and yes i said it in a vulgar way. Also I am not quite sure what was so toxic about that second game? I mean you can tell i was tilted, but i didnt flame anyone?
