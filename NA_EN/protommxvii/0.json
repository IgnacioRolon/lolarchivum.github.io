I got ganked mid around 11 times during laning, both by the opposing team jungler, and the botlane coming up. No one in bot pinged MIA. When I would run down the river to try to escape and hopefully have my botlane come help, they wouldn&#039;t listen to my pings. Then throughout the game my Lulu would call me trash (and in lobby tried to force a role on someone, then told them to suck his ****).\r\n\r\nI ended to game around 1/11/4 or something with less than 100 CS. Granted I could&#039;ve played more safely, but botlane could&#039;ve also used pings besides the MIA ping when I died. It was obvious they were trolling and verbally abusing.\r\n\r\nHowever, from what I think happened, my whole team reported me instead for feeding.\r\n\r\nMy question is, from what I think, the in game chat is taken into account when deciding for bans, and so are replays (this one I&#039;m unsure about, verification please). If person A gets reported, can other people in that game become banned from their actions or words if they violate the game rules, even if they weren&#039;t the original target of the report?\r\n\r\nAlso, like I just said, what&#039;s taken into account when deciding bans/punishments? What does the staff look at to see if someone deserves to be banned?\r\n\r\nLastly, is the lobby chat taken into account when deciding bans? Like if someone decides to super troll pick and feeds, or decides to break the rules inside lobby?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sorry if this is posted somewhere already, but I&#039;ve yet to find it. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-06-07T01:18:27.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only the person reported is checked, so even if (for instance) you and Player B were both extremely racist and everyone reported you but nobody reported him, only your logs would be reviewed and only you punished.\n\nIf you're worried about being punished for intentionally feeding when you were just having a rough game, don't worry about it; the system does try to make sure your poor score was not intentional (through various methods). Basically, only be worried if you were *intentionally* feeding.\n\nAnd for your final question, the Instant Feedback System unfortunately does not parse the lobby chat. Lobby chat *is* saved, however, and can be pulled during a manual review. If someone is committing offenses in the lobby only, fill out the report description and annotate that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-06-07T01:49:53.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You only get punished if someone reported you and found guilty by review, this is to keep false positives and/or situations where nobody cares from resulting in punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moooose3","date":"2017-06-07T01:14:09.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm.
