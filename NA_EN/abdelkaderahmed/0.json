Technically, I can run League on a Core m (and that's 0.8 GHz on my model) and still run it smoothly. The minimum specs should be just more than X GHz minimum, because higher clock doesn't mean faster speed.\n\ni.e. Intel Core 2 Duo @ 1.8 GHz still performs better than Intel Pentium 4 @ 3.6GHz\n\nGive a baseline series that works for most OEMs, For example; you can run League of Legends most likely on more recent Celeron processors, and slightly older Pentium and i3s for Intel, and newer Semprons, and older Phenom series etc.","replies":[]}]}]}
