You need to play around 100 games or more to be placed in the proper rank.\n\nHowever imo if people are still stuck in bronze/silver after a 100-150 games then they aren't improving they are just playing. To actively improve requires not only the drive to improve but the ability to recognize ones mistakes and activley try and fix them the next game.\n\nThings like remembering enemy summoner times, roughly judging where the enemy jungle is, wave control, zone control, rotations, champion matchups, good ward placements and locations, good cs etc. All these things need to be researched out of the game through guides, videos and having someone explain it and then thought about in game. Not everything at once, but one at a time until they are all mastered.\n\nIf after a game people are just thinking \"yeah yeah, I lost, I probably need to ward some more in lane so I die less to ganks\" but don't do it next game they can play 1000 games and still be stuck in bronze/silver","replies":[]},{"poster":"Touch My Box","date":"2017-02-27T13:53:46.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=C9 Obito,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rIcrfdX8,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-02-27T12:07:26.793+0000)\n>\n> every response especially the 1st one was already answered in quote. if you think its just somehow healing magic these dudes are just so good. ur full of shit lol. look at my replays. bunch of ragers and quitters. no real good player could easily master out of bronze  to gold in 20 games unless they went full throttle dick sucking mode for riot.\n\nhttps://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Toxic+Shaco\n\nPlaced Silver V. \nPlat 4 in 130 games.\n\nI am also terrible at league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2017-02-27T12:55:08.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"?
