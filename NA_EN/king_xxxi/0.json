Not too long, but easy to understand korean culture. Btw when you get some rest, care to explain why are internet cafes so popular there? Can you give a short description of those places?

Mind you, this will be a sea of spelling, and grammatical errors. \n(It's indirectly mentioned in the thread linked in my previous comment) PC Bangs are popular because Koreans (especially students) are very much restricted and under the authority of their parents at home. Meaning, in Korea if your mom calls you for dinner during a ranked match, you are going to lose that LP real quick. \n\nJokes aside, it's similar to how love hotels in Japan exist for couples wanting to have sex and how it's pretty awkward to do it at home due to close family structures (always someone at home). \nAnd of course, you will see clueless outsiders calling it a place for prostitutes when prostitution is fucking banned in Japan.  \nLike people need to start understanding that it can be very rude misinterpreting and boldly expanding on a small piece of information you think you know about a culture when you don't. \n\nAnyways, here are the details of a PC bang: \n\nPC bangs are usually quite dark inside. Imagine a movie theater where everyone breaks the rules and turns on their phones. The bright lights in a PC bang would be the monitors which can be as big as 32 inches. 24 and 27 is more common I think. And it's bright enough so you wouldn't trip or anything. \n\nThere is usually a counter near the entrance where a dude (or a hot girl in the PC bang I go to- lucky me) accepts payment. If you are a guest, it's around a dollar or a dollar and a half per hour. If you get a membership (which might cost you at first) costs will be cheaper (cheaper eventually considering if it was a paid membership) \nIt feels cheap at first but time goes so fast when playing games lol\n\nNear the counter is pretty bright and there are refreshments of all sorts nearby. Practically a small convenience store is in there but with only things that are edible and purchasable game currency cards for whatever game. You can also order food from outside (Pizza, etc). \n\nThe temperature is always cool because there are huge fans and ACs running 24/7. \n\nA normal PC bang could probably fit around 80-100 people. Larger ones can fit more. Smaller ones- less. \nAfter walking pass a bunch of rows of computers placed in cubical areas (for personal space), you'll probably see a smoking room or bathroom at the back end of the room. \n\nThe equipment is lit (gaming chair, headset, keyboard, mouse etc). The computers are really fast and I haven't experienced any lag of any sort so far. \nLED lights of different colors can come from the equipment, the ceiling, or the floor. \n\nIf you are under 18 or 19 (I can't remember), you can't stay in a PC Bang after 9PM. A few PC bangs don't allow people from a certain age group as well. \n\nUnderstand that Koreans are really picky when it comes to cleanliness. I've lived in Europe, Africa, America and Korea- and I can tell you it's pretty ridiculous how far these Koreans can go. I mean in most houses you don't even wear shoes inside. \n\nSo a PC bang that's not clean, smells like sweat or food, has poor/cheap equipment, and or bad management (keeping noise down) will always go out of business. Always. It's because no matter where one lives in the city, there is at least 5 competing PC bangs from a 3-8 minutes walk distance. \n\nI have a friend who's family is pretty rich (owns hotels and what not). They also own high tier private PC Bang and it has glass tiles with water underneath. 99.99% of PC bangs aren't like that. \n\nIt's 3AM here. Goodnight.

You pick an early game champ for a strategic advantage early.  You are EXPECTED to be ahead with a lane bully.  The impetus is now on you to do something with the advantage you should have.  Time is against you.  That's the point.  Why do they feel entitled to win?  Because they made a strategic decision to pick a scaling teamfight comp.  \n\nYou're basically saying that if you pick a lane bully champ against a scaling teamfighter and you win lane (Which should be easy to do, and is EXPECTED for that to happen) you should just automatically win the game.  \n\nThe reward for being ahead early isn't that you just get to win and I don't understand why people think that. It's that you get first tower, vision control over objectives, probably item leads, ability to roam, your job is to take those advantages and press them to a win.  Just like it's up to the scaling comp to play smart, play safe, don't get picked, and play defensively until you're stronger.  \n\nIf you pick lane bullies and go up two towers and a few kills and once the map opens up you get picked and play like a bunch of apes, you should not win despite the fact that you are ahead.  Your champ picks gave you advantages, you failed to do anything with it.  You shouldn't be rewarded for that.  If you got ahead with an early game comp and turned it into a bunch of picks cause they have no vision, turned it into a baron, and played aggressively with your advantage, THEN you deserve to win.\n\nIf you picked a scaling comp and took stupid fights in lane and fed, you should probably end up losing.  If you played smart, kept up in farm, waited for jung pressure, didn't get picked, played smart around vision, and didn't give the early-mid game comp an opportunity to press their advantage, you deserve to win.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Janakin","date":"2018-07-10T15:14:42.339+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Seriously Ghostcrawler and Meddler, go watch old videos of league and see what you've done.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2018-07-11T04:27:19.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know I am getting tunnel visioned on a meaningless part of the post but CS:GO has a ton of strategy... you think people have been playing counter strike for decades because they like shooting the other guy before he shoots you?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yordle Xayah","date":"2018-07-10T21:48:20.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you play {{champion:29}} as a shooter heh","replies":[]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-07-10T20:19:44.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% Combacks only happen if your team has a Hypercarry that gets the gold for the power spike and the team supports them just a little (assuming the enemy team does not also have a Hypercarry, if so then you are SOL you lost)\n\nThe game is in such a bad state.

Remember last year when games where just afk farming and waiting until one team made a mistake and basically winning from there? People complained about that too. So they made games much faster paced and more decisive early. They nerfed the champions that were able to just sit in lane and wave clear, whilst also buffing assassins.\n\nThe main problem is, what makes pro play 'exciting' is also what makes solo queue a miserable experience. Pro players picking Riven, Zed, Yasuo and other \"exciting\" champions every game means that they will also become even more played in solo queue than they already are and in turn making these typically frustrating champions to play against even more of a problem than they already are.","replies":[]}]}
