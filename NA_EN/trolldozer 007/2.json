Just a really binary champ to play that i would sleep on. Out of all the better choices to chose from, maokai was picked. What the actual fuck???\n\nNow im not too worried to fight for gold and not get it by end of season.\n\nJust to list a few examples, Victorious reksai would be a lot cooler! What about darius and irelia? Gankplank? ekko?  Victorious rengar would be awesome too!\n\nIf there's anyway this skin can be redone that would be great!","replies":[{"poster":"1st Movement","date":"2016-10-03T21:59:32.747+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's gonna look stale like victorious sivir","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-10-03T23:16:09.502+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yo what?

Think the MVP of champions. Darius Irelia and GP do not qualify as they did not influence the game as much as Maokai. GP had some influence but not so much. Mao hovered around 60-80% pb rate on summer split depending on region so i can see some reason for him. \n\nBut i FNCly agree that Mao was far from the top spot. You noticed that i didnt mention Ekko before? Thats because i beleive he should have gotten the skin. He was the champion that got the most influence in the game throught both splits. But after some junglers and supports that are out because we need some diversity in skins, we would have 3 of support/jungler if one got. FYI my picks before ekko would be Nida(almost 100% pb rate both splits, thats insane but got challenger already), Karma (highly contested both splits but she is support) and Rektsai (jungler so out). Elise would be another contester if she already had not got one.\n\nImo champions that surpassed Maokai's performance this year are:\nTop:  Ekko Gnar\nJungle: Nida, Rektsai, Elise, Graves\nMid: Victor, Vlad, Ryze\nAdc: Ashe, Jhin (mostly for utility, same deal as SIvir)\nSupports: Karma by far\nThere are more but cant think them now and they are close to Mao, but the above surpassed him by a noticable margin. Still without support and jungler i can still see 7 clear picks before him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Schoenberg","date":"2016-10-03T21:59:26.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Viktorious Viktor would be the best..","replies":[{"poster":"1st Movement","date":"2016-10-03T22:00:17.242+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JanDismasZelenka,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=igQgsdeE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-03T21:59:26.191+0000)\n>\n> Viktorious Viktor would be the best..\n\nSame it would save me 1350 rp \nGuess I have no choice x)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"546f7047756e","date":"2016-10-03T22:11:22.399+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yah LET THE NUMBERS speak! Every youtube video i saw complained about this. And almost everyone on boards dislike it. He just doesn't qualify for victorious.\n\nEarly season victorious skins were actually on LIKABLE champs who had impact throughout season. VICTORIOUS Janna, Jarvan, Elise, and Morgana were all good, even if u dont main the champ most people were fine with it. Than it all went downhill since last season. Sivir? really? i dont even see people play vic sivir this whole season cuz its that bad. AND NOW MAOKAI? Im laughing so hard haha!","replies":[{"poster":"Odinakos","date":"2016-10-04T00:35:08.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jokes aside, Sivir and Kallista were the utility adcs that enabled the rundown/pick comps focused on juggernaits. While the later could be subed with another, Sivir and Kallista were valuable picks. They had high priority throught the S5. So one got the championship, the other the Victorius. They both earned it. Its the same deal with S2 Janna in the adc meta. While not being the main force, she enabled the main force.\n\nThats without saying that i found 10 champs better suited than Maokai this year.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-10-04T00:29:42.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually Sivir was an extremely influential pick early last season.
