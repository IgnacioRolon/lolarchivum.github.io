With the idea being on, for instance, Nautilus, was that I was taking a strong late game as a given and leaving behind the %extra bonus armor and HP at level 18 and getting myself the Movespeed, Extra starting gold, pot duration and biscuits from Utility. \n\nThat way, my start is machete+3 biscuits that all last 10% longer which adds up to approximately 3.7 pots worth of health vs 2, and my level 1 stats are pretty much the same. I lose maybe 200-300g of stats late, but I already have a strong late game so it's kinda moot as Naut is already a beast late. \n\nWhat if you tried sticking with the atkspd, double edged sword, etc stats and dropped the %bonus AD and AD at level 18 from Yi counting on the extra devourer stacks to make up the difference? Bet you a dollar I could get a full clear out of him before I had to back.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-13T18:34:52.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Truly interesting I have to say.\n\nSince I think Yi needs an early feed so some full offense tree would be needed but I haven't taken into account that going hybid mastery might actually only resulting a few bucks of stat loss late which can easily be compensated while in exchange for early smoothing.\n\nI would definitely give that one a few runs once I get back to LoL (busy on other games atm hue).\n\nThanks for the heads up bud.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Belighted","date":"2015-01-14T18:37:52.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you need to learn how to play Yi?

I am not the best player, and I have little experience with darius but the experiences I did have were positive so I wanted a little more play time with him to see if I should buy him.  I get into a game and I find myself against Annie Top lane.   I have never played against Annie top, and never against Darius in the lanning phase.  I honestly had no answer for her.  I would try and get her to use her abilities and then close but before level 6 she  was able to keep enough difference till her stun came up and then poke me down.  Due to my noobness she got a couple kills off me because she hit ALOT harder against me than I was hitting her.  Would she have a similar experience pro against pro?\n\nyes cause annie deals more damage and is tankier and has cc","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MAZZ1M0","date":"2015-01-15T05:39:02.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It still only heightened inefficient gankers weaknesses. The Chilling Smite nerf only makes it worse. If you can't gank, you won't be viable.\nRemember to everyone saying X champ can clear or X champ has sustain, you're competing with the enemy jungler for map dominance. If they pick a Rek'Sai or Lee Sin and you don't, you are automatically at a disadvantage. So focus on faster clear, Lee ganked ur bot lane while u were farming. You try to gank, but it takes the second try to land it instead of the first. Rek gets ahead of you in gold. It's always something. Volibear is my best jungler atm and half the games I play I only spend maybe 20% of the game in the jungle? Maybe less. I gank all the time and get fed off assists. I only farm if there're no openings.\nDiana is great once she hits lv.6, but then I have to wait for lv.6 which is problematic against the Reks and Lees and X champs that gank earlier. Because the XP and gold gain suck in the jungle now *with* longer spawn timers, you can't keep up by farming. It's more *interesting*, sure, but it's incredibly prohibitive and did the exact **opposite** of what was intended.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nebuul","date":"2015-01-14T19:18:23.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:14}} is really good in the new jungle. Start gromp with W and a good leash. Then take Q, E, then I like to max W. You clear:\n\n1. Gromp (smite)\n2. Blue (heal pot)\n3. Wolves\n4. Red (smite)\n5. Chickens\n6. Krugs\n\nYou don't even need 2nd pot unless you go in for a gank or something.\n\nIf you want stronger early ganks, max E first because of increased slow and damage. If you want more team fight cc, max Q first for reduced cooldown. I like the crazy sustain and jungle clear of maxing W first.\n\nFor runes, I take movement quints, AD marks, armor seals, 3 scaling cdr glyphs, and 6 scaling mr glyphs.
