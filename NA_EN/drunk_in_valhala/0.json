This will have me doing the crafting animation 14 consecutive times.\n\nIs there any advice or tips on how to expedite this? I already did it individually, but found it rather bothersome. Any advise would be greatly appreciated so I do not have to do that again. (last event quest rewards had me doing the essence trade 8 times)\n\nTrading Tokens for Key Fragments, would make things 3 times faster, but it's out of the picture because I have 15 completed keys and no chests. How I got that stockpile, I have no clue, I have not spent RP on chests or keys.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T23:38:17.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y'know, if you're only about 10 tokens shy of an orb you might be able to draw some fancy art in a ticket to see about getting those tokens ;)\n\nOther than that, we don't really have a way of making the crafting go by faster like doing batches of 5 or anything right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Drunk In Valhala","date":"2017-11-07T20:32:27.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply! Much appreciated.\n\nI didn't think you guys still liked seeing art in tickets, haha! Last I heard about the MS Paint fan-art was several years ago. Thought popularity had skyrocketed making it cumbersome to keep that practice alive.\n\nDefinitely awesome to hear it didn't go away!\n\nUnfortunately, I made this post after I did the batch crafting, leading me to look for a faster alternative.\n\nThere is a different game I play that has batch crafting, where you double click what your crafting, and a window appears that asks how many you would like to make. Just throwing some idea's around, probably not the best solution, but I think throwing around possible solutions is more productive than only complaining.\n\nAgain, thank you for your time and best of luck on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-08T02:06:49.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a pretty good idea tbh, and we actually recently made a system where you could open multiple hextech chests actually I believe! You should post this idea over in Client Discussion to get a little more visibility for your suggestion!","replies":[{"poster":"Drunk In Valhala","date":"2017-11-08T04:32:20.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> post this idea over in Client Discussion\n\n[Here it is!](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion/YZY86d9x-hextech-crafting)\n\nWould you mind posting over there?
