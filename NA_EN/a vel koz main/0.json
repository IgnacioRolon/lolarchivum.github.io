It&#039;s almost like there&#039;s no signature AP Keystone, it all scales better with AD.................................. can we talk about this? 10% AP max scaling plus 30% ad on thunderlords, balanced. Like seriously, why do all AD people get everything catered to them tons of MR, Health and Damage, Damage and MR, Damage and MR and Health. And why is it that Void Staff doesn&#039;t come with a passive like Last Whisper? Do you realize that part of the balancing issue is the items, in fact, it&#039;s mostly the items fault and keystones scaling so well with AD that it&#039;s dumb. \r\n\r\nTone down AD a lot, give mages more choices and balance them both out, then tone AP down slightly. Remove the Keystones or at least the amount of AD scaling involved like hell.\r\n\r\nOh and one last thing:\r\n\r\nJhins E doesn&#039;t do damage til detonation, why is executing people at 100 health or lower for no reason at all? And it&#039;s not Deathfire Touch lol, it&#039;s literally dealing 100 damage on activation to people who&#039;ve stepped on them, I can&#039;t be the only one seeing this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2017-01-31T18:25:36.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not like it's their randomly, It's on their because of it's component item. (Hunter's machete) But that in mind, it applies only to jungle monsters, and the second component, (or even the tier 2 jungle item) is by no means a rush requirement.\n\nSo your not really wasting a ton of value just by having it. I honestly wouldn't worry about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-31T18:02:49.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Things that scale with both AP and AD have higher AD scalings because AD is much harder to come by. Deathcap gives you over 120 ap by itself, there is no AD item that matches that. At end game an AP champ usually has more than twice as much AP as an AD champ's AD. The AP champ usually ends up doing more damage with those skills.\n\nVoid staff does not have an extra passive because it gives more relative stats and it has % magic pen instead of % bonus magic pen. Void staff is a much better item than either of the last whisper items.\n\nIdk about the AP jungle item, I don't play any champs that build it. \n\nAs far as defensive AP and AD items... they are about equal. Most champs also end up with way more armor than MR too. People have been building three armor items and one magic resist one lately.","replies":[]}]}
