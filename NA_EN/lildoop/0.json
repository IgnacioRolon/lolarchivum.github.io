But I am not one of those players of my own will; I love LoL and I don't ever quit matches. My CPU randomly shuts off, and I don't mean sleeps. It shuts off like it got unplugged or something but it didn't. \r\n\r\nFull black screen, game completely off. I have to go back to LoL and reconnect; Its happened around 3-4 times now and I am really getting annoyed. \r\n\r\nI don't know why it is doing this because I have a really nice CPU, and its a very good one for gaming. \r\n\r\nEverytime my CPU shuts off I turn it back on and it has an error message thing. It says \"Rear chassis not detected\" And then a bunch of other stuff I cant remember atm. \r\nAny way to fix that? \r\n\r\nI don't wanna be punished for something I cant control after this time.  \r\n\r\nAll comments welcome! \r\n\r\n{{champion:103}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-12T17:09:13.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there's a pretty serious issue, maybe hardware, that's causing your PC to shutdown as a security precaution.
