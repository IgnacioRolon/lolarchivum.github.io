You save it to catch up to targets when they try to slow you to escape. You don't EVER use it to start the fight. Fights aren't supposed to last 18-30 seconds.\n\nWhat actually happens is this:\nYou open with your ultimate, hitting two targets, getting a shield, and focusing on one target. that target stuns you for 1 second and you eat some damage. then you dps race them with your abilities. they slow you, and try to run, you hit your w, you kill them, your w resets.\n\nIn no way does this change offer any sort of positive net to eve's gameplay. She is going to lose her ability to stick to targets (they will simply outrange her and stay past her max range so that she never becomes relevant again), in exchange for... nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Widder88","date":"2015-03-14T20:28:00.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Love Tentacle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eMuiAvAE,comment-id=000c0000,timestamp=2015-03-14T18:37:47.194+0000)\n>\n> Only the thing is, none of those computations make sense in the gameplay aspect of it. \n> Eve's W is a slow remover.
