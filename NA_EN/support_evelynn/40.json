No one said much about it, but her AD ratio on her Q went up. No compensation. Meanwhile, Evelynn got her W nerfed hard, by putting a 40 mana cost on it, and unlike Lucian's E it doesn't scale down to 0. I'm happy she's now going to be changed into something... else as some Rioter said she was now on the list for a GU and VU as well. Maybe a new ultimate? And a new passive as well. Certain champs just get ignored by Riot, and others get ignored by the community. But... the champs that Riot usually ignores are the ones the community plays the most, and the ones that are usually ignored by the community are the ones that Riot focuses most of their \"balance\" onto.\n\n**Riot has taken away Dominion (and as of right now, is not planned in the weekend rotation) and has yet to give us a new fast paced game mode.**\n\nThere are a ton of people, myself included, who have no time to play League. Especially during the school year. At least give us ShowDown or something.\n\n**There is no place on LoL for lore.**\n\nThere is no set location to go and read up lore. There is no giant map of Runeterra. There is no Journal of Justice anymore. The retcon on the original lore wasn't needed (and it only puts more work on the lore team). We need more stories about some of the champs that were already in League. Like, Ryze, Veigar, Rammus, and even Kog'Maw. They don't need to be long, just something short and sweet just telling about a day in the life of a Champion. *I also want to point out that without the Institute of War, the title **Champions** is out of place.*\n\n**We have a hard time reaching out to Riot.**\n\nIt feels like I'd have a easier time talking with other gaming companies on their discussion pages, than I would even get a comment out of a Riot employee. And its only more infuriating that apparently, the only ones that will communicate are the ones that aren't allowed to say anything or don't know much on the subject (but those guys are the VMPs of Riot for communicating). RiotRepetior and a few others do talk to us, but they can't answer all of our questions. RiotRepetior isn't in the art department, he's in the design department (and even he is limited on what he knows about things other than what he's working on). I wish that Riot employees (whenever they get on here and I know they occasionally do) try and talk to us if possible. If we have some angry rant, read it or skim it and leave some thoughts. Try and at least communicate. If around (or over) 75% of the community is having issues with something (like say, Dynamic Queue) then stop thinking we're stupid and that we have to get use to it. Talk to us. Find out why we're in distress. Try and please us, because without us, your income might start to get smaller...\n\nThat's what I think about Riot at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"Dessem","date":"2016-04-29T19:12:33.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> some Rioter said she was now on the list for a GU and VU as well. \n\nShe's been on that list forever.
