Now I'm not saying Evelynn is a strong pick by any means, she does need some help (not a lot, but a little), but to go around and say she's unplayable? That's absolutely hilarious.\r\n\r\nFor your benefits I made a guide in General Discussion on how to clear early and gank early on Evelynn: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/0QEwiEAA-how-to-clear-the-jungle-early-on-evelynn-a-guide \r\n\r\nIf you really love playing a champion, don't just give up on them, make them work and have fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Lotto123","date":"2014-12-21T10:23:42.637+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eve is way underpowered... She has almost no sustain in early jungle, her q doesn't generate much dmg early on when compared to the jungle monsters so she ends up having to recall constantly for the first 10-15 minutes of the game. Since she is a big squishy ball, her ganks are relatively useless unless she can get off some super early in game. Otherwise she falls behind and can't even gank a squishy vieger.\n\n I've done good with her, but she is also a champ that relies heavily on allies. She isn't the \"assassin\" they call her either, an assassin is like zed, in-and-out attack. With eve you have to trade blows with a champ and since she ms. Squishy it doesn't work out well. \n\nNOW HER ULT is pure rubbish, worse than pantheon's ult. Why does her ult have no minimum damage? I know it's supposed to be an engaging ult, but with that horrendous cd time, you can't even engage much. Not to mention, when you engage, even if the persons health is low, they won't die. Literally a champ with 100 health left can survive her ult? Makes no sense, riot needs to give her ult a minimum damage","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poptart Evelynn","date":"2014-12-21T08:11:29.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"If we don't bitch then Riot wouldn't be actively working on her currently. ***But they are because we bitched about her being extremely subpar with the game changes.*** \n\nYou ever heard of an indirect buff? Well Evelynn got a huge ass indirect nerf recently with the changes to the game pace. So what's wrong with us complaining about Evelynn's current shit state again? Playing Eve in sub par elo can make you think she is ok. But I dropped out of diamond trying to play Eve through these last few patches.\n\nSo you're damn straight I'm going to just drop Evelynn when she is currently garbage. The state she is currently in is extremely upsetting and we deserve for Evelynn to be properly fixed.

This is mere opinion. However when people say she's unplayable and say it all the time everywhere the game becomes a very toxic environment for those who are still play these champions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Poptart Evelynn","date":"2014-12-21T12:07:57.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crabby,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MbXsUE7n,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2014-12-21T08:14:43.879+0000)\n>\n> I vaguely remember you even admitting of doing such yourself.\n> \n> And yeah, I must be such a fotm player spamming her during a time where I get flamed for picking her.

I'm just speaking in general to most people that say she is \"fine\" and we just suck with her.\n\nIn general I'm extremely mad about how Evelynn has been handled in the past and currently. They just kept whacking her and giving her random things to compensate without actually acknowledging the role she is suppose to fill. So when I come across a post saying that current Evelynn isn't that bad and just needs a slight buff. I get extremely pissed. \n\nMe and so many other Eve players have been making post back to back on so many things. We told them the pink ward change would be an issue. Did they acknowledge it? No, they just whacked the shit out of her the moment she saw competitive play. We told them the current stealth is an issue for her being viable with burst being on the table. Did they acknowledge that either? Nope, they just whacked the shit out of her the moment DFG mid Eve got popular. It's over and over we keep seeing the same cycle. She becomes a viable pick, whacks the shit out of her, weak for a period of time, crappy buffs, and then a slight change in the kit which will lead right back to the start.\n\nI don't mean to rant here but it really irks the hell out of me when people can be ok with how Evelynn is being treated over these years. How the hell can anyone be okay with this? I really enjoy the style of Evelynn but I feel that Riot is taking her in a boring/non fun direction that no one really likes. Building ap on Eve is fun, being an assassin is fun, and moving fast/invisible is fun. Now what we got for a while was an invisible tank. Ahh yeeaa we want the enemy team to have to focus something they can't see. Brilliant.\n\nSo I'm sorry if you are offended by my comments but you really understand that as an avid Kat/Eve player. I really get frustrated when others say Evelynn is in an okay spot but just needs a little help. \n\nI'll let everyone in on a secret too atm with current jungle. You don't even have to jungle it at first. Do red, level 2 gank a lane, sap a little xp from each lane you gank(just happens while you gank so you don't really think about this but you get to level 3/4 through this), and then go back to base to get your first set of items to farm jungle with. The problem is after you have snowballed the shit out of the game with all those kills early on. You fall off so frekin hard that you can't even kill the carries that have no items. If you can't close the game out in 30 mins you lose. FUN right?...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Koechophe","date":"2014-12-21T07:12:17.280+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm sorry, but eve is bordering on unplayable at the moment. She \"can\" clear the jungle, but so can jungle soraka. Doesn't make it viable. I would go in depth, but basically, the crux of it is this: eve was weak before the jungle changes, and while a lot of things about the new jungle hurt her, nothing benefits her. She can't take spirit of the lizard elder anymore, and the new AD item has too much focus on Armor pen when Eve's damage is mixed, while the AP item has too much focus on CDR when eve benefits more from AP. Eve used to be an early game champion who fell off hard if she wasn't fed, now she's terrible in the early game while still falling off hard. She is outclassed in every way by other assassin junglers, especially shaco who does everything eve does except better. She is resting at an 18% win ratio in master ranked (http://www.lolking.net/charts?region=all&type=champion-loserate&range=daily&map=sr&queue=1x1&league=challenger) and a 38% in general. She needs more than just \"a little work\" and she definitely needs more than just a low-end mana regen buff and adding on-hit to her E.","replies":[{"poster":"Support Evelynn","date":"2014-12-21T07:14:21.101+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Koechophe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MbXsUE7n,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2014-12-21T07:12:17.280+0000)\n>\n> I'm sorry, but eve is bordering on unplayable at the moment.
