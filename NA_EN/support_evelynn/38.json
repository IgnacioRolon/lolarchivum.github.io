People saw what was clearly a bug, and abused it for thousands of dollars worth of in game items. This essentially tells players who have already spent many hundreds on this game that they basically wasted their money and newer players to just wait for exploits to get their shit.\n\nNeed I remind you that people who abused refer a friend and were caught were permabanned, and that was for comparatively much lower value than exploiting this recent bug. Turn it whatever way you want, but Riot should be banning the top abusers of this incident at the very least, otherwise they undermine themselves.","replies":[]}
