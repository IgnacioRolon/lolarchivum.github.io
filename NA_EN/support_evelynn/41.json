Which is why Evelynn ganking via permanent stealth is a little annoying in solo queue. Btw, feel free to check my match history - silver 2 and i upgrade my trinket more often than not and typically place over 20 wards per game as a non-support. \n\nSecond,  as to why it's not super valuable in world's:\nPros are better at warding the enemy jungle,  they can spot her doing a camp and figure out where she'll go to gank next and how long it will take. \n\nEven without wards,  pros have exceptional knowledge of when a champion will be ready to try a gank. \n\nFurther,  pros use a lot more pink wards than solo queue players do. I'd guess in over 50% of my games I'm the only one with a pink on the map. I doubt I've ever seen more than 3 pinks from my team at once. Meanwhile,  pros regularly have 4 or 5 pinks on the map for each team. When a pink gets destroyed that player replaces it. Pinks give true sight and hence can see eve,  so actually her major strength is a LOT weaker in the pro scene.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathToHeretics","date":"2015-10-09T14:16:33.596+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You make a lot of good points, and I agree.
