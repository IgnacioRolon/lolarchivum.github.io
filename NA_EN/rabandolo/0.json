This is because Penny Arcade has a say in their distribution due to being included in the name of the skin. There was a point where all the PAX skins became Riot skins (Graves, Blitzcrank, Nasus, Kayle, etc) instead.","replies":[{"poster":"GhastlyGhoulMan","date":"2015-03-19T23:15:55.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm...
