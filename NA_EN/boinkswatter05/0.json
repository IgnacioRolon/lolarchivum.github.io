I don't like being in a meta that has comps titled \"Protect Jinx.\" or \"Protect Draven.\" Racing to get Noble, Guardian + a carry makes this game extremely stale.\r\n\r\nKarthus, A. Sol., Veigar is still too potent of a trio. Sorcerers just one shot everything. God forbid I can get my hands on one cloak in a game with these nuts.\r\n\r\n Ashe single-handedly winning fights 1v3 is getting annoying.
