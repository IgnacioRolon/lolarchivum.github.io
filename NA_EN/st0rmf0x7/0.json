I'd really love it if her ultimate served as an interrupt. For example, when Blitzcrank pulls me in or Thresh pulls me in, I would like my ultimate to be able to interrupt this act. Also, it feels like I'm no match for Miss Fortune or Lucian's ultimates, but an interrupt on the arrow would change that.     -St0rmF0x7","replies":[{"poster":"St0rmF0x7","date":"2019-07-21T16:56:36.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the explanation!

I don’t know if you’re newer here, but I’ll see if I can explain why Ashe’s Ultimate has pretty low damage. The main reason is because of a concept called power budget. Power budget explains why certain aspects of a champion kit or ability are weak. For an example, I’ll use Blitzcrank’s rocket grab. This ability has really bad damage, and will rarely ever kill an enemy, even if blitzcrank builds damage items. This is because most of it’s power budget is allocated to the utility it provides. The ability to pull one enemy to a position where they are in danger of dying is very strong. Likewise, Ashe’s Ice Arrow has one of the longest stuns in the game if hit from a long distance. 3.5 seconds is more than enough to catch up to any champion running away and kill them through other means. Secondly, in LOL, you cannot interrupt displacement. This because of how the system works under the hood, as most displacements move a champion a certain distance over a certain time or set them as airborne. Without changing the systems in place already, Ashe’s arrow couldn’t interrupt any displacement.","replies":[]}]}
