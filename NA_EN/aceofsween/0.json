She has very good clear times and stays relatively healthy compared to other junglers, both of which are much more important than in the previous seasons' jungles.  However, she goes oom so quickly that it really makes it hard to justify picking her in comparison to other champions.\r\n\r\nPower wise, I think Diana's actually in a good spot.  But man, watching my entire mana pool disappear when trying to clear a camp or two really hurts.  Especially when compared to champions like Jarvan IV and Vi, whose mana costs are considerably lower, almost across the board, and and they have larger mana pools with higher regen.","replies":[{"poster":"maikokk","date":"2014-12-30T01:15:12.603+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"you dont need mana to clear with diana","replies":[{"poster":"aceofsween","date":"2014-12-30T01:43:44.179+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Frankly, you don't need to use mana to clear with any junglers, but to be effective, you do have to use your abilities as a jungler to get through the jungle quickly, and more importantly, at high health values.\n\nYes, you can get your way through the jungle without them, but then you're trading off health for mana.
