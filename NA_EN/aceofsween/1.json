It was a way to show skill with a particular champion.  However, it&#039;s implementation is flawed, and points essentially amount to whether you win or lose, not how you perform.  The strangest part is that the system actually does seem to know when you&#039;re performing well, even in a loss.  I&#039;ve seen grade S to A in a loss, so something under the hood is working (one would think).\r\n\r\nBut it doesn&#039;t seem to have any bearing on how many champion points you are awarded at the end of a match.  Most recently, I finished a game as Elise going 6/2/0 (our Caitlyn was constantly DCing, so we surrendered at 20:23).  At the time, I had the most gold on our team, 3rd most gold in the game, and was responsible for 6 of 10 kills we amassed.  I finished the game with an A+ grade, which I think that was reasonable.  And out of curiosity, I hovered over the number of champion points I was awarded...\r\n\r\nI got +37 for that game.  A+ rank, only +37 points.  Compare this to a game where I went 0/8/4 as Riven feeding my ass off.  That game we still won, and I got over 1000 pts for a C performance.  (By the way, If that was a C, what do you have to do to get a D?)\r\n\r\nIn the end, the only thing Champion Mastery tracks is how often you win the game with a particular champion, which I find shortsighted and foolish.","replies":[{"poster":"Jrud","date":"2015-06-06T23:32:15.423+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":3,"body":"Agree... points should be based on performance (because obviously the are good at measuring it) and not on win/loss","replies":[{"poster":"Stompburger","date":"2015-06-07T21:33:30.299+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have to disagree. If you separate champion mastery from winning the game, then you are going to get people who don't care about winning the game as long as they get champion mastery points.

Maybe it would make sense if you always got very few mastery points for a lost game, but would only get a lot of points for a won game if you performed well.","replies":[{"poster":"Nin10do0014","date":"2015-06-08T03:18:40.924+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, a solution to promote playing well is to have quantified scores, such as Minion Kills, Time spent alive, Objectives taken, and Damage Dealt.

Winning is the single best way to prove that your team was better than theirs. Your actual accomplishments during that game are irrelevant according to Champion Mastery.
