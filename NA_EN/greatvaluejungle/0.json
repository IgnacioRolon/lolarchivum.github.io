People were just as equally as \"toxic\" as i was. Ill post the transcripts.(sadly of what I said only) Most of my comments where factual witty and kind of being a smart mouth but factual. Some of those who made comments about me were passive aggressive but they played a part into the toxicity. I get it I should just mute people. But really we all play this game we all sink our money and time, 14 days it not worth one game of light statements. But really riot??? 14 day suspension. I have seen a lot of toxicity and i mean name calling, unheard of things, and profanity but really was mine worth a 14 days. I think a lot of players have the same sense if its like super bad i mean mine is not even close to things that can be said \"sure 14 day ban\". Best part is riot allows those who troll and play new champs in ranked some where they don't even if its ap or ad damage type but they slide right by. And that is what upsets me more i get a ban for being pissed at the fact the jg trolled in the beginning. I get banned because i reacted to them feeding the other team and costing a win. This is a team game and one person who is actively trolling but can put up as \"oww im still learning\"... Thats ok. Costing 4 other people a win where they get knocked back down and feel like trash, soon that turns into hate for the other player. We are all humans getting beat down in any situation because of other breeds disgust That Riot, is you guys create a breeding ground for toxicity. Especially if you put suspensions like this on other people. But Ill just wait 14 days mute every single player and play the game. \r\n\r\nIs there a fix to this? \r\nYou know what id be happy with a ban system where if i retaliate in the game i don't get banned and they don' t.\r\n\r\nDoes it really create the behavior I'm referring too? I believe it does.\r\n\r\nIs letting a new player play ranked Ok? NO!\r\n\r\nPlease Fix your ranked system. Fix your banning system. Because calling someone a troll is not really up there on the profanity list. If my ban is not warranted contact me i'd like not to be banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Amamahdeth","date":"2019-03-28T07:21:10.779+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"Asking for reports is bannable.

What is the difference between civil punishment, and being punished in this game? They are both generally based on stripping someone of some sort of investment of some kind. This game is a time, and money investment when people feel that their investment isn't properly taken care of, and they are harassed they naturally get upset it's a normal human emotion.\n\nI'm not sure you understand what psychological warfare means then. I'm not sure if you realize but entrapment is considered a form of torture, and that's exactly what riot does to people because leaving is a bannable offense. No other game will ban your account outright if you leave matches. Generally at most they ban you from playing ranked mode specifically for the season. They trap them inside a video game with strangers that can abuse them, and have no recourse they cannot even leave. I'm not sure what you consider trolling, and greifing to be if not psychological warfare. People want justice, and they are not getting it so the trolls are getting worse because it's become a cycle of trolls turn more people into trolls because they feel it's the only way to get back at the community. \n\nYou have people generating 100's of games trolling their teammates, and riot does nothing about it because they're just bad. One of the simplest solutions to rank would be make it a requirement that to play a champion in ranked you have to at least have rank 4 on them. Sure it would effect trading, and it would effect their sales. The thing everyone seems to forget is riot isn't in the business to make their customers happy or create a fair game model. It is first and foremost to generate as much profit as possible with as little effort as possible they only way things get change is by community outcry. When people are defending inters like those in an urf game of mine who didn't buy a single item, and saying it's just a bad urf game they are part of the problem. Remaining silent in the face of true outrage is something humanity seems to not be able to escape.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Voldymort,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=wVufIf6y,comment-id=00000001000000000001,timestamp=2019-03-28T07:37:32.132+0000)\n>\n> i'm sorry to break it to you but that's how reality works. mob justice is not a thing in league\n> \n> https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player\n> \n> ***Things to avoid***\n> \n> *\"Do not ask other players in the match to report the offending player.
