Her jump itself is also one of the slowest mobility abilities in the game. You can literally just shoot her with a skillshot while she's in midair. Of course, the two champs you listed are champs who should instashred her so I feel like maybe the issue is with things you do before you face off against them.","replies":[]}]}
