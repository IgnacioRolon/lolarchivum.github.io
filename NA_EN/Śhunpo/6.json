She's in need of NERFS not buffs, and these changes are especially awful as they make her far easier to pilot. \nLegitimately, if these changes go through there's really no point in using R2 as an execute, and honestly R2->W cancel will just be the single best meta way of destroying your opponent(s), as well as the typical R1->E->R2->Flash->Q+W (auto). \nThus, lowering her skill level immensely. \n\nThis isn't limited to just kill combos either, the W buff makes her laning far better, especially if she can get to her quad {{item:1036}} powerspike, or even a {{item:3134}} . +30% AD scaling is ridiculous...\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nVayne is also the same, she doesn't need buffs, she needs nerfs and/or a reduction in how overloaded her R is. She's the 3rd best ADC atm, right behind Kai'sa and Draven, that doesn't mean she needs a buff. Even if this is for pro play, she's not going to get picked since the Riot balance team refuses to properly nerf {{champion:145}} . Why pick Vayne when {{champion:145}} is just a better Vayne than what Vayne is.\n\nMordekaiser also doesn't need a buff, especially on W which is already extremely good in terms of soaking damage.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, everyone's freaking out about the Riven changes (myself included), but uhhh....the changes which I think Riot are definitely trolling with would be uhhh.....these Xin changes.\n\nYeeeaaahhh, two 70% slows AND one of them is on an ability most Xins max first anyways. Oh, and if that wasn't enough they're also buffing his passive, making his general clearing and fighting so much better. \nYou're not going to be able to escape Xin if these changes go through, especially not if he has red buff. If you get hit by ANYTHING you are dead, and considering both his Q and E are point and click, good luck counterplaying him.\n\nIf these changes go through Riot is genuinely trolling since Xin is arguably the single best early-mid game jungler along with Elise and Lee Sin, along with being one of the strongest clearers in the game. \nHow about instead of buffing Xin we nerf {{champion:60}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:30}}, {{champion:64}}  and {{champion:517}}, so he can actually not be a pick which is overshadowed by these aforementioned champions.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\ntl;dr Riot better be trolling with these PBE changes, because they're all atrocious.","replies":[{"poster":"xelaker","date":"2019-09-13T14:57:34.517+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot genuinely hopes you'll buy lcs merch and skins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neriticc","date":"2019-09-13T08:08:29.492+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito Games get erect when they look at her that’s why she is getting a new stripper skin and buffs. 100% obvious fucking bias in this company.","replies":[{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2019-09-13T08:19:49.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"She's actually really really really strong right now.
