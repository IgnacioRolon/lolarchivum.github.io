If old Akali and the like have to go then so do all targeted spells as they lack counterplay.\n\nAs I've stated, the problem of her damage being point and click was amplified by the fact that she's an assassin, a class that traditionally deals heavy burst damage. ADCs deal sustained damage, meaning there is a time window between an ADC engaging you and you dying. Mages don't have their entire kits being PnC, and support damage falls off a cliff. If Sona Q+AAs you after early game it tickles. If old Akali did it you died.

That's not balanced.\n\nI'm not saying new Akali is balanced. I'm saying that design wise, old Akali was still way worse even if numbers said she was balanced. Tryndamere is balanced too. Nuclear-tipped spears Nidalee was balanced. Does it automatically mean those champions are healthy for the game?\n\n> Great, and now here we are with a champion that's practically the same just with more flexibility. \n> \n> Also, point and click damage is hardly an issue. If anything it's a downside as you lack range.\n\nPoint and click damage might not be an issue by itself. But when it's dealt in burst, on a champion from whom escaping is impossible, and has sustain attached then it becomes a problem. If old Akali was in range to dash on you and had enough stats, you died. Period.\n\n> Mmm, that's true, but it was a reasonable amount (before they buffed her passive to have a 4 sec cooldown for some reason).\n> \n> Actually there was plenty of counterplay. You could displace/CC her during her dash and kill her, place down a pink ward and murder her, not fight her because her ult had a low(ish) range and you could just y'know; not 1v1 her.\n\n\"CC and kill\" is a counterplay to any champion. PInk warding, again, relied on Akali not having numbers to do her task. If she did, congratulations! You can see her while she's murdering you! On the other hand, if she didn't have numbers then warding was just a waste. Hardly a satisfying outcome for anyone.\n\n> As for the latter part, so the healing part...just remove {{item:3146}} . It's an abomination of an item that has no place in the game anymore.\n\nAgreed on that. Remove {{item:3812}} as well while on it.\n\n> Ok, but statistically this version of Akali is far harder to balance than pre-rework Akali or Akali 1.5. How do you explain that?\n\nThat's easily explained with her skill requirement. New Akali is one of most difficult champions to master, meaning she can never be balanced for anyone. In hands of good players with coordinated teams she will dominate, so she needs to be kept in a gutter for everyone else. Compared to old Akali, who was extremely easy to pick up and as such her winrate difference between bad and good players was lower.\n\n> Pre-rework Akali had hardly any changes made to her and she did just fine, and she was actually easy to nerf. \n> This Akali on the other hand, receives only nerf...after nerf...after nerf...after nerf...after removal of a certain new aspect of her kit...after nerf.\n\nWhile she was \"easy to nerf\", she wasn't fine at all game-health wise. As with new Akali, when old Akali was strong she sucked the fun out for everyone due to how easily she could get out of control and how hard it was to stop her once that happened.\n\n> -------------------------------\n> \n> Look, I did say that the revert would likely only be temporary. At least until they can design a rework that isn't literal aids to face, as tbh Akali 1.5 is the lesser of these two evils.\n\nConsidering she got full model update as well, with animations and particles to fit her new abilities, that isn't happening.

No one's putting that much time into a project just to scrap it.\n\nYou know how much it took to make each character back when Capcom was developing Street Fighter 4? Rumors have it that it was about 1 million USD per character. Skullgirls? $250K per character. Why would I bring that up here? Because developing a video game character takes *time and money.* You can't just scrap it after one or two years. That's hundreds of thousands of dollars, as well as time investment, you're tossing out the window. And to do so *for a shitty N64 graphics rip looking model from 2010?*\n\nNo one cares who's asking. Stop asking.\n \n> And have a 36%-43% win rate champion in the process who is 0 fun to play? \n\n> I think the only time this is ever acceptable for the playerbase is when it happens to assassin lmao\n\nIt happened with Zoe and now she's perfectly fine. Significantly less belly aching about her and she still sees occasional pro play. Do I personally like it? No. I've always defended the Akali rework and I don't even play assassins, simply because there's more counter-play to the champion than getting ran down and murdered relentlessly. However, people don't think very far ahead in this community.","replies":[{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2020-01-26T17:42:59.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Why would I bring that up here?

Who cares about little snarky after thoughts you throw behind it to try to salvage a point?\n\nI really don't see how I'm trying to be snarky, I'm stating a fact. They never gutted her, she's always been viable.\n\n>New Akali > Old Akali because old Akali has no counter-play save \"cc her\". Don't even mention the pink ward because they scrapped that during the assassin rework.\n\nIf you actually could use basic comprehension skills you'd realise that I think that the stealth changes outside of making camouflage a thing were atrocious. Pink wards countering invis. champs were perfectly fine, and that same mechanic is used in every other MOBA and RTS, wherein you forfeit gold to counter something specific; in this case, invisibility. \n\nOld Akali did have counterplay, and I've listed the counterplay in the comments, so please have a read through of them.\n\n>I'm actually going to be nice here and just let you live despite saying something so outlandishly...\"amazing\".\n\n\"...let you live...\", christ, and I thought I was the edgy one.
