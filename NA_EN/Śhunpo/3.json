How do you call that bad. Oh yeah its also only 2900 gold. 2000 + 900 gold. For: Invincibility, armor, cdr, GOOD AP, not to mention the building items to it. Seekers is so good. 45 armor for 1100 gold but it also gives you 45 ap. if you did the calculation of seekers, the value it gives is stupid. Also stopwatch? Yeah no thats broken too. \n\nNow we can talk about protobelt :D 2500 gold for a mobility, high burst, high hp, cdr, good AP item that can clear waves very well actually.
