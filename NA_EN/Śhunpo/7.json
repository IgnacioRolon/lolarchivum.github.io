With the changes planned to the jungle he&#039;s just going to get even better since he&#039;s not much of a farming jungler anyways. \r\n\r\nNot only that but the champion lacks any form of mechanical intensity outside of double jumps and he&#039;s almost impossible to face when ahead. I would hate him more but luckily he&#039;s not as popular as other OP junglers such as Lee sin and Camille.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-01-28T06:34:51.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya hes op","replies":[]}]}
