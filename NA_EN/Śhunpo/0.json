That is to say that other champions were buffed/nerfed because of the state of the game which included the state of klepto using champions and the nerfed ezreal in that time where you were figuring out that klepto was the problem. Once you figured out that klepto ez situation other champions had been inadvertently tuned to that meta, and when that meta faded other champions had been unnecessarily over/under tuned.

It's far too punishing to the player as in this game, almost all players know that a SECOND is a LONG time. It can cost a lot to just \"have fun\" and screw around with your friends, using emotes, allowing animations to finish on emotes. Interacting with taunts. It takes time, time the enemy will make you pay for.\n\nAnd as soon as the opponent gets ahead, the game will close out fast. And i meant REAL FAST. It can take about 5 to 10 minutes to finish a game after you're getting legitimately stomped on from trying to have fun and not care about winning. The enemies can literally take away all of your attempts at succeeding to have fun, whatever that may be, and disable you from playing the game by killing you through stomping you that you allowed to happen as you were trying to have fun.\n\nIt's why games like PUBG or CoD are popular for example.

People could make their own \"All for One\" on one side (and potentially lose horribly), but who DOESN'T want to know if an all Jhin team could take out a meta team?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Liquid Dario","date":"2018-03-18T03:23:40.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maple Nectar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VPJupcy1,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2018-03-17T06:11:36.869+0000)\n>\n> I have a sneaking suspicion that if we just turned off our API for like...2 months we&#x27;d start to see a lot more creativity and &quot;off meta&quot; decisions being made again. As a competitive sport/game depending on your degree of investment in league, it&#x27;s only natural that people will attempt to optimize the game as much as possible to give them the best chance to win. That gets made all that much easier when you can go to any 3rd party sight and look at whatever is &quot;the strongest&quot; champ/build order/strat on any given patch. Then throw the LCS into the equation and you not only have numbers to look at, but demonstrations by the best players in the game in how to play the game best. \n> \n> I was personally finding myself get a bit burnt out in ranked this season, so started focusing more on normals with friends and just tried out champs I haven&#x27;t played in ages, or took them in weird spots (Brand jungle). Even though I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s far from optimal, it was actually super fun to just try funky shit again. That was one thing I loved seeing when we first rolled out runes reforged (or the rune builder website). I was seeing so many people going &quot;oh shit! These specific runes on this champ sound so fun I can&#x27;t wait to try it!&quot;. You know, true theorycrafting, something of a lost art over the years. What we were seeing was players reading tooltips and getting excited envisioning moments in game, not looking at and trying to crunch the numbers for what was best. There was excitement, there was creativity, there was fun. Then runes launched and people immediately turned to 3rd party websites to figure out what the optimal pages were, and we saw decision making quickly converge on what the numbers said, not on what sounded fun. Part of it is we don&#x27;t yet have the system to the point where you have to think hard about what&#x27;s optimal, and part of it is human nature. Losing feels bad. So you tend to optimize to chase the win, as opposed to take the risk of picking something &quot;troll&quot; and lose a game/waste your time. \n> \n> This is hardly scratching the surface, but it&#x27;s something i&#x27;ve been lamenting on weekends, and something I don&#x27;t have a good answer to.\n\nWhat hes saying is not a lie tho this game isnt open enough every champion is designated to a spot or two max. The game really needs to be opened up. Why cant I play jinx jungle and be just as competitive as lee sin ? this is the kind of restriction I'm talking about. \n\nVery EXTREMELY rarely we will actually see a player do something odd. The last I can remember was a nunu in bot with smite .... and he got BANNED for his actions and had to go through hoops due to the whole situation. His originality literally got him in hot water with riot games.\n\nI really do not wanna be one of them \"haters\" but there is truth to what I am saying.\n\nYou guys really need to make an ACTIVE and quick acting decision regarding this. It is stunting the growth of league as a whole and just makes the game a stale boring game where you simply play against the same 2-3 champs per lane. \n\nOPTIMIZATION should not be according to which champion you play ... that should be up to your individual skill as a player. This comment you made is the fundamental issue with Riots decisions. \n\nIf ppl want to use smite top side that shouldn't be a problem it should be balanced around not removed or nerfed into uselessness. Teleport being the only top lane spell to use due to it allowing you to actually impact other lanes is something that needs to be dealt with too. \n\nTeleport needs to be changed into something that should allow top to have a higher impact on the game as a whole instead of having him live on an island for 30 mins into the game.\n\nRune system is a complete and utter failure. You wanted to promote originality and different styles of play. Instead all you did was replace masters and runes and mashed them together instead. They are the same thing with the same effects for the most part. Which if you failed the first time ... its like you flipped a hourglass upside down and expected a different result. Its the same system so the same failure occours. \n\nItemization hasnt changed at all. There is barely choice its more like 3 items is core no matter what the scenario then you can deviate VERY minimally between a VERY VERY small pool of items per champion.\n\nWarding being done by everyone - This really made support a useless role IMO. If anything we should be placing warding back on the support and adding it to the jungler. Make him roam and place things on the map instead of just needing to farm every 2 mins and ganking every 30 seconds.\nGive the jungler a purpose beyond just being a bloodthirsty maniac who has to babysit everyone every 30 seconds of a game.\n\nGive the jungler a reason to actually invade the jungle besides oh im going to gain a ward now. I mean I could keep typing but typically riot never listens or even responds to my posts so I am going to save the rest of my typing because I already know its going to fall on deaf ears. \n\nImproving this game is not hard. its improving riots stubbornness and will to change and adapt that is the issue here.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2018-03-17T03:59:50.885+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":18,"body":"your playing with mostly silvers and bronze players in normals i wouldnt say that doing off meta shit is the problem rather personal skill to make use of it","replies":[{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2018-03-17T04:04:12.484+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UnboundHades,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VPJupcy1,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-03-17T03:59:50.885+0000)\n>\n> your playing with mostly silvers and bronze players in normals i wouldnt say that doing off meta shit is the problem rather personal skill to make use of it\n\n\"Personal skill\", kinda hard when the meta picks are so meta that they invalidate anything off-meta.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2018-03-17T04:11:35.829+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":11,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lovesick,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VPJupcy1,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-03-17T04:04:12.484+0000)\n>\n> &quot;Personal skill&quot;, kinda hard when the meta picks are so meta that they invalidate anything off-meta.\n\nYet non-meta champions still have a decent winrate and are able to beat meta champions quite often.

It's about being viable. And usually when you build off meta, you DO go for synergies, just different synergies than when you go meta. For example, AD/On-hit TF. He builds attack speed and either crit+runaan's(Runaan's bolts stack his E faster), or on-hit. This synergizes with his E, which deals quite a bit of damage. AD Ahri, the main synergy with ADC Ahri has is that most ADCs don't have self peel or near as much safety, or CC. Ahri has all of those. It works, but you don't actually have synergy with crit(though most ADCs don't either, they just buy it to make their autos hurt). Meta is the most effective tactic available. It's not always the most interesting or fun, and people actually find OP strats by going off meta. Meta changes because people find something better by experimentation. There just isn't as much of that anymore because there's so much information out there and people wanna bandwagon with what the pros are doing.\n\nThat tank assassin meta wasn't made from someone playing the same Akali playstyle every single game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2018-03-17T07:52:13.051+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZephyrDrake,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VPJupcy1,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2018-03-17T04:11:35.829+0000)\n>\n> Yet non-meta champions still have a decent winrate and are able to beat meta champions quite often.

If I play Quinn bot lane into a Tristana I will almost definitely lose because Tristana is just that good. It doesn't matter if she's bronze or challenger, I will lose no matter what because that pick is just broken. \nOr better example, I pick Riven into Maokai. Even if he's bad I likely cannot kill him, yet he can kill me due to how good his base damages are and how much CC he has. Even if I roam to other lanes I'm still at a disadvantage because he beats me in roams. My skill as a Riven is almost completely negated when someone picks a meta tank top laner.\n\nMy skill level can only interact so much with what I pick. I could make pretty much everything work before season 8 (and the preseason), so what's holding me back now? \n\nI've been looking to better myself at this game for 8 years, got d2 at one point too. But like....my skill doesn't matter against picks that are just braindead auto-win. Case and point, Malzahar. Sure, I can buy QSS, but then I get stunned by their support, and then if I manage to get past that I get chain CC'd by their top laner. \n\nActually, this is less a champion specific problem, this is a general game problem. There's too much (mind my french) bullshit in this game and the game is sooo team focused that my own skill level hardly affects the outcome of the game. \nBut again, that wasn't my main point. My main point was that this game is less about fun and more about winning to most players. That is a glaring flaw to this game since \"fun\" is what drives players to recruit more players, play more of the game and really cherish their time playing this game. No one cherishes a game where the only purpose of it is to win.\n\n\"But people get enjoyment out of winning!\" you may cry. That is true, but would you really call that having fun? Is personal satisfaction really the best outcome in gaming? I'd argue that general fun and a sense of belonging in a group/community would bring more enjoyment to people's experiences if they could just get past the whole \"I NEED TO WIN THIS\" mentality. \nSure, winning is an objective, but it should never be the primary focus in video games.
