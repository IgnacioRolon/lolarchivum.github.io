And it last for 7 seconds because honestly if your opponent is smart and doesn't just sit there, you need that 7 seconds to kill them. Hell, most of the time if they aren't a hyper squishie I can't kill them in 7 seconds because they are either tanky or play smart.","replies":[{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2019-06-15T20:19:41.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you're telling me that thematics take precedence over balance?","replies":[{"poster":"Makarakarn","date":"2019-06-15T20:23:34.557+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KazKaz,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=p0dhH5pV,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2019-06-15T20:19:41.441+0000)\n>\n> So you're telling me that thematics take precedence over balance?\n\nDid you only read the first sentence of my comment?
