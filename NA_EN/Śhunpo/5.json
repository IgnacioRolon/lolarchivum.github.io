They claim it was to help supports buy power items, but they then stripped support of their powerful quests AND 3 of their biggest power items, all so we could use Sightstone for free. There were literally a dozen other ways that Sightstone could have been given to supports for free, but for some super strange reason, they decided to gut the passives and remove 3 items all together just to give us a free Sightstone. You really can't sit there and say that that was the most efficient and effective way to grant supports free Sightstones, not when they could have made it a trinket enhancement, or had it simply appear in your inventory after you hit a certain milestone. This entire thing with support itemization changing is just a giant cover for them to nerf every abuse case of the gold income items in game without properly locking it down to the class who needed them most.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2018-01-21T06:42:34.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rester,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qkjyR16N,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-01-21T06:25:28.301+0000)\n>\n> Pretty sure the sightstone change had nothing to do with adcs abusing relic shield.

The shield+overheal = you can't win ANY trades.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-01-21T06:13:33.208+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im just pissed ADCs have abused Relic Shield to the point that Riot thinks the best option is to delete everything we love about the item line instead of locking it down to melees only.","replies":[{"poster":"AShortJoke","date":"2018-01-21T07:03:37.780+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Riot has proven anything, its that they almost never choose the correct buff or nerf, they always try to do something that sorta works but also sorta doesn't and just makes things more annoying for everyone in the long run.

Secondly, Ancient Coin offers tanky stats once you go to Talisman. Third, it's FAR FAR easier to give Thresh compensation buffs for the loss of Relic Shield than it is to fucking remove an item entirely from the game for everyone else who actually uses and needs it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-01-21T10:48:38.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, you're right, it needs some nerfs, but look at the adcs playing without it, They get legit dumpstered because they are squishy without runes/masteries items, I think in the old 1 it was mandatory to go 18/0/12 just to survive/sustain, 200 scal hp, mr arm etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2018-01-22T08:16:23.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Peritheus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qkjyR16N,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-01-21T10:48:38.927+0000)\n>\n> Hmm, you&#x27;re right, it needs some nerfs, but look at the adcs playing without it, They get legit dumpstered because they are squishy without runes/masteries items, I think in the old 1 it was mandatory to go 18/0/12 just to survive/sustain, 200 scal hp, mr arm etc.\n\nIt needs a hotfix...","replies":[]}]}]}
