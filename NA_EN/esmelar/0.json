No he's not an all-around terrible champ, but his weaknesses and strengths are so odd. It feels like his stealth puts him in the niche of a marksman/assassin, and stealth being a mechanic that Riot seems to never be happy with makes him even more of a problem. He has two steroids that allow him to burst down entire teams alone if fed, but his other basic abilities and passive feel underwhelming mechanically and numerically. His ranged assassin playstyle means that Riot has to give him low early game numbers, and his stealth means that he has to reserve a certain lack of counterplay. It's incredibly difficult in Twitch's current state to get fed, and since his items only increase his strength as much as one would expect for an adc, his role in a team is \"be an adc that people won't expect coming as he tries to 1v1 people\", even though there are adcs that specialize in burst and dueling that would be able to take him out in an even fight.\n\nThat being said, I personally hate supporting Twitch because laning phase I never expect to get any kills as he cant whittle people down with any worthwhile poke, and the strength of his Q + ult isn't enough to 2v2 two full health opponents. His slow isn't as reliable as I'd like it to be for someone with low mobility either. It feels very much like his strategy is just to farm, despite there being marksmen like Vayne and co. who scale far better with farm and are still able to kill in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Shosuko","date":"2015-10-29T14:03:13.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I think Twitch really needs a full rework into a more cohesive kit.
