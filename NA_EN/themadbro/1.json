I would like to understand why the system cannot recognize when someone is being ganged up on by a group and how in the world does &quot;child&quot; and &quot;Snowflake&quot; constitute as being chat ban worthy? \r\nI truly miss the old Tribunal system when a reasonable person could view the entire chat and get some understanding of what was actually going on.\r\n\r\nOn my part: I stayed in the game in spite of playing with a horrible group. I did not intentionally feed and I tried my best. I endured name-calling, trash talk, teammates purposefully preventing me from getting CS, 3/4 teammates falling out of teamfights until I was killed off and then would try to 3v5 or 4v5.  This was all because the support got upset when he tower dove at level 3 and gave first blood while I did not follow him. So please explain how this system is helping me as a player? Or is it the word snowflake is somehow more offensive than the massive amount of cussing, swearing, religion bashing and other things that I report almost weekly and yet, never get a notice that those players are banned.\r\n\r\nIn a game about 2 months ago I wrote &quot;lol, don&#039;t be a snowflake&quot; to a guy who started cussing me out because I accidentally used my lucian ult in the wrong direction. I also got chat banned after that game... What makes this word so bad?","replies":[{"poster":"BlueThingamajig","date":"2018-11-14T01:06:03.049+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"You: I got gang-reported and banned. \nAlso You: I tried to get someone else gang-reported and banned. \n\nMost important note: The IFS does not count the number of reports.
