We have been seeing a higher than usual amount of tickets these last few days.\r\n\r\nChecking your account it looks like you had already gotten sets of chat restrictions in the past. As a result of continued negativity it has now resulted in this suspension. With our Instant Feedback system accounts will generally be issued punishments on an escalating path which looks like this:\r\n\r\n10 chat restrictions-&gt;25 chat restrictions-&gt;2 week suspension-&gt;Permaban\r\n\r\nAny negative behavior that would result in a penalty (even chat restrictions) will bump an account up the next step. I totally get that games can get frustrating at times but that never excuses responding to that negativity with more negativity. Berating others when things go wrong just makes things worst for everyone. Remember, you are responsible for your own behavior only and it doesn&#039;t matter who &quot;started it.&quot;\r\n\r\nI don&rsquo;t want to see you lose your account and in the future I highly suggest using chat only for when it will contribute to the success of your team. If you don&rsquo;t have anything positive to say it just might be best to say nothing at all. In my games I always prefer to instantly mute those players that are being negative as it isn&rsquo;t worth giving them the attention they want.\r\n\r\nLegendary\r\nPlayer Behavior &amp; Game Support\r\nJarvan IV Jungle\r\n&quot;For the King!&quot;&quot;\r\n\r\nI thought muting players gets you reported for lack of communication, then i found out apparently those reports dont go anywhere. SO WHY IS IT AN OPTION?\r\n\r\nwhy dont they refined the report categories to things that are actually report able offences, that way there man might actually be enough man power to go through the reports.\r\n\r\nIf they are lacking the man power to get through the reports properly, put it off, or dont do it. As paying(or not) customers we should be innocent until proven guilty in this system.\r\n\r\nIm going to do what ever i can legally to get my refund for all ive spent on this game and close my account for good. With the touchiness of this system, and already being on 3rd level restrictions(that never go down by the way)","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2017-10-27T23:17:15.611+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since this has gone from a discussion about the OPs ban to the OP just attacking anyone who disagrees with them this thread is now locked.

Seems like a very long time of no problems to stay at that level.   \n\n6 months is typically enough to drop, provided your behavior is good. My suspicion with this log is that you've been riding the line for a while, and that it finally pushed you over -- or that you simply haven't played much in that time. The usual estimate is 3-5 months.\n\n> or the Instant Feedback system takes a joke out of context or something.\n\nIf you're not making jokes where the \"humor\" arises from taking insults in the manner in which they were perhaps intended, you will not encounter this issue in the future. Remember that people on the internet may not know how you intend a statement, or may not find casual insulting amusing or enjoyable.\n\n> Chat bans should be handed out all the time.\n> But Gameplay bans should require Gamebreaking behavior such as intentionally feeding or going afk.\n\nRiot tried extended chat bans in the past and found them unsatisfactory in terms of how they dealt with toxicity.
