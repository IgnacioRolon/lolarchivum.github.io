Demacians have to be loud, cocky, or at least be annoying with their voice (Cough, Lux laugh, cough). Sona is all quiet, just strumming her instrument like a quiet Ionian. She... kinda is Ionian though, but brought to Demacia. Sorta why Kayle isn't in there either. She's Demacian, but isn't actually Demacian.","replies":[{"poster":"RedCyclone","date":"2015-10-23T12:32:45.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To each thier own, there is nothing wrong with the piece at all\nJust I never understood when people get confused on Sona's alliance, her entire color pallet screams \"DEMACIAAAA!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Wallyshark","date":"2015-10-24T09:29:20.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well thanks :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wannabe Doom Bot","date":"2015-10-23T01:51:08.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aw this is cute!!\n\nand sona doesn't strike me as very demacian looking either. maybe its because she was born in ionia?","replies":[{"poster":"Solari Fortune","date":"2015-10-23T05:07:06.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Born in Ionia, Raised in Demacia","replies":[{"poster":"Wannabe Doom Bot","date":"2015-10-23T12:24:34.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, exactly my point ^^","replies":[]}]}]}]}
