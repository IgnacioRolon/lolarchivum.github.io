He recently got banned for asking for a report on a teammate who was trolling champ select and didn't dodge in time. The game ended up remaking and yet, he got 14 day banned for letting the enemy team know what happened than asking for a report after. This is, in my opinion, very mild. I've seen people tell others to dangle from ceiling fans and not get banned and yet, he asks for a report and gets banned. Not to mention the amount of times I've seen people ask for reports and not get banned is insane. \r\n\r\nhttps://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/3065635790/80679175?tab=overview\r\n\r\nNow, look at this \r\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/338744359120011274/591107266904588289/unknown.png\r\n\r\nThis summoner (the summoner in this case is me) went into this game intentionally wanting to int and I did just that. The punishment received was a 14 day ban for intentionally running it down in someones game. A very reasonable ban reason and much deserved. So, how does Player 1 receive the same punishment as me? One asked for a teammate to be reported during a REMAKE and got punished for two weeks, and my mouse slipped 19 times throwing the game making 4 of my teammates lose LP. \r\n\r\nDoes riot really not see a difference between our two actions? In the eyes of riot this man deserves a 14 day ban just as much as an inter! So, the next time you feel like asking for someone to be reported you might as well int. You're no better as the person who is inting your game.","replies":[]}
