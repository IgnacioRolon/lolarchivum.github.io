Super leashed for jungler and my allies got to lane faster which created a positive morale atmosphere to start off the match in solo ranked. Smite in lane helped secured cannon minions or skuttle crab; then later it helped secure Dragons, Heralds, or Barons while the jungler busy or dead. The burst was the best cause it didn't give the enemy a chance to potions, stopwatch, or barrier to live. Great for burst mages for sure, the slow acted like an early Rylai's in lane and since it was a cheaper version of luden's it helped clear lane minions faster. Smite in lane felt like a superior spell in alot ways and aspects over ignite.{{summoner:14}}","replies":[{"poster":"TreeDayBan","date":"2020-02-07T12:00:45.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, before it reduced minion kill gold by like 50%, but since that's gone, its probably not a bad item to get on some champs anymore since its cost efficient and smites are pretty good.\n\nI was gonna come here and tell you it reduced minion gold, but I must have missed that change recently. Because I accidentally took smite in pre-season on an ADC and my CS gold was cut in half. Never paid much attention after that, cause I mostly play support.","replies":[{"poster":"lunarcana","date":"2020-02-07T18:20:18.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait when was the minion gold reduction removed?","replies":[{"poster":"Worst JG Wins","date":"2020-02-07T19:00:27.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=lunarcana,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZVPxX43A,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2020-02-07T18:20:18.087+0000)\n>\n> wait when was the minion gold reduction removed?\n\nit wasnt","replies":[{"poster":"TreeDayBan","date":"2020-02-07T22:49:48.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Worst JG Wins,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZVPxX43A,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2020-02-07T19:00:27.161+0000)\n>\n> it wasnt\n\nIts nowhere on the item anymore. Unless I'm missing something, I'm pretty positive it used to say you got reduced minion gold, just like support items do. Well, it no longer says that for some reason. And, doesnt seem to be reducing gold.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
