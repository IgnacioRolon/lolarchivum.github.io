Whereas ziggs has.....a Q. \n\nVel'koz has a Q that can be used to pick off opponents if they're not looking. Ziggs has....a Q.\n\nVel'koz has a lazor that can decimate teamfights if positioned correctly. Ziggs has.....an ult that tells you where its landing....\n\nVel'koz has a passive that deals extra true damage. Ziggs has.....a passive that deals extra magic damage.\n\nWhy would I pick Ziggs over Vel'koz? The only reason you pick Ziggs is for his Q and his ult and MAYBE his w for cc. Besides that, no one cares about Ziggs. You pick Vel'koz for geometry, for lazors, and for killing noobs who aren't looking (lol).\n\nI see there a complete reason to pick Vel'koz over other mages.","replies":[{"poster":"Orangesilk","date":"2016-01-22T14:27:01.479+0000","up_votes":49,"down_votes":8,"body":"Let's be honest, the differences are minimal, their role in teams are the same.

That doesn't really matter to me because the specific items he gets for damage don't really change how he plays.\n\nAnd he's not always relevant either. Having lower gold-scaling means he's tuned more into level scaling, and when he's behind he falls behind in levels just as quickly as anyone else and suffers more for it. He's just as bad as any other low-utility character when he's behind.

I can (or could, anyway) elect to get Twin Shadows if my team was really light on CC and not feel like I'm gimping him too much. CDR, mana, and Liandry's/Luden's make him an efficient poke, MPen and raw AP make him a decent burst mage, Rylai's + Luden's + CDR results in a decent peel/CC mage.\n\ntl;dr: He may have an optimal build like everyone else, but he isn't punished as much for straying from it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zero Skill Tank","date":"2016-01-22T14:38:57.073+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"> Besides that, no one cares about Ziggs. \n\nThis is exactly the problem.

THat's why he was picked when he was good.  When the meta is about objective control Ziggs shines.  \n\nVel'Koz is different from Ziggs beause he has true damage and the ability to decimate an entire team in a teamfight.  Ziggs is much less about burst and more about constant poke.  With Vel'Koz you're trying to stack your passive and take advantage of it, as in, play smartly.  WIth Ziggs, again, is more about constantly poking and harrasing the enemy while keeping zone control.  These champions play nothing alike.  If you're going to 1v1 someone with Vel'Koz it's all about paying attention to your stacks and landing the perfect combo.  Laning with ziggs is about poking the hell out of your opponent until he has to leave lane because you out traded him.\n\nThere are many other champions in the game where their kit is fairly similar (specially with melees and tanks) but they have their own purpose and gameplay.  VK really needs no rework at all, and absolutely nobody is asking for it.   Meanwhile you have Katarina the most binary champion in the game, or Karma which is a mage in much more need for a rework.
