I come back on as soon as it comes back up and i have this penalty for something I can't control? Why is that?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-06T23:23:16.549+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely understand where you are coming from, especially since power going out is something that isn't in your control at all.  Keep in mind that we never punish for a single leave, and it seems like this is the 2nd DC after creating a fairly new account.  Punishments are much stricter on low level accounts due to the fact that we want players to understand that leaving games is definitely not ok.\n\nAs long as you don't experience any other random acts of God, you should be good to go!
