It would be different if the hook started from a spot in front of him so he could use the cc from his hook if he is also standing next to the wall and the enemy is standing next to the same wall on the other side but it doesn't start from a spot like that and he doesn't have to stand next to the wall so it's 100% a repeatable bug.

It won't animate through the wall like that.  The reason it does with a champion there is because the champion hitbox overlaps far enough into/past the wall that it triggers a hit.  The way Riot animates a skillshot impact is by snapping the projectile to the champion hitbox's anchor position.  This is why landing a Thresh hook at the very tip of a champion's hitbox will still anchor to the target's chest.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/4aRgCGZ.png[]","replies":[{"poster":"GonahtanuGepardi","date":"2019-12-17T13:57:26.821+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes yes but explaining why it happens is pointless as we already know that.

It's you not fundamentally understanding how hitboxes work  in a game that updates information on a server.\n\nThe shortest answer as to \"why this happens\" is one word: Interpolation. \n\nLet's pretend League is a game played live and not on servers, meaning hitboxes are measured and determined frame-by-frame, like a fighting game.\n\nHitboxes in games exist  as interpolated instances. That is, they are placed where they are on, for example, frame 10, then there is time before frame 11's hitbox placement. When frame 11 comes,  the hitbox is interpolated between the two points between its location on frame 10 and its new target location, meaning it exists at both points as well as the space between the points  in the time between the frames.\n\nWhen the game checks if Nautilus's anchor has collided with anything, it uses interpolated hitbox information. So on, we'll call it frame 10 even though it's probably like frame 40 or whatever, on frame 10, the anchor has not collided with any terrain. Then the game is moving into frame 11, so the anchor hitbox moves to its new location and interpolates the area between the locations. On frame 11, the anchor hitbox has moved past the wall and to a location where an enemy player is. Because the hitbox has been interpolated, it has collided with the wall \"between\" frames, while  detecting a hit on Ashe on frame 11 because her hitbox is overlapping with it.\n\nThat's in a game where time is measured in frames. In an online game like league, though, time is measured in MS of ping between server updates. In even the best kept servers, this is going to result in significantly longer interpolation between updated hitbox locations than would occur frame-by-frame, meaning the wall can be much thicker than in an offline game and this occurs.\n\nNo one is defending this happening, simply stating why it happens. Even people who wrongly thought it was due to being out of position  were simply ignorant of this interpolation themselves, not personally attacking you  or vehemently looking to say small multi billion dollar indie company riot can do no wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2019-12-17T02:18:56.364+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"TL;DR Walls need to be made slightly thicker to stop this from happening.","replies":[{"poster":"PopcornBunni","date":"2019-12-17T02:23:45.957+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or Anchor's hitbox flattened in the Z-axis, which would be much easier a change.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreamspitter","date":"2019-12-17T10:16:46.561+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PopcornBunni,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=H3BmEpPl,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2019-12-17T02:23:45.957+0000)\n>\n> Or Anchor's hitbox flattened in the Z-axis, which would be much easier a change.\n\nIs there really a Z axis in game?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-12-17T10:22:16.898+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dreamspitter,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=H3BmEpPl,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2019-12-17T10:16:46.561+0000)\n>\n> Is there really a Z axis in game?\n\nThe graphics have a Z axis, but the game's model (the part that keeps track of where stuff is and who's doing what) doesn't.","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2019-12-17T12:27:07.710+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And this leads to problems in the river.

The anchor can completely miss you visually, but you'll get hooked anyways. With most hook supports all reasonable people can agree, there are some BS hits. I'm willing to put up with that if it's only once in a while, but with Nautilus there's a BS hit more times than there aren't. It is legitimately broken.\n\nThere have been so many times both in my games and in streams where I've seen a champion completely side step his anchor, only to be locked down and deleted or be forced to use flash. It's not fair and when a champion is as broken as that, they should be disabled until Riot fixes them. We shouldn't have to waste a ban, and it's such a well known issue at this point. His ban rate is high, and I know everyone didn't just decide to become Nautilus mains towards the end of season 9.\n\nAftershock is obnoxious enough. He doesn't need an anchor hitbox that takes up half the lane on top of it because at this point you can play him blindfolded and end up hitting someone half the time.","replies":[]}]}
