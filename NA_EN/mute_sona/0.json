I recall a few red posts stating that new champions is one of the core qualities of league of legends to help game development and pursue better balance.\r\n\r\nEven Smite has four bans per team and their pool isn't nearly as big as League's. I'm not sure about the bans in Dota2. But besides the point.\r\nIf we were to have four bans per team it only banishes 9.84% of the pool leaving 81.16% which is still enough diversity per game.
