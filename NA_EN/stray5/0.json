Before I get started I just want to say that I think this is my first boards discussion, and even though it is short I will try to get my point across.\r\n\r\nEver since the slight Tristana {{champion:18}}  rework I was disappointed to find out that her W (Rocket Jump) is still not an actual jump.  It is, in fact, a dash.  This might not seem like a big deal at first, but when you look at it in pro plays and general ranked/normals it is a pretty big difference.  The ability being a Dash (Like Shen's {{champion:98}}  dash, or Tryndamere's {{champion:23}}  spin slash) means that Tristana is still targettable even though it appears she jumps mid air.  This means that the following abilities can affect her:\r\n\r\nEverything.\r\n\r\nNot even gonna list.  EVERY ability can hit and interrupt Tristana, from Blitz {{champion:53}}  Q to Malphite {{champion:54}}  R.  That means that she gets knocked up IN MID AIR!  She can be auto attacked, hit with skill shots, targeted for literally any point and click (Jax {{champion:24}}  Q for example).\r\n\r\nAll I'm saying is she performs the _**FATTEST**_ of arcs which would make you think she dodges things, but in all actuality shes as vulnerable as a kalista {{champion:429}} trying to dodge an ezreal {{champion:81}}  ult.  (WHICH CAN HIT HER TOO!  SHE FLIES LIKE 30 FEET ABOVE IT FOR GOD SAKES!)\r\n\r\nSo please, riot.  Make my girl jump, not dash.  Sincerely, a Tristana main.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-02T01:47:50.662+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"There is no such thing as a \"jump\" in this game and no such thing as \"up.\" Making Trist untargetable and/or unstoppable during her W is unnecessary.","replies":[{"poster":"ProExpertKing","date":"2019-08-02T05:01:06.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"It would allow her to be an adc that allows you to really go ham without being instantly denied being able to play the game.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-02T05:50:07.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ProExpertKing,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=y7QBjzFy,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-08-02T05:01:06.238+0000)\n>\n> It would allow her to be an adc that allows you to really go ham without being instantly denied being able to play the game.\n\nIt would allow her to eat a gigantic nerf so she doesn't become 100% pick/ban due to being able to W out of any fight with no counterplay, is what it would allow her to do.","replies":[{"poster":"ProExpertKing","date":"2019-08-02T17:43:57.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It doesn't have \"No counter play\".

I think it would give a bit of depth to her ability and would have to make players think about when they throw out their spells instead of just throwing it out there and hoping it hits.","replies":[{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2019-08-02T12:25:18.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes and what else doesn't \"make sense\" is that {{champion:54}} is as big as a mountain yet {{champion:150}} can kill him.\n\n{{champion:223}} is a fish but {{champion:267}} water hurts him\n\n{{champion:136}} is a a God but dies to {{champion:119}} \n\nEct...Ect....Ect....\n\nITS A VIDEO GAME, it WILL NOT make sense.","replies":[{"poster":"ProExpertKing","date":"2019-08-02T17:52:26.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Tahm isn't a fish and nami sprays salt water. High velocity salt water to a lake dwelling demon. Of course it's gonna hurt.\nThere's a little bit of a difference between physics being questionable and power being questionable.\n\nGnar can kill Malphite because it doesn't fucking matter if he's as big as a mountain, Gnar can clearly punch through a mountain. Braum did it.\n\nDraven can kill Aurelion cause he's a gladitor who's really good at sticking an axe blade through your skull. Aurelion still has a brain that he needs to have to function. Without it he's dead. Pantheon's new lore even confirms that the celestials can die. Although the idea did come form Morgana and Kayle's lore first.\n\nSaying the Gnar beats Malphite is like Samurais beat Knights. There's no real proof that he can or can't. There is however proof that adding an iron bar to an onion ring won't make it float. If you jump over something, you jumped over it, it can't affect you. That's why can jump over walls because she goes over it but somehow doesn't go over any ground abilities, like wtf.","replies":[{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2019-08-03T01:50:17.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.
