This is the 3rd time I&#039;ve been banned for no reason besides 3 or more enemy team players trash talking and being unbelievably bm all game and let them unmuted so I had plenty to report yet they don&#039;t get punished. Stuck up for my teammate who was being bullied by 4 of them yet riot leaves them unpunished. This game is complete shit and I&#039;ve uninstalled. I&#039;ve watched every one of my friends on league leave because how shitty your game has become. No I will not be coming back. Sincerely f$#k you riot and your steadily declining game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Ticklesword","date":"2017-12-12T18:24:20.201+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You only get a notification if your report was the last one to trigger a punishment. Which means either someone else got it or the next report will hit them. You helped by building a case on players you report. \n\nYou have every right to quit a game you don't find fun, but your reasoning to do so seems incredibly petty.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shandrake","date":"2017-12-12T19:55:04.702+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat~ Logs~ Please~","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-12-12T19:51:56.659+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would not mind seeing some chat logs to see how civil your end was.","replies":[{"poster":"zileanistaliban","date":"2017-12-12T22:14:30.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-12-12T22:37:08.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tribunal doesn't exist anymore.
