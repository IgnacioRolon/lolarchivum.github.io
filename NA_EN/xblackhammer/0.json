But in actuality it does not help at all. The matchmaking system assigns teams randomly. Players have no way to avoid the 'troll' until they see them in champion select, and it is highly unlikely unlikely for anyone who gets matched with that player to also see your post and know to dodge the match.\n\nOn top of that, revealing a player's information online does harm, because it gives others the opportunity to harass them.\n\nConclusion: It does more harm than good, so posting on the boards to reveal trolls is not worthwhile.\n\nIf you want them to be investigated you can always submit a support ticket to Riot. That would be much more effective for getting them out of peoples' matches.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"xBlackHammer","date":"2017-11-07T14:35:22.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NF Kuddles,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=GErabj54,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-07T14:25:16.751+0000)\n>\n> 1.

Even if they were behaving poorly you harassing them over it will change nothing except make it more likely that they continue with that behavior now that they've gotten a negative reaction out of you. Also, you seem to be under the belief that multiple reports in a game lead to a punishment: that's not true, as it only takes 1 report to flag a game for review (keyword: review), and if punish worthy behavior is found in that game and multiple games then that's when the player gets punished.\n\nYes trolls stink and are annoying and frustrating to play with and we've all experienced it at one point or another. However, there are better ways of handling it then spending all game harassing the trolls and calling for reports against them. Next time I would suggest finding other ways to vent your frustration rather than using the in-game chat to do so, as that time is better spent playing the actual game itself.
