I click Launch, nothing happens, I look in Task Manager and it's in processes so it's working in the background but no application pops up, I have tried multiple fixes like reinstalling, deleting the RAD folder,  My internet is fine so that isn't an issue and running as administrator, and still nothing works. Please someone help, I Don't want to stop playing the game that got me into PC gaming..","replies":[{"poster":"Imagine Wagonss","date":"2017-09-30T19:35:03.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I need help plz, my league client won't start after I press \"launch\" I have tried many things and read on about it but I cant find something that will work o my computer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Braxxdonboi888","date":"2017-08-14T19:31:03.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PLEASE HELP ASAP!

I press launch and the mouse shows it loading, but no login window appears; and same as you, it is running in background via the task manager.\nHave tried everything I have found on the internet, both new and old... and nothing seems to help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-14T03:08:55.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue has historically been caused by your connection to our login servers being *poor or unstable*.
