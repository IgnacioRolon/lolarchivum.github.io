We believe that all players should play on equal footing in an effort to promote competitive sportsmanship. You should be aware that modifying your League of Legends client is against the Terms of Use: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse. We hope you can see that it is unsatisfying to play against other players who are using a tool to gain an advantage over others._\r\n\r\nI followed up through the support ticket the last week and after discussing with Player Support, their final answer was:\r\n\r\n_I must reiterate that we cannot comment on programs that we do not officially support. However, our system did detect usage of exploits that seriously violated our Terms of Use. In the end, we will not be changing our decision regarding this case._\r\n\r\nThe confusion I had with my ban, as many others have within the past week. The only modifications I have made were the rebinding of my Champion Mastery Emote to my spells (Q,W,E,R,D,F), and I installed custom skins via a program called Wooxy. The programs only function is to add purely cosmetic changes such as custom skins for champions and maps as I screenshot below. While using the program I had three skins which were Demon Illoai, Dark Side Yi, and Surprise Party Rengar.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/cNayiT4.png\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1R862v6.png\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Im7bzDP.png \r\n\r\nI did some poking around viewing my files to reassure myself of any modifications that I was not aware of, and my findings validated my suspicion. The only files affected/modified were the config file to rebind my Champion Mastery Emote, as well as some champion models due to the skins I had. For those that are interested, screenshots below with a short description of where the file path is.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/u9wU6t0.png \r\n(C:\\Riot Games)\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GktWfGs.png \r\n(C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends)\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4Su6aEj.png \r\n(C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config)\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YfsXhvL.png \r\n(C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\\Champions)\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KC6ff0U.png \r\n(C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs)\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CYvHDMD.png \r\n(C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS)\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/P4xBYjj.png \r\n(C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\temp)\r\n\r\n\r\n**SO MANY LINKS IM SORRY**\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}} \r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YWpiWmE.png \r\n(C:\\Wooxy)\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qz5nM5z.png \r\n(C:\\Wooxy\\skins)\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dQRcTeS.gifv (C:\\Wooxy\\backup\\l3cdn.riotgames.com\\releases\\live\\lol_air_client\\0.0.1.31\\assets\\images\\champions)\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HrKOMs3.png \r\n(C:\\Wooxy\\images)\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UtZKNwz.png \r\n(C:\\Wooxy\\images\\champions)\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all that being said, I want to know opinions and hear from others affected, because to what I see and know about the usage of custom skins, they are more of a warning instead of an instant perma-ban by Riot.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, and I hope you all Stay Victorious!\r\n\r\n-Derrick/VG Drock55555","replies":[{"poster":"mirageofpenguins","date":"2016-01-16T00:30:19.105+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":1,"body":"Heya Derrick,\n\nI appreciate the thoroughly documented screencaps, but we don't currently suspend for the use of Wooxy or other skin installers (if that's their only functionality).

I'm curious to know if any of these said \"users\" are given any type of second chance, even if they tried every year to revive the banned account.  I've seen so many people banned from these \"scripting\" programs, while I see how a perma-ban suits that kind of thing, isn't it mildly, and I mean mildly unfair to some of those who have spent a large amount of cash on their main account?  I'm usually a firm believer of second chances, even if it is the player's fault that they never read the ToS.  As a matter of fact I'm sure most of these players have yet to read it, even if they were here since the first season.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2016-01-16T03:54:36.200+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Money should never be a factor in deciding punishment.\n\nELO boosting is permaban-worthy as well, and they at least did that part knowingly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2016-01-16T01:32:22.725+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"While i know nothing about the support system for this kind of situation as I haven't been banned before.

There's never really a good reason to share your account, and those seeking additional security guidelines can level up [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account#h2q1).\n\nHello MirageOfPenguins (and Riot SlumberJack),\n\nI understand what you both are saying, my confusion is truly this. \nI was not aware of any other user playing on my account during said time. I do admit another person had logged onto my account before in December of 2014, which I know is an issue in it of itself, but they were not playing games to my knowledge. I was myself playing ranked bouncing between Silver III and Silver I, but I do not recall noticing any odd changes or anything to make me suspect that another user was on my account. \n\nWhile I do understand that use of 3rd party programs to obtain an unfair advantage is a severe offense and the proper action needed to be taken place, what I was hoping for with my posting to boards is a chance to speak with Rioters about it to see if there is any opportunity to correct the situation and allow users such as myself a chance to reform.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEAT ENGINE ssd","date":"2016-01-20T00:39:38.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=VG Drock55555,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7JBfAA5o,comment-id=0013,timestamp=2016-01-17T19:12:05.166+0000)\n>\n> Hello MirageOfPenguins (and Riot SlumberJack),\n> \n> I understand what you both are saying, my confusion is truly this. \n> I was not aware of any other user playing on my account during said time.

If you have seen my post previously I have stated multiple times I did not hack at all. I have many accounts, why is it my main is the one that gets perma banned :/ I have a mental disorder/illness as I have been told where I get emotionally attached to anything I have been for a long time and I have had this account for 3 years and the perma ban in which I have had is causing me so much stress and grief.\n\nI keep stating I have not hacked once in my life on league and if it was a third party application that I have not known about please let me know and I will delete it instantly but even still I do not use third party applications :/ like once my nvidia program told me I can change me aspect ratio and resolution to something that was not on leagues client and it modified it for me. It ended up looking ugly so i changed it. I tampered with the league client because i was having stuttering actually last month which ended up fixing it and now thag people mention it i seriously feel like that was the reason i got banned :/\n\nPlease all I want is a way to prove that I did not hack! Please just some way :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"FastAsHeck","date":"2016-01-15T19:36:39.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have done the **exact** same things... shit.
