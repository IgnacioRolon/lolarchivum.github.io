The Star Guardian skins currently on PBE make 4 more for 971. We have 29 skins before the 1000th skin. Riot missed the opportunity to make Devil Teemo the 666th skin. What skin should be the 1000th?\r\n\r\nI believe it should be an Ultimate skin and one for a Champ without a huge skin pool already.\r\n\r\nThe champions with the most skins are as follows:\r\nEzreal (13) [Ultimate]\r\nMiss Fortune (12) [Ultimate]\r\nAlistair (12)\r\nAhri (11)\r\nAkali (11)\r\nAnnie (11)\r\nCaitlyn (11)\r\nKatarina (11)\r\nLux (11) [Ultimate]\r\nTwisted Fate  (11)\r\n\r\nNot listed Champs with Ultimate skins already:\r\nSona (8) [Ultimate]\r\nUdyr (5) [Ultimate]\r\n\r\nThe Champions with the least amount of skins are:\r\nYuumi (1)\r\nSylas (1)\r\nQiyana (1)\r\nOrnn (1)\r\nNeeko (2) [When the Star Guardian Skin comes out]\r\nTaliyah (2)\r\nRek'Sai (2)\r\nKled (2)\r\nKindred (2)\r\nKayn (2)\r\nIvern (2)\r\nIllaoi (2)\r\nAurelion Sol (2)\r\n\r\nHonestly any champs with 4 or less skins I think should be eligible for it. What is the communities input? Is there any champ that the number 1000 applies to?","replies":[]}
