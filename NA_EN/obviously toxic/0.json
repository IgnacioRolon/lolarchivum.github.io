This isn't the reason we'd selected her, as I've mentioned the criteria we use above, but it was clear Sivir was someone players felt was impactful.","replies":[{"poster":"Pykel","date":"2015-10-05T22:02:34.145+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dont take this the wrong way, but clearly from peoples responses to the victorious skin being sivir i think we'll have to disagree. i understand you wanted a marksman i get the logic there you wanted to fill out the victorious pool to have champs from multiple roles, now im assuming you are talking about most impactful in the lcs NOT in the season (that skin would go to vayne), so i guess i see how you would choose sivir but i still think kallista trist or vayne deserved the skin a lot more. on a seperate note did riot ever decide what  they were going to do chroma wise with these skins?","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-10-06T18:19:35.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, that skin would not at all go to Vayne. That's literally the same problem as choosing Sivir. Vayne in solo-queue didn't see any play for months and now is at a high point. Sivir in solo-queue was at a highpoint and hasn't season play in a few months. Sivir just also has the benefit of being the definition of the tank meta, whereas Vayne...didn't really change anything about the game.\n\nTrist was highly impactful in the NA LCS, but the others kinda meh, not to mention she didn't really change the meta at the level Sivir did.","replies":[{"poster":"Pykel","date":"2015-10-06T21:16:16.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne didnt see play for months? what? Vaynes been played all season long, shes been the most popular solo que adc pick. sivir opened a new style to play that got played for a short while only in lcs and hasnt been played much since. my point is at least champs like trist and vayne have been impactful in both lcs and solo que, whereas sivir was impactful for about a month or two in lcs.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2015-10-05T18:52:37.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=cEUNgXWE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-10-05T18:19:47.758+0000)\n>\n> Hey DMortal1, \n> \n> These all have potential to be awesome Championship skins!

That's pretty fortunate, to be honest.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-05T21:00:57.780+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"We begin planning before Worlds, yes.
