( maybe it was who knows  :p )\n\nsion had sunfire and ninja tabi and somehow he managed to deal more than me and i was so frustrated because why can he outtrade with just straight up tank? i dont know i find it so boring and unfun to play againist because even with 3 items i would _**barely**_ just _**barely**_ win \n\nmaybe its only me but oh well","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2018-02-16T22:24:03.171+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Illaoi excel in teamfights and poke.
