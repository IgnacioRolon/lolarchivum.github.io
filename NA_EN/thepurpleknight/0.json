Aside from the fact that everyone is hidden by the UI and the fact that the camera doesn&#039;t zoom out far enough, there is also just the fact that it&#039;s backwards from how I have played games for 12+ years.\r\n\r\nImagine walking backwards, you go to pick something up so you put your hands behind your back and lift it up to your mid back. THAT&#039;S RED SIDE! As someone who has had Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance SP and several variations of the DS from around the time they came out, I&#039;ve come to see the bottom of the screen as the part that is closer to me, WHICH IS WHY IT MAKES NO SENSE TO WALK TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. Constantly firing skill shots at my real life self just feels terrible.\r\n\r\nI feel like I can&#039;t be the only one having this issue, I feel like others must have the issue but just didn&#039;t wanna complain about it so they just deal with the fact that they play worse. My mechanics get so much worse just because I&#039;m on red side, yea part of it can be fixed by unlocked screen but that creates more issues than it solves, and aiming skill shots doesn&#039;t get any better. There should really be an option to invert the map so you always play as if you&#039;re blue side.\r\n\r\nHeck I&#039;d even be cool with it just being an option in the menu &quot;Only put me on blue side&quot; If I could add 15 minutes to my queue times but ensure I am always blue side I would do it immediately without a second thought and I would never consider turning such an option off.\r\n\r\nWhen Poro king first came out I had like 20 games on it, nearly all on blue side by some huge stroke of luck, I won every single game I played on blue side, there was 2 red side and I lost them. Now Poro king is back, I still got a decent win rate, I even win on red side, but I&#039;m getting red side almost every game, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve lost a blue side game yet. Red side is really unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonManSquid","date":"2017-04-23T04:19:22.118+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I stopped reading when you said you've been playing that way for 12+ years.

LoL decides to just flip shit on it's head with red side.\n\nConsider a game like any 3D Sonic game, Sonic has his back to the camera, and he runs forward, Red side, does the opposite, it's like you're forever running from the GUN truck, but you don't even get the advantage of vision that the camera gives in SA2B when you do run from the truck.\n\nGames play in 2 different ways, you're either running from the left side of the screen to the right, or you're moving forward (up). Blue side plays the same as a game should, you move up, you throw shit upwards, aiming is super easy because you're not throwing shit at yourself. It feels natural.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-23T20:48:42.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you have played a very limited number of games..\nThat is traditional for oldschool 2D platformers (and basically nothing else), MOBAs are not oldschool platformers, and have their roots in RTS games.

I've played over a thousand LoL games and I cannot get used to this, no amount of practice makes it any less difficult.\n\nI was actually considering adding a second stand on my monitor so I could turn it upside down when I get red side, but then I've have inverted mouse controls and I don't think there is a way to invert my own mouse controls to make it normal again. I'd even settle for a mod to the files to switch it around, I don't understand why you and that other guy think it's hard. If people can should the map from another perspective with replays can't someone make a mod or Riot implement an option to do it to? Like literally this is all I need https://puu.sh/vuhw6/04f1e8ed98.jpg\n\nI can't keep playing like this, I'm playing against gold players and if I'm red side I don't land any skill shots, I dodge even less skill shots and sometimes someone just stands off screen killing me and I don't even know I'm dying until I get too low to change anything.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-24T03:52:08.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you dont understand why it would be very difficult, i cant explain it to you in a way you would understand. Just to get this straight, i am a programmer with a lot of experience working with physics, movement and cartesian space, and i can see a ton of potential issues in doing this - every angle and coordinate would have to be flipped, and the game is not designed to support that, on top of how much work it would be to make the adjustments on a per-player basis.\n\nPlus the map is not truly symmetrical and not made to be viewed from different angles, it would require an entirely new summoner's rift, or at least very heavy adjustments. Just swapping sides would be a disaster (jungle camps, ward wall tricks would all break, ect)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"B Y","date":"2017-07-30T05:35:10.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I wanted it too. I seen some Chinese streamer using a flipped map but on their server.

I didn't want to learn how to play unlocked screen, it felt so unnatural, and I hated it. I wished riot would do exactly what you asked. Then I started watching streams and saw how none of their cameras were locked. They were able to click the map to watch different things happening, not just themselves. I decided to learn how to play on an unlocked screen. It was awful at first. I mostly kept my thumb on the space bar the entire time, to center it on myself. Eventually I naturally stopped using the spacebar. It's super easy now. You just have to get past the learning curve.\nAlso, I read somewhere you're more likely to get dragon on the purple side, so that's a plus.","replies":[]}]}
