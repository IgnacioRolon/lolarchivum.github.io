Both hitting Q and then R, or R and then Q sets her range to the 175 of the Q auto distance rather than the  225 of the Ult autos. Not sure if this is intended functionality, but it&#039;s kinda annoying to be whacking someone with your ult and suddenly not be able to stun them. \r\n\r\nDoes this happen for anyone else?","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-07-14T16:23:18.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's strange. I would've guessed it only took the biggest bonus, like for Nasus currently between Q and R (and Renekton too?).\n\nTaking only the smaller one is absolutely ridiculous, I'm 99% sure it's a bug, and I suggest you make a bug report there: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report\n\nBoth bonus stacking would be great, but maybe *too* great and kinda OP. ^^'","replies":[{"poster":"RaiKirah","date":"2016-07-14T16:35:45.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just did make a post in the bug report section!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-14T06:28:47.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd have thought the range increase on autos would stack.
