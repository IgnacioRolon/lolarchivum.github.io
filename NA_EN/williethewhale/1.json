You are not seeing ghosts, this is the updated version of the map! Quite a few things have changed, but the most technical stuff stayed the same. The biggest changes have been made to the map layout and therefore the map components. Because the old stuff will still be in here, the post will be even longer then before (so sorry), but to make it up to you guys. I added {{summoner:1}} tags whenever something got changed, this should make it less of a burden to have to read it all over again. I can&rsquo;t wait to show you the update, so here we go!\n \nhttp://imgur.com/cT7gu1l\n\n**Introduction**\n\nHello  League of Legends community. My name is Willem &ldquo;WillieTheWhale&rdquo; Klok. I have been a League enthusiast since season 3, and on the go, have seen quite a few awesome events happen. One of which was &ldquo;The snowdown showdown&rdquo; Which basically was a 1v1 blind pick on the Howling Abyss. This game mode might be the simplest, yet most fun game mode I have played (after URF ofc. ;)). But when I played it a few games, it got boring really quick, because you could just pick an adc, and you would win (by killing minions, outpoking your opponent, or taking the turret). The first time I got stomped by a Caitlin, I knew, this might be the hardest game mode RIOT had come up with, and it didn&rsquo;t work.\n\nI just accepted it, and moved on. But lately, I have felt a certain urge to do something more, with this game mode. Because the more the game (on Summoners Rift) has become more of a &ldquo;team-game&rdquo;, the more I wanted to play my own game, outplay my opponent, and not die to a gank when I did so. \nThe only way to make that happen. Is in a simple, good &lsquo;old one versus one. The game mode that does not seem to be possible to be balanced, the game mode that will &lsquo;never work&rsquo;. This game mode, is played on the Mountain Falls.\n\nWelcome, to my map &amp; game mode concept!\n \nhttp://imgur.com/cT7gu1l\n\n**House-Rules**\n\nNow, before we start our journey I want to kindly ask you a few things:\n* A lot of work went into this, I think it would be polite if you reflect that in your comment. Feedback is very welcome. Just make sure its constructive feedback. \n* If you happen to not like the concept, and down vote this discussion, don&rsquo;t hesitate to share with me why. I have had a post on the NA boards the other day. The thread went from 4 to -3, only one person said what he didn&rsquo;t like. Until this day, I still don&rsquo;t know what there was wrong with that concept. I do not want to have this happen to me again.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this discussion (at least until here &lt;3). Let&rsquo;s go!\n \nhttp://imgur.com/cT7gu1l\n\n**Table of contents**\n\nFor this game-mode I want to make changes to a lot of things, to keep it balanced for any kind of champion. We will take a look at the following subjects:\n\n* General map layout\n* Map components\n* Themes \n* Game-mode settings \n* Items\n* Queues\n* Asked questions\n\nI will (try to) have the top of a subject explain the general idea. The remaining part of the subject will get more in-depth (for it is a loooong post).\n \nhttp://imgur.com/cT7gu1l\n\n**General map layout**\n\n{{summoner:1}}  The general layout of the map used to be a straight line, with 3 turrets. Both players had their own jungle that contained 2 camps and an altar. I&rsquo;ve gotten quite some requests to make the center of the map more of a &ldquo;battleground&rdquo;. With that they referred to making the map more open/bigger. At first I did not want to admit that the current battle-area was a little small of size and because of that denied it. Later I accepted that no idea is perfect and a bigger battle area would actually be more fitting for the game mode an map. \n\nSo, things got changed up pretty drastically. I will start off with the first layout concept, and from that we will build up to the eventual result.\n\nThe first raw sketch is displayed below. I saw the map as some kind of platform that had been built onto the side of a mountain top. From the mountain a stream of water fell into some kind of well at the mountain-side of the battleground. It would flow underneath the battle area, only to fall from a waterfall. This could look amazing. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/KimUI80\n\n{{summoner:1}} At the image, the bottom right side is the battle area, the brown &lsquo;bow&rsquo; is the path the minions would walk. The blue areas above and below the battle area is where the water would fall into the well (top) and then drop from the waterfall (below).\nNow as you might have noticed, the battle area is now really, really wide (considering the bush size) and also the bottom blue area (representing the waterfall) was a little big. So, I decided to change it around a little, leading to the following result:\n \nhttp://imgur.com/8Yi3Y3S\n\n{{summoner:1}} I don&rsquo;t think I need to get into &lsquo;what is what&rsquo; too much. Since its pretty much the same as the last image. But notice how the area is a little more tight, and the waterfall is more of a &lsquo;river-size&rsquo; then &lsquo;half of the mountain&rsquo; size.\nAlso, I thought it would be cool to not only have water drop into a well at the battle-ground area, but also have some small &lsquo;streams&rsquo; fall into a smaller well at the jungle camps. I added those two. \nWhilst making this, I couldn&rsquo;t come up with a great idea to make the water come to flow other than having it just come from &lsquo;somewhere&rsquo; on top of the mountain. So, what other substance can flow, and really comes out from the top of the mountain?\nExactly,\nLava.\n\nCould this be a reworked version of the magma chamber? Maybe. Judge for yourself. The way I&rsquo;m seeing this has been displayed below.\n \nhttp://imgur.com/QX3EAGx\n\n{{summoner:1}} Of course, these are only sketches, and if someone has the skill to make this into a drawing, we could probably get the DOTA players hyped for this ;).\n\nFor the sake of people not being willing to choose between the mountain of the volcano, ill mix them up in the next sketch. The rest of the concept will use this image as a reference. I&rsquo;ve already added the components here, so the ones that still don&rsquo;t quite understand the layout might just do so now.\n \nhttp://imgur.com/UZOG4dC\n\nIf you understand entirely what I meant to make, feel free to head over to the next chapter. Meanwhile I want to show you in a little more detail how everything should look like.\n\n{{summoner:1}}  Ok, so for the most part you are just seeing the lane with 3 turrets and a nexus. I assume you can imagine how this looks like, because it&rsquo;s very similar to the top lane (except at the end of course). The 2 area&rsquo;s that you might have a hard time imagining, are the jungle and the battle-area.\nNow, for the next two images I apologize. I can&rsquo;t draw, and when I paint I feel more free, and it looks less bad a bit faster. So, the battle-area and the jungle I have tried to paint. I know it does not look good at all, let&rsquo;s just keep it at that this is meant for explanation purpose only. \n \nhttp://imgur.com/2haoGnj\n\n{{summoner:1}} This thing above this is meant to be the battle-area. This is where you will fight your opponent in the early stages of the game. The top-middle is supposed to represent a waterfall, that flows underneath the battle-area. At the bottom-middle it is supposed to come out, in the form of a waterfall.\n\nThe battle-platform is supposed to be sticking out of the mountain for a bit. I put some &lsquo;minions&rsquo; there to give a better idea of what you  are seeing.\n \nhttp://imgur.com/poKp6X4 \n\n{{summoner:1}} On this image you see the basics of half the jungle. In the middle we have the altar. In from of that altar, we should make something where a smaller waterfall comes out of either the mountain or a head or something. When we have a head, maybe the mouth can close when an altar is locked?\nOn the right side we see a jungle monster :P.\n\nWe can divide the map up into a few different compartments:\n\n* Spawning area\n* Nexus area\n* Battleground (a.k.a. midlane)\n* Jungle\n* {{summoner:1}} Lane\n\nLet&rsquo;s get further into those:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Dfjq5d3\n\n**Spawning area**\n\nThe spawning area is practically the same as the one on summoners rift. It&rsquo;s a platform, in the corner of the map. At the side there is a shop. The way this should look will be based of the chosen &lsquo;theme&rsquo;, which I will not get into, because I think the community should decide this. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/1E2x2SX\n\n**Nexus area**\n\nThe &lsquo;Nexus area&rsquo; contains the nexus (dah) and the nexus turret. Inb4 commenting &ldquo;where is your inhibitor you crazy fool???&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t. This will be explained later on.\n \nhttp://imgur.com/jdGsZ7v\n\n**Battleground**\n\nThis is where the magic happens (MTV Cribs pun intended), literally. The early stages of the game will take place on this part of the map. It is very comparable to the middle lane. A few differences are that there are no ways out of the lane (into the river on summoners rift), but there are brushes one can hide in. The distance between those two turrets is slightly more to the ones on summoners rift. This is mainly to prevent your turret from dying instantly when you went back after pushing out your lane. \n\n{{summoner:1}} To give a better image of the size were talking about, I&rsquo;ve added minions for red-side (squares) and for blue side (circles). I&rsquo;ve also added the inner and outer center circles. Those represent from where the melee and the ranged minions would be attacking.\n\n{{summoner:1}} I have not yet decided if there should be a wall on the bottom-right (where the waterfall comes from under the battle-platform). Maybe it could be like an instant execute? Unless you were hit by your enemy of course, then het just gets the free kill. \n\nAnother option here would be to make either a invisible wall, or some kind of fence. I am not a fan of invisible walls&hellip;\n \nhttp://imgur.com/5u1mJOD\n\n**The jungle**\n\nNow this is the most interesting part. After proposing the concept to you guys, I got the question: &ldquo;Why is there a jungle on a 1v1 map?&rdquo;. Well, I want the game to be based around player skill. With this I am not only referring to the potential to outplay one other. The player also needs to make tactical decisions. When to back? Can I do a jungle camp and have enough HP to return to my lane? I need 100 gold, a jungle camp would help me to get that item, but I will lose on some turret HP, is that worth it? By adding a (small) jungle to the map, you add a lot of tactical outplay potential, as well as a more dynamic environment. \n\n{{summoner:1}} The jungle is some kind of round-shaped area with the altar in the middle. There are **3** camps, an entrance from the players side, as well as the opponents side. This also Is a platform, a little higher than the rest of the map (just like the fountain is a little higher).\n \nhttp://imgur.com/fwT38mk\n\n {{summoner:1}} **The lane**\n\nUnlike the last design, there are now 3 turrets on each side. The second tier turret has the exact same stats as the 1st tier turret.\n \nhttp://imgur.com/cT7gu1l\n\n**Map components**\n\nThe following components are a little different from the ones from summoners rift (with the same name). I will try to explain what they should be doing, why they do it, and the effect they can have on the game.\n\n* Tier 1\n* Tier 2 turret\n* Tier 3 turret\n* Altar\n* Neutral camps\n\n**Tier 1 turret**\n\nThis is the turret you will find on the battle ground. I do not want to get into detail about the numbers representing health and armor. I think we should start off with the outer turrets from summoners rift. The effects however, I want to get a little more into. \n\n**Ally buff, Healing**: Within the turret range, allied champions gain +50% health regeneration. \n\n_Why_: I want to give melee&rsquo;s a chance to be able to defend their turret, without having to sacrifice their HP bars for it. I do not want to give them a shield like the tier 2 turrets in summoners rift used to have, because the ranged champions that will poke you down under turret just need to have that advantage, because that&rsquo;s why you would pick them.\n\n**Self buff, tough skin**: the turret takes 30% less damage from ranged attacks. \n\n_why_: Same story as with the ally healing. I don&rsquo;t want ranged champion to be able to win the game by &lsquo;just pushing&rsquo; without giving your opponent the chance to gain the items to even do something about it. But, I don&rsquo;t want to hit them too hard because once again, you pick the ranged champions for a reason.\n\n**Self buff, Reinforced armor**: Gains 200 armor and magic resistance when no enemy minions are in range for attack. (same as on summoners rift)\n\n_why_: Face-tanking a turret is fine if you just need to get that last hit, but not if you are going to straight up push without minions.\n\n**Note that the tier 1 turrets do not heal themselves.** \n\n{{summoner:1}} **Tier 2 turret**\n\nThis turret you will find in lane. It is almost the same as the tier 1, except that this one does not give you health regen. Reason for this being that the early game is over. If you had a hard time staying alive you have had the time to itemize for it.\n\n**Self buff, tough skin**: the turret takes 30% less damage from ranged attacks. \n\n_why_: Same story as with the ally healing. I don&rsquo;t want ranged champion to be able to win the game by &lsquo;just pushing&rsquo; without giving your opponent the chance to gain the items to even do something about it. But, I don&rsquo;t want to hit them too hard because once again, you pick the ranged champions for a reason.\n\n**Self buff, Reinforced armor**: Gains 200 armor and magic resistance when no enemy minions are in range for attack. (same as on summoners rift)\n\n_why_: Face-tanking a turret is fine if you just need to get that last hit, but not if you are going to straight up push without minions.\n\n**Note that the tier 2 turrets do not heal themselves.** \n\n**Tier 3 turret**\n\n**Self buff, tough skin**: the turret takes 30% less damage from ranged attacks. \n\n_why_: I don&rsquo;t want ranged champion to be able to win the game by &lsquo;just pushing&rsquo; without giving your opponent the chance to gain the items to even do something about it. But, I don&rsquo;t want to hit them too hard because once again, you pick the ranged champions for a reason. (just like at the Tier 2).\n\n**Self buff, Reinforced armor**: Gains 200 armor and magic resistance when no enemy minions are in range for attack. (same as on summoners rift and same as the tier 2)\n\n_why_: Face-tanking a turret is fine if you just need to get that last hit, but not if you are going to straight up push without minions.\n\n**Self buff, Recovery**: Every 5 seconds not taking damage, this turret regains 2% of its missing health.\n\n_why_: One push that heavily damages your turret should not cost you the game. Therefor even after it took damage, managing to defend the turret should be rewarded.\n\n**Self buff: Immortality (kind of)** When this turret is destroyed. The enemy minions gain 10% bonus movement speed. _But_ the turret will respawn in 4 minutes.\n\n_Why_ ;_; : Well. I don&rsquo;t want the game to be like that whenever your inner turret is down, you will have to worry the rest of the game of your opponent back-doring. But I do want to reward the opponent for taking the turret, and giving him an extra boost to finish the game asap. You can see this turret as a combination of an inhibitor and a turret.\n\n**Altar**\n\nOnce I opted for the idea to make this concept, someone sent me a video of a fragment from smite. In the video you could see a control mage just wave-clearing for days, under his turret. The game got dragged on and on until his opponent surrendered (or something, can&rsquo;t remember). Moral of the story: don&rsquo;t play smite. Just kidding, what I meant to say was don&rsquo;t allow that to happen here. We know there is an item to do that against mages, but I want to have a more accessible way to make that happen. However this is not the only reason the altars are here. \n\nThe altars are somewhat like the ones on the twisted tree line: Having one gives you a few bonuses, but having two gives you a few more. Here you can read the bonuses each of them give. \n\n**First altar** (buffs after capturing one altar)\n\nAfter capturing for 5 seconds, this altar cannot be recaptured for 1 minute. After this one minute has passed, the opponent can re-capture the altar, revealing its location for the capture time. \n\n**Self buff, advanced movement speed**: While the altar is captured you gain 25 bonus movement speed. \n\n_Why?_: Well, I want your own buff to be worth getting, whiles not giving you any bonus combat stats. Reason for this is that when you lose your own altar you don&rsquo;t lose on damage, causing you to fall even further behind.\n\n**Self buff, monster hunter**: While in the jungle, you deal 25% bonus damage to monsters in the jungle the altar is placed in.\n\n_Why?_: This one I would like to see in the twisted tree line as well. Because this way, you make it less easy for an opponent to &lsquo;sneak-steal&rsquo; one of your camps without having you notice it. He instead has to capture the altar to take the camps to a lesser cost, but you will notice when he does so. \nIn general, the first altar is meant to make it able to get your second altar buff. Because this one does give you a more game-breaking advantage.\n\n**Second altar** (buffs after capturing two altars) \n\nAfter capturing for 5 seconds, this altar cannot be recaptured for 1 minute. After this one minute has passed, the opponent can re-capture the altar, revealing its location for the capture time. \n\n**Self buff, monster hunter**: While in the jungle, you deal 25% bonus damage to monsters in the jungle the altar is placed in.\nYou already should know why&hellip;\n\n **Self buff, empowered minions**: Minions take ~ 25% reduced damage from AOE attacks and ability&rsquo;s. Additionally, your minions also gain 25 bonus movement speed.\n\nThis makes it easier to push the last turret, the main reason for this buff is to prevent certain champions from instantly clearing waves. It&rsquo;s an unknown minion buff, therefor testing needs to be done to get it balanced.  \n\nSince the effects are relatively unknown, I&rsquo;m pretty sure there will need to be some tweaks happening. \n\n **Neutral camps**\n\nAs for the jungle camps, I want them to give a tactical and a combat buff. I chose to use camps from the summoners rift, BUT: they give the buffs when you kill them. Smite has been removed from this game mode (find out more about this under &ldquo;Game mode settings&rdquo;).\n\nI chose to use the wraiths (tactical advantage) with their buff that has decreased range. Reason for the decreased range is the range of wards and the size of the map being smaller (find out more about this under &ldquo;Game mode settings&rdquo;).\n\nI think the other buff should be the gromp buff. It gives you a significant advantage when being up against a ranged champion as a melee, whilst not being &lsquo;useless&rsquo; for ranged champions. I think their combat stats should equal those of the ones on summoners rift, the altar buff should somewhat compensate for the absence of smite. Besides that, the amount of gold you earn from them should be slightly more, you gain more passive gold, and to keep the camps worth the effort their reward should be larger.\n\nI think the wraiths should be like the wolves, not necessarily regarding the way they look, but mainly because there should only be 3 units to be able to fit in a spot. \n\n{{summoner:1}} It would be the easiest to have the third camp to be one of the remaining ones of the Summoners rift. Since I kind of like the easy way, but don&rsquo;t like the buffs, I&rsquo;ll just make my own!\n\nThe idea is to copy the golems, or whatever they are called now, but instead of giving the buff the give in Summoners rift, I think they should give a &lsquo;healthy buff&rsquo;. I think something like +100% base health regen would be a good buff to start off with. This is yet another thing that needs to be tested to be considered &lsquo;good&rsquo;.\n \nhttp://imgur.com/cT7gu1l\n\n**Themes**\n\nAt first the idea was to make a map, themed just like the twisted tree line. With this I refer to there being no significant difference between the two sides, no &lsquo;opposites&rsquo;. But later I realized that this might be the most important thing there is to the map regarding the visual concept. Because it really is &lsquo;one versus the other&rsquo;. So, there really needs to be some theme to this, just like we have fire and ice for all-stars. \n\nThis subject covers some of these concepts. I would love to hear suggestions from you guys, if there are good ones (which I&rsquo;m sure there will be) I will add them to the list, with your name included!\n\nThese are the ones *We* could come up with:\n\n* Industry (city) versus nature (woods)\n* Good (angels) versus bad (devils)\n* Land versus water\n* Beautiful versus ugly\n* Knights versus samurai\n* Knights versus dragons (dragon shopkeeper FTW)\n* Solari Vs. Lunari \n* Mount Targon\n* Your submission&hellip;\n\nThe map art can be adjusted to these different themes. The shop for instance is a good changeable example to this. Maybe some of you are enthusiastic enough to make some possible art for it!\n\nAs for now my favourite would be the knights versus dragons. One side can be like a nice healthy forest, while the other side could be darker with fire spots and snapped trees. Also the path could be more &lsquo;ashy&rsquo; there. But the main reason would be a dragon shopkeeper, I mean like, riot please. \n \nhttp://imgur.com/cT7gu1l\n\nWohoo, we got to the most exciting part of this concept: numbers, and, erm&hellip;, more numbers!\nFeel free to skip this part, just know the main changes I want to make are the following:\n\n* Faster EXP and gold gain\n* Decreased ward range\n* Shorter death timers\n* Spawn timers\n* Removal of certain summoner spells\n\nYou can scroll down if any of these interest you. Please do read this if you don&rsquo;t like any of these changes already, because I&rsquo;m going to get into the reason why I think these changes should be made.\n\n**Faster EXP and gold gain**\n\nI think that we need to give a fair chance to every kind of champion. So when you are playing a late-game carry like Nasus, when you play your game well enough and manage to get your 4 full items, you deserve to win. This will need a lot of work, because it should not be too easy to stall until that &lsquo;endgame-fantasy&rsquo;. Therefore, the numbers below only give a slight indication of  what the new numbers should be. These numbers are based of [base-value]&rsquo;s which are the values that apply on summoners rift.\n\nValue of minions and monsters [base-value] + 20%\nValue of turrets [base value] + 0%\nValue of kills [base value] + 10%\nPassive gold gain [base value] +10% \nShutdown bonus [base-value] + 15%\nStarting gold [base-value] +0%\n\nReasoning behind these: killing the enemy turret already gives a load of advantages, since you are now able to take the enemy altar. I want to have a fair game and allow the opponent to be able to recover from turret loss, therefor I think the amount of gold gained should not be higher than it already is. Farming is one of the skills, that if you manage to do correctly, you should be rewarded. Getting kills is also one of these skill-things. But, its slightly easier to pull off, due to the lack of jungle presence. Passive gold should be higher for champions that have a hard time farming and getting kills early on. But it should not be too high, because farming under pressure is also a skill that needs to be rewarded if done correctly. Coming back from an opponent that has a lead over you, is even more important now, because there is no one to help you do it now. So pulling this off should be rewarded even more, allowing to let a player get back into the game. \n\nSomething that has nothing to do with the above is the starting gold. I think this should be the same for every game mode (except for ARAM), simply because there are items that can give you a huge mid-game advantage that should not be able to be bought at level 1 (Yes, I&rsquo;m referring to you ryze *Tear*).\n\n**Decreased ward range**\n\nThe range of wards,  trinkets and the wraiths buff have been reduced by 50% (cast range is unchanged).\n\nAnother change, that I would really want to see in the twisted tree-line. As for now, wards are not peaceable since they give too much information due to the size of the map. So, RIOT came up with these &lsquo;poof-vision&rsquo; trinkets. But you take away some really important advantages away from certain champions such as lee sin, or other champions that are allowed to have some kind of escape/gap closer just by having a ward. I think this one is really important. The 50% is very random though, once again testing needs to be done. \n\n**Shorter death timers**\n\nAlthough some of you might disagree with this one, death times should be reduced by at least 30%.\n\nReason behind this one is very simple: there is no team to cover the base when you die. Normally, you can get a turret, dragon or baron off of an ace. In this mode, same thing applies. But I&rsquo;m afraid that due to there only being two turrets, one can most definitely end the game after a minute or 10 when there is only one turret left. This problem is insanely hard to tackle, and might result in having to add another turret between the two current ones.\n\n**Spawn timers**\n\nThis is a good place to put that the &lsquo;home guard buff&rsquo;  you currently get at a higher level should apply at level two here. Once again due to the fact that there is no team left to defend your structures when you die. Together with the shorter death timers, you should be able to defend your base more easily. \nThe spawn timers I think should be the same as in Summoners Rift. Also the movement speed bonus should apply on this map. The time before the match start is not only to allow some mind-games before minions are present, but also allow players to not have to make a mess from their bathroom because they have to hurry :).\n\n**Removal of certain summoner spells**\n\nIt&rsquo;s pretty obvious, but here are the summoner spells that should not be available in this game mode. These are the summoner spells that should be available.\n\n* Barrier\n* Cleanse \n* Exhaust\n* Flash\n* Ghost\n* Heal\n* Ignite\n \nhttp://imgur.com/cT7gu1l\n\n**Items**\n\nAs for default, we take the items that are available in Summoners rift. Some items might need to change (I&rsquo;m really thinking life steal items), some other items will be removed. I will not get into the changing of items, because testing is definitely necessary to do this properly. I will, however, cover the items that should be removed from this game mode. The items are:\n\nGuardian Angel\nOmwhecker\nZz&#039;Rot Portal\n\nI think there should also be some items that take away some advantages from your opponent. I could come up with two. I don&rsquo;t think this is the only items that will be needed to balance out the game, but it gives an indication of the path I want to walk.\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/nI91tYq.png \n\n**Aegis Shard**\n\nBuilt from Chain vest (800) and Kindle gem (800), combining cost: 600 total 2200\n400 Health\n50 Armor\n\nUnique passive: 10% Cooldown reduction\nUnique passive, Aegis of shards: every 22 seconds, you gain a shield that blocks the next champion basic attack\n\n_With this item, you will not get poked out of lane by basic attacks as quickly. I&rsquo;m a little skeptical about this one, because you will need it as your first item. Maybe a cheaper version with a longer cooldown might be better (testing&hellip;)._\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CYHSfI8.png \n\n**Moral Banner**\n\nBuilt from Chain vest (800), Crystalline Bracer (650) and cloth armor (300). Combining cost 1150 (the cloth armor and Braces should make 1 item 1st). Total: 2800\n+400 Health\n+100% Base Health Regen \n+60 Armor\n\nUnique Aura: Grant nearby ally&rsquo;s 15 bonus armor.\nUnique Active, Promote: Grans an ally minion a shield that reduces incoming physical damage by 80% (120 second Cooldown).\n\n_A banner of command for if one is up against an ADC, combining cost seems like a lot, but the aura and active give some serious bonus stats._\n\n{{summoner:1}} http://imgur.com/0ez0ezB \n\n**Enchantment: Monster hunter**\n\nBuilt as an upgrade for tier 2 boots.\nCost 475\nMonster hunter: Deal 20% bonus damage to monsters\n\n_For those who gain bonuses from farming certain jungle camps, that want to be able to take them faster (kindred?, Nunu?)_\n\n{{summoner:1}} {{item:3060}}\n\n**Nerfing banner of command**\n\n{{summoner:1}} UNIQUE &ndash; PROMOTE: Greatly increases the power of a lane minion and ~~grants it immunity to magic damage~~ Takes 90% less magic damage. 120 second cooldown (1200 range).\n\n_Someone pointed out this item should be removed. At first I thought that this item does not cause that big of a deal. Then I realized you don&rsquo;t have teammates. And if you are a squishy melee mage like Akali or Katarina, you would just have to watch your turret drop its HP because if you get to that caster  minion your opponent will kill you._\n\n \nhttp://imgur.com/cT7gu1l\n**Queues**\n\nReally excited for this part, because this is where the mind-games start :). For this game mode I think there should be at least 2 game modes. I would prefer 3, but for the twisted tree line they also only did the blind pick and the ranked teams (draft pick missing here). The same I want to do for this game mode. This leaves us with the game modes:\n\n* Ranked solo\n* Draft pick\n* Blind pick\n\nI will start explaining the way champion select will develop itself.\n\n**Blind pick**\n\nBoth players have 50 seconds to pick their champion, and fix their runes and masteries, when both players lock in they have an additional 10 seconds to change their minds on runes, masteries, or be able to dodge.. This should be more than enough. You don&rsquo; t counter pick, so you should at least have an idea of what champion you are going to play when you queue up.\n\n**Draft pick and Ranked solo**\n\nBoth players have 25 seconds to ban a champion. 6 Times (3 for every player). Once that is done. Player one picks one champion, then player two pick two, player one picks two more, and finally the second player picks his last champion. Every pick takes 30 seconds or until locked in. Needless to say that the opponent can now see the other players picks (just like in normal draft and ranked).\nSo both players know which 3 champions the opponent selected. Now both player &lsquo;blind pick&rsquo; one of their 3 selected champions. This way, you can still counter someone, without giving a huge disadvantage to the enemy. Just like for blind pick. The player now has 50 seconds to pick, and fix his runes and mastery&rsquo;s. When locked in, there will be an additional 10 seconds left for runes, mastery&rsquo;s and dodging. Until the game launches, the opponent is not able to see which of the 3 champions the other picked, this is to prevent people from dodging a bad matchup. In other words, until the ten seconds after locking have expired, both player will see the 3 picks of their opponents. \nBy using this system, you prevent people from being counter picked just by guessing what they play. But you also prevent people from being counter picked just by being second in line. Isn&rsquo;t that just beautiful ?\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/hooVsP9.jpg\n\n**Ranking**\n\nI think that this is also a easy to resolve problem in 5v5 and 3v3 queues, because we all know (especially in the beginning) that you jump divisions REALLY quickly, and gain shitloads op LP for a win (I am talking like 50LP per win). Solution? Remove some of the divisions. I think if every division had like 3 tiers instead of 5, everything would go a lot smoother. The promos and amount of LP gain should stay the same. Games are relatively short, and I don&rsquo;t want this mode to become more popular then the 5v5 on Summoners rift. \n \nhttp://imgur.com/cT7gu1l\n\n**Asked Questions**\n\nRight now, no questions that you might want to ask as well have been asked (and answered). Feel free to ask anything!\n \nhttp://imgur.com/cT7gu1l\n\n**Community suggestions**\n\nThe following elements have been suggested by the community:\n\n**Simato (EUW)**\nOpponents are able to teleport to one others jungle and back.\n \n**Sander599 (EUW)**\nMaybe there could be something that when you capture an altar, it will give you a bonus for 2 (or less or more) minutes. After those 2 minutes, the last owner of the altar can't capture the altar for 2 (or less or more) minutes. This would make the game a bit more tactical.\n\n**VictoryDance96 (NA)**\nPerhaps you could have an option for 2v2, so that players can work on their teamwork skills more fundamentally? Its shape seems to resemble the curve of bot lane on Summoner's Rift.\n\n**Kilar (NA)**\nInstead of the same kill the nexus idea. The goal is for champions to escort their sides minions into the volcano or waterfall in the middle. Kinda like smites one mode. And when your team wins the volcano blows up or waterfall does something cool.\n\n**Epic3Epic3Epic (EUW)**\nyou could as well add a biggie like Nashor or Vilemaw.\n\n**Kilar (NA)**\nThe goal is for champions to escort their sides minions into the volcano or waterfall in the middle. Kinda like smites one mode. And when your team wins the volcano blows up or waterfall does something cool. Otherwise I am all for the new map and can picture it looking very aesthetically pleasing in waterfall or volcano form. Just my two cents\n\n**Gimilee (NA)**\nSo, to mix things up, what if the lava/water receded and expanded in the middle at random intervals, making windows of opportunity and #lcsbigplays. This way players will never get bored and will be able to test skills in a wide variety of scenarios. This way the middle could be either a huge fight stadium like middle of dominion with minions, or a bit more narrow than mid lane, adding to the difficulty of landing combos, etc.\n\n**TheChaoticSwede (NA)**\nThis could be an ancient temple where the Darkin and/or Watchers would hold coliseums and tournaments and they were one on ones.\nOr it could be a more recently made arena made by Noxus as part of a fierce competition.\n\nBut my biggest thing about this is the aesthetics that Riot could work into this map.\n\nLooking at your map I can easily visualize a temple/arena built on the mountain near it's peak with a water fall coming down from the center of it and passing near the inner center of the playable area. On the right-most side of the map you can see on wards for miles. Maybe even have a major city of Valoran be showing in the very far distance.\n\nI think the best theme for both sides though would be Land and Sky.\nThe bottom portion of the map steady becomes more and more enclosed around the mountain until you get to the bottom base, which is either built into the mountain or completely enshrouded around it.\n\nAs you move to the top portion of the map it starts steadily getting more and more open and you can see more sky and more of the land below until you get to the top base which is actually built on pillars extending off of the mountain.\n\n**Aqua4748 (NA)**\n\nThe gold mine is something you can capture for a crazy amount of bonus gold for your team. After you capture it generates gold over time for you. If the enemy team kills it however, they will take your gold and steal the mine itself.\n\nNow lets put this into your map in the LANE, not the jungle. since you don't have a paralleling jungle, why not put something like another alter in the middle of the middle of the lane?\n\nWith the alter giving boosts like the other two, it makes the fight a bit more interesting, with the two fighting to kill each other and possible capture the middle alter. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/cT7gu1l\n\nDear reader, if you read the whole thing, I already feel honoured.

I would agree that this map as a 2v2 would work better, because of the jungle camps and alters included with this mode. Jungle camps and alters in a 1v1 (In my opinion) would be harder as a solo laner to decide when to go do a jungle camp, because you still would somehow lose a lot of CS in the lane one way or the other. However, going back to the idea of a 2v2, one person could jungle and come back to lane and help support while one stays in lane and farms CS. This would be great for people who want to work on their teamwork skills or a bot lane duo could also practice their combos. Again, these are just my personal opinions and suggestions.

First, increase the distance between the 1st tier turrets so that it is the mean of the distance between turrets in mid lane and top lane. That way, the distance is long enough so that melee fighters stand a chance early game, and far enough so that an opponent can farm or at least not get denied XP if he is losing.\n\nSecondly, I'd change the waterfall area to the following: http://i.imgur.com/xoQnhVV.png\n\nThe brown line is a small footbridge. The water to the top left of this would be in-passable as it's too deep, the water to the bottom right of it would behave like the water on summoner's rift. The bridge would serve purpose as to have a tight area to bait/juke your opponent into. For example, champs like nidalee can run here if getting chased and have a good opportunity to use to various terrain and brush to outplay her opponent. She can leap from the bridge to the water for example, just like she can on SR. Otherwise, the terrain is a bit one-dimensional and tedious.\n\nThirdly, I'd reduce the jungle camps from 3 to 2. 3 is a bit much, almost like a full jungle rotation. Instead, have 2 camps and make them a little more difficult. Short and sweet.\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to see the altars offer significant move speed that last for maybe 5 seconds. They can't really be abused, but can help get to lane quite a bit faster, so that way the map can be large without being slow. We want this to be a fast-action battle mode, correct?\n\nAnd, I would also add an epic monster to the bottom-right most part of the map. One problem with having an epic monster is that Udyr is far, far better at killing Epic monsters than Soraka. A fix to this issue could be to give the epic monster the following traits:\n\n* Very very tanky, with some armor and magic resistance\n* deals a small amount of damage - but it is true damage based on current %hp. This way it hurts tanks and squishies alike.\n* negates 75% of lifesteal - so it can't just be sustained through.\n* suffers true damage every second while in combat. So even champs with a small amount of damage can defeat it.\n\nSo basically my idea is to have a FAIR epic monster than can't be sneaked by junglers and all champions have the chance to destroy it. Additionally, it will take a moderate amount of time to destroy, and therefore can be contested. RISK vs REWARD.\n\nThe buff it would grant would need to be utility-based rather than pure combat stats. I'm thinking 250 gold, 30 movement speed, mana regen & 10% cooldown reduction, along with a small flat AD & AP increase (something like 15 & 30) for 2 minutes.\n\nPerhaps it should also grant stacking permanent buffs such as %movement speed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChromeFluxx","date":"2015-12-10T13:14:19.812+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we please base the theme off ionia, it doesnt have its own map yet, it seems very ionian-esque, and ionia has tons of mountains. so it makes sense.

Each tier gives a bonus dedicated to the side that kills it.\n\nHere's how I think it would work:\nTier Gate 1: Raptors or Wolves or something as weak. Reward: True Vision and one extra melee and ranged minion.\n\nTier Gate 2: A slightly stronger Gromp, not exactly as strong as a buff but is extremely difficult to take down solo at a low level. Rewards: The next ability you use on an enemy champion will deal extra damage (once per clear) and minions gain extra damage against the enemies minions.\n\nTier Gate 3: The Actual buff. I think it'd be best to have the buff for this map it's own thing since it will give both Blue and Red for the reward and will be stronger than the buffs in SR. Rewards: Bonus Resistance and Damage to you and towers next to you.\n\nTier Gate 4 (located near the center of the arena/stage): WILL ONLY OPEN AFTER BOTH SIDES CLEAR ALL OF THEIR TIERS! This is basically the Baron Nashor or Vilemaw of the stage. It shouldn't be as strong as Baron or Vilemaw since the champions are going to have to solo it, but it should still be a big threat to anyone who wants to get it. Rewards: Basically the entire Baron buff PLUS the buffs you've had previously are enhanced.\n\nNotes:\nA) As I say, the only gate that will be automatically opened will be Tier 1. In order to advance you must clear that Tier. This is set in place to specifically prevent junglers from just taking the Tier 3 once they hit a high enough level while also avoiding any straightforward strategy. (Yea, sure you can just clear the tiers early to get the buffs but if your going up against someone with a big wave clear and is great at pushing it might be better to take your time on them or to just sit in the lane and try to scrape off their hp and make them back off first.)\n\nB) The Tier Gates will stay open for as long as the respawn timer is for the gate below them. Once the Tier below them respawns they are locked down again.\n\nC) The buffs are meant to benefit the individual and the base and minions so everything works in sync with each other.\n\nD) Each respective buff has it's own timer that descends with the tiers. (Example: Tier 1 lasting 2-3 minutes and Tier 3 only lasting 90 or so seconds.) Tier 4 grants 1 extra minute too all the buffs as long as you still have them.\n\nE) The Tier 4 Gate once opened will remain open as long as at least one of the Tier 3 Gates monsters are dead.\n\n\nLooking at this now after I typed it...this sounds like it would be a huge balance headache. Maybe it's not such a great idea but I just want to put it out there anyway.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FizzicallyNothin","date":"2015-12-09T21:05:17.897+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upvote for sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Incandecense","date":"2015-12-09T20:53:44.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read absolutely none of this.

Having only one path may be fun for a few matches but it'll become stale for a good number of players quickly. Having good flow is really important.\n\nEmbrace the chaos that is the internet and let players decide how to play it. I like the look of the concept, however  I would add a path from either side making a wide V shape from the top down, then I would add an intersecting path or two from one altar to the other.  So it be a V shape with a line through it on top of what you have. \n\nI'd upload an edited pic but I'm at work atm and don't have access to sites.\n\nFor example my first thoughts were when I looked at your concept drawings.  \"How do I back door and be sneaky sneaky. ?\"  My next thought was \"Damn I don't want to run all that way. \" which translates into I'll be playing super passively, and this will be a long match. \n\nJust my thoughts and opinions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ýones","date":"2015-12-09T15:03:29.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow!

I have two things to say. First because of how small is the jungle or at lest seams small a champion with sunfire would begin to fight all the monsters at the same time or for exemple the q of kindread would target all of them and she probably would die. Second you could make a small wall between the jungle and the lane so champions who have junps could sort of gank.","replies":[]}]}
