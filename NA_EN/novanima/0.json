I don&#039;t know how this happens, but isn&#039;t this actually a huge problem? As far as my understanding goes, doesn&#039;t Riot need to act on this immediately?\n\nThankfully a lot of people are downvoting it, but I saw a few comments saying &quot;downloaded so if this is taken down I can put it up.&quot;\n(I&#039;m not sharing it because obviously people shouldn&#039;t see it, and I trust Riot to be smart enough to find it on their own. Hell, anybody can find it if they have half a brain but still, you understand why I&#039;m not posting any identifying information about it.)\n\nEDIT: I also know that it might be a lot more complicated than Riot issuing a takedown notice on the videos, but it still strikes me as something that they can do something about, similar to the Spectate Faker problem a while back.","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-09-11T02:19:41.722+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way the youtube algorithms work currently downvotes and upvotes are given the same treatment for a video's visibility. So by downvoting the video people are giving it a chance to be more visible.

It's more so so that those teams (and specifically the team that wasn't putting the game online) don't really want their strats to get leaked and potentially harm their potential team comps.","replies":[]}]}
