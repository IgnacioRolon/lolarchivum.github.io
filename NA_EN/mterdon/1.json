However, even when I do this, v-sync through the Nvidia control panel doesn't have any effect in game because I still get 100+ fps if I don't turn on v-sync in the game settings. Is the League of Legends game engine blocking my Nvidia card from deciding the 3d settings and only allowing changes to be made in game?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-20T01:28:08.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never heard of someone having this issue before. It's possible that League is hardcoded to pull settings only from your configuration files instead of other applications that may attempt to influence your settings.\n\nI hope this clears the air of confusion, let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
