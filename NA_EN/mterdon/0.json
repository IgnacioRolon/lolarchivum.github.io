I think it's something to do with rendering death animations or something because it happens frequently. I'm playing on an ASUS laptop with a nvidia 940m and i-5200U processor. When I check my cpu, gpu, and disk usage through task manager and GPU-Z it's never above 70% for any of them except for gpu load which can go around 80%. I notice that my disk usage does spike to around 25% briefly when I get the fps drops. I also use vsync because without it I get terrible screen tearing so that could be a cause of the problem because I go from 60 to ~30 fps when the death occurs.  The fps drops are minor and last for less than a second but it can cause me to win or lose a teamfight. Can someone at RIot help me out?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-17T22:51:25.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are likely either driver/hardware issues or there are corrupt/missing files in your League install causing this.
