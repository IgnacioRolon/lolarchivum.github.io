After time goes on i play with all my friends and see them getting up to level 3, 4, then 5 while i stay at the same honor level. doesnt really make sense since i get even more honor then them at times so im wondering why this is happening. Is there anything that i did before the honor system that restricts me from leveling up? or is it some type of bug...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-14T21:42:17.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can slow down if you have some less than honorable games, but progress shouldn't stop unless you've been penalized for a behavior incident.
