Then after the update i noticed lower frames and lag or what not so i thought if i lowered the resolution to 1680x1050 then maybe it would perform better? Not too sure why i did that though, anyways when I try and go back to 1920x1080 it gives me a border and I can't scroll up on the map... Any suggestions? Also thank you for responding.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
