That's why Trundle and Cho did well against him because his ghouls dying would sustain them. The problem with old Yorick was that it wasn't interactive to constantly be fighting ghouls while Yorick CSed and healed, which would just auto push and win his lane, only to fall off mid/late game using his ult that no one knew how to use properly.
