An asssassin's job is to flank and apply backline pressure, while a mage and adc's job is to apply damage to targets that you can attack without overextending.\n\nYou can generate massive leads off of CS in almost all brackets except korean chalanger, to the point where you can be ahead multiple kills worth of gold.

Usually in these lanes, I end up some 60 CS, and when 17 CS is equal to a kill, that's effectively being up just less than 4 kills on the enemy laner, without even killing them once. And in these scenarios, the opponent ends up being so weak that the game becomes a 5v4. \n\nIt doesnt matter what kind of champion you're playing, assassin, bruiser, tank, mage, etc, if you have an advantage, you can just deny your opponent to generate a fuckhuge lead.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-06-19T16:06:50.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Do you know how miserable that time needed to scale is? ;_;\n\nUnless snowballing it's the very picture of misery.\n\nAnd all of us does not play Draven or twitch.","replies":[{"poster":"The 2nd Horseman","date":"2017-06-19T19:39:49.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And do you know the feeling of a game lasting too long and trying to kill an adc with two shield bots?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2017-06-18T21:00:02.585+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":29,"body":"except no average Draven is able to 1-shot anyone at any point in the game.

Draven can easily kill a squishy with two Q's, an E, and ult (if both hit). With a slight lead and decent CS, each auto does well over 200 damage.\n\nThat being said, Talon's oneshot potential is insane.

Talon, Fizz, and Shaco are all worthy nominees for \"assassins who could reliably one-shot before the assassin rework\"\n\nAlso, Draven @ Level 6 attacking a lv.6 Fizz (about 1k hp) with 33% damage resistance would need to do:\n\n1000\n-  175(.66) (ult)\n-    70(.66) (e)\n---------------------\n   838.3\n/      3\n----------------------\n   = 280(ish)\n\n280 per auto in order to kill someone in *3* hits at level 6 + Ult + E.
