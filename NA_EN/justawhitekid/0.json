Then throughout the game, every 20 or 30 seconds, I'll disconnect. Not entirely but, the attempting to reconnect box will appear, and I'll still be able to move my champion and see health changes but nothing will die, I can't see abilities, and I cant use my abilities. My ping stays low throughout so I know it's not typical lag. Has anyone else experienced this and if so how did you fix it? I've already tried completely uninstalling and reinstalling league.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-07T22:04:32.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like Bladenite said, there's a number of different things that could be going on here. I wouldn't worry about the port forwarding steps, since if those were closed you wouldn't be able to get connected *ever* most likely. \n\nTo me, this really sounds like an issue with packet loss tbh. Let's run a quick test to see what your connection looks like after it leaves your network. Sometimes it can get damaged or degraded before it reaches us, which leaves the problem on the side of how your connection is being routed. Run a traceroute to our NA servers at 104.160.131.1 for about 5-10 min and post the results here so I can take a look at what's going on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bladenite","date":"2018-01-07T20:44:28.822+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Howdy justawhitekid, \n\nHere are some ways to clear your problem.\n\n You can try to manually forward any potentially closed ports on your router that LoL needs by following the [steps here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq8).\n\nYou'll need to make sure your firewall isn't blocking League Of Legends from connecting as well, you can find steps to bypass it if necessary [right here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3).\n\nLastly, if the option above didn't seem to resolve the issue try downloading the Hextech Repair Tool and running it.\n\nif youâ€™re still seeing issues after deploying this pint-sized problem-solver, it can automagically gather your system information and LoL logs into a .zip folder.
