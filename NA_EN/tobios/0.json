I'm particularly thankful for the late game advice. I would sometimes take exhaust just because down here in the depths of silver 1 your adc will most likely say,\"Dude take exhaust. I hate it when my supports ks me\" before going 0/9/1 with 30 cs 10 min in and blaming me. I guess you just gotta ignore em sometimes. I always found ignite better in most cases anyways. Thanks so much. Keep hooking!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xelaker","date":"2017-05-05T21:25:14.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ThreshestFlay,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=W3uXEJqz,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-05-05T15:06:23.364+0000)\n>\n> Hey guys.

Thanks to all who help!\n\ncould be totally late here. after you Q (circumstances pending of course) thresh will give the chain a few tugs. learn the number or a rough feel of the timing and let the Q get more cc with a tug or two before you cast it to move in. also worth noting don't be super obvious with the lantern when bringing someone else into lane with you. people usually back off if you chuck the lantern off screen for no obvious reason.","replies":[]}]}
