What's more frustrating is that if I do manage to login, I enjoy stable, responsive gameplay with no issues whatsoever; there is just some kind of check that is occurring during the login process that causes the game to crash.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-24T23:20:27.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The maestro error can happen when your network can't connect to our servers.  This can cause problems like leaving you behind in champion select, or fail to group you with other players.
