I&#039;m colorblind, and with that new loading screen background I have a really hard time seeing the loading tips. Words/letters are nearly invisible in the center of the screen. Colorblind mode resolves most of my colorblind-related issues in-game, so this is one thing that sticks out a lot for me.\r\n\r\nAs far as my type of colorblindness: I see colors like I imagine most other people do, but sometimes they blend together in a weird way, making it so I can&#039;t distinguish or identify a specific color often. \r\n\r\nI&#039;d be happy to answer specific questions about that, and I&#039;m not sure what sort of other info a Rioter might want for feedback.\r\n\r\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot JxE","date":"2015-04-11T00:34:38.346+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're looking into the making it much easier to see the tips with the loading screen backgrounds, sorry about the inconvenience!","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2015-04-11T00:40:54.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this is unrelated, but I'm that desperate guy looking for a Rioter to help him like someone going to the refrigerator section of Best Buy for help with finding a TV.\nI've been receiving overwhelming requests to send a lore for one of Riot's skins to them for reading, but I'm not sure where to go for that.
