However if I'm home I will connect my laptop to my external monitor and play from there. However if I last played from my laptop, when I connect my monitor the resolution is all messed up, with the top have of the screen being black and the bottom half of the screen being filled with what should've been the top half. The \"apply\" button to change resolutions is cut off so I can't change it to the proper settings. I usually end up deleting the game, reinstalling and it'll fit. However next time I play using just my laptop it is once again all messed up. Is there a easier solution?? Please help. This never ending delete/install cycle is killing me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-19T21:14:25.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you're switching between monitors, if the native resolutions don't match you can run into issues like this where the secondary display is all wonky at first.  It sounds like deleting the game was forcing the resolution to reset, but it's not really fun to have to do that =\\ .\n\nIf you can change the resolution of your external monitor to match the native resolution of your laptop, that should fix the awkward display issues you're having.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ANNIEmate","date":"2017-03-19T17:43:14.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone?","replies":[]}]}
