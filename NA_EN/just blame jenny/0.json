The screen just locks up -- and then either shuts itself down after some seconds, or I'm forced to kill it with the task manager. It's frequent enough to be a bother. Perhaps once every three games.\n\nI don't suppose anyone else has experienced something similar, or has any solutions?\n\nFor reference, here's my machine:\n\nWindows 10 Pro 64-Bit\nAMD Ryzen 7 1700 Eight-Core Processor\n16 GB DDR 4 Ram\nNvidia GTX 1080 Ti\n\nI've already tried a full game repair, and no go on that one.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-08-06T02:09:26.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may consider testing the loyalty of your computer with a trial by fire.... {{item:3751}} \n\n... actually just kidding. The most likely causes for this are connection based; the way you described the game freezing up and the fact that it happens sometimes and other times doesn't makes me think there's an intermittent connection interference. For starters, run through the steps in [**this guide here**](http://riot.com/12B7oac) for me to troubleshoot LoL's connection, and let me know if it helps out or not. Make sure to test the results in a few Customs just in case so you don't trigger Leaverbuster!\n\nIf it doesn't, when you write back, if you can screen-cap any error messages you're getting that'll help me better ID what is causing the problem as well so I can look for other solutions!","replies":[]}]}
