We need more members of the kinky-cow clan maybe someone who joined zed and didnt abandon his teachings. Ninjas are oppressed in this game and i want more ninjas, for now shen will have to do because he is without a doubt the coolest of the 4, able to get kills, make plays, and save teammates from doom all add up to an amazing champ.","replies":[]}
