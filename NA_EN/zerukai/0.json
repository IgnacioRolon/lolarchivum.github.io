Whenever the shop is open and the mouse moves, the screen will freeze. However, more interestingly, if I change the shop to \"all items\" and begin to scroll up and down quickly, it will freeze and also make a \"beep\" sound that sounds like a Windows beep sound (but not the actual \"default beep\" sound, if that matters), so I know that it's not coming from League. Navigating the shop is a nightmare due to the constant freezes, and the beep sound when scrolling under \"all items\" is strange.\r\n\r\nAfter doing some more testing I've found out that this won't occur at the start of the game, but rather approx. 5 minutes into the game is when everything starts to fall apart. I haven't been able to test the teamfights as much, but I experienced similar freezes during an ARAM game earlier today, without the shop open.\r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\nIntel Core i5-4430 3.00GHz\r\n8GB RAM\r\nAMD Radeon R9 380 Series\r\nWindows 10 Home Edition\r\n1TB HDD","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-19T02:25:43.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm that is definitely not good if your Windows is starting to make some of it's default sounds during game.

I'm going to do it again to be sure, but I don't think that it's the issue to be honest. I've played a few more games and the trend seems to have continued, and especially in teamfights it gets absolutely unplayable. After I died I took a few moments to record what was happening (and send it to my friends on snapchat so they know I'm not just boosted... lol), and hopefully this link will show you a little bit of what's been going on, at least in the teamfights. The same thing happens in the shop, regardless of whether or not a teamfight is going on. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B48nbxUgcMJrWEZIT0ExN2Y0R3M Apologies for poor camera work, it was in the heat of the moment, trying to just get it on footage.\n\nI should also mention that the windows sound will ONLY appear if I'm scrolling vigorously in the shop, which I have no explanation for to be honest. I even decided to try and scroll vigorously here and in other programs just to see if that would do anything, and nothing happened then. (I feel a little bit stupid for trying that, but whatever works, 'ya know?)\n\nAlso, I should (again) also mention that I've checked my display drivers and they're all the way updated, and I've already initiated a full repair of the client, if that helps any. I have not done a full reinstall.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-19T03:46:34.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooooo yea I definitely see what you mean there.

Yes, I was having connectivity issues which he found by telling me to download and run WinMTR, and ping the following.\n\n> *NA Server:\n> 192.64.170.252\n> 104.160.131.1\n> Google.com\n\nI didn't believe that my connectivity issues were the problem, so he suggested that I...\n\n> 1) I'd like you to make sure you've installed the latest Windows Updates. League of Legends is only optimized to work best when on the latest version of Windows.\n> \n> 2) Since the most recent Windows 10 update, Many players have been experiencing FPS drops and crashing due to the Windows Xbox Game DVR app. To resolve this, you will need to DISABLE YOUR GAME BAR. Disabling this app will help optimize and improve the stability of your League of Legends.\n\nI did this and it resolved the issue for a game, but then the issue came back.\n\nLastly, I decided to try one thing while I was looking to see if there were any recent Windows updates that I may have missed. There weren't, but I noticed that my AMD driver was updated on May 17th, so I decided to try a rollback. As of my writing this, rolling back my driver for the GPU had solved the issue.","replies":[]}]}
