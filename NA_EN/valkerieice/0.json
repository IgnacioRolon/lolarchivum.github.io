You have a chance to get a key fragment after every win regardless of your score or your teammates scores.\n\nAs mentioned before, the drop rate isn't linear.  As Wingfield commented in the linked thread, you can think of it like a leveling system. Earlier key fragments take less \"XP\" to earn than later keys.

How many wins would be expected to acquire that number?
