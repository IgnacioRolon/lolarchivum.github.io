Everybody loves him, but only a few will admit it.\nSome think hating on Teemo is cool, following some sort of anti-Teemo cult trend.

Even if dies, he still has those 10 minute shrooms everywhere that are next to impossible to kill all of them. Then besides the shrooms, he also has his Click-blind which just shuts down adcs so hard (on top of the very high base and ratio.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"MalzaharAnyLane","date":"2015-05-04T02:48:28.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"My favorite thing is killing Teemos.\n\nThe players are pretty much griefers by definition.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-04T02:43:45.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey OP just said Satan is cute, quickly spray holy water onto this post NAWWWWWWWWW","replies":[]}]}
