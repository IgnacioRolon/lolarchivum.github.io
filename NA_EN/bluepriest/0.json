I was looking at a few peoples profiles and unfriending them if they just did 5s, I accidentally unfriended the guy I wanted to contact and left the guy that exclusively played 5s though. It would have been a couple seasons ago that I played with the guy, and I can only sora remember his name (sou*  ** *ixer)  I cant remember what was in the ** so I cant find him. Is there any way to find that? I found out typing just sou instead of bringing up a list will actually send a friend request... so sorry to that guy... but yeah, anyone know of a solution to be able to reach him/her to get them back on my friends list or am I outta luck?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-05T00:16:18.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn't a way to retrieve a history of friends on your list, and it's not something we would be able to offer either.  It really sucks that you may have lost contact with your friend, but hopefully he might be able to find you somehow.  Unfortunately, I don't have any advice I could offer but I wish you the best of luck!","replies":[]}]}
