I think something like {{item:3050}} could have the Lost Chpater in the recipe. Obviusly with some adjust in the item too. My thougths are:\n\n\n{{item:3050}}  Total Cost increased to 2450g from 2350g\n> \n> &gt; Stats\n> &gt; +30 armor\n> &gt; +550 mana (up from 250)\n> &gt; +35 ability power (down from 50AP)\n> &gt; +10% cooldown reduction\n\n\nUNIQUE: When within 1000-units of each other, you and your Conduit will generate 1 charge every second, up to 100, with a bonus 4/2 charges whenever you or your ally attack, and 8/4 on spell cast. \nAt 100 charge, dealing damage grants you and your Conduit 20% increased Ability Power and +50% Critical Strike Chance for 8 seconds. **Also you restores 20% of your maximum mana over 3 seconds.**\nAll current charge is lost if you move further than 1000-units apart or hold onto 100 charge for longer than 5 seconds.\n\nSo this could be a good option for supps that are mana dependant and spend a long time with their adc&#039;s, also the mana restore is a reward to achieve the 100 stacks,  because to reach that amount the supports needs to spam abilities and walk with the adc. With all the mana regen nerfs this could be a good option to help all those supports that spend huges amount of manas (like the new Taric, Sona, Nami etc.) and expand the build paths of Lost Chpater too.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2016-04-22T03:25:08.230+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the idea of have more than one Last chapter Ã­tem. I notice that A lot of support needs this after the incoming mana nerfs so is a good idea and is not broken at all.","replies":[{"poster":"lxl RockBall lxl","date":"2016-04-22T04:18:13.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But Lost Chapter is not live right now so is better wait for some news about how that items is eprforming on PBE","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2016-04-22T14:19:14.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well maybe we need to wait if they add in some other items too, but Zeke's is a good option to start.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
