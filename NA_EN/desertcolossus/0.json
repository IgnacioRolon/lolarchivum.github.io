The amount of BE could be 1000 for the champions that are worth 3000 BE and if you like the champion and want to buy them 1000 BE off for the champion as long as its still under the rental","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2018-07-03T19:37:04.841+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some way to allow newer players to test champions they see without waiting for free rotation imo is something Riot should of had a long time ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Desertcolossus","date":"2018-07-03T19:38:33.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I think Smite has it, so I don't see why League doesn't","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2018-07-03T19:41:14.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know HoTS has a way to test characters.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kjm99","date":"2018-07-04T00:47:58.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something simple like a few tokens that refresh each week that can be used to pick any champion you want could be good.
