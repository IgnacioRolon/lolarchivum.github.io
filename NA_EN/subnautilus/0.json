I would love to test out the new workings of league to help better it but I have always felt ignored. Normally I would understand but even when they were testing a new support or jungler i wouldn't get anything. My role has always been to test everything in the jungle and I have since played every single champion in the game in the jungle and determined the flaws with it and the pros. Along with playing most champions as support. That being said is there anyway I can get into the PBE, what would I need to do to get a better chance.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T03:57:54.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Other than applying on the [PBE Signup page](https://pbesignup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/pbe), the best thing you can do is continue to be active in the game and a positive influence on the community. Those are the two most consistent parts of the criteria that don't often change, but the rest does, depending on what we are testing, we send batches of invites out to players that match what we're looking to test.\n\nI definitely recommend you check out our [PBE FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top) for complete details on how the system works.

It's a matter of patience, luck, play style, absence of toxicity history etc. Please have a look at the FAQ:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#h1q5\n\nGood luck.","replies":[]}]}
