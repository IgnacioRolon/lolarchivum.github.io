Try the legacy client to see if that fixes it:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Jam Jung","date":"2017-01-03T21:49:38.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's work now!\ni clicked disable language filter in the legacy client and try in custom mode = not work\nand i reply to you then back to the updated client and try in custom mode = work!\nlol, soooooo thanks you so much for help! xoxo :')","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jam Jung","date":"2017-01-03T21:42:57.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's still not work :'(\nnvm, i think the next update client will fixes it :)\nthanks for ans (^__^)","replies":[]}]}]}
