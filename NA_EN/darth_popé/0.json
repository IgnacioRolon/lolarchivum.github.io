(Not sure if this is important but I'm playing version v7.24, Could be a outdated one since I saw a higher number but I might be wrong but if so I also got no update for the newest version.) This bug is active on me since today 2-1-2018 with the first game I tried to play of today.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2018-01-04T23:59:52.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, a little late with this response but I wanted to check in and see if you were still experiencing the trouble connecting to game like this. Bladenite had a good idea gather info and sending it to Tech Support to give it a look see. If it's still bothering you, I do have some suggestions you can try as well while we're here.\n\nFirst, you can try to manually forward any potentially closed ports on your router that LoL needs by following [**the steps here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq8). I'd also suggest making sure your firewall isn't blocking LoL from connecting as well; on the same page you can find steps to bypass it if necessary [**right here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3).\n\nRun a Custom Game or 3 to test out the changes and let me know if you can consistently connect to the game afterwards. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bladenite","date":"2018-01-02T18:52:50.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Howdy Darth Popé,\n\nAlthough bugs isn't really my area of expertise, I'll try to help you out.\nFirst off, I suggest you download the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367).\nAfter the download is complete, you'll want to run the HRT.\n\nif you’re still seeing issues after deploying this pint-sized problem-solver, it can automagically gather your system information and LoL logs into a .zip folder .
