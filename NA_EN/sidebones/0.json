I figured that i would be able to be a positive force the the community, and i hope i was for the time i had. Even when you guys totally changed some of my most played champs i still kept on playing the game, i have spent alot of time just playing League, time that should´ve probably been spent on homework and evolving my social abilities now that i think about it. But i loved this game with such a passion, although it sometimes makes one rage alot, it still had a special place in the heart. I miss the old way league was, but i understand that a game must constantly have changes to not grow dull and lose intrest amongst the public. \r\n\r\nI got a message from a good friend of mine that i met through the PBE servers, that he wasn´t able to log in and that it said something along the lines that his account was inactive, which we both found weird since we both used to play on the PBE servers alot. So i tried to log in and i got the same message, and it saddens me that these are the kind of changes you guys in development reached for. It doesn´t really make the people who play most of their games on the PBE servers fairly happy, knowing that all of a sudden we just can´t log in, and that we have to wait for the chance of us to get randomly picked (which doesn´t really seem like a good chance). It is just a tad bit disappointing that this is what it has come to, the PBE community were so much more polite than any of the servers i have played on, sure it had a few people who resorted to threats and similar, but it was far too less than any other of the servers. And this new change will probably not effect the PBE community for the better, it will probably just create more angry players and induce a more toxic community. \r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\nYour average somewhat level-headed player","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-06T23:36:47.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any PBE account that were not linked to a Live account (NA, EUNE, EUW) or were part of our old PBE system (prior to 10/25/2013) were disabled through a few waves.
