I get an error saying that the client has crashed, game closes, then I can immediately reconnect, load back in and it won't crash again until the next game. It happens nearly every game and while it doesn't kill the whole game, it makes early invades/trades, and leashing impossible. I repaired client to no avail, and even uninstalled and re-installed the game to no avail as well. Wondering if anybody else has had the same issue and maybe has a fix, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-28T16:10:28.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you may have driver or game file issues that's failing to render, which would cause your game to crash like this.
