Uh.\n\nIt seems that someone checked my LolKing and noticed I'm a big fan of Karthus {{champion:30}} , and now everyone thinks this is about him?\n\nI think Karthus AA animation is way too easy to cancel, but I'm fine with it because your Q is supposed to be used for last-hitting, and your E functions as an instantaneous auto attack if used skillfully.  He has enough CS'ing tools as it is.  This isn't a complaint about Karthus at all.\n\nThis is more about champions whose slow AA speed feels completely arbitrary, like they just didn't think about how bad it was when they programmed it, or they just don't care because the champion is old.  (While newer champions get excellent AA animations regardless of their kit strength.  Like Azir.  His AA animation is fantastic.  Very quick and reliable.  They didn't make it horrible to force you into cs'ing with your soldiers.)","replies":[{"poster":"Tapu Fini","date":"2014-12-28T21:59:05.870+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quinn's arrows can be literally half way to their target and you can still cancel the animation :l","replies":[{"poster":"Bouffon dAnglais","date":"2014-12-29T16:56:10.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:16}} Banana.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aarekk","date":"2014-12-30T06:57:10.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who wanted to be a Quinn main early on, that was always one of the most painful things.
