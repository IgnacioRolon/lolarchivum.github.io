I'm not sure what some of those are but they can't be good.\n\nPoint is human (and yordle and like, vastayan, you get the point) interference with the ecosystem of these cute critters could be endangering them in the long term. \n\nThat is why my poro eats nothing but the corpses of his fallen enemies.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"130x","date":"2018-04-05T11:00:15.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"Despite what is said the report system works like this.\n\nSolo que gets trolled by and reports premade, solo que is banned.\n\nPremade trolls solo que and reports him/her for \"costing them the game,\" solo que gets banned.","replies":[]}]}
