It has too many things in it (Escape, gap-closer, displacement, power up to her abilities and stats), therefore it can't just get buffed. Shyvana need's another ult, maybe something like Gnar's passive, so that it will only change her form and amplifies her abilities. So, get rid of the dash. Maybe, to compensate that, move dash to some of her abilities when used in dragon form, like W, for example. And another passive, we need new passive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hinata Rabbit","date":"2015-10-08T22:27:22.567+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with them both being in a reasonable spot in terms of balance. and i love how shyvana works now but i just feel some aspects of her kit (passsive) is just really boring and her laning in the top lane is really bad compared to the other juggernauts that take over top now.\n\nI want to see her changed so you guys can fulfill the \"everyone is different\" role more so than to see her power balance get shifted but, it seems a tad disappointing when i hear you guys say these things but don't actually follow through with them (Remember when veigar was meant to \"torment\" the enemy inside his new E after the delay but nothing in his kit promoted that play aspect and instead just remained the \"aim for a stun but now with a delay\" -- PS veigar isnt broken. people are just whining because he won an lcs match and now hes suddenly pick ban in yoloQ)\n\nYou guys are breaking my heart here. but i understand there are many more characters that could and should get some changes first (Taric, Yorik, Poppy) but you already started the #Juggernaut Thing. go ahead and finish it with Shyv and Olaf. they deserve to be treated with special AoE 30% missing health heals and true damage autos too!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ExecutorDill","date":"2015-10-09T18:45:10.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about urdyr and warwick?\n\nand forgive me for asking....
