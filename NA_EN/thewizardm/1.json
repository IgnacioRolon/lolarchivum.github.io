You can get blocked by a single stray minion and be able to walk through a whole army of them, it&#039;s rather random, and pathing doesn&#039;t take into account the hitboxes of minions as far as I can tell, meaning your champion can just walk into them and get stuck.\r\n* Most of the tooltips don&#039;t accurately reflect what an ability does.\r\n* % hp based dmg and executes are calculated incorrectly (Try playing Ziggs while holding a calculator, you&#039;ll notice how far off it is).\r\n* Death recap has many bugs, including incorrectly stating damage types, incorrectly stating what ability dealt the damage, and showing nameless abilites.\r\n* and many more","replies":[{"poster":"TheSymbolÔfPeace","date":"2018-08-16T13:17:31.332+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"They won't do that until their entire sense of direction changes.

Nobody is forcing you to purchase something you don't like.\n\nAs for buffing random champions that are popular, I encourage you to read the patch notes (they provide context on these buffs / nerfs there) and ask [Meddler or RiotScruffy](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner) (Design Directior and Lead Gameplay Designer respectively) the whys behind said buffs and nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"TheSymbolÔfPeace","date":"2018-08-16T20:43:51.734+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Metas last a long time, like a LONG time when it comes to this game.

However, they tune the garbage loot up and good loot down in order to get more money, please don't tell me that they balance that fairly, it's almost a money scam.\n\nRiot tells us why they do buffs and nerfs? I don't know if you've been playing League lately at all, but Riot has favorites. \"But, but, they have reasons\" is a stupid excuse for why they buff and nerf a champion. They can say whatever they want, doesn't make it the right call. If you recall on PBE those Yasuo changes? The community nearly lost it, and THAT is the reason we nearly escaped the ridiculous change. Their reasoning is ridiculous, they buff things that favor their meta to get more profit. Riot has lost all sense when it comes to understanding how the community works, but man they excel in business. But that's the only thing that matters right? Who cares about the rest of the community when they can just make piles of cash through a buff or two to meta champions, right? It's ridiculously true, and if you doubt that then you're just hopeless.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2018-08-16T20:55:57.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Metas don't last that long and overpowered champs last an even shorter time before they're nerfed.

It's also worth noting that the more valuable an item, the more scarcely tuned it will be.   \n\nRiot looks at data generated from matches across all skill levels (particularly upper levels) to see if a champ is overperforming or underperforming, so while feedback is reviewed and appreciated it, sometimes feedback is too opinionated to act upon.\n\nYou state the reason for their actions is stupid but provide no context or evidence as to how these decision are stupid. The Yasuo changes were highly experimental and were unlikely to make it to the live servers either way. It's what the PBE is for, to experiment and review the results of said experiments in an isolated environment so as to not screw up the game for all players.","replies":[{"poster":"TheSymbolÔfPeace","date":"2018-08-16T21:26:33.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Metas don't last that long, I can tell you haven't played League in the last year, or you would've remembered the wonderful Ardent meta, or do you care to defend that meta? How long before marksman were nerfed again?\n\nIt's scummy when a company makes the loot skewed towards getting garbage. It's also pretty sad when people back this up by saying \"nobody is forcing you to buy it\". You don't understand that they are PROMOTING the buyable items that are largely biased to give you garbage.\n\nAh that's makes sense, Riot really doesn't listen to the data. Remember Ezreal with a +55% wr and a 40% pr? That didn't take long to nerf right, since the stats show he's performing extremely well? Oh wait it did. Evelynn sitting at almost a 10% pr and a 53.44% wr, Alistar sitting at a 17% pr and a 52% wr. Rakan sitting at a 19.5% pr and a 51.55% wr. You're right they ARE looking at the stats my bad.\n\nI state no reasons? Do I really need to state a reason as to why a 100% INCREASE on a <40second level 3 ult is ridiculous? His ultimate already loaded with a out of range turret reset, shield reset, cc, armor shred, and it has decent damage. You're telling me that Riot isn't even smart enough to know that they shouldn't even place that buff on the PBE? That's ridiculous that it wasn't even SUGGESTED. Anyways, the PBE isn't the only way to get our information to Riot before they seal the buffs/nerfs forever. But let's go back to ardent meta with adcs. Everybody hated the meta except for adcs which were overpowered as heck with the ardent buff. It took them until after Worlds to fix ardent and it took until SEASON 8 to finally nerf that role.\n\nI understand that you are a Riot fanboy and like to defend every little criticism ever tossed at them, but you need to understand that not everything they do is good.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2018-08-17T03:06:48.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been playing League since 2010, thank you very much for assuming I haven't played last year or haven't played League much. \n\nThe more valuable the item, the lower the chances of getting it.
