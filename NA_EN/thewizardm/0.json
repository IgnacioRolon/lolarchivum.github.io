With that being said, if you're able to get any screenshots of who was sending you the links send those our way in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). We can look over the site, as well as the player who sent it to you, and see what needs to be done!","replies":[{"poster":"TheWizardM","date":"2017-06-10T09:25:04.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got the don't click part xD.
