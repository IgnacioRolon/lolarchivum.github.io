But starting on monday, my ping after connecting to a game is 150+. I just found out today that the only way to lower my ping again is to reconnect to my game, which will bring it down to a static 40ms. Is there any explanation or permanent fix to this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-26T04:36:43.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there could be issues along your route to our gameservers.

I'd like you to run a traceroute log during a time that you're experiencing the increased latency (you may need to use a custom match to check) using an app called [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/). After loading up the app, simply plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field, then start the trace. After 5 minutes has gone by, you can export the results as text and then paste them into a reply.\n\nLet me know if you ran into any issues.","replies":[{"poster":"zBibler","date":"2017-02-03T04:19:06.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n\n|                             192.168.1.1 -    0 |  346 |  346 |    0 |    0 |    2 |    0 |\n\n|                            66.43.193.94 -    1 |  335 |  332 |    1 |    1 |   68 |    1 |\n\n|    ins-kb2-et-7-0-3-325.kmrr.netins.net -    2 |  323 |  317 |    5 |    5 |   10 |    6 |\n\n|        ins-kc2-et-po101.kmrr.netins.net -    2 |  323 |  317 |    5 |    5 |   10 |    5 |\n\n|               10ge7-3.core1.oma1.he.net -    4 |  307 |  297 |   10 |   13 |   48 |   48 |\n\n|              10ge3-11.core1.den1.he.net -    2 |  327 |  322 |   20 |   24 |   43 |   20 |\n\n|                             206.51.46.6 -    2 |  331 |  327 |   20 |   20 |   40 |   20 |\n\n|                          104.160.138.35 -    1 |  335 |  332 |   20 |   20 |   27 |   22 |\n\n|          ae34-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    2 |  327 |  322 |  147 |  162 |  173 |  163 |\n\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    2 |  323 |  317 |  146 |  162 |  173 |  168 |\n\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-05T21:34:20.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you capture this during an incident?
