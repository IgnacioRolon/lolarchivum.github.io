But starting on over a week ago, my ping after connecting to a game is 150+. I just found out today that the only way to lower my ping again is to reconnect to my game, which will bring it down to a static 40ms. Is there any explanation or permanent fix to this? I've done all of the connection troubleshooting and nothing seems to work.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-04T23:55:50.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having to reconnect to fix your ping sounds like an unstable connection to our game servers, and it could be caused by something local or even how your ISP is trying to route to it.  If you've already gone through the connection guide, run a traceroute to see how your ISP is reaching out by grabbing [WinMTR ](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/)routing to 104.160.131.1.
