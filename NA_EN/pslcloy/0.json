Are the casting animations supposed to randomly halt an in-progress Auto Attack? (seemingly random as its been inconsistent) \n\nI'm going to specifically test some of this out later tonight and might be able to get a video but I also wanted to note that I don't notice this occurring with his regular skins.","replies":[{"poster":"JC DarkOmen","date":"2015-02-08T08:05:34.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i get that a lot too. it really affects tiger stance Udyr, and *really* afftects top lane Udyr. When you get the stun off you want to get the tiger dot on them pronto, but Udyr just sits there menacingly, offering a small window of opportunity before finally applying that 230 + (260% AD). I've had to give up on kills and take turret shots just because of this delayed reaction","replies":[]}]}]}]}
