I found them very useful, especially the &quot;Clear History&quot; button for when someone said something that put me off to see or there was a lot of pings or something. I&#039;d like to know: why this feature was removed, when (I know recently), and if there is a chance of it coming back. I, personally, would like to see it come back.\r\n\r\nLeave your opinion in the comments and represent which you want in the poll. Just remember, if you do not care about if these buttons make a return, then vote &quot;All buttons&quot; and vote none if you do not like the buttons in the first place at all.","replies":[{"poster":"doiminat0r3600","date":"2015-10-18T19:19:49.147+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":2,"body":"I love how this could also be seen as a \"bring back the old morde\" kind of picture as well.
