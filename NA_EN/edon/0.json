Soo I thought I would make a theory about the whole deadeye thing too!\nBut im going to tell the theories in a story style. \n\n{{champion:37}}  **_Sona Buvelle_** {{champion:37}}\n\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fossweb-img.qq.com%2Fimages%2Flol%2Fweb201310%2Fdata%2FSona.gif&amp;key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&amp;width=425\n\n... Gun shot, boom!.. \n&#039;&#039;Sona, help me! Sona, help mee..!&#039;&#039;\nHer adoptive mother screamed. She stilll remembers everything what happend.\nHer mother crawled on the ground and her blood flowed like a river mixed with tears of pain.\nEven her mouth was full of blood. Sona was like paralyzed. She tried to speak through her etwahl.\nBut that didn&#039;t work.  With tearful eyes she tried to move, she tried to help... Sona even tried to scream.\nHopeless... The only thing she could do is see her mother die infront of her. \n&#039;&#039; _I will always... love you Sona_&#039;&#039; and her eyes closed for ever.\n\nIn moments like this Sona would wake up from her nightmares.. But this wasn&#039;t the case this time.\nThe dream just repeats like a circle over and over again.\n&#039;&#039;Couldn&#039;t you help her Sona?&#039;&#039; she heard. ,, Couldn&#039;t you save her?&#039;&#039;..\nSona disagreed. ,, Did you kill her?&#039;&#039; Sona pointed to her etwahl.\n&#039;&#039;Do you know the truth?&#039;&#039;   &#039;&#039;.....&#039;&#039;\n\nEverytime Sona disagreed with the mysterious voice the dream just started again.\nAfter many circles she finally agrees. The white doves around her turned black for the first time.\nAnd she woke up _**screaming **_: &#039;&#039; **I KILLED HER!!**&#039;&#039;\n\n\n**Theorycrafting**\n\n\nI think &#039;deadeye&#039; or Jhin shot the champions with a bullet so that they dream about their their darkest times\nover and over again until they refuse to tell themself lies. For example:\n\n{{champion:86}}  &#039;&#039;My **HEART** and sword always for **demacia**!&#039;&#039;\n-&gt; Come on dude, we know that you love Katarina. -&gt; He is lieing .\nEverytime he needs to fight against Katarina he refuses to follow the codex.\nHe could kill her but he doesn&#039;t.\n+ Deadeye shot him in the face/eyes/head.\n\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fossweb-img.qq.com%2Fimages%2Flol%2Fweb201310%2Fdata%2FGaren.gif&amp;key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&amp;width=425\n\n{{champion:37}}  We don&#039;t many things about her. The only things we know so far are:\n1. In her &#039;old lore&#039; her mother died even though many claim it was an illusion.\nMaybe riot picked the old lore up and refreshed it like I did.\n2. She is mute.\n3. Her etwahl returns to her everytime.\n4. Deadeye shot her in the throat.\n\n\n{{champion:238}}  He got shot in the left/right eye. He is blind? \nThis can maybe also help:\nHe says that truth lies in darkness http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/6/6d/Zed.move9.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20121119061402\nIs that true? Maybe he knows that the darkness isn&#039;t  showing him the truth but his own lies\nblinded his mind and know he believes this quote. Or something like that..\n+ His animated picture can also mean that he is dreaming the same thing over and over again.\nBecause blossoms also represent the circle of life. They bloom and die (nature winter, spring and so on)\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fossweb-img.qq.com%2Fimages%2Flol%2Fweb201310%2Fdata%2FZed.gif&amp;key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&amp;width=425\n\n{{champion:254}}  Vi left her group to join the good side of Piltover.\nBut the question is, is she doing the right thing?\nI think her animated picture represents Love.\nShe refuses to love her sister Jinx (even though we still don&#039;t know for sure if they are sisters)\nand she lost the connection between her old gang (Ekko and co).\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fossweb-img.qq.com%2Fimages%2Flol%2Fweb201310%2Fdata%2FVi.gif&amp;key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&amp;width=425\n\nGood to mention is that everyone of them except Garen are orphans.\n\nBut afterall the whole theory can be wrong and so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nI hope you liked it!

They're all conflicting with themselves. Zed wanted power, he got it, but he gave his soul to the shadows and they will soon take him over. Sona got the instrument, but she's a mute now. Vi wants to keep the peace, but also has a lust for violence. And Garen wants a worthy opponent, which is katarina, but he also loves her. They all got something given to them and something taken from them. It's almost like they wished for something , they got it, but the wish got twisted and messed some other part up. This can all relate to how in other theories, people say Jhin is related to the Arabian djinn (genie). And the Arabian djinn are twisted beings, they want to mess things up for you, but they grant you a wish, but they have a habit of messing those wishes up for the worse. This is almost what exactly happened. All four champions almost seems like they got their wish, but then it got twisted.\n\nEDIT: Btw, another thing that makes Jhin seem like a djinn, is the similarity of the names. The d is silent in djinn btw, so the only difference is the spelling\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"WacingTheFind","date":"2015-12-29T22:58:47.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"garen is a orphan?

Had she mindlessly placed it aside just now?\nSuddenly, a chord rang out, piercingly askew. Sona spun around to see the etwahl drifting swiftly down the hallway. Sona called the instrument back to her, but for the first time, it paid no heed. The single note played over and over as it drew closer to Lestara’s back.\n\nIt was out for blood.\n\nSona flew frantically into the hallway, but she was too far away to reach Lestara in time. Her only chance was to scream a warning. She strained her throat, but no sound would come forth, just as it never had in her entire life.\n\nThe etwahl’s strings strummed a terrible noise that would forever be embedded in her memory. A vibration trembled through the air, and a rush of razor-thin air scythes tore through Lestara’s body.\n\nSona reached Lestara’s side in time to catch her as the body fell to the ground in a pool of blood. Tears streamed down Sona’s face as she tried to scream, but no sound would come out._**\n->League Judgement.Those are actaully illusions based on past events/memories which are sometimes altered.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Seriphym","date":"2015-12-30T05:05:51.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=769230","replies":[]},{"poster":"maxaroni118","date":"2015-12-29T20:52:41.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am interested in seeing where you got Jhin from because i did not see that.
