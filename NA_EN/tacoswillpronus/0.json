This is the account in question, https://lan.op.gg/summoner/userName=tacoswillpronus on the LAN server. I get better ping to the LAN severs, thus why I switched. I don't really ever talk in chat during these games so that might've caused some sort of trigger or something since I don't understand the language all too well on LAN. That's also the reason why I'm posting it here, since I don't speak the language I thought it would be better to post this thread on the NA forums. Thanks.
