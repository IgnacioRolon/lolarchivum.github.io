They can be easily underestimated and get a kill. Some even go mostly tanky items, and still out trade everyone. They also transition well into the mid-late game in most cases as very strong front lines. Just always hated the idea that these champs are supposed to fall off later in the game... Especially now that early game is 10 times more crucial as games are getting shorter and shorter. It just feels bad playing against these things. I am not saying they shouldn&#039;t be in the game, I am just saying it sucks to have to play scared all lane phase, and then watch these bullies bully your team in the mid-late game.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-07-04T04:32:35.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just pretend you're smokey from \"Friday\" for the first portion of the game.\n\n\"I got mind control over Deebo.
