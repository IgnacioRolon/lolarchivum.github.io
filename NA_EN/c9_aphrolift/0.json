If so, how so &amp; how much higher?**\n* **How would you feel about an Ezreal support in your game?**\n* **Does your opinion of how you feel about an Ezreal support change at all if it's a low-elo(bronze/silver) game?**\n* **When playing an off-meta champ like Ezreal Support should you discuss your champion choice with your team before picking it?**\n* **What are the best safe guards I can put in place to main Ezreal support so I don't receive chat restrictions, suspensions or bans?**\n\n\n**My Story:**\nI got the idea from someone who I played with when I was filled to ADC one game sometime in the middle of Season 8.\n\nIt's also worth noting they did a rework on Ezreal which went out live on October 23rd. [cited link](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-update/ezreal-coming-soon)\n\n**Why Ezreal?**\nThe main reason is because it's a champ I enjoy playing and I've tried him as an ADC and I don't enjoy playing him nearly as much or that role as much.  I like the fast traveling skill shot q which can be spammed and used to poke down/get gold from enemy champions.  I like that I can hit a meaningful mid game power spike that offers(pick potential, peel &amp; damage) between 20:00-25:00 minutes in majority of my games independent of getting kills,assists or farm. \n\nThe official reasoning was \"Intentionally Feeding\".  Here's an excerpt of the response I got from the robot initially when I submitted a support ticket:\n\n> ...You’re receiving this penalty due to evidence found of intentional feeding, or “inting” as the human children say. It is, to borrow a human phrase, a “not cool,” and may result in a permaban the next time it occurs.\n\nObviously, one of the games cited I had 0 deaths so I requested a human to get more information.  Eventually they responded with:\n\n> ...Your account has been suspended for 2-weeks for hurting the competitive integrity of your teammate's matches, not for intentionally feeding. Specifically for taking roles that were not assigned to you. Please excuse our incorrect phrasing in your reform card.\n\nBeing that I queue for support in about 80% on my league games I find it particularly strange.  Why would I try to steal someone's role when I have the role I want to be playing in the current game?  Anyway, I added some of these comments to the tickets along with a few others and the last response from them looks like this:\n\n> ...I get how confusing this is since you're testing out something that's not conventional and doing well. The problem is it's a team game. You have to be able to communicate your strategy to your team and work with them to win the game. Sadly it seems that there was a lack of communication of your role int he team and it's come back to bite you.\n> \n> After reviewing your games with my team, we won't be lifting this suspension. Let me know if you need anything else!\n\nSo, it's very clear to me that this suspension will not be lifted.  I find this response especially demoralizing for the entire \"off-meta\" community.\n\n\n[edit]Adding some context to the games:\nGame #1: Jinx backed around 4 minutes and went top lane and wasn't seen again in bot lane for all of laning phase.  I tried my best in a 1v2 lane and I feel like I was a major contributing factor to us winning this game.\n\nGame #2: Our lane was heavily camped although I did not die.  I spent a great deal of the last 10-15 minutes of the game clearing super minion waves that would have otherwise hit/killed our nexus towers which is why my CS is \"high\".\n\n[edit #2]\nHere's a challenger commentary playing Ezreal support in preseason last season:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcBx0MOWz-E","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2018-11-25T06:35:15.889+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":5,"body":"Lets take a look at this.\n\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9%20Aphrolift\n\nIt looks like every game you play Ezreal support you start taking farm right off the bat.

I will usually last hit in this instance.\n\nAnother instance I usually take last hits is when a minion wave is crashing at the tower and let's say a full health melee gets hit twice by a tower and I see my ADC has no intention of auto'ing it.  I might take this minion as well.  \n\nBasically, if there's a very low chance my ADC is going to get the minion I will try and get it.\n\n> \n> But you're straight up lying.

Now that I have looked over the data in more detail, it just looks like you are choosing examples that fit your argument, rather than looking at the majority.  And on top of that, you are only comparing one statistic from the game, when there are several.\n\n**Image 1**\n\nYou only show the cs between him and his ADC, which doesn't look great in all fairness.  But if we instead compare the cs of his ADC and the enemy ADC, we see that in the beginning of the game, their numbers are quite comparable.  Only in the mid to late game (starting around 15/20 mins) does the enemy ADC pull ahead more drastically - which makes sense since his team is winning, has more gold, and can more easily push them out of lane.  Also, the enemy support also has cs right at the beginning of the game when the minions come to lane.  This is just something that happens.  You have to take into consideration that Ezreal support is all about poking the enemy out of lane to deny gold and exp.  So when he throws Q's, it's inevitable that he is going to hit some cs here and there......especially in Bronze!! (this is not pro plays).  So when you look at the whole picture, nothing looks wrong here.  Even the gold between the two supports is similar, even with Ezreal having kleptomancy.\n\n**Image 2**\n\nAgain, you are showing a very one-sided picture.  You aren't even showing cs, but gold acquired (remember Ezreal has kleptomancy which makes this normal).  If we look at cs, MF actually has much higher cs at the beginning of the game - Ezreal doesn't even touch a single cs until 4 minutes in.  Even Nautilus has higher cs for the first 8 minutes of the game than Ezreal.  And can you really be surprised that he ends up with more cs eventually when the adc goes 1/9 and him 8/3?  Feels like you were really reaching in this example.\n\n**Image 3**\n\nAgain, we are only looking at one comparison.  If you instead compare the cs between Ezreal support and their Kennen support, kennen has more or equal farm up until 8 minutes into the game.  Or if we compare the cs between the two adc's, we see their cs is basically identical throughout the entire game.  I honestly don't even see why you used this as an example.  He didn't have cs \"right when the minions got to lane\" and his adc had more cs all game, by quite a lot.\n\n**Image 4**\n\nADC has more cs all game, comparable to enemy ADC all game for the most part - even when having a KDA of 1/9/2.  That's a lot of time out of lane....\n\n\nNow that we're done with that, let's look at the other games, where we aren't trying to be bias to make a point:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/xxpLUu8\nhttps://imgur.com/a/gwb4xdw\nhttps://imgur.com/a/9Dwtscj\nhttps://imgur.com/a/pftT0VF\n\nSo, basically.  You can use specific statistics to paint an ugly picture if you pick only those that fit your argument.  But it doesn't mean that you know what happened during a game exactly or the circumstances.  But please don't try to lie to us and pull the wool over our eyes solely to pass on doubt.\n\nAlso, it says here clearly that he played support/fill 71% in only the last 20 games in ranked.  So how can you possibly say that he is lying about 80% for all season?  Prove this to me please.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ekYtrmt\n\nSo now you are the one whose hand is caught in the cookie jar friend.","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Aphrolift","date":"2018-11-25T09:27:34.740+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"> ADC has more cs all game, comparable to enemy ADC all game for the most part - even when having a KDA of 1/9/2.

Despite the ADC dying 9 times he was equal to the enemy ADC for all game for the most part.\n\nGuys!! Ezreal support can do things in lane.  He has poke.

In higher elo, warding does a lot more jobs than simply picking stuff to do more damage. You could be safely split-pushing while knowing the enemy team is somewhere else, you could've managed to pick an enemy off who was sighted from afar, you could've saved your team from face-checking bushes to their deaths. Aside from that, you can just change to your red lens trinket & contribute your team even more by eliminating the enemy team's vision power.

One of the qualities that differentiates between lower and higher elo players is a higher elo player’s ability to adapt to situations. The ability to realize which items are not useful in a specific situation and knowing what is needed in order to give their team the best chance to win.  The fact that he sold his support item in order to provide his team with more damage since their ADC was not contributing enough, is something that is helpful. It’s definitely not hurting the team.  I’ve seen many mage supports that sell an item in order to provide more damage to their team when it is obvious during team fights that they need it.  I’m not saying it’s the best idea, but you certainly wouldn’t be complaining like this if it was your brand support who went full damage. You are being incredibly biased because he played a marksman as a support. Moral of the story: adaptation == good.\n\nSecond, not our place to cast judgement on others? You’re kidding me right? Isn’t that exactly what you are doing because he played an off-meta champion? Being a hypocrite isn’t a good way to win arguments or get your ideas seen. Also - it’s a very poor argument. \n\nAlso, again, if it is indeed a team game. Then how could you possibly blame him for going full damage in order to help his team since his ADC was hitting as hard as a cannon minion?   It seems like you’re upset that he adapted his normally supportive build to provide more damage for his team, claiming that this is not helpful. When, honestly, I can’t think of a better idea at that point when your jungler has no items and your ADC is basically inting. \n\nI suggest you rethink your arguments and come up with points that actually make sense.

I would say yes. \n\nIt's an unconventional that confuses many, so proper communication would certainly help calm people down and understand how to play around it.\n\n> * **How would you feel about an Ezreal support in your game?**\n\nI've said it before, I'm all for off meta. If I knew what you were trying to achieve, I would probably pick trist / ziggs / heimer or even morde bot (with demolish) to supplement your style.\n\n\n> * **Does your opinion of how you feel about an Ezreal support change at all if it&amp;#039;s a low-elo(bronze/silver) game?**\n\nLow elo aren't familiar enough with champs to understand why it can work. High elo ais just Meta sheep, both elos will dislike it regardless of what's going on.\n\n> * **When playing an off-meta champ like Ezreal Support should you discuss your champion choice with your team before picking it?**\n\n\nThat's just good etiquette, and it shows that you are capable of reason and communication. \n\nI remember an old video about using Eve support (back when she had perma-stealth). They suggested starting champ select with \"is it possible you pick a champ that can hold the lane 2v1? Cos I'd like to roam\".\n\nIt sets the expectation and instills confidence into others.\n\n> * **What are the best safe guards I can put in place to main Ezreal support so I don&amp;#039;t receive chat restrictions, suspensions or bans?**\n\nStart champ select saying that you want to play an unconventional support. Let them know that you will not take CS and will be heavily focused on poking and turret damaging. \n\nLet ban phase go through but only hover your pick after all your team mates have banned. Once that has happened, hover Ezreal.\n\nThey will freak out again, and now you mention about your strong points for Ezreal, like the poke speed, the W turret dmg, and the E out to face tank CC\n\nReassure them that you won't take CS and ask them to trust you. \n\n\n\nIf they don't agree to it, then you might want to reconsider your pick. \n\nPoint is that you are talking and discussing with your team, and not shoving your strategy down their throat. \n\nIn game, make sure you pay attention to the map and ward often, as you dont have any CC, so they will blame you for any death if they get ganked.\n\nCommunicate the enemy jg position and tell them to position safer if the enemy jg is around. Trade aggressively and make sure you aren't just sitting behind your bot laner throwing out Qs. Also, don't just run away if they eat a bad hook, make sure you attempt to zone the enemy out as well. \n\nIf you want people to have more confidence in you, then you need to play at a higher level than they are in order to prove yourself to them.","replies":[]}]}
