And when I try to reconnect, it crashes again and again while my network connection is perfect. Now I have low priority queue for the second time in 2 days and it pisses me off. I restarted LoL multiple time, nothing works. Is there something wrong with the servers or is it really just my PC?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-02T15:47:45.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear this is happening to you.  :(  Even though your connection elsewhere might be perfect, it does look like it's struggling to reach our game server.
