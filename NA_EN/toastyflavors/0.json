The first time it happened was when everyone starting hitting past level 6. It caused us to lose because I couldn't get back in time to help. I figured it wasn't a big deal so we went to play another and it crashed earlier than last time. I was in the bottom lane around level 4. I re-logged and it happened within seconds. Then it happened again, and again, and again. (we somehow won) \r\n\r\nI tried to fix it with the launch page repair option and tested it in a custom game. I crashes around the 3 minute point every single time despite me repairing the client. \r\n\r\nThe crash I get isn't a bluescreen ether. It's more like my computer forces itself to restart on me. \r\n\r\nSomeone please help{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-23T01:20:42.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ToastyFlavors, \n\nCouldn't help but read your issue and have dealt with that too.
