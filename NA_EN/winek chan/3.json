AP Corki is hardly viable currently, and the only AP item most people build on him is Gunblade, and all that nerf did was to reduce the +40 AP to +28 AP considering he built gunblade. So 12 less damage for corki but a shitton less for AP corki? :/","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Rouge","date":"2017-12-15T11:38:59.417+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure it got hit?

The base damage was nerfed as was his AD (by a whopping 12 AD late game - huge for an ADC).
