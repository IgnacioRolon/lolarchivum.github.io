My hands aren't the ones that do the fine craft art, but perhaps I can help answer your questions.  \n\nMost recently our team worked on \"The Climb\" and \"The Wrath of Zaun\".

Uh, I'm not too sure how well I'll be able to articulate what I want to know, so my questions might sound too broad or convoluted or stuff like that.\n\nWell, I guess my first question would have to be about 3D modeling. How do the textures get made? The grains you use for the stones in the background, the many minuscule scratches on plate armor, the individual strands of hair, the little fibers you can see sticking up from Yasuo's cloak on his shoulders when he stands up in \"The Climb\"-how do they get made? Or am I just completely overthinking things and it's some type of preset that even beginner 3D model creators can do?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crimson Anam","date":"2018-03-13T05:42:11.834+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Star Guardian: New Horizon anime short is the best.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaune","date":"2018-03-13T10:45:33.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd still put my money on either Annie: Origins bc they had to partially paint each frame and Lux: Binding Light bc it was cell and used quick sketches to make something awesome.

I might just be exaggerating because I tend to get too excited with animations, but dang. It's nothing to scoff at.\n\nI haven't watched Magus yet though, but I hear it's good and I know the plot (more or less).

Different studios have their strengths and weakness depending on the kind of philosophy they adhere to, some may be more traditionalist while other may use more varying degrees of digital assistance.\n\nThough in general, the drafts and sketches of anime are still done on paper first. This is still kept because hand-made animation flow more organically and typically able to be more complex thanks to the malleable nature of hand-drawing, which is something CGI may lack if no fat budget and significant talent is put into reassuring natural movement. CGI hence is mostly used in anime either as a budget cutting measure used at the expense of quality, but sometimes its disadvantage is actually used for beneficial results, such as if you actually need frantic and janky movement, they sometimes use CG model as a base to draw 2D arts on, because CG characters by default do not have fluid movement (this is how the titans in Attack on Titans are drawn). Many ways to play around things.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaune","date":"2018-03-13T11:28:30.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's still amazing though!

When it comes down to it, the harder you train, the easier the battle.\n\nAnd in the case of animation and art, the more things you try to draw and the more you keep animating, the better it looks. And it helps if you have A LOT of time. I tried drawing a comic panel once just to see what it was like (fully colored btw) and burned out on the fourth panel. If anyone ever said that drawing doesn't require any stamina and it's easy, then I BEG TO DIFFER.","replies":[]}]}]}
