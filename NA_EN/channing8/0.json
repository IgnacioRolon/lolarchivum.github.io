The reason many low-ELO players lose to him is that they deliberately counterpick a \"hard counter\" champion (such as Kayle or Yorick), despite having little experience or skill with that champion.\n\nFirst of all, I'd strongly advise you not to pick a champion that you have no idea how to use, even if that champ has a statistically high winrate against Garen. If you choose Darius or Quinn thinking you'll get an easy win against a Garen main, think again. Because his kit is so simple to learn, many players have more time to focus on Garen's metagame, developing strategies to succeed against particularly rough matchups (itemization, positioning, etc.). Many other champions don't afford that luxury, meaning low-ELO players are still learning mechanics and combos for their champ even as Garen is knocking down their towers. Pick a champion you are already comfortable with, or barring that, start practicing with another champion or two that fit your playstyle and have a high winrate against him.\n\nSecond, lets go through Garen's weaknesses. He is a low-mobility melee champion; his only gapcloser is a movespeed steroid (and his only disengage); he has no ranged poke; his passive sustain is negated by poke; he has no hard CC and has weak peel; he relies heavily on items and his abilities to remain relevant; his ult execute deals magic damage and scales with opponent's % missing HP; and his kill potential is dramatically reduced while his execute is on CD. Also, despite being a \"juggernaut\" champion, Garen is not a solo carry champion. If his teammates are behind, it's nearly impossible for Garen to win the game on his own against a competent opponent, even with a significant gold and experience lead.\n\nSo in an ideal world, we'd like to counter Garen with a high-mobility ranged poke champion with lots of armor and HP. That's a tall order, but we can probably fit most of those attributes into a particular champion.\n\nSeveral melee champions who have strong splitpush and dueling capability are the exception to the rule when it comes to melee. Trundle, Tryndamere, and Yorick come to mind. Yorick can lock down Garen in his W and harass with his minions. (Side note, Malzahar can do the same quite well but his low mobility is a big downer.). Trundle steals Garen's tank stats while AP Tryn outsustains Garen pre-11 (still works despite the E nerf). All three can push lane much harder and faster than Garen, setting him behind.\n\nIf you want something a bit more durable, Cho'Gath and Tahm Kench are both high-HP, low-mobility melee tanks with strong poke. Cho'Gath in particular has a sweet knockup, an AoE silence to match Garen's, and an execute that deals true damage scaling with his bonus HP. Tahm has some hard CC in his Q, and his W swallow is strong peel that deals % opponent's-max-HP true damage.\n\nSome ADCs also do well against Garen, specifically low-HP, high-mobility ranged poke champions like Quinn, Vayne, Kai'Sa or Ezreal.\n\nAnyway, that's just my thoughts on how to counter my main man Garen. Good luck on the Rift! :)","replies":[{"poster":"jacobbiceps","date":"2018-08-21T22:40:44.216+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good work mate!\n{{champion:119}} {{summoner:4}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2018-08-22T07:41:58.957+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just as a note, Tahm is a skill match up, if Garen can deal damage to him but hold onto his Q until he has Tahm at like half HP then silence him and Ult then Tahm's toast.

to animation cancel to maximise your dps, play around your mobility with minions, and use the knockup on your q properly. you also need to space yourself out really really well.\n\nmost of the time you just want to stay out of his range and poke him with your q. but that requires practised reflexes to kite back when he tries to engage, manage minion waves, and positioning so youre behind minions yourself so he cant run directly at you.\n\ngaren is good at one thing in lane. hes good at punishing mechanical mistakes that youre making.\n\nand playing difficult champions as you do, you probably make a lot of them.\n\nthe first mistake you might be making is trying to fight him with yasuo at all. yasuo outscales garen. so you already win when you just out cs him and win in farm. as soon as

Garen mains that play him in high elo that get beaten up in their lanes because of the reasons above\n\nNow this is how it should be:\nTo satisfy all 3 groups Garen needs changes to his kit that keep him a basic champion with abilities that allow players with a higher skill ceilling to outplay his opponent.\n\nPossible Solution to satisfy all 3 Groups:\n\n1.) Keep the general frame of his kit Q/W/E/R how it is\n2.)Take away the unreliable (RNG) Villian mechanic that destroys people in low elo/ and add CC to his R so Garen becomes usefull in teamfights\n3.) add something to his kit that rewards skillfull players and punishes if the player misses the play*\n\n*Here is the solution or my thoughts :\nIf Garen activates his Q and reaches a certain distance to his Q target, he can leap forward by pressing Q for a 2nd time then he deals bonus damage on hit. IF Garen does not connect then his Q cooldown extends by 4 seconds or X amount of time needs PBE testing!\nTo compensate the removal of the villian mechanic that is an unreliable (RNG) and unfun mechanic his NEW R draws people in X distance of sucessfull execution of the enemy towards the impact area of his ult and slows them for X amount of time.","replies":[]}]}
