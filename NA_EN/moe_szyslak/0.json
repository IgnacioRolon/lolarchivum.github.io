We all know what happened to Veigar, so I won't go there in this post. I want to focus on Viktor instead.\r\n\r\nA LOT of people are asking for Viktor to be nerfed because he suddenly saw some LCS play. A LOT of people are saying Viktor is OP, and I've even seen some claiming Viktor has no counter-play late game due to his burst (top lel when people claim this).\r\n\r\nHere's what I have to say: the champ is in a perfectly fine spot right now, and doesn't need to be changed. He has his strengths. And he also has his weaknesses. Just like any other champ in this game should.\r\n\r\nYes, he gets powerful AoE damage late game with his E and his Ult. Yes, if you buy Lich Bane, it stacks with his Q beautifully and he can do a lot of damage with it. It's almost like the Lich Bane combo was intentional, especially considering how it's a recommended item when you open up the shop screen. However, high AoE damage does not make Viktor overpowered - it is his ONLY strength. You see very similar style of play out of other mages like Brand and Xerath. Anyway, let's discuss what Viktor sucks at.\r\n\r\nFirst, I'll talk about his obvious weakness. The dude has no mobility. Even with his augmented Q (which costs 2000 gold, because if you don't augment E first you've lost your lane), he is a slow as crap.  The Q only works if you land a hit on something, so you either need to burn the initial Q damage on a minion for your speed boost, or you have to get within striking range of an enemy champ to use it, which puts yourself in danger. Contrast this to LeBlanc, who pretty much has very little counter-play if she gets fed early due to her excessive burst damage and mobility.\r\n\r\nAlso, since we're on the topic of mobility, Viktor has no gap closer. It's easy to just out run him, especially since his W (the stun bubble), requires enemy champs to stand in it for a short duration before they're actually stunned; more often I find his W to be only useful for zoning or in defensive situations, and rarely ever do I actually stun anyone with it.\r\n\r\nSecond, many champs can easily counter or be played very effectively against Viktor by simply outmaneuvering and bursting him down. I'll name just a few obvious ones: Ahri, Akali, Leblanc, Zed, Talon. Many of these champs can get close to Viktor to inflict heavy damage, and easily maneuver out of harm's way when he can retaliate. This is exacerbated by the fact that VIktor's E is difficult to use at short ranges, especially when an enemy is standing directly next to him; in some situations, it's glitchy/downright broken and Riot should probably fix it for Vik at some point. Further, mages with heavy CC can give Viktor a lot of trouble, e.g., as Annie, Cassiopea, and Morgana. Because Viktor's Q is reliant on getting within close range, he opens himself up to being CC's and bursted by such champs. Finally, tanks like Cho and Malph are generally also very problematic, as Viktor is mana hungry and tanks can out-sustain his mana consumption.\r\n\r\nAnyway I'm going to wrap up the post here because honestly most of you won't read this far before posting your opinions anyway. Overall, please stop being  noobs and asking for nerfs just because you got trashed by a champ you know don't know much about. I really dislike that many people immediately react by asking for nerfs instead of actually stepping back, learning about champs they are unfamiliar with, and realizing Viktor is quite balanced already.","replies":[{"poster":"Sooko","date":"2015-03-11T23:24:44.983+0000","up_votes":77,"down_votes":1,"body":"My friend kept saying Viktor was one of the least viable mid laners in existence.

He's an early game monster who has dictated the jungle meta almost since his release. And even if he does fall behind, his kit will ensure he stays relevant all game. That's why he is considered pick/ban status at high elo.\n\nUnfortunately, he shares Kit-nerf problem that Janna has. Their Kits are strong enough that simple number tweaks would have no significant impact (short of the extreme). So the only way to truly nerf them is to modify their kit.
