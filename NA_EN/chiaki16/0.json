I was red side so this was a pretty bad problem) and tried to restart my computer to solve these problems. When it started back up I was reverted to a 7.4 client and my league won't update so I get an error when trying to sign in on any of my accounts.\n\nI have no idea what caused this, but can I assume the only way to fix this is a lengthy repair of the client?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-24T16:42:50.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on similar reports I've seen so far, it seems like some players are failing to grab necessary updates and end up on a different version than everyone else.  We've got a [sticky ](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/Oe3XBf34-incorrect-username-or-password)about this up as we track the issue, but found a workaround that might help in the meantime:\n\nLocate LeagueClientSettings.yaml within C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nOpen it with a text editor (such as Notepad, TextEdit, or Notepad++) and find gameflow-patcher-lock. It should have a number there.\nChange the number to read \"null\" (without quotes)\nSave the file.\nRestart the client.\n\nIf that doesn't work, you may need to perform a Force Repatch via the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367).  This will help make sure you get on the correct version.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
