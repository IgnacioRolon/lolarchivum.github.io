It sucks that you're having issues lagging though; a few questions really quickly:\n\n1. Does your old system run League of Legends without any connection issues? If so, it's more likely the new computer we'll look into than your home network.\n2. Are you using a wired connection? A wired one generally works more consistently than a wireless one for a variety of reasons.\n3. Have you updated all of your network drivers? The software and drivers that are responsible for your wired and wireless connection. (unfortunately, I cannot find something specifically for your system because the product page doesn't mention what your network card's brand and model are)\n4. Have you tried power cycling your modem and router? All it means it unplugging your modem and router from power, waiting for a few minutes, and then plugging them back in; modem first, then router. Though not as typical anymore, some older networks behave oddly when new hardware is connected (usually negatively affecting the new hardware) until the network has been restarted.\n\nBesides that, you might want to check out our [Connections support article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), it has a few steps that may help you achieve connection bliss (some have been mentioned already)\n\nIf you still continue having issues, reach out to one of my colleagues by sending a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). When sending a ticket, [logs will be a great help](http://bit.ly/2thtj6h)!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Advo","date":"2019-03-10T01:53:14.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i find that half the time someone comes to me with this issue there computer is set to used some shitty motherboard graphics gpu instead of the actual gpu they paid all the money for","replies":[]}]}
