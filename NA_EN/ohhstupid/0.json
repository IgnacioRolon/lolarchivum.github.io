According to the wiki, over 27 Million people play league everyday. So if everyone just played 2 games with a team of 5, we would reach the level 5 goal in a day. \n\nSo if everyone would just go out of their way to try and play at least two 5-man games this week, they would be doing their part to work towards the goal. \n\nI have to admit, I am a little disappointed in how few people are willing to work towards the Pool Party, but I think we can turn it around in the next few days if we all work to do our part. It only takes 1 person to get people together for a 5-man team. Talk to those you queue up with and ask them to team up with you for the next one (it doesn't have to be a ranked game). Even just playing an ARAM game with a team works towards the Pool Party. The average time for a game in ARAM is about 20 minutes, so it's great to spam a few games with your 5-man to add points towards the goal. \n\nTo anyone who reads this, I hope you will try and make a team to at least play 2 games with, more is better, but any game you can get in will be very appreciated.
