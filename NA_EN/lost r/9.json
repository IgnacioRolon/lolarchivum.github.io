How much changed from a few months ago to now that suddenly tanks are considered the new meta? The largest addition was the Cinderhulk, but the tank junglers getting a huge buff to their core item (and the addition of Bami&#039;s) isn&#039;t THAT big enough to suddenly make them the new meta. Laners don&#039;t directly benefit from it. At most, it made the tank junglers viable again.\r\n\r\nFrom my personal experiences in game, it seems like an overreaction from the assassin meta getting broadsided by their elemental nemesis. The core element of assassins is they deal their damage in one big burst and get away before they face retaliation. Tanks specialize in dealing their damage out over a longer period of time, but are able to last considerably longer in battle, sometimes able to bounce back much faster from damage, and hold down the enemy long enough to deal that damage to them. \r\n\r\nIf assassins can&#039;t kill their mark, their only option available to them is to get the hell out. Unless they have someone to help pin down the enemy or just generally protect them from the enemy, either through buffs or crowd control, they melt in the hot sun under direct and sustained fire. Tanks by and large have exactly what destroys assassins, and since tanks received a decent boost to their earlier game, it made them a lot more capable of taking on their nemesis and winning.\r\n\r\nThe punchline is this isn&#039;t exactly new. Tanks received a huge boost in their power back during Season 4 when the Quill Coat was introduced, and what would later be remade into the smite buff from the Gromp. The short life of the Quill Coat, however, along with the entirety of the old jungle item sets made its impact quiet, minimal and short-lived.\r\n\r\nTanks are not the new meta. Assassins are just losing their ground from the previous season, yet people insist on bringing four AD assassins to the game regardless of how counterproductive it actually is, and this is becoming all the more apparent the longer it goes on.","replies":[{"poster":"Sooko","date":"2015-05-24T22:29:20.053+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":2,"body":"Its actually because assassins literally took over the game by the end of season 4, as most instant punishments to deal with their superior mobility were removed, and the fact that most of them lived through the mana regen nerfs, unlike mages. \n\nThe champions that dealt with assassins, tanks, were deeply sunk in tier 3 (most of them), being outplayable, slow starters, and easily counterjungled by mobile junglers, not to mention the fact that any ADC could bring them down with a Bork and a LW very quickly.\n\nWhen the Cinderhulk was released, their clear times were powered up a lot, not to mention being allowed to have easily the best jungling enchantment due to how lackluster the others seem to be.

Mid lane is most efficient for champions that scale well on levels, and that means **ability based damage dealers.** Assassins and mages, primarily. If you don't have damage coming out of mid your team comp will be weak on damage overall and likely quite susceptible to being tanked to death. Moreover, a tank in mid could possibly work given a carry top/jungler, but wouldn't put as much gank pressure on the side lanes as someone who did more damage, nor provide as much to early game skirmishes across the lower map.\n\nIf you want to play tank'gath, there's always top lane.

A meta favoring one  of those three is established when one counter is buffed enough to be a viable threat OUTSIDE of their ability to counter their nemesis class.  \n\nIn Season 4, the way to stop Zed was to choose a tankier champ.  Keane proved this more recently when he played Urgot into Zed.  Urgot benefitted only from a small direct buff to his shield, Urgot did not benefit at all from the general and targeted buffs that brought back tanks.  And the only thing that changed for Zed was a small nerf to attack speed.  This tells us that Urgot would have been VERY LIKELY to do just as well against Zed last season as he did when Keane brought the zombie to life.\n\nThe reason Zed was strong was not his ability to delete squishies.  He still does that, and yet is not considered as strong.  He was strong because, once he was done deleting that squishy, he could do respectable damage to tanks or split push and either kill one person or play safe against two.  That's what he can't do anymore, and that is why assassins have fallen out of favor.  If you see a good Zed in the game, either your ADC or squishy mid, if you picked one, is still going to die.  After that, though, Zed can't contribute anything more.\n\nTanks, however, received numerous direct buffs, particularly in the jungle, that translated into them not only being the counter to assassins, but being able to contribute beyond shutting down those assassins.  Now a tank can split push without worrying too much about the threat to their life.  Now they can dish out quite a lot of damage with Cinderhulk and Gromp buff.  And yes, those two things are the lion's share of the difference.  Every other jungler CAN get Cinderhulk, but their contribution suffers because they need damage.  Every other jungler CAN get Gromp buff and stomp wards, but the Gromp buff benefits those tanks more than anyone else, and the ward stomping Raptor buff is just as useful on tanks as anyone else.  PERHAPS, if Krug buff was actually threatening to champions, other junglers could shine as well.\n\nSo yes, tanks are the new meta, because they got buffed to be useful beyond their capability to counter another class.  And they are already seeing their time in the sun fade into shadow as their counters, which have always been strong, see a resurgence.  Just as Season 2 was the time of the tanks and saw the rise of the \"ADC Deathball\" comps that dominated afterward, and just as Season 4 was a response to those carries getting out of control and needing assassins to take them down again, so we come full circle, and will again.\n\nAnd I, for one, eagerly anticipate the day when the wet noodle fight is considered the epitome of excitement in this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-05-25T09:16:58.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"The Meta\" Is really just short for what people consider popular, strong or safe at the given time.\nSince assassins were the main threat for so long, minor buffs to a number of tanks caused people to jump onto the tank wagon and charge full steam ahead, creating a tank meta.\nVery little has actually changed, minor buffs to a hand full of tanks via direct buffs, item implementation and reworks on some jungle buffs, but really, it's more about the placebo effect than anything.
