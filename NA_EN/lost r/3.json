Literally every game, I&#039;m the only one who is actually get objectives while everyone else just fucks off in the jungle or flaps their mastery dicks at the enemy. They absolutely refuse, even under pain of the most agonizing death imaginable, to do anything that isn&#039;t farming, mastery dick flapping, or just plain old giving up. They expect to have victory handed to them on a silver platter without doing any of the fucking work, while the support busts their ass just to get the slightest bit ahead while the rest of the fucking team rides on their coattails and bitches the whole time over every goddamn little thing that goes wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"D3M4L1S","date":"2016-10-11T19:25:41.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And it makes me salty when they give me $#!+ for clearing winions while they're MDFing.
