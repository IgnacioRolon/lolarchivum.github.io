If your support builds a sightstone/helps the team get ahead, does it really matter who they're playing?

They're dedicated to dealing ranged damage and relentlessly poking the enemy, focusing on volume over damage. Brand is a really good one, since most everyone wants to endlessly teamfight like rabid dogs these days, and Brand severely punishes the enemy for bunching up (which they do because no one has actual range and can only focus one enemy at a time).
