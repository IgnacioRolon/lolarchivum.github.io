Long as we keep showing up Riot has no motivation to look at actually fighting the problem. People act this way because they get away with it, they lose nothing or gain nothing by being terrible people. \n\nThe best part is Riot refuses to acknowledge that they have a problem. Riot's official post located on their FAQ page mentions that over 92% of all their players are \"Neutral or Positive\". \n\nThe next paragraph is the best one. \n\nIF OVER 92% OF ALL PLAYERS ARE NEUTRAL OR POSITIVE, WHY DO A LOT OF MY GAMES SEEM TOXIC?\n_Players who are generally positive or at least neutral can have a bad day or week for any reason. If these players happen to be playing League of Legends when they feel frustrated or upset, they may be less likely to tolerate mistakes from fellow summoners, and start to rage or flame their teammates. As there are another nine players in the same match, any number of those players could become frustrated by a single summoner’s behavior, and will now have the potential to become a negative force in their own future games, causing the toxicity to spread, fast._\n\nBasically Riots definition of a toxic player is extremely restricted and they don't care about the fact that 80% of their games have some form of toxicity that takes place. I am not in the high tiers, and from what I gather from the forums, the higher your rank, the greater the flaming. Either way Riot is perfectly fine with almost every game you play having a toxic player in there. That fact coupled with the fact that pre-game chat windows, and post game chat summary windows are not captured in their AI toxic player system and both ignore game muting and you realize that despite the best intentions of 99% of the community. The people at the top still hold all the power and Riot has clearly laid down their policy from day 1. If a change reduces their player base numbers, it will never happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Eevee In A Jar","date":"2016-02-23T03:38:42.838+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's especially worse now.

Bot/mid lane isn't the best for peeling away from lane to secure objectives like dragon early?  Grab someone who can do so.  Your team needs a hard frontline, grab one of the tanks that can do so.  Top/support is going tank, but you still need a bruiser?  Grab one of those.  Your frontline is good, but you need an assassin/carry?  Those can work too.  You have lanes that can snowball easy, they just need a kill or two ahead to get rolling?  Grab someone who can fill out what they need (as in damage or cc, probably the cc).  So in this sense, they are a lot like supports, in  that they should be working with their team to shore up it weaknesses, but they have more flexibility in the sense that they can fill in more weaknesses, because they do have a steady source of xp/gold income, so they can play item based carries.\n\nOne of the major things that junglers need more than anything is speed.  If it's just high mobility, fast clear times, or great dueling potential for those who counterjungle  (IE: fast champion kill times). These are the marks of a good champion for jungling, and knowing your champions strengths and weaknesses is key.  There are champions who don't have any of these that are good junglers, but they bring something else to the table that is stronger than their lack of speed, usually in the form of being healthier than others once they do a full or partial clear of their jungle.\n\nBecause of the speed, and their \"lane\" wanders across almost half the map, they were expected to, the same way that a support is, to put up vision, and to recognize and exploit mistakes from the opponents.  This really gets me going for both the role of support and the role of jungle, because apparently you are supposed to have pro level of threat/weakness recognition, and the split second reactions/mechanical execution to respond to these situations.  When I'm playing with people at my level, I'll make the same mistakes, same misclicks, same poor shot calls as them, but because of my play immediately affecting them instead of say, 5-10 minutes from now when my lane opponent decides to roam after they were just a better player and won the lane, they react instantly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Maratsune","date":"2016-02-22T04:55:45.768+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main support, and I think I've heard that sentiment like, once.

I found that when I was in a carry role half the time even if I won my lane the rest of my team would get stomped to dust. Things went much better when I was able to spoon feed them with well placed CC, or waiting for Zeds to ult and landing a bubble right as they come out of it. Often times I would have no boots and 6 active items and I'd be throwing shields, buffs, and cleanses all over the place. People don't realize it, but the insane amounts of utility that supports bring to the table can turn the tides of teamfights when placed in the right hands. I was always taught that the support's job is to maximize your team's potential in fights, and a good support can carry a team this way. I'm always asking myself \"What champion can I pick to maximize the power of this team comp?\" or \"What items do I need to build to keep things in our favor?\"\n\nAlthough this season, because of how bursty everyone is and how quickly teamfights go, I haven't been doing so good.

Can't really build damage either because most support champions have god awful scalings. I feel like playing support this season just sucks, the only supports that really stand a chance in this meta are super tanks like {{champion:12}} and {{champion:201}} . There's a few other supports that are viable too, but {{champion:40}} has been meta for years and {{champion:432}} might as well be in the same class as taking a mid laner for support. With the gold and xp gap combined with how quick fights are I feel like the only things I'm ever good for anymore is being a ward machine, a distraction, or setting up a few kills early game. Once it gets to mid game though it feels like everything is out of my hands. I feel like my skill level peaked around mid to late season 5, then ever since I've just been playing worse or something. Support just isn't that fun anymore, I really hope Riot gets around to a support update or something.\n\nCheers to all the support mains out there who continue to take up the burden!\n-Vaz-","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Azteryz","date":"2016-02-22T06:52:44.564+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"in my opinon riot needs to make more support champs \n\nthere isnt a huge variety in terms of characters for supports \n\nmost are either innocent \"frail looking\" and the rest are either braum thresh and morg (pretty sure im missing some)\n\ntl;dr rito make more supp champs they are fking awesome and always well received when you release them","replies":[{"poster":"Forwraith","date":"2016-02-22T08:56:11.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Rather than that, I feel like Riot should buff some of the existing/unplayed support champions.  I know they reworked Zilean a while back, but how many people actually play Zilean?  He doesn't have too strong of a laning phase, and is relatively easy to gank (Base damage to his q increased, possibly...?).  I figure they're going to start working on that seeing that Taric is supposed to get a rework (Please dear god let the Gem Lord of Leg Warmers be viable...).  Plus, there's plenty of champions who have the potential to be an amazing support and would probably do well in that role.  I could see a Galio rework becoming a strong support option.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-02-22T11:47:09.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Zil's getting LCS play in mid lane, so his days as support are basically over untill nerfs hit him again.\n\nNeed a tank?

Aside from a few exceptions, the answer would be no.\n\nAssuming you're ruling out all the flex picks like Poppy, Lulu, Lux, Nunu and Nautilus from the category of \"support champs\".  Trundle has seen some high level support play too.\n\nConsidering most non-flex supports have been nerfed specifically to keep them out of solo lane and/or jungle viability *at least* once, some several times... yeah, it's not surprising that their current balance state is not solo lane viable.  When you have a kit that is great at working with others you often have a kit that is bad at working without others -- or Riot will nerf you until you do.\n\nOn the other hand, when you have a map where grouping happens constantly and everyone is assured a decent gold income whether their champion last hits well or not, i.e. ARAM... then most supports are top tier or outright OP even *after* the map-specific nerfs to sustain, and this is only partly concealed by the fact that you can't pick them on purpose.\n\nThe laning phase doesn't create 1 slot where supports are good so much as it creates 3-4 slots where supports are bad, hiding how strong their kits truly are at equal gold and exp.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pars Fortuna","date":"2016-02-22T14:56:05.017+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's strange how people belittle supports so much...
