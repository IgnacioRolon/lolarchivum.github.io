It&#039;s your own goddamn fault for not paying attention when the client downloads a big ass patch, then you have to go through their TOS box twice, then the new login screen, then the popup window once you login, then the various banners that mention the preseason update.\r\n\r\nI know California Cannatonic was legalized just yesterday, but come the fuck on.
