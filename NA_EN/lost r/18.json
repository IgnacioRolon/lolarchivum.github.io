{"poster":"Lost R","date":"2016-08-22T02:03:23.121+0000","title":"The issues with Yorick and why he's getting reworked.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":37,"down_votes":4,"body":"There&#039;s no argument that Yorick needs a rework, but like every champion that came before him, from Sion to Poppy to Ryze, there are always going to be critics behind changing his mechanics. There are ALWAYS sincere naysayers, even if you had a champion that just made a different obnoxious squeaky noise globally on each skill.\n\nSo what&#039;s up with Yorick? Yeah, he sucks. Yeah, he looks like ass. Yeah, he&#039;s never played or banned (by anyone except me). But then you have the fanatics who won&#039;t shut up about how awesome he is and how everyone else just doesn&#039;t get how he&#039;s supposed to work and at least one who will inevitably lament his relaunch with threats of suicide. \n\nBut why, specifically, is Yorick twelve different grades of ass? It&#039;s easy enough to just say &quot;This champion sucks&quot; and expect everyone to agree with you, but if you are a game designer, you have to pin down a champion&#039;s core identity, figure out what&#039;s wrong about them and then decide where you want to go from there. If you don&#039;t do this, among many other things, you risk repeating the same mistakes.\n\n\n----\n\n\nOut of all the champions that have been reworked thus far, I think Yorick&#039;s core identity is the hardest to pin down. Poppy was the frontline Yordle with a hammer, shield and heavy armor (by Yordle standards) known for shoving around enemies like a schoolyard bully and being too stubborn to die. Sion was an undead guy with an axe who refused to die. Ryze was a salty frontline mage with an emphasis on spell combos. These elements, while different in their relaunches, are similar enough to their old incarnations that they feel like the same character, just made better.\n\nSo what is Yorick&#039;s core identity? Well, he&#039;s a gravedigger. He&#039;s undead. He&#039;s got a shovel, and he summons minions. That uhh.... isn&#039;t much to go on. Even more confusingly, despite building attack damage, Yorick&#039;s kit doesn&#039;t emphasize his own involvement in the fighting. Yeah, he can basic attack, but his ghouls do most of the fighting. His kit says mage like Azir, but his ratios mostly say brawler (with one ghoul mechanically identical to the others being AP for no reason). His ghouls also look so similar to one another that in the heat of battle, it&#039;s impossible to tell which ghoul is which and why you should care about that specific one. His ult, while the most interesting part of him, also scales off of AD and can be dreadfully underwhelming in many circumstances compared to Zilean&#039;s ult, which, despite being full of cheesy bullshit is functionally superior. All that aside, his ghouls are very unrewarding to fight against. Their hitbox is unbelievably small, difficult to hit, they usually died before you could make the killing blow, and up until a relatively recent patch, you didn&#039;t even get rewarded for killing them.\n\nWhat does this mean for future Yorick? It&#039;d be fine enough to make him a minionmancer like Azir, focusing on one type of minion and using the rest of his kit to command them around, but we already have that with Azir. We also have Elise, and Malzahar, and even Heimerdinger, whom their minions feel less of a core identity and more of just one part of their kit and overall menace (not to mention they are much easier and satisfying to hit). More than likely this will remain with Yorick with his relaunch, but Riot will have to show something really creative to make him stand out from the others who took his job.\n\n---\n\nNext up is his story, which has to be hands down the absolute worst story in all of League history. If you haven&#039;t read it, you aren&#039;t missing much. In short, Yorick was a gravedigger in a family line of gravediggers on the Shadow Isles who died before he could have children, and now is cursed to continue his family trade in undeath. He&#039;s basically a boring zombie or ghoul even by zombieghoul standards. It&#039;s a far cry from other &quot;normal&quot; characters like Braum, who despite being a humble goat herder is portrayed as a folk hero who once punched through a mountain and fought off an avalanche to save a troll child.\n\nGiven that Yorick is still a gravedigger, identified by his shovel in the social media teaser, I don&#039;t imagine his backstory will change all THAT much, but no doubt he will be made more interesting. He deserves it, hanging around dead things long before the region went to hell and EVERYTHING died and undied (not always in that order). He might have some ancestral gift, either before or after the Isle transformation, possibly even being a necromancer. We don&#039;t really have one of those at the moment (Borom Darkwill doesn&#039;t count; he&#039;s not a playable champion).\n\n---\n\nFinally, his appearance.\n\nhttp://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/d/d3/Yorick_OriginalSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110623115350\n\nIt&#039;s a face not even a mother could bring herself to love.\n\nThere&#039;s a lot to say about the old art. Everything looks insanely cartoony and overstylized, which even by the standards of way back when is pretty abysmal. Keep in mind that Orianna and Vayne came right before him, with Leona and Wukong right after. His face is mostly ashen, and unlike Nocturne, he doesn&#039;t even have the excuse of being a living shadow. His shovel looks all kinds of fucked up, and not even in the damaged way; more like someone wanted to overdesign it and never knew when to stop. His hair looks like a combination of moss and leather. His anatomy is all kinds of fucked up (even Dampe from Zelda looks better than him!), and he&#039;s got patches even where patches shouldn&#039;t be. Where do the clothes begin and where do they end? Is he naked? Do we need to censor this picture?\n\n~~Now don&#039;t take this the wrong way, whoever designed him. I&#039;m sure you&#039;re a much better artist now, but honestly, what were you thinking back then? Did you lose a bet?~~\n\nI have no idea what New Yorick will look like, but I have endless faith in Riot. Ever since they started the Visual Update and relaunch shtick, they&#039;ve never failed to disappoint. No doubt he will look awesome. If a prison warden can transform into this\n\nhttp://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/f/f3/Thresh_OriginalSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160522024023\n\na tree transforms into this\n\nhttp://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/0/02/Maokai_OriginalSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160520004142\n\nand whatever the hell Evelynn is supposed to be transforms into this\n\nhttp://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/a/a2/Evelynn_OriginalSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160413184544\n\nA gravedigger on the Shadow Isles must look pretty bitchin&#039;. His shovel alone looks really cool. An impossibly cool appearance must be part of the benefits in the Shadow Isles.\n\nSo in conclusion, Yorick is even more of a wild card to predict than previous champions that went under the knife. He was never a distinctive champion to begin with, he looked fuck ugly, and his playstyle was all over the shop. With only a handful of champions left that I haven&#039;t unlocked, I might be forced to unlock him before the others rather than dead last, now that his relaunch has been announced.\n\n---\n\nA day after I post this thread, Riot teased us with a preview gif of Yorick.\n\nhttps://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zqyFktEODhM/V7tB6dDYeII/AAAAAAAA9wI/lyAtWawvmMUErv-IuP8TH8B9IwoTei0qACLcB/s400/giphy.gif\n\nNow THIS is what I like to see!\n\nOkay, so Yorick's theme largely remained the same; it just looks infinitely better than his previous artwork. He's a pale blue, fitting in with the Shadow Isle aesthetic and the asian color theme for undead characters, so it's plenty safe to say that he's undead or in whatever way affected by the curse of the Shadow Isles. \n\nHe's got a MASSIVE build; Yorick's old art had him rather bulky-looking, and while I doubt he's as large as Sion or Braum, he definitely looks like he lifts (and doesn't skip leg day). It stands to reason; digging is grueling exercise, and a career of gravedigging will build you up right quick.\n\nHis face is hidden only partially under the hood now (for those who said his old ashen face was just shadow, you don't know how shadows work), his eyes glow blue rather than yellow (keeping in with the whole Shadow Isles color theme), and he's got a very cool beard.\n\nThere's something odd on his back. I can't tell what it is from this angle, but whatever it is, it's generating a black mist like a cape behind him. It probably means something, like some metaphorical and literal burden he has to carry like Ryze's scroll. He also has a pendant. I will guess it's not an ordinary pendant. It shines right out at you. Perhaps it's the source of his power? Perhaps its a phylactery, and if so, whose is it?\n\nHis shovel is also huge. I have two shovels and they are nothing near this size. I'm going to guess he's at least six feet tall, the shovel is taller than he is, and the general aesthetic around it and how he wields it makes it seem more like a staff. Based on how it glows at the very end and its general appearance basically confirms that the shovel is not mundane. It probably has powers over the dead that you bury with it, which would all but confirm Yorick's new status as a necromancer.\n\nFinally, he has minions still, backing up his status as a close range mage or magelike; possibly an AP brawler like Gragas. They all appear to be the same type of ghoul, physical ones over ethereal, and they better fit the theme of League. They are still twisted abominations, far from being human; closer to imps than people. They also run very fast. I counted four of them, and it's likely his maximum is four (probably maxes out automatically when he ults or something).\n\nGreat, now the rest of the week will be spent watching the Riot news feed waiting for Yorick updates. You have officially intrigued me about Yorick, Riot, and those are words that are baffling to say in that order.\n\nBy the way, there's a dead Thresh in the background. This was probably ripped from their champion spotlight video, and dead Thresh also implies that he and Yorick don't see eye to eye, likely regarding to the dead and their souls. If that's the case, then Yorick's story and motives likely revolve around trying to bring order to the mortal chaos in the Shadow Isles and at the very least putting souls to rest, as opposed to Thresh who revels in the torment and seeks to torture souls forever. Possibly the closest thing to a good guy the Shadow Isles has.","replies":[{"poster":"Wyrmblade","date":"2016-08-22T03:32:26.064+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe evelynn could be described as a \"spooky strumpet\"","replies":[{"poster":"Lost R","date":"2016-08-22T03:44:17.544+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"A creepy concubine?\n\nNo, she's closer to a scary succubus.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-08-22T11:47:47.041+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Demonic Dominatrix?","replies":[{"poster":"Leonerdo","date":"2016-08-22T16:53:15.417+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shadowy Seductress?\n\nApparently Evelynn belongs in Fallen London (obscure reference, don't worry about it)","replies":[{"poster":"Shrek Luigi","date":"2016-08-22T20:29:53.898+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sneaky Snoopster!!! ^---^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Argomecha Perdix","date":"2016-08-22T23:06:50.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Leonerdo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=y0y43ckv,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-22T16:53:15.417+0000)\n>\n> Shadowy Seductress?\n> \n> Apparently Evelynn belongs in Fallen London (obscure reference, don&#x27;t worry about it)\n\nNah, she looks like she is at home at the Iron Republic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lost R","date":"2016-08-23T04:15:35.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A horrific harlot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2016-08-22T23:06:35.640+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer an adorable assassin. \nhttp://img12.deviantart.net/6d2f/i/2014/094/e/c/evelynn_and_poro___cm_ryutuisen_by_xano501-d7cazog.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2016-08-22T03:33:51.648+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"You wanna know Yorick's biggest flaw?\n\nHe's false advertising since Day 1.

It was a lot to wish for but I almost thought Riot had cracked the code on minion AI. We'd get a sick-nasty micro intensive complex character. Hell even if he wasn't super complex we might at least get a champion who has some micro or cool things he can do with minions. Fast forward to release. The HELL happened?\n\nOn top of having a bland kit, the ghouls were just addons. Here's a fun experiment: Remove the ghouls from Yorick's kit....what do you lose? Sure, he needs a new passive, but otherwise he's just about the same as before. The ghouls are literally just an addon with zero thought to them. You can remove them and there is next-to-nothing that Yorick loses besides some jungle cheese. It's disgusting, especially for someone we were told would be -the- minion controller champion.\n\nYorick's look isn't bad. In fact I like it. It makes him stand out as the apathetic \"I'm just doing my job\" zombie of the shadow isles. I like his lore. I like his character. I like the idea of a gravedigger employing a cavalcade of minions to help him dig graves. But the fact that Yorick was billed as a minion controller and never given the tools or kit to reflect minion control has always left a sour taste in my mouth.","replies":[{"poster":"morris1","date":"2016-08-22T18:08:45.940+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CaptainMårvelous,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=y0y43ckv,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2016-08-22T03:33:51.648+0000)\n>\n> On top of having a bland kit, the ghouls were just addons.

Prior to being abandoned from a balance standpoint, Yorick had a very cool identity as a mixed-damage lane bully with all the sustain, poke and disengage tools he needed to come ahead in lane, while having the tradeoff of a low sphere-of-influence and overall damage-output later into the game that reduced his role to that of a watered-down (but still functional) bodyguard.\n\nThe inherent issue with champions like Yorick is that a huge portion of their power-budget goes toward a safer game, be it mindless effective bullying or bottomless sustain, which effectively puts a consistent cap on how influential they can be in a match. When this happens, there are two outcomes--either the champion needs to be reigned in balance-wise to the point where they are overshadowed by less-safe but more rewarding champions, or they are affected by balance changes in a way that causes their combination of sustain and harass to spiral into uncontrollable snowbally top-tier filth and they become The Best Champ For That Role. Both of these things have happened to Yorick on numerous occasions, although mostly the former, as seasons have passed, and Riot is finally dropping the hamm....the shovel.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sylvant","date":"2016-08-23T10:11:24.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like Yorick and i dont understand why is he considered bad champ, whenever i played him, i always found it super easy and fun.

I just said he has some pretty major falloff. \nPoppy, taric, and sion needed changes desperately. Sona did as well, but making her a slave to the ADC wasnt the right choice. Malzahar didnt need a rework, just a new W and passive (Pre-rework voidlings on an ability with a per-level cap? frag yeah. woulda been great.) But yorick isnt as boring as you think he is, hes not as flat, hes just subtle in what he does and how he does it. Hes simple, and for a lot of people, that simplicity is very fun to PLAY. You cant exactly pull the \"not fun to play against\" card when we have things like zed, yasuo, LB, azir, and caitlyn being extremely popular.\n\nPeople who like, say, zed or sejauni or nautilus will not like yorick because of that reason. Yorick is very quiet. \nthe rework needs to change a lot of things, i just hope the things that are changed are what actually NEEDS to be changed. Failed reworks like ryze, soraka, cass, and malzahar all come to mind.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-08-22T15:23:34.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still waiting for a champion that is ACTUALLY two units.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-08-22T12:52:02.181+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is even more \"ass\" in the Gameplay department when it comes to Yorick as well. Not only does his kit have little overall direction and synergy with itself, but it also somehow ends up being both potentially game breaking if not balanced the way it currently is.\nFirst up, we have the \"on surface\" issue, being Yorick's sustain. His E is an extremely poorly designed ability. It gives him a huge amount of instant healing for a target of any kind simply being in range, and then gives him even more healing, which ends up being a ton against champions, through the ghoul's attacks. As mentioned, ghouls are terrible units to target and kill, so they usually just end up living their full duration. This just makes Yorick incredibly annoying to lane against because you essentially either out damage his E healing (which is harder than it sounds) or flat out lose the lane. It's that simple.\nSecondly, his minions themselves (the current form of them). Now, anyone who has been here for a LONG TIME will have seen at least one of these guys lurking the Rift. I'm talking about Jungle Yorick. Yes, that's a thing and, secretly, it's the most limiting factor of his current kit. If his cool downs were any shorter or his ghouls lasted for any longer, he could very effectively solo Epic Monsters at nearly all stages of the game. Currently, at Level 3, if Yorick has Blue Buff, he can solo Dragon. At Level 5, if the Rift Herald's back hitbox cooperates and properly gives you the % health true damage for hitting his back (seriously this needs a fix) and Yorick had Blue Buff, he can solo Rift Herald. Once Yorick is nearing full build and has Blue Buff, he can vary narrowly solo Baron Nashor. If Yorick's ghoul durations or cool downs were buffed in any way, he could probably solo Baron Nashor with as little as 2-3 items. It's ridiculous.\nFinally, his ultimate itself. You mentioned the cheese, but I will highlight it. If Yorick has a Vayne, Teemo, Jax, or anyone who builds Muramana or on-hit effects on his team, his ultimate's effectiveness is increased infinitely. The clone has the targeted ally's items and will apply all passive effects the target has. This ultimate in and of itself I am willing to bet has limited design space a ton in on-hit items and just makes playing on-hit characters with Yorick almost mandatory.\nTo top it all off, Yorick's current kit is pretty braindead. Other than directing the ultimate clone, Yorick essentially just spams spells when they come up and wins.
