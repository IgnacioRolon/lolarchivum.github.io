Above anything else, I&#039;m really good at pattern recognition. Names can hold tremendous meaning, especially in fictional works. League is no exception.\r\n\r\nSo the entity formerly known as Ao Shin that Riot teased us with back in 2013 has been announced to at last ~~maybe~~ **finally** be released in this half of the year... under the name Aurelion Sol. Does this mean the Ao Shin we knew once is dead? No. This is the evolution of ideas and drafts. i know this personally being both a writer and an artist that from meetings to the cutting room and production floors, so many things can be changed about anything in any given work. Remember that Illaoi was originally a squat, old woman and Braum once wore armor. Riot and League of Legends in general is an interesting case study on the evolution on ideas. Since it&#039;s constantly being updated and its voice and image slowly shaped over time, we can see in real time the ideas being reworked and old story elements being retconned in favor of ideas more concrete and better shaped... with varying degrees of quality and accuracy, but I digress.\r\n\r\nSo what kind of name is Aurelion Sol? First, we&#039;ll discuss what kind of name Ao Shin is. Ao is a Japanese word for color somewhere between the blue and green spectrum. It&#039;s also associated with youth. Shin has a variety of meanings, depending on how you write it in Kanji, with a synonymous thread between most of them. It has associations like &quot;new&quot;, &quot;progress&quot;, &quot;true&quot;, &quot;humility&quot;. So Ao Shin&#039;s name can have such meanings like &quot;New Blue&quot;, &quot;Young Progress&quot;, or &quot;New Humility&quot;, and these various names give insight into the kind of character he might have initially been portrayed as behind closed doors. The name Ao was also fitting because sky blue was a primary color on him, and the sketches showed him interacting with wind, painting him as a Janna-like champion who had mastery over the element of air. On top of all this, his name was Japanese, associating him with Ionia, the Asia surrogate in this game.\r\n\r\nAurelion Sol is Latin. Aurelion is an alternate spelling of Aurelian, which is an ancient term for interest in butterflies. Its name is associated with chrysalis and the golden color that it changes to before it hatches and the butterfly emerges. Aurelian&#039;s name is also derived from the Latin word for gold, Aurum (Au is the periodic symbol for gold). Once again we see an association with the sky (butterflies) and progress (chrysalis), still reflecting the undertones behind Ao Shin&#039;s name.\r\n\r\nSol is the Latin name for the sun. It&#039;s as simple as that, but the meaning can have so many interpretations. The sun is literally the single most important thing in the universe to us. We could not be here without the energy and light from the sun. Almost every religion on the planet was born as a result of this subconscious acknowledgement of the dependency on the sun; even the Judeo-Christian religions are derivatives of sun worship. The sun is also commonly associated with the elements of light and fire, being a giant ball of plasma and nuclear fusions that provide heat and light. Finally, it&#039;s also associated with the cosmos; the sun is just one of basically infinite out there. Whenever you look up into the sky at night (granted you live in an area with little smog and light pollution and can actually see them), all those stars up there are another sun in our galaxy. They&#039;re everywhere. From a mythological and religious standpoint, the cosmos is the outer realms of reality, where greater gods dwell and what mortal minds were not meant to comprehend. You can call it Heaven or Asgard or Olympus, but the meaning remains the same.\r\n\r\nNow combine this association with the Bard trailer from a year ago. Giving Riot the benefit of the doubt and hoping and assuming that they weren&#039;t playing us like a ~~piano~~ ~~two dollar banjo~~ **GODDAMN _FIDDLE!_**, the egg object that Bard stole/took/recovered/protected from the Ionians and Noxus was claimed by Riot to be Ao Shin&#039;s egg. Bard technically has no association or affiliation in Runeterra. He&#039;s an extraplanar entity who appears to restore balance where it&#039;s needed. His story in the preview leading up to that was told from the perspective of stargazers on (presumably) Mt. Targon. For all intents and purposes, he&#039;s of a cosmic affiliation; something outside mortal understanding, and this is further emphasized by his voicelessness, his faceless, inhuman mask, glowing eyes and mouth, alien designs on his flute(?) and clothing, and inflated, disproportionate limbs. Even calling him a him from a masculine sense is misleading.\r\n\r\nAo Shin&#039;s supposed egg was also cosmic in its appearance; it literally looked like a reflection of space. This proposes that Ao Shin, now Aurelion Sol, is also cosmic in origin like Bard, perhaps even directly associated with him because of the events in the Bard trailer. Because of his name of Aurelion, he could also still be associated with the sky and therefore wind. Sol associates him with fire and light. His Latin name (meaning almost literally Golden Sun or Solar Butterfly) and their association with the sun could make him affiliated with Mt. Targon or even Shurima, as they both worship the sun and have a lot of solar iconography, and the Latin language originates from the area around Italy, which presides just northwest of the Middle East, similar in Targon&#039;s geographical relationship to Shurima.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean for his supposed abilities? It probably means he&#039;ll either have phenomenal cosmic powers or he&#039;ll control the forces of wind and/or fire or some combination of both. It could even be solar wind (though THAT would be truly bizarre). He&#039;s definitely a mage and likely a support. Whatever the case may be, understanding the origins of his names gives new insight into what he might possibly be once he&#039;s finally released, and definitely made me more interested in him than when I was when I woke up this morning.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-02-22T02:07:08.946+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not on the Narrative Team, so this isn't a trap in any way - I'm honestly curious.  Where was it said that the egg in the Bard video was Ao Shin?\n\nI know that [Jaredan called it an egg in the Q&A](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Ev3qQR4G-bard-qa-completed?comment=015b0000), but if you have a link to where it was stated that it was Ao Shin's egg, that'd be great.  I know it was definitely a super popular theory at the time.\n\nFor reference, this is the mention of the egg from Sharjo's awesome \"[What we learned this year: TL;DR Lore 2015](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/UzrAym3Y-what-we-learned-this-year-tldr-lore-2015)\" thread:\n\n> Bard's current identity as \"Bard\" comes from the Bards; a society of Ionians who lived on a trio of mountains. They had some deal with Bard in the past that involved keeping a trio of magical altars and a celestial egg of sorts safe. In return they received some magical benefit from the objects in question. Bard's deal with them came to an end when Noxians tried to claim the egg and attacks the Bards, which forced them to use the Egg for destructive purposes. Bard sensed this, swept in and took not only the egg but the three altars to a place beyond Runeterra for safe keeping. This was maybe about four decades ago now and was the last record of Bard appearing in Runeterra.\n\nTo reiterate - I'm not trying to trap anyone here.  I'm honestly just a curious lore fan who is wondering if she missed some info, or if you're operating on popular speculation.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-02-22T16:59:21.629+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was everywhere, EVERYWHERE, and I don't recall anyone from Narrative ever mentioning that the egg had any connection to Ao Shin at all, only that the artifact was described as an egg.\n\nIf I missed that I'll cry, but I've stalked Jaredan's entire post history several times now and the post history of other folks like FauxShizzle and WAAARGHbobo to glean even the tiniest details, and I don't recall any mention of Ao Shin in relation to this weird celestial egg of weirdness.","replies":[{"poster":"Mimaropa","date":"2016-02-22T17:40:00.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sharjo missed a bit of Lore?\n\n\nShocking indeed","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-02-22T18:03:18.587+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt he missed it because I can't recall anything like that either and I pretty much read everything about the lore as well...","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-02-22T18:23:55.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wouldn't make much sense anyway considering the egg from Bard: Mountain was seemingly celestial in nature like Bard himself, where as Ao Shin was always portrayed as a storm dragon and a protector of the natural world.

Why else would Bard take it outside of mortal existence where people can't mess with it? But the curious part is what Jeredan said.

This is based on some clam shells and bones forming the images of the Azure Dragon and the White Tiger that were found in a tomb in Henan. In addition, it is claimed that one of the artefacts from the tomb of the Marquis Yi of Zeng (c. 433 B.C.) is a lacquer-painted wardrobe with the patterns of the Four Symbols and 28 Mansions.\nThe Azure Dragon is the mythological creature in the East, as it is said that when the seven mansions in that area (Horn, Neck, Root, Room, Heart, Tail, and Winnowing Basket) are joined up, they form the shape of a dragon. The Azure Dragon corresponds to the season of spring. As the dragon is considered by the Chinese as the noblest of animals, it is the head of the Four Symbols. Although Chinese dragons are commonly associated with water, the Azure Dragon is the exception, as its element is wood. In Chinese mythology, the dragon is regarded as a fearsome and mighty creature. Yet, unlike their Western counterparts, Chinese dragons are believed to be just, benevolent, and bringers of wealth and good fortune.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Heaven Dynasty","date":"2016-04-05T15:36:25.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since when did ao shin became a Japanese thing?
