I have a bit of a problem. Whenever I enter a ranked/draft pick queue I sometimes lose connection. This makes me dodge and lose lp. Does anyone know why this happens? My internet is fine. I can google, surf the web, while having connection problems only to lol. Any fixes? Any help is appreciated. \r\n\r\nAlso P.S. I moved into a new house. Before then connection to lol was fine, now it has been terrible.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-09T20:22:44.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vouching for Kayle's information!  Your network has an unstable connection trying to reach our servers, and the Connection Troubleshoot article may help find a fix for good.

You said your internet is fine, but there may be some underlying issues in which a stable connection is unable to be established to league resulting in time outs and eventually a loss of connection. Such a stable connection is not required for things such as google or general web surfing, so I recommend checking out the [troubleshooting connection issues KB](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). This suspicion is reinforced by the fact that you say your connection to league is worse after moving. Typically when troubleshooting the first things you want to look at are any recent changes and in this case it appears it would be your internet. \nSome more obvious hints that you're having a connection issue would be an increased/spiking ping, getting a \"firewall error\" message, or \"disconnected from PVP.net\" error message.\nI recommend trying the solutions listed in the KB article before we dive deeper into this! \nRegards, Kayle {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
