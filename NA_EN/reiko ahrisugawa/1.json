We also have a workaround in a [pinned thread](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/Tb1fUZFV-known-issue-were-unable-to-log-you-in-because-you-may-be-offline), but since you are on a mac it might be different.  Let me know if these steps help:\n\n1) Start and log onto League of Legends\n2) Open Finder\n3) Go to Applications\n4) Right-click on League of Legends\n5) Select Show Package Contents\n6) Open Contents\n7) Open LoL\n8) Open Config\n9) Locate LeagueClientSettings.yaml\n10) Open it with a text editor and and find gameflow-patcher-lock\n11)  Delete the whole line\n12) Save file and restart the client\n\nWhile wi-fi might cause lag issues sometimes, this one is on us.  I know this has been frustrating and it sucks that you lost LP as a result.  While I can't restore that, I hope those steps can help in the meantime.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterFlame","date":"2017-06-15T02:20:48.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was in a game then it crashed.
