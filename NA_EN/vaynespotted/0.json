Im getting better at the game. I know i am. Every day im learning something new. But in an effort to truly embrace how good I've gotten at the game, i have decided to only play 10 champions.  2 per role. I know that it might sound absolutely stupid to not know every champion, but this is something that i want to do. So, here are the champions in the roles that i have decided.\r\n\r\nTop: Riven, Garen\r\nJungle: Rengar, Vi\r\nMid: Leblac, Yasuo\r\nADC: Vayne, Twitch/Kalista/Tristana/Draven (Havent decided on the other one yet. Probably Draven.)\r\nSupport: Nautilus, Thresh\r\n\r\nSo give me your thoughts and suggestions. I'm wide open to suggestions and trying out things.  DON'T HESITATE.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ThEntropist","date":"2015-11-10T22:37:39.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi There! \n\nThis is actually how I worked on climbing as well. I wouldn't lock yourself down to only 2 champions, especially if you find others fun, but it is definitely good to master a few before taking them into ranked. My only suggestion would be to make sure that you have an AP/AD in each role that way you can fill out a team comp a little better. \n\nOther than that play what you wanna play and if you have mastered the champions you will climb. Good luck in your climb.","replies":[]}]}
