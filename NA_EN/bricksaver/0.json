Then I came to college. The internet here is supposed to be even faster than the internet I used to have. Everything runs perfectly fine except league. \r\n\r\nThe instant I open league, everything on my computer slows down: my typing, my mouse movements, everything.\r\n\r\nI've run scans for viruses multiple times and everything seems fine. My computer's not running anything else and the storage space is only 9% full! I've also redownloaded league twice. At this point, I'm not sure what is causing this issue. Please help!\r\n\r\nP.S. I'm the only person in my dorm experiencing this problem with league so it's probably something with my computer","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T22:58:45.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There could be some hardware or driver problems causing this to happen.
