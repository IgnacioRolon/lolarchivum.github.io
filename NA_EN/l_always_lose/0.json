Took forever to install and when it was done I thought I would play a marvelous game of league filled with cis toxic trash. So I went on facebook and announced my status that I was in a league game. But to my shock I got a recent message! It was from computer and it said \"no\". To my surprise my computer when full potato and I couldn't do anything. So I hard-rebooted it and everything was back to normal.\n\n\nTL;DR:Whenever I get into a league game my computer freezes because of a windows 10 update.\n\nSOLVED: I downgraded windows from the windows 10 anniversary update and it worked like a charm.
