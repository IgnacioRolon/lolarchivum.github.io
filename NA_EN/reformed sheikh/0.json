What day of the week do we receive new Worlds Missions?\r\n\r\nThe missions I have completed are: \r\n\r\n*  _Welcome To Worlds_\r\n*  _Skill - Quick To Win_\r\n* _Teamwork - Objective Control_\r\n* _Fight For Glory_\r\n* _(Master Pass) Courage - Knock 'em Down_\r\n* _(Master Pass) Resilience - Set 'em Up_\r\n\r\nAs of right now the only Worlds Mission that is standing is _\"A Real Challenger\"_, which requires you to complete 4 Worlds Missions.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-28T01:18:18.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"At first, it seemed like we would all be getting the second set of missions in the second week, but at this point, it's looking like they might not pop up until next week.

Are they planning to give us the extra week and a half to complete these missions (not that it should be a problem for people like me who play faithfully every day anyway, but for those who do not...)?  A lot of us who bought the pass are already feeling a bit scammed for our money, not to mention how many people were upset with the results from buying the dungeon pass for the arcade event strictly for the icon simply to have it changed anyway... but even aside from that people are beginning to question the missions and whether or not having these passes available to purchase gives the game  a pay to play feeling. This delay in mission updates without any official statements from Riot is... disappointing, to say the least. \n\nPlease tell us there will be SOMETHING extra, whether it be extra time to complete the missions or a bonus orb or even a key fragment, for those of us who bought the passes?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-28T20:03:08.830+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"There hasn't been a delay in the missions releasing, it's just we didn't have the exact dates until now. They'll be releasing on Oct 2, and it just looks like the first set was up for 2 weeks while the next ones will be weekly. Not 100% sure why this event had a little gap between the missions tbh. \n\nPorocles and I do our best to provide you guys with all of the info you need as soon as we can, but sometimes we just don't have any more information than you guys do =\\","replies":[{"poster":"Avarosan Ashe","date":"2017-09-28T21:09:22.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"My apologies, by delay I had meant the gap between the initial release on the 21st to what next is supposed to be the 2nd of October. I had assumed they would still only release the few missions and not release everything that should be to date (assuming that they go past the 2nd, anyway). Thank you for clarifying though - I'm still hoping for some sort of official statement to let players know. I'd be happy even with a \"Hey guys, we dunno when it's coming back, but it will!\" On the front page, instead of having to sift through various board posts about it. \n\nThat's just preference though, I'm blunt and up front and have a tendency to expect others to be as well. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-28T22:35:00.785+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://img35.laughinggif.com/pic/HTTPS9tMC5qb2UuY28udWsvd3AtY29udGVudC91cGxvYWRzLzIwMTYvMTAvMjgxMTAwMjQvc2FtZS5naWYlog.gif","replies":[{"poster":"TwîsT","date":"2017-10-02T08:29:01.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oct 2. 7.07pm CEST.
