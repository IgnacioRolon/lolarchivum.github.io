Normally as a top laner I didn't have much impact beyond teleport ganks, but jungle lets you enjoy the rest of the map as well. However something has been happening recently that I just don&#039;t understand on a personal basis. Why do people feel the need to invade.\n\nI&#039;m not saying I don&#039;t get the idea, go in steal their stuff and possibly kill them, but that concept is very..wrong to me. I was raised on sportsmanship and the idea that the greatest enjoyment is beating someone who&#039;s just as good as you. I played soccer and baseball for years and practiced in martial arts for years, this concept was something I always clicked with. Add to that that I want everyone to have fun, and for the 3 or so years of league I still don't understand invaders and the idea of putting someone on tilt as an actual tactic. If it were real life I&#039;d understand, but because this is a GAME primarily this tactic of intentionally being a scumbag (or appearing as such) confounds me.\n\nI&#039;ll admit that I have often died to these tactics, and indeed get quite angry with these people enough that I&#039;m not lying when I say the moment someone does it, I hate them. I can&#039;t even come to grips with this idea being valid because to me it seems like such an enormous last resort that results in a hollow victory without substance. When I know someone didn&#039;t have fun it&#039;s saddening, when I know someone's intent is to not let someone have fun it&#039;s infuriating. If my own team acts this way I dislike them just as much in fact. \n\nI know it wouldn&#039;t work at all, but some way to prevent people from being so unnecessarily mean to opponents would be something to strive for, I&#039;d much rather lose to a more skilled player when we&#039;re at out best, then lose because I or one of my teammates wasn&#039;t allowed to enjoy themselves. \n\nTLDR: I don&#039;t get why invaders feel the need to not let everyone have a fun game, or what they even get out of it because a win thats hollow isn&#039;t satisfying at all.","replies":[]}
