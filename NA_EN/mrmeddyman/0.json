They believed her.&quot;\n\n{{champion:44}}  &quot;That bow is of the stars, as is its mistress.&quot;\n\nSo we know Ashe lied about finding the bow at the Avarosas&#039; cairn from Swains&#039; secret knowing demon. Her story of being chased by bandits into a random clearing where she magically finds the burial site of one of the most revered heroes of the Freljord that she just happens to be a descendant of is baloney.\n\nBut Taric tells us more &quot;That bow is of the stars&quot; he&#039;s talking about Targon? (I&#039;m certain the &#039;as it&#039;s mistress&#039; part is just him macking on Ashe)The enemy of Targon is the Void but there still is no connection to the Freljord there. Until you remember that the Watchers are the masters of the Void. They want Ashe on their side so they can take the fight to Targon after she unites the Freljord perhaps? Thus they promised her power in return for her loyalty. Maybe they want to create more &quot;Iceborn&quot; (to me this means nothing more than Void-infected northerners, basically the Freljordian version of Shurimas&#039; Ascended or Mount Targons&#039; Aspects but champions that represent the Void) but the Watchers think Ashe would be more useful than {{champion:127}}, as despite her continued loyalty she has already failed to protect them once before and maybe they have lost all confidence in her (which is tragic considering that her only motivation is to bring the Watchers back as she was the only one appreciated their &quot;gifts&quot; where Avarosa and Serylda didn&#039;t).\n\n{{champion:223}} s&#039; quotes reveal more. For those who don&#039;t know Kench has Ally and Enemy voice lines for most of the champs he interacts with. In the Ally voice lines he tells them what they want to hear so that they will take his deal and probably get consumed once they trust him and his honeyed wordsif they are on the enemy team he doesn&#039;t waste words and instead chides them knowing he can&#039;t manipulate them into becoming his dinner.\n\nAlly: &quot;If you wanna&#039; build an empire of peace, then your mortar will be blood.&quot; This might reflect Ashe&#039;s mindset. Her mother was killed by the constant warring in the Freljord so it&#039;s natural that she hates the neverending strife between tribes. She knows she can&#039;t undo it in one life time which is why she turned to Watchers for help who gave her the bow that would inspire people to follow her (Ashe isn&#039;t a natural leader her short bio reads &quot;Stoic, intelligent, and idealistic, yet uncomfortable with her role as leader&quot;) in return for a united Freljordian army who could be turned into a 2nd generation of Iceborn slaves. Tahm is trying to appeal to her rationale to get closer to her.\n\nEnemy: &quot;Girl, you got as much &#039;foresight&#039; as a blindfolded mole.&quot;, outside of the context of my theory this quote doesn&#039;t make any sense. Like I said Kench tells his teammates what they want to hear and his enemies the cold truth.\n\nEnemy {{champion:114}} &quot;A duel is a fight between two imbeciles... and you are the greatest.&quot;\nEnemy {{champion:32}} &quot;I say, you&#039;re as &#039;fun&#039; as a leaky roof.&quot;\nEnemy {{champion:41}} &quot;Your attempt to be monstrous is as successful as your dictatorship.&quot;\n\nSo why is he bringing up Ashes&#039; &quot;foresight&quot;? She isn&#039;t really known for having a flaw that comes from lacking foresight. Unless you consider the possibility that she is LYING to her people and Tahm Kench is insinuating that this lie will come back to bite her one day.\n\nThis puts everything into focus: her marriage to {{champion:23}} despite him being the epitomy of everything she resents a brutish warrior that prides himself on being able to kill anyone ({{champion:266}} notwithstanding ofc) She bit the bullet and married him anyway to reach her goal of uniting the Freljord despite the fact that she probably despises Trynd.\n\nSo many questions. How is {{champion:201}} involved if the popular theory of him being a Watcher/Iceborn in disguise are true. Did he lead her to the bow? Serve as an inbetween for the Watchers? Their emissary?\n\nGuess we may find out more when {{champion:20}} drops and we get more lore on the subject.\n\nI really like the implications of this wrinkle. Before Ashe was the shining hero that completely invalidated {{champion:113}} and {{champion:127}} claims. Now I&#039;m not so sure.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-07-05T01:38:33.383+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"No... but also Yes.   \n\n You’ve looked at a lot of clues and realized they are clues, moving towards and revealing something....

Just mentioning the Watchers, then Tahm Kench and Swain’s vague impugnments, and asking “Is she _really_ a hero?” is idle speculation at best and character assassination at worst.\n\nFurthermore:\n\n1) Tahm Kench is an evil, manipulative champion who thrives on corruption and misery.  He is not a psychologist dispensing useful information to allies and tough love to enemies.  Instead, Tahm tempts his allies with their darkest desires and his enemies with vicious insults, in both cases trying to overturn their psyches.  He is anything but a reliable source of information about champions.\n\n2) Swain is arrogant, cynical, and vague.  Everything he says about other champions is negative, accusatory, and vague.  He is, again, not a reliable source of information about champions.  And furthermore, he never says that Ashe deceived her people; even were her bow not found at the Frost Queen’s Grave, she might have believed her own “claim”.\n\n3) Arguing that someone is ideal and pure and no-one even insinuates anything wrong about, then proceeding to find some insinuations from whatever source, does not make those suggestions believable, much less prove that the character must therefore be the _opposite_.  You’re grasping at straws.\n\n4) The story of the Three Queens has been repeated throughout the Freljordian lore.  One of them, Avarosa, has always acted like Ashe; another like Sejuani; the third, Lissandra.  If those stories mean anything, then Ashe is the Avarosa of her time, not just a second Void follower.\n\nAshe is peacefully uniting and rebuilding the Freljord.  She has ended her people’s feuds, brought the Barbarians to her side, and even made peace with Lissandra. The Avarosans breathe easy and free, logging and farming the rich southern land, while Sejuani and Lissandra’s followers raid and freeze respectively.  There are no strange sigils on her flag or bizarre rituals in her culture.\n\nWhy would you believe the flirtations of a notorious womanizer and accusations of two demons over what you can see with your own two eyes?

OP's theory is far from proven, but it IS consistent with the few clues he picked up, and those clues can't be explained by *just* the public story about Ashe.\n\nMaybe she's not following the Watchers, maybe it's something else entirely, maybe she doesn't actively deceive her people and does believe her claims herself. But something is clear, it's that we don't know the full truth yet and there are secrets to dig out. No harm in making hypothesis, even if those hypothesis turn out to be wrong later, it's still fun.\n\nWhat I consider reasonably certain for now is that Ashe's bow isn't what it seems, because both Taric and Swain point in that direction. And that is already enough to question her position as the true heir of Avarosa. It's not enough to deny that she may well be a perfect spiritual successor to Avarosa, but her true heir, I doubt it.\n\nAlso, even if Swain/Tahm/Taric aren't exactly reliable sources of information, they aren't real people. They are characters, and some author/writer decided to put those words in their mouth for a good reason. It's usually not a good idea to give flat out lies to your audience, so even if what they say isn't the plain truth, you can probably assume there is some seed of truth hidden inside.","replies":[{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-07-06T18:21:35.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"About the harshness: Ashe is one of my favorite champions, and unlike many players, I love that she’s a real hero with the power to change the world for the better.  When people say, “Oh, she’s not all she seems to be,” I get upset.  Moreover, speculation masquerading as an argument should irritate us all, since it’s misleading and can actually change people’s minds to the wrong opinion.\n\nAshe’s bow is made of ice, changed her hair color, shoots more arrows than otherwise possible, creates ice arrows, turned her hair white, lets her summon hawk spirits, and saved her from assassination after some of her tribesmen rejected her vision of peaceful unification.  That thing could not have belonged to anyone _but_ Avarosa.\n\nAt most, it could be argued that there is more to Ashe’s story than we know, but we already know that Freljordian lore will come with Nunu’s VGU.

Ashe working for the Watchers is speculation. Swain/Taric VO is a valid argument that supports the speculation. Nothing is masquerading. Nothing is proven either, but that's not the same thing.\n\nAs for your argument that the bow couldn't have belonged to anyone but Avarosa, well.... It's entirely consistent with Anivia's powers, for instance. And I didn't say the bow didn't belong to Avarosa, I said the bow \"isn't what it seems\". Maybe Avarosa did use it, but he was given to her by Targonians, I don't know. But there is something here we're not told yet, and if the bow is magical due to something more than Avarosa's own power, it means probably anyone could use it, and so Ashe is not necessarily a direct descendant of Avarosa.\n\nYes, the OP was suggesting something not proven yet.

Presenting evidence supporting that argument but also other arguments (did the bow come from Aurelian Sol?) without even mentioning them ignores the possibility that they could be true and is misleading.\n\nWe’ve never had proof that Ashe is Avarosa’s descendant, but that was never how she was portrayed.  Taking up her bow and her cause of peace, justice, unity, and hope is what makes Ashe today’s Avarosa.  And speaking of what the authors might have meant, doesn’t the relationship between the three current Freljordian leaders and the three ancient queens seem obvious?\n\nPeople seeing things differently than I do means that, at most, one of us is right.  I debate them to find out who, if any, is.  And if our judgments of the characters and world didn’t change afterward, then we must have been discussing a curiosity at best.

At the very least trynd seems to feel good enough about the place to not just go and look for the next tough opponent like certain other barbarian we know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Camille Ferrøs","date":"2018-07-04T10:05:27.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We really need a Freljord lore update with ALL the changes thought the years we don't know what did happen what is retconed etc. Freljord is untouched since 2013...","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-07-04T10:22:02.407+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well we'll likely get a freljord update with the release of {{champion:20}} though I doubt it is going to feature all the freljord champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Camille Ferrøs","date":"2018-07-04T11:34:51.891+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreenLore,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=lz9ptdlH,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-07-04T10:22:02.407+0000)\n>\n> Well we&#x27;ll likely get a freljord update with the release of {{champion:20}} though I doubt it is going to feature all the freljord champs.\n\nI know we will get some update but it needs a big lore update.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SickAnto","date":"2018-07-04T10:44:03.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Probably only the main protagonist of the Region, wich mean Ashe, Sejuani and Lissandra.","replies":[{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2018-07-04T10:45:28.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And they'll probably explain Udyr's existence. \n\nI forgot he was Freljordian for a second.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-07-04T11:12:19.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FurorDivinus27,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=lz9ptdlH,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2018-07-04T10:45:28.419+0000)\n>\n> And they&#x27;ll probably explain Udyr&#x27;s existence. \n> \n> I forgot he was Freljordian for a second.\n\nHe was originally an Ionian, but Riot re-wrote him to be a Freljordian who'd visited Ionia for some reason.","replies":[{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2018-07-06T21:32:21.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Went on vacation with his pal Lee Sin so he could better learn to harness his animal spirit.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-07-04T18:12:54.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats one possibility though I could also imagine them focusing only on a specific tribe,like the avarosans.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CaptainAntiHeroz","date":"2018-07-08T03:59:01.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreenLore,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=lz9ptdlH,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-07-04T10:22:02.407+0000)\n>\n> Well we&#x27;ll likely get a freljord update with the release of {{champion:20}} though I doubt it is going to feature all the freljord champs.\n\nI'll bet he'll be a freljord yordle....

Freljord is my favourite part of the lore. I actually hope we maybe get a small video since there is so much text I can't keep up with the lore in league :c Atm I have no idea where to start reading about it anymore which means I'm too afraid to write any fanfics on it  because I'm afraid it's not up to date anymore ^^\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2018-07-06T18:44:38.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My guess is that Ashe didn't find the bow by random chance, but it was given to her by Lissandra, who is covertly playing both sides of the conflict between Ashe and Sejuani in order to weaken their respective tribes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-07-05T14:48:31.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're extrapolating a bit much here. First of all, there were 3 Sisters - each claiming to be the Frost Queen. Ultimately, Lissandra outlived Averosa and the other one, which left _her_ as the Frost Queen. Therefore, it can also be assumed that Swain's secret knowledge is that Avarosa isn't the Frost Queen - Lissandra is. Therefore, Ashe's assumption that she got the bow on the Frost Queen's grave is wrong since Lissandra isn't dead.\n\nTaric's line towards Ashe is also pure smooth talking and flattery. I don't look very deep into many of his lines for other champions, and this is definitely one of them. \n\nAs for Kench, his point about foresight is in reference to her dream and desire to unite the Freljord using peace and diplomacy. He's saying her dream is basically stupid, naïve, and ill-conceived because she's trying to unite war mongering using the wrong methods.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MasterDClone","date":"2018-07-05T05:58:03.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a very interesting theory and would be very fun to watch unfold.

The watchers wouldnt contact a traitors bloodline so as avarosa did betray them and ashe is supposedly her decendant :/\nLissandra is powerful she tried to work it out and she gave her best to protect them but she is only one against an army of iceborn back then when the war was fought.. The watchers love lissandra as she had a prestigious place to interact between the watchers and the iceborn as a seer :)\n\nA lissandra lore update is coming with nunu as she did imprison him :)","replies":[]}]}
