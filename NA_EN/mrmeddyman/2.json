You can see them in the Jinx music video amongst other things.\n\nSince the lore overhaul however it seems like while Piltover is still an advanced society for Runeterra it isn't as advanced as it used to be. It's been pared down from a Final Fantasy VII psuedo-modern art-style society, complete with skyscrapers and modern zoos to a more Rennaissance/ Victorian Industrial era city. \n\nAre they still there? Because you can't see them in any Piltover art depicting a skyline. I simply must know...","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-10-04T13:46:37.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, there surely will be some kind of aircrafts from Piltover.

We also know that Riot at least considered giving us a jetpack champion when they designed Husk back then. Even if she got scratched, then it seems that jetpacks at least are technologically possible in these cities.

Corki is just such an old champion and has so little consistency throughout I don't like using him as a reference for anything. He was originally not even a Yordle, he was just a very short old man until they reworked him. Plus he has a passive called \"Hextech Munitions\". Back in the old days Piltovans used Hextech to toast their bread, the city was dripping with it. Now we are to believe it's a bit rarer and reserved only for those who can afford it so why would Corki make it into bullets?? How is that feasible.
