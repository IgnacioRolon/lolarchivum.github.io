It ended around 3 AM on January 10, 2018 right before the 8.1 Patch Update. Because of that, the match was ungraded. I am not sure of the exact criteria for achieving an S or S+, however I will not know if I had earned an S (or higher) and whether I should have received a token or not because of the update. Is there any way I can verify if I had earned the grade necessary to receive the Mastery token if I had earned it?\r\n\r\nKDA: 9/1/5 &amp; CS: 173 at Match Time 27:06","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-11T01:54:56.128+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that match wasn't graded due to server downtime or something similar then you'll most likely need to just play more games and get an S. There aren't set requirements for getting S grades either, it's more of a percentage based scale where you're being compared with others who played that champion in the same role.","replies":[]}]}
