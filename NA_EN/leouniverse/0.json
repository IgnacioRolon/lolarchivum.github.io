Then lategame my ping climbs to 3.000, 5,000, and it DC's me at 6,000 and I am left to sit in base wondering where it all went wrong. My router was just fine, my internet bars were full. Nobody else in my house was awake to have been causing high traffic. I've never had my ping jump so drastically to the point of it disconnecting me. Was it a DDoS attack? It really is awful when I feel helpless to my team and i get spam pinged when I can't even move.\nWould a VPN prevent this? I've been hearing that it may slow gameplay but if it protects me from a DDoS attack then I'll absolutely get it.","replies":[{"poster":"EATARI","date":"2020-03-01T18:27:46.848+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don’t care to elaborate how DDOS works, but the short and simple is that you weren’t DDOSed. DDOS would impact every player on that server host, not just you. DDOS is essentially the overwhelming of a servers capacity by creating thousands of false server calls. You likely dropped the connection entirely. Could be your ISP, router, or network card, but it absolutely wasn’t a denial of service attack.","replies":[{"poster":"Leouniverse","date":"2020-03-01T19:58:22.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know the gist of what it is, but thank you for explaining. Probably my router is absolute trash, or Florida is far from Riot's servers. \nSo if it was a DDoS attack, would that mean that the entire ally team would've gotten DC'd as well?
