Helping players reform\n2.) Shielding others from the behavior, at a cost.\n\nWe used to issue chat restrictions that essentially scaled indefinitely. \n\nWe were able to determine that after a certain point the penalty no longer helped with reform. The 10-game and 25-game counts for chat restrictions are based on data that they were both light enough, and felt strict enough to encourage people to understand their behavior is unacceptable in game and change it.\n\nWe also saw that the players in this 'large restriction' category defaulted to gameplay altering means of harassing their team. It caused an increase in feeding and trolling.\n\nThe sample size of this population and time frame is huge.

The Tribunal (and the old infinitely stacking chat bans) was around for 3 years. I believe the four tier system is older than HotS as well. While there are many ways to accomplish the same goal, it wouldn't surprise me if they have to change tactics with HotS at some point.

He was under a player permaban, but after a time, Riot did allow him to return to playing League.  At that time, he made new accounts.  None of his old accounts were unbanned.  \n\nPlayer permabans are really quite rare.  It honestly takes quite a bit for Riot to decide that a PLAYER has become a detriment to the community to the point where they are to be banned upon sight.  For the average player, they will never encounter this.  Even players who end up with a handful of permabanned accounts don't generally cross into that territory.  It took 19 permabanned accounts and the thousands of copycat fanboys before Tyler1 reached that point, so it's not something that Riot does lightly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2017-09-27T02:26:01.578+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hes still banned...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellpyre","date":"2017-09-27T02:27:14.479+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He, uh...\n\nHe did not get unbanned...","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2017-09-27T02:30:15.746+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tyler1 got permabanned 24 times, and he's in a state where if he ever makes an account & plays it, Riot will just insta-ban it on sight.\n\nYours on the other hand is still a minor consequences.
