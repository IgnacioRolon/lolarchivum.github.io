The only thing I didn't really do is install optional windows updates. It said there were no important updates available. https://gyazo.com/92fe65f6ebb177fdf5777efd899ef98e  maybe one of these optional updates would solve the problem? \nI also did a full scan of my hard drive and there were no corrupted files. The night I first had this issue I was able to play League again at like 12am my time(central). The next day I went to play and I had the same issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-28T23:25:09.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I highly recommend downloading all of those options to make sure your OS is in its best shape as well as to rule out any possibilities.    These updates are usually security patches, so it's important to have those.  This isn't really an issue that requires a corrupt file scan, but an issue with your permissions.  If you still have any issues, reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and our tech team will take a look.
