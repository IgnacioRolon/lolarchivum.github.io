On my ticket that I submitted, the person I'm working with isn't even reading my questions to even answer them. I'm simply asking a yes or no question in regards to a response that I got on a previous response and the Game Player Support person, is completely ignoring the question and just responding with \"Well for more information on X check out this link ______\" which doesn't even have the answer to the question.\r\n\r\nAll I am saying is, if you want happy players and happy customer service, and this is coming from someone who works in retail and deals with customers, at least listen to people...doesn't mean giving them always what they want, but pay attention to what they are saying. This person obviously and clearly isn't.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-26T20:41:40.322+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Took a look into this for you and it appears that there may have been some confusion.
