Pre-mades are making it more difficult with early invades for buffs but now broadcasting the buff timers for everyone to see makes it even easier for pre-mades to put the enemy jungler behind.\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t get me wrong, I love counter jungling, but it shouldn&#039;t be something so obvious and easy for you. Counter jungling can have huge rewards (i.e. all their camps being up, or a buff being up), but risks as well (camps all cleared so waste of time...or running into enemy, or getting cornered). Chances are unless you&#039;re in a premade with others on your team, if an enemy premade invades to get your buff, you&#039;re not going to have help.  Counter jungling should be about your own skill of warding the enemy jungle and getting the buff times for yourself, not looking at a mini map to see if their buff is up. \r\n\r\nIf this change becomes real on summoner&#039;s rift, I will not be jungling.

Blue is the only way a mage can get through a fight and still be safe to push or contest an objective. Otherwise, the mage is backing late game when the enemy assassin is still good to go.\n\nB) Turrets now have 700 less health and each attack procs an extra blast of red buff. That much free true damage means you'll cut through towers no problem even as a support in the late game.\n\nC) Red buff gives approximately a Warmog's worth of out of combat health regen late game. That's amazing for a split pusher who needs to get in the thick of things and then take towers, like Trundle or Shen.\n\nD) Blue is having its mana regeneration doubled, and its mana regeneration scales based on max mana, which mages are going to have a lot more of.\n\nHave you not read the changelist?","replies":[{"poster":"My Sea Cow","date":"2016-04-20T22:16:54.184+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes I read the changelist but it's not something I see worth fighting over or possibly getting aced over","replies":[{"poster":"D rok","date":"2016-04-21T01:18:37.484+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They'll be fought over, but mostly just as a secondary objective on the way to another one.

Call me casual player if you want, but I&#x27;m all in for changes like these that&#x27;ll make game less tedious.\n\nThis is exactly what is wrong with these changes.  Zero effort, max reward.  I used to think game companies just made bad decisions.   Now I realize they are making all the right decisions.  They are catering to their new casual audience that doesn't want skill to be involved.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aheadatime","date":"2016-04-21T13:59:03.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't have to write anything down currently. You already have buff timers. The only 'tedious' thing you need to do is ward the enemy jng if you want their timers revealed as well. Do you understand these changes? You can hold tab early game and watch if enemy red or blue buff timer goes out to see which buff they started real-time. It's like you have perma-vision of the enemy jungle at all times. That's fucking ridiculous.","replies":[]}]}]}
