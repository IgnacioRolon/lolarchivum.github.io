So I've been playing League since late Season 5, And my favorite champion and my main has been Shen. I really enjoy playing him and I would like something to show how much i love this champion. From what I have seen, there hasn't been any official merchandise from Riot at all. I would like to see a mini figure or a statue, or a shirt if possible. I would really apprieciate seeing something for him soon.  And I'm pretty sure others who also enjoy playing Shen would love to purchase an item like I have mentioned. Hopefully we get some info on this topic. {{champion:98}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-01T23:58:06.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recommend posting this idea to the [Miscellaneous boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous), since it really doesn't belong in H&S and will get far more visibility and discussion there.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
