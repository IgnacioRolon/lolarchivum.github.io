Unable to load into games.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've recently purchased a new laptop after my old one dying a few months back. I've also since moved into a new flat. I've moved from Virgin Media to Sky Broadband. Try to play league on new laptop and it simply refuses to load me into a game and keeps disconnecting me during loading screen. When I do load in my ping is 500 and it keeps showing attempting to reconnect.\r\n\r\n I've tried the hextech repair tool and I've also submitted my log. It has said that the its over 50% packet loss and that I should talk to my provider about this. I spoke to my ISP (Sky) and they've essentially told me its not a problem on their end. Both sides are denying its their problem. Other games have played fine and the speed test is perfectly normal. I've changed to a static IP, I've changed my DNS to open DNS and then flushed it. I've tried port forwarding and I'm simply losing my mind at this point. Can someone help me clear this up? I feel like it can't be an issue with Sky Broadband as it would have been made a bigger deal of if one of the major ISPs in the country couldn't support this popular of a game.\r\n\r\nHelp??","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-17T23:08:01.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of settings may not be configured just right with both a new network and rig.

I have gone through all the connection issues guide and changed everything available to change and have also supported a ticket with logs attached. Have any idea on the waiting time for this?
