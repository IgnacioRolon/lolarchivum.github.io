Aside from that, I think Gypsylord designed him pretty well (for an assassin).  We probably won't see nerfs until after Patch 5.11 (so they can give him time to settle down and let the player-base figure out how to play as, with, and against him).  If they did, there are only a few things I think should be touched:\n\n* The damage on Chronobreak.  Keep in mind Chronobreak also can heal him, and act as an escape or initiation.  It doesn't need such absurd damage (though I do like that it does do damage, right now it's a bit ridiculous).\n* The on-target cooldown if his passive.  Right now it's really low when compared to other similar passives/abilities (Udyr/Skarner) and it's arguably much stronger than theirs.\n* Stun duration on his W.  Right now 2.25 seconds is better than many ultimates (Amumu, Sejuani, Malphite, etc).  I get that it's difficult enough to land because you have to predict where your opponent will be in 3 seconds and it should be fairly rewarding, but it's already got a massive shield.  Lower the stun duration from levels 1-4 and have it scale up to the duration it has at the moment.\n\nIt'll be fun to see how Ekko is once the dust settles and not everyone and their mother is playing him, for now he's a nuisance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EkkoFroffles","date":"2015-05-30T16:01:36.107+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Given my love for Ekko, as evidenced by my changed summoner name, I may be viewed as biased, but here are my thoughts on the changes that could be made to nerf him while still keeping him viable.\n\nQ: The return trip is what you have to watch out for, as the ratio between outgoing and incoming is 3:4, and that's not taking into account the +60% AP it gets compared to the +20% AP for the first half. Lower the damage on the second part, either through reducing the base or the AP scaling, and I think that's enough.\n\nW: As it's tough to land, I'm okay with it having a little extra power. My issue with it is the shield. When you're turret diving, or being turret dived, you   can become a tank for 2 seconds. A shield of 330 at max level, not factoring in the AP scaling? This is, in my opinion, the part of his kit that needs nerfed most.\n\nE: This I'm okay with leaving mostly as is. However, I wouldn't be completely against increasing the CD.\n\nR: Going based off his lore, and the cinematic, this ability should be more about the 4 second \"reset\" he gets, not the \"nuke\" (as people have called it) he gets upon returning. 500 at max level, plus 130% AP scaling!? I rarely even go for kills with it, instead choosing it to do things such as steal dragon with my E then back out of the 1v3, ult back to lane, get HP back in a sticky situation, etc. Yet I still find myself getting kills with it whether I intend to or not.\n\nTL;DR: If you're going to nerf-hammer anything, target his W's shield and the damage on his ult. The rest only really needs minor tweaks, in my opinion. Just please, please, please don't do to him what you've done to so many champions recently that you've nerfed, or even tried to buff/rework, and change him so much that he's rendered virtually useless except in the hands of the truly skilled.

Counting damage when it requires enemies' direct cooperation and consent to be dealt is pretty absurd. Veigar's ult is point-and-click; if you're an AP assassin and you go near him at any time, for any length of time, he will delete you. The fact remains that more than 40% of Ekko's potential damage lies in an ability that will literally never land against a competent player unless they eat it on purpose, and that makes his damage output less than any other \"assassin\". Akali and LeBlanc both out-burst him if you ignore everyone's ult, and again, those two have ults that can be used for damage at will, and not just when your opponent walks in a very specific place. Diana significantly out-bursts him, and she's not even an assassin. She has sustained damage (which he doesn't), and almost all of it is basically at-will.\n\nThe scaling is supposed to be ridiculous, because you're not supposed to stand on Ekko's bloody ghost. These numbers don't exist in a vacuum, and Ekko can't just nuke you whenever he feels like it, while most other assassin-class champions can. That is what you're failing to acknowledge. It doesn't make me bad at math. It makes you bad at logic. You're also incredibly rude for literally no reason, so there's that. Why don't you take a break from raging for a bit? You're totally out of line, here, and it's unbecoming.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nucleophilic atk","date":"2015-05-30T03:26:53.990+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":9,"body":"It's pretty much Ekko players vs. the rest of the League community on this one.","replies":[{"poster":"ElJanitorFrank","date":"2015-05-30T03:57:32.175+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Don't own Ekko, voted no.\n\nBecause you can't judge a champion based on his abilities literally 2 days from release.","replies":[{"poster":"Nucleophilic atk","date":"2015-05-30T04:06:55.637+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"You **can** judge the fact that he has an overloaded kit **and still** has more damage in it than Veigar has in his.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-05-30T04:56:47.785+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"They're completely different.\n\nVeigar does have less scaling on his own, but deals damage based on the opponent's AP as well as collecting AP through his passive. Come late-game, the extra AP offsets the lower scaling and makes him a terrifying APC. Not to mention he was considered gutted with a .75 second delay on his stun, but 3 seconds isn't enough for Ekko.\n\nCome late-game, Veigar would destroy Ekko.
