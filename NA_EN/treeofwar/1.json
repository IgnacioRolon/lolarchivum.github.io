Don't follow on every hook. Valuable Life lesson right there. If you hook someone over a wall without vision, the follow up, your likely to get fucked.\n\n2. Unless your great at last hitting, run coin on Thresh. Also IMO take the BunFu Runes/Masteries, as I don't like anything besides Thunderlords on Thresh.\n\n3. Make sure people hit the Box. Don't just Hook+Box, then pray they get hit. Make sure they get hit. The damage plus the slow can really turn a fight.\n\n4. Generally, if you hook a tank, don't even bother to try it. Most likely its just gonna end badly.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-10-31T22:09:46.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UnholyReign12,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xTjwFfKN,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2016-10-31T21:11:22.907+0000)\n\n> 2.

There are always going to be these games where you don't understand the matchup and get killed over and over again by your lane opponents. When this happens, Leave the lane and start roaming. no amount of CS here and CS there can alleviate the advantage the other ADC (and their mid and their jungle because by that point you've got a bullsye on your head) gets when you die to him over and over and over again. \n\nyour ADC can 1v2. Or give up tower and freeze on your side of jungle. Still better than you getting killed all the time. \n\n2. Vayne players are dangerous. When they are on your side, I mean. Play very conservatively at the early levels, to prevent your vayne from going all-in too early. \n\n3. Your job is to affect the win, your means are the other players. not necessarily your ADC though. Identify who is the play maker on your team. Assist them first. \n\n4.

If your ADC doesn't do what you want him to do, don't force it at the expense of yourself. Instead, \"lead\" him by setting an example; most randoms tend to follow what their supports do. Meaning, if you want that little shit to man the fuck up, play a little more aggressively but don't go OOM. If you want him to back off, spam pings, run, but don't leave him too behind.\n3. If he does suck and is not worth helping for, don't feel bad if you go off to help someone else. However, don't completely forget about him! ADCs never fall off because of the importance of ranged sustained damage, but do know when to switch priorities in helping teammates.\n4. As starter advice, you're better off not roaming unless A) a tower is down and your ADC needs to either farm or go take another tower, B) the wave is very pushed and your ADC is absent (make sure to come back though, tower lives matter!), or C) you actually know how and when to roam, do something about that roam, and still not vastly fall behind in EXP.\n5. SIGHTSTONE AND WARDS. No one asks you to be a ward bot, but don't forget about vision completely either.\n6. If your ADC/some other teammate talks trash about your plays, forget about them. Don't waste time worrying about the fact that you are \"not perfect\" because someone else brings it up. Keep calm and just play, and remember that unless you get good you will acknowledge that bitching and whining from and to everyone happens on a daily basis. No, even experienced supports get just as much shit and they know well enough to forget about such complaints.\n7. Try not to touch the wave when your ADC is around, and try to waveclear and save towers when they are not. And yes, #towerlivesmatter\n\nIf you can't do either of the above, at least learn to adapt very quickly. A lot of botlane mistakes come from lack of coordination and even with randoms it is possible to fix it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spartan Potatoes","date":"2016-10-31T21:37:13.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friend here is a support main.

You are a strong and independent woman and no ADC can tie you down. It's kill secrued, they woulnd't have gotten it without you.\n4. Flame your ADC if they flame you.\n5. Play {{champion:81}} support, guaranteed lane victory. Also, {{champion:17}}, blind is win.\n6. You MUST always {{summoner:14}} and {{summoner:11}}. Why you ask? Ignite guarantees the kill, and smite guarantees the dragon, because every jungler is shit.\n7. Thunderlords always work, Stormraider is PogChamp worthy. Never take Bond of Stone.\n8. If you're AP, ALWAYS get {{item:3070}} , if you're AD, ALWAYS get {{item:1083}} .\n9. Don't always worry about saving {{summoner:14}} for the kill, if you an enemy champion ganking, or the enemy shit jungler, IGNITE AT WILL. ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE {{champion:245}} .

Seriously. If you have it up, you're a *huge* threat. If you throw it out when it has a 50% chance of hitting, then you're suddenly not threatening for 15 seconds. Simply having your Q up can prevent enemies from ganking and tower diving. And if they happen anyway, Qing enemies under your tower gets you 3 extra tower hits, which practically guarantees a kill early game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarianEX","date":"2016-10-31T20:58:57.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an adc main.
