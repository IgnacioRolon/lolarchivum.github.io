To my understanding mana was nerfed because mages were overbearing in the lane for wave clearing and sending x champion back (unfun to play against). Can I ask what the hell are mages are supposed to excel at? aoe team damage doesn&#039;t really apply when the team fight is over in under 1-2 seconds. Why is it okay that {{champion:238}}{{champion:157}} has unlimited wave clear potential but its not okay if {{champion:161}} does?","replies":[]}
