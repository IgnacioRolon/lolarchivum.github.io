If you are convinced you have met all of the criteria, but still did not receive rewards make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n) to us in Player Support so we can investigate further!\n* There is a known bug in normal queues where your highest division marker will not be displayed.  This will be fixed in the next patch!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> #***UPDATE 11/16:***\n* The overwhelming majority of players should have all received their rewards for all regions (Borders, icons, skins, etc).  \nWe are still working on identifying edge cases, or finding players we may have missed.  However, all rewards should be distributed by November 18th, 23:59 PST.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n> #***UPDATE: 11/11:***\n* With the latest patch, we have updated the Border Art in the Loading Screen.  ***This is new art for EVERYONE, and is NOT the 2015 Ranked Reward Border.***  Those will be distributed by November 18th, 23:59 PST.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> #***UPDATE 11/5:*** \nThe rules for being kicked from a ***Ranked Team*** and then re-joining has changed.  This is the updated section:\n * If you were kicked from (or left) a team for whatever reason, and then rejoin, your past wins ***WILL remain***.  You do ***NOT*** need to start over in terms of number of wins\n   * For example, if you won 8 games, and then were kicked from (or left) the team (then re-invited), you would only need to win 2 more games, because your prior 8 wins are remembered.\n   * If you are never re-invited to the team, you will not earn rewards.  You ***NEED*** to be on that team on November 11th, 00:01 PST in order to earn rewards\n   * If you join a ***new different team***, you will still need to earn 10 wins on that team\n\n\n\nHey everyone,\n\nRanked Rewards are the culmination of everyone&rsquo;s hard work throughout the season (or grinding those 10 ranked games at the last minute XD). We want to make sure everyone knows the exact requirements in order to unlock those rewards:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> #***Ranked Season***\n\n* Ranked Queues will be disabled on November 11th, 00:01 in each region.  [For NA, this is PST ](http://bit.ly/1H8vM18) -- Click here for [EUW](http://bit.ly/1kha3Pt), [EUNE](http://itsalmo.st/#theendofthe2015rankedlolseason_hs4zz), and [OCE](http://bit.ly/1XFI6iT).)\n * You can queue at any time before this, and the game will still count.  You can even queue at exactly 00:00 PST on November 11th, and the ranked game will ***still*** count. \n * The Ranked Season will officially end once the final ranked game is completed in that region\n * Challenger/Master tiers will update one final time after the final games are completed (after the Ranked queue is disabled) which determine the end of season standings\n* If you decay at exactly 00:00 PST on November 11th, you will get rewards based on where you land after the decay. Decay is disabled on November 11th, 00:01 PST --  the same time Ranked Queues are disabled\n* You can find a full list of rewards for each Tier [in this Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/205891456-2015-Season-Rewards#h1)\n* Rewards are displayed for specific queues.

Player Support cannot override or change this.\n   * If you are never re-invited to the team, you will not earn rewards.  You ***NEED*** to be on that team on November 11th, 00:01 PST in order to earn rewards\n * If you were kicked from (or left) a team for whatever reason, and then rejoin, your past wins ***WILL remain***.  You do ***NOT*** need to start over in terms of number of wins\n   * For example, if you won 8 games, and then were kicked from (or left) the team (then re-invited), you would only need to win 2 more games, because your prior 8 wins are remembered.\n   * If you join a ***new different team***, you will still need to earn 10 wins on that team\n * If your team goes into an in-active state before November 11th, 00:01 PST, your team will ***not*** earn rewards\n* The Ranked Team Ward Skin is unlocked for each individual (not team) based on how many points you individually earned during the Ranked Season:\n * You must ***WIN*** Ranked Team games to earn points -- Points are individually earned, not tied to specific teams\n   * Victory in Ranked Team 3v3 - 1 point\n   * Victory in Ranked Team 5v5 - 3 points\n   * Points are earned from ***ALL*** Ranked Teams combined.  Points do not have to be earned within a single Ranked Team.  Even if you leave the team, are kicked, or if the team disbands, your points remain.\n * Ward Skin tiers are unlocked at 20, 45 and 75 points respectively\n   * You must earn 20 points to earn the base Ward Skin\n\n> #***Things that will get your ass disqualified from Ranked Rewards***\n\n* Being banned or having ***active*** chat/ranked restrictions at November 11th, 00:01 PST\n* If you had any 7 day or more bans, they ***must*** have expired/ended at or before August 9th, 23:59 PST\n * For example, if you received a 7 day ban on August 2nd and it ended on or sometime before August 9th, 23:59 PDT, you are eligible for rewards\n * On the other hand, if you received a 7 day ban on August 3rd and it ended on or after August 10th, 00:00 PST, you are ineligible for rewards\n* Players banned for boosting during the 2015 season remain ineligible for rewards\n * Both those who boosted and those who did the boosting are ineligible\n* Players who received fraud-related (including Chargeback bans) and accidental/false bans will still be eligible\n* Players who had LeaverBuster suspensions are still eligible\n* Being ineligible for 2015 Ranked Rewards does not automatically disqualify you from getting other rewards in future seasons\n\n> #***Reward Distribution***\n\n* All rewards (Borders, banners, icons, Skin Wards, Victorious Sivir/Champion) should be distributed by November 18th, 23:59 PST\n * Rewards are distributed in waves.  If you see others with rewards, but you haven&#039;t been rewarded yet, ***don&#039;t panic!*** You will get your rewards in subsequent waves\n* If you want your reward border to be removed from your account for whatever reason, [contact Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we will get this taken care of for you.\n* If you earned rewards, but did not receive them by November 18th, 23:59 PST, feel free to [submit a ticket to Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can investigate further!","replies":[{"poster":"AthenasVendetta","date":"2015-11-04T23:40:11.561+0000","up_votes":79,"down_votes":6,"body":"\"Things that will get your ass disqualified from Ranked Rewards\"\n\nI love how this was said. {{champion:222}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-11-04T22:57:15.927+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":4,"body":"At least I get an icon this time.

I got the statement by Lyte that banned players wouldn't have the rewards in the end of my ban, what is kinda bad because changes like this shoudn't be announced in the near-end of season, so i was like, really? Being main Adc, i'd give the morgana one i got last season for the Sivir one, getting banned got me demotivated to keep going as the new policy is: Get punished for talking bad in a game where people can mute you and right after get punished again. People have bad times, i had bad times and never was a flamer, due to personal happenings i kinda found lol a way of escaping the world and sometimes got in with the rage of the real world some months ago, and really got myself as Bad Luck Brian as the time i get raging and flamer, people announce that this happens.

It's like adding a rule in a game of football 3/4 of the way through the game. If they would have said this is what we are doing next season then I would have literally no problem with it.

I was given out my ban on August 9th, and that was a huge wake up call. \nI have improved myself drastically and feel that I have prevented more toxicity than caused it. However, I am now being \"punished\" again by a rather spontaneous rule that you will not receive rewards if you were banned that should have been placed at the beginning of the season rather than 2 months before it ends, that really isn't fair considering the amount of dedication time, and even money that a lot of people put in the game because they truly enjoy just because they had some bad days and got frustrated with the game either because of bad luck or trolls (which you must admit were getting away scott free at the time and had a less punishment percentage than toxic players). \n\nThe number should be whenever Lyte announced the criteria of the ranked season rewards. I believe he did it some time in September so it should really only be 2 months at most. Truthfully, I would not have gone as far as I did to get banned if I had known that my ranked season rewards were in jeopardy.

You were a toxic dick, you don't deserve rewards; pretty damn simple. I'm honestly really glad Riot placed this rule at the end of the season, because it directly punishes actions no matter when they happened, which serves as a reminder for those who are no longer under the effects of the punishment, of how serious it is to receive a ban or restriction.

Or give everyone rewards that does not have an active ban within the last month. 3 months is extreme, especially when you should notify everyone in client of the impending change to rewards. \n\nIf they haven't been banned again, clearly they have reformed.
