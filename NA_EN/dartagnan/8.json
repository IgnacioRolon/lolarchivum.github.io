Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> #UPDATE 4/20 Mac Sound/FPS issues:\n\n> From our testing, Macs users experiencing distorted sound/low FPS should've be fixed in Patch 6.8. It's been difficult to reliably reproduce the low FPS issue in our internal labs, but our internal machines no longer show the issue.\n\n> We know some of you are still experiencing it, and because of the challenge in reproducing this, we'd like to get some further helpful information in order for us to track it down.  Please go to this [thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/IB3ucbih-mac-sound-not-resolved-patch-68) and provide this info:\n* System specs (Operating System, CPU, GPU, RAM)\n* Have you tried disabling in-game sounds? (Y/N)\n* How often do you experience degraded FPS?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey everyone,\n\nIn Patch 6.8 things are about to get truly...\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4woAdqI.png\n\nYou know what shouldn&#039;t be outrageous? Patching your client. If you are having issues, read the steps below. If they don&#039;t help out, drop a comment and we&#039;ll have your back!\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n> #***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n> #***Patcher never pops up, or disappears after you press &quot;LAUNCH&quot;***\n\nThis can be caused by corruption with the patcher itself or it failed to properly self-patch. Additionally, it may be due to some issues with the configuration of your computer system&#039;s permissions (meaning it can&#039;t properly save the files in the correct location). To resolve this, make sure to complete all the steps in our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!\n\n> #***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. Many of the most common Anti-virus programs [have already whitelisted LoL](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), however make sure to update yours to the latest version!\n\nAlso, even though you may have set specific exceptions in place before for your security program, League of Legends has gone through a major update. Therefore, your security program may recognize the old version of League of Legends, but not the new version. \n\nTo get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, and you still do not see the glorious orange &#039;LAUNCH&#039; button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!  Rioters as well as Wrenchmen volunteers will be on hand to respond and provide some additional help!*","replies":[{"poster":"Divine Zen","date":"2016-04-20T18:42:41.944+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugsplat at 33% while patching from 6.7 to 6.8.\nAnd no, there is no issues with my frigging Internet connection.

Since I'm not sure, I feel confident that Tech would be a better supporter in this situation.

If you have time, give it a look and run through some of the steps to see if any of them provide a solution. It is an FPS KB, but it may have solutions for your problem. :)\n\nHope this helps out! ^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PeteAteMickey","date":"2016-04-24T00:45:08.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried patching from 6.7 to 6.8, the scanning files is just taking forever (13k+).
