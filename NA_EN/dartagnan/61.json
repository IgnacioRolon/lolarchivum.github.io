We got you","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/CKwUjPP.jpg\n\nHey everyone,\n\nIt&rsquo;s time.  It&rsquo;s finally here, and it&rsquo;s badass!  With the updated client entering open beta, we wanted to give everyone a heads up into some of the biggest bugs we&rsquo;ve seen so far:\n\n>#***Champ Select crashes when going from Ranked to Normal Draft***\n\n* This happens very rarely, but can happen when a player finishes a ranked game, then in the game mode select screen switches from ranked to Normal Draft and enters Champ Select, which doesn&rsquo;t appear properly.\n* This so far only happens when entering Normal Draft after ranked and is wildly inconsistent when it happens.  We are currently investigating and will provide an update once we get more info.\n\n>#***Unable to create new Mastery Pages***\n\n* We are currently investigating this error and working to get it fixed ASAP.  We&rsquo;ll update everyone once we confirmed that we got this bug eliminated.\n* If you encounter this in the meantime, feel free to boot up the legacy client to create new mastery pages.\n\n>#***Incredibly slow responsiveness from the updated client***\n\n* The Updated Client can slow down considerably if other programs are draining a lot of CPU power. Commonly, this happens for players having a lower-end machine, but has happened for mid-range PC&rsquo;s as well. This tends to have when you have a...\n * Youtube or a stream open\n * Chat system open in the background (e.g. discord)\n * Large number of chrome tabs open\n* We&rsquo;re looking into why this happens and will update everyone once we learn more.\n\n>#***How to Return to the Legacy Client***\n\n* On the login screen of the open beta updated client,[ look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom](http://i.imgur.com/K1HsK2X.jpg).\n* You can also create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation.  Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nIf you&rsquo;re curious about a more detailed list of known issues, [we have you covered](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/231536768).  If you&rsquo;re experience any other issues using the updated client ***in the open beta***, drop a comment and we&rsquo;ll help you out!","replies":[{"poster":"TooMuchSwagga","date":"2016-11-16T16:05:13.086+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"After i hit launch nothing happen.
