If you believe that you should have received rewards, but didn't, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to us in Player Support and take a look!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n>#UPDATE Nov 10th 11:57 PST:\n\n>As our machines churned out rewards for everyone, there was a bug that didn't properly grant Victorious Maokai to players who previously didn't earn Maokai.  These players may have gotten the champion, but not the skin or neither.\n\n>We identified what the problem was and are hoping to get this resolved by the end of the day.  We're on top of it!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n>#UPDATE Nov 10th:\n\n>Rewards should be completely distributed and given out to all Riot Regions (except Garena)!  If you earned any Ranked Rewards, you should see them in your inventory.  Congrats!\n\n>If you didn't receive rewards but are convinced you should have, make sure to [submit a ticket over to Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can investigate and help out!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n>#UPDATE Nov 9th 22:04 PST:\n\n>We have finalized lists of all players earning rewards for the 2016 season.  We've removed those who are ineligible, and are going to start dishing them out.\n\n>Remember, rewards are given out in waves.  So it is possible to get some of your rewards, but not others at a certain time.  Additionally, your friends might have received them before you did.  Sit tight!  We're going to get them to you!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n>#UPDATE Nov 9th:\n\n>We've been testing our reward distribution by completing it in two smaller regions, Oceania and Japan.  Players in these regions should have recieved their rewards, if elligible.\n\n>We are going to test it one more additional region, before we start rolling out rewards in much more massive regions such as NA and EUW.  I'll update everyone once those rewards start happenin'\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n>#UPDATE Nov 8th:\n\n>With the Ranked Season officially over, we are currently compiling everyone's info who played and placed in Ranked this Season.  Once we gather everyone's info and identify all of the people who were disqualified for rewards, we will start granting them out.\n\n>Once we get an ETA when reward distribution starts, I'll let everyone know.  ***REMINDER*** Rewards are given out in waves, so when we do start, it's possible you see others with their rewards, but not yours yet.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey everyone,\n\nRanked Rewards are the culmination of everyone&#039;s hard work throughout the season (or that last minute grind fest). Here are some of the exact requirements to unlock those rewards:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/08PQgpq.jpg\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>#***Ranked Season***\n\n* The Ranked season will end at November 8th, 00:01 in each region. [Get the countdown clock for your region here!](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/230496748)\n * You will need to be in the Loading Screen (Champ select needs to be finished) by Nov 7th, 23:59:59 for the final game to count\n * Challenger tiers will update one final time at 23:45 on November 7th.\n  * This means your game needs to have finished by this time for it to count!\n* If you decay at exactly 00:00 on November 8th, you will get rewards based on where you land after the decay.\n* You can find a full list of rewards for each Tier [in this Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/228380727-2016-Season-Rewards)\n* Loading Screen border rewards only show for certain queues:\n * Ranked Solo/Duo - 2016 Dynamic Queue\n * Ranked Flex 5v5 - Best of 2016 Dynamic Queue or Ranked 5s\n   * Note: Borders in this queue won't appear until patch 6.23!\n * Ranked Flex 3v3 - 2016 Ranked 3s\n * Normal Summoner’s Rift - Best of 2016 Dynamic Queue or Ranked 5s\n * Normal Twisted Treeline - Best of 2016 Dynamic Queue or Ranked 3s\n * Co-op vs. AI Summoner’s Rift - Best of 2016 Dynamic Queue or Ranked 5s\n * Co-op vs. AI Twisted Treeline - Best of 2016 Dynamic Queue or Ranked 3s\n * Custom - Best of any 2016 queue\n * Rotating Game Modes - Best of any 2016 queue\n * ARAM 5v5 - Best of any 2016 queue\n\n\n>#***Ranked Dynamic Queue***\n\n* To earn rewards, you must have played ***ALL*** 10 games (your placement games)\n * Unlike Ranked Teams, you ***do not*** need to ***win*** 10 games to earn rewards\n* Rewards are awarded depending on your ending rank at November 8th, 00:01, ***NOT*** your highest achieved\n  * ***NOTE:*** Your emblem for either a solo player or teamplayer has no impact on any of the rewards.  Only the type of game mode (Dynamic Queue, Ranked Team 5's, Ranked Team 3's) influences what reward you get.\n* You must be Silver Tier and above to receive a Loading Screen border\n* You must be Gold Tier and above to receive the Victorious Maokai Skin (If you don&#039;t own Maokai, he will be added to your account.)  \n * ***NOTE:*** If you purchased Maokai right before receiving Victorious Rewards, he will ***not*** be refunded.\n\n>#***Ranked Teams***\n\n* You must have ***WON*** 10 games in a single ranked team to qualify for tier rewards that team has achieved.\n * You must have 10 wins on the same team, not on multiple teams\n * If you won 10 ranked games on a team, and then are kicked from that team, and not re-invited/rejoined you will ***not*** earn tier rewards.  Player Support cannot override or change this.\n   * You ***NEED*** to be on that team on November 8th, 00:01 in order to earn tier rewards\n * If you were kicked from (or left) a team for whatever reason, and then rejoin, your past wins ***WILL remain***.  You do ***NOT*** need to start over in terms of number of wins\n   * For example, if you won 8 games, and then were kicked from (or left) the team (then re-invited), you would only need to win 2 more games, because your prior 8 wins are remembered.\n   * If you join a ***new different team***, you will still need to earn 10 wins on that team\n* The Ranked Team Ward Skin is unlocked for each individual (not team) based on how many points you individually earned on a Ranked Team during the Ranked Season:\n * You must ***WIN*** Ranked Team games to earn points -- Points are individually earned, not tied to specific teams\n   * Victory in Ranked Team 3v3 - 1 point\n   * Victory in Ranked Team 5v5 - 3 points\n   * Points are earned from ***ALL*** Ranked Teams combined.  Points do not have to be earned within a single Ranked Team.  Even if you leave the team, are kicked, or if the team disbands, your points remain.\n * Ward Skin tiers are unlocked at 15, 30 and 45 points respectively\n   * You must earn 15 points to earn the base Ward Skin\n\n>#***Things that will get your ass disqualified from Ranked Rewards***\n\n* Currently banned or having ***active*** chat/ranked restrictions at November 8th, 00:01\n* If you got a 7 day (or more) ban ***issued*** on August 7th 00:01 or after, you will be ineligible to receive rewards.\n* Players banned for boosting or who were boosted during the ***2016 season*** remain ineligible for rewards\n* Players who received fraud-related (including Chargeback bans) and accidental/false bans will ***still*** be eligible\n* Players who had LeaverBuster suspensions are ***still*** eligible\n* Being ineligible for 2016 Ranked Rewards does not automatically disqualify you from getting other rewards in future seasons\n\n>#***Reward Distribution***\n\n* All rewards (Borders, banners, icons, skin wards, Victorious Maokai/Champion) will be distributed in the coming weeks.  We&#039;ll give further updates as rewards are sent out regarding timelines!\n * Rewards are distributed in waves.  If you see others with rewards, but you haven&#039;t been rewarded yet, ***don&#039;t panic!*** You will get your rewards in subsequent waves\n* If you want your reward border to be removed from your account for whatever reason, [contact Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we&#039;ll take care of it.","replies":[{"poster":"GerAvos","date":"2016-10-27T23:59:32.565+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":15,"body":"Imagine someone gave their all to reach gold, was super happy when getting gold 5 and then gets chat restricted and doesnt get rewards for the year. lol","replies":[{"poster":"Wasabi Kitty","date":"2016-10-28T01:33:41.899+0000","up_votes":105,"down_votes":15,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GerAvos,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=K5Vtw6EG,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-10-27T23:59:32.565+0000)\n>\n> Imagine someone gave their all to reach gold, was super happy when getting gold 5 and then gets chat restricted and doesnt get rewards for the year. lol\n\nShouldn't have been a dick then.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-10-28T17:12:29.864+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":9,"body":"Technically speaking humanity would vanish a long time ago if it wasn't for dicks.\n¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯","replies":[]},{"poster":"Duskbring3r","date":"2016-10-28T09:09:17.246+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Amen.{{summoner:13}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Miles The Man","date":"2016-10-28T00:01:15.968+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"We've got 11 days left!

God damn sick of it.\n\nI'm sorry that you feel so poorly. What you need to realize is that you're a wonderful person and you have no reason to be angry at yourself. You've got one life to live, and the goal is to enjoy it as much as possible! Don't bring yourself down by cursing yourself for making poor plays or cursing your teammates for making bad decisions.\n\n_\"Stay positive, Summoner!\"_\n\nGames are a lot more fun when you're being a nice guy (or girl). I get lots of positive replies when I try to start my games off on a friendly note, some jokingly negative replies that still make my day (\"Let's have a great game and a fun time!\" \"report Ashe for flaming\"), and then some negative replies that I ignore. No need to get myself frazzled over some guy or girl who can't take a bit of positivity. I'll tell my allies that they did a good job when they get a kill, or when their cs is really high, or when they get an objective, or when we win a teamfight. They might not respond, but getting that kind of encouragement feels good.\nHow do I know that? Because I would feel good if I got my play complimented.\nWe're all human beings here; we're not all that different. Since I like getting compliments, chances are other people like them too. I'd want a positive player in my games, so I _be_ that positive player in others' games.\nMaybe I'll get some compliments back, and that feels good. Maybe I'll inspire someone else to be a bit more positive in his or her next game. That means I made someone else's day better, and that person made other people's days better. That's the kind of thing that makes me _really_ happy.\nThis applies to toxicity as well. I'm sure you wouldn't like mean people populating your games. So what _you_ need to do is stop being a mean player yourself. You're going to make other people's days better (or at least not make them worse), and they'll act happier towards you. You need to be the positive force in the community, so that others can follow your example.\n\nAll the power is really in your hands, Terminus Edge. I believe in you. I believe that you can get your ranked rewards next season and get your Hextech loot back in a few months.\n\n\n##Are you going to let me down?","replies":[{"poster":"Onkel Malte","date":"2016-11-02T11:51:08.444+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"This wall of text is filled with so much positive energy I think I'm going to explode in a cloud of rainbows, unicorns and poros.\nIt's so nice to see that there are League Players who actually are nice people ;-;","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AgeOfTheMage","date":"2016-10-28T01:54:02.300+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"hmm, I want to play ranked for the rewards.. buuuut..\neh i'm too lazy to try and rank  up","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-10-28T02:04:57.846+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hear ya, the grind is real.\n\nBut so is that feel when you look at your loading screen with a shiny border...\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MFgBfGx.gifv","replies":[{"poster":"AgeOfTheMage","date":"2016-10-28T02:24:43.701+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"only to have it ignored c: *huehuehuheuehue*","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FourVsFive","date":"2016-10-28T17:36:49.003+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"I am triggered by the word ass I demand a safe space!  ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"a big msitake","date":"2016-11-06T03:25:54.706+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"**\" Players banned for boosting or who were boosted during the 2016 season remain ineligible for rewards \"\n**\n\nSo Nightblue won't be getting the rewards?\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} \n\nI tried.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Am I Daddy","date":"2016-10-28T00:11:28.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"even if banned after the august 7th date, do we still get borders and icons or no?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-10-28T00:21:40.663+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you had a 7 day suspension issued after or on Aug 7th 00:01 PDT, you will not get any rewards.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-10-28T00:41:00.551+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"The thread says a ban \"issued\" on or after the deadline makes you ineligible, while this comment (and last year's explanation) seems to suggest that the ban simply ending *after* (but issued before) the deadline would make you ineligible.\n\nCould you clarify which it is, to make sure I'm not just reading it wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-10-28T00:51:33.693+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"The 7 Day suspension needs to be ***issued*** on or after Aug 7th, 00:01 to make you ineligible.  \n\nIf you got a 7 day ban on Aug 6th for example, you would still be eligible.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-10-28T00:55:53.415+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://i.gyazo.com/4b0f3bcb874bbb7a4a886fdeff5577c8.png","replies":[{"poster":"Mystic Delibird","date":"2016-10-28T16:11:00.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Where did you get that? >_>","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-10-28T17:04:55.025+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"[I made it](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/dYoX8bgz-sharing-the-nami-stickers-i-have-so-far)","replies":[{"poster":"I Dont Main Mid","date":"2016-10-31T00:58:28.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":14,"body":"Why are you even on the fourms.

They don't want to restrict rewards to anyone who may have left games due to circumstances out of their control, but chat restrictions are only given to players who deserved them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Camil Toe","date":"2016-11-07T16:20:46.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post says if you have active chat restricted/banned on  November 8th, 00:01 you will not receive rewards.

Based on that picture, rewards are distributed out.  So if you get punished afterwards, count yourself lucky about rewards, but you should still be taking a hard look at yourself as to what kind of behavior other players find unacceptable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Poros In A Yaoi","date":"2016-10-29T13:43:55.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"When you're in your gold 5 promos last deciding game and then suddenly ur computer closes, dodging the champ select and then deciding to not open up ever, ending the series and forcing you to go into league withdrawal until black friday\n~~fucking kill me~~","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-10-31T22:45:46.713+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that happens, there is only one recourse left to take...\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MbjLMtQ.gifv","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"K6 Nvil","date":"2016-10-28T11:49:07.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are the loading screen borders going to remain the same or will they release the new ones later?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-10-28T18:31:51.872+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"The design of the Loading Screen borders are remaining unchanged since last year.\n\nSo if you really loved how one looked this past year and got it this year, hell yeah!\n\nIf you hated how it looked this year and got it again this year...I don't know what to tell you haha","replies":[]}]}]}
