Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hey all!\n\nThe migration of the servers to Chicago is almost here! If you are getting geared up and excited to play, but an issue patching stops you cold, we don&#039;t want this to prevent you from enjoying the Stress Test/Party IP weekend!  Be sure to check out the following articles, as they should resolve any patching issues that you experience!\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n> ***Launcher/Patcher never pops up, or disappears after you press \"LAUNCH\"***\n\nThis can be caused by corruption with the patcher itself or it failed to properly self-patch. Additionally, it may be due to some issues with the configuration of your computer system&#039;s permissions (meaning it can&#039;t properly save the files in the correct location). To resolve this, make sure to complete all the steps in our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!\n\n\n> ***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general \"Unspecified Error has occurred\" message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. Many of the most common Anti-virus programs [have already whitelisted LoL](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), however make sure to update yours to the latest version!\n\nAlso, even though you may have set specific exceptions in place before for your security program, League of Legends has gone through a major update. Therefore, your security program may recognize the old version of League of Legends, but not the new version. \n\nTo get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, and you still do not see the glorious orange &#039;LAUNCH&#039; button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!  Rioters as well as Wrenchmen volunteers will be on hand to respond and provide some additional help!*","replies":[{"poster":"XsN1p3rdUde2009x","date":"2015-08-20T17:40:47.264+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Today I patched my client and logged on, only, I can't connect to chat.\n\nIt says \"Unable to connect to chat, you may reconnect manually.\" I press the button to do so, and it says \"Disconnected from chat, attempting to reconnect...\" Then it fails.
