At around 6:04AM PST, we noticed that more players than normal were disconnecting and attempting to reconnect, possibly due to the routing change.  By 6:24AM we noticed this was becoming more widespread throughout the platform and enabled Loss Forgiven at 6:25AM and disabled it at 6:52AM when everything seemed to return back to normal.  \r\n\r\nThe teams in Riot responsible for this routing change were on call in the wee hours of the morning to investigate and determined that we should roll back the changes.  They are putting all further changes on hold until they figure out what went wrong.  While we&rsquo;re constantly looking at improving players connections to our servers, we won&rsquo;t tolerate making a shitty experience for those still playing.\r\n\r\n######When it rains it pours!\r\n\r\nAt around 8:02AM PST, we noticed that PvP.net (the client) was not getting the right info from the Game Servers about whether a game has ended.  Since PvP.net never got notification a game ended, players would see the End-of-Game stats either never load or the client would be under the impression the game didn&rsquo;t end. Essentially, the Game Servers are screaming at PvP.net that the game is over and here is all the info, but PvP.net is saying, &ldquo;huh?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nWe believe that this was a result of the maintenance we attempted earlier this morning and had all hands on deck investigating.  We pushed through some further solutions and we believe that the Game Servers and PvP.net are now healthily talking to each other again.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;ll make sure to update this thread if any further issues crop up!","replies":[{"poster":"WendÃ­go","date":"2016-03-30T19:54:31.076+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Now I can't stop thinking of the Game Server and PvP.net as an old married couple","replies":[]},{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2016-03-30T19:16:35.008+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"look a new board for stuff. \"live incident breakdown\"\n\nthanks for letting us know tho fam","replies":[]},{"poster":"Takazaki","date":"2016-03-30T23:18:05.797+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dArtagnan,realm=NA,application-id=6WpmgL9O,discussion-id=LEsHhsM3,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-03-30T18:45:48.398+0000)\n>\nwe won&rsquo;t tolerate making a shitty experience for those still playing.\n\n\nthis was beautiful to read","replies":[]},{"poster":"MaesterBaiter","date":"2016-03-30T22:58:23.651+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I DIDNT GET MY LP FROM THE GHOST MATCH RIP DIAMOND DREAMS","replies":[]},{"poster":"Decretum","date":"2016-03-30T21:57:57.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was in a ranked game during this time and was kicked out after we won the game (said reconnect to game.. but game had already ended), and I never ended up getting my promotional win.
