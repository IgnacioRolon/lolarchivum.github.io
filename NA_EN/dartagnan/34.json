We created a fix, pushed it out, and resolved the issue.  All chests should have been awarded for all S- and above grades as well.  Thanks for the patience everyone!\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nHey everyone,\n\nAround 4PM PST, we got a notification that mastery stats were not loading and appearing properly on the end-of-game stats screen.  Other than being damnably annoying, this is also possibly causing chests to not be immediately awarded and therefore won&rsquo;t appear in your inventory.\n\n> NOTE:  This does not mean that these chests were lost; once this issue is resolved the chests should be added automatically.\n\nCurrently, we are investigating what happened and the root cause.  Once we know why this happened, we can get to work getting a fix out ASAP. I&rsquo;ll update this thread once we know more!","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-04-04T23:39:13.003+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice to see a proper explanation about what's going on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hjor The Savage","date":"2016-04-04T23:44:59.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i better not  be getting a s- for going 19-0-1 with {{champion:105}}  and getting a penta.","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-04-04T23:48:12.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"B+\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RAT IN GAME UwU ","date":"2016-04-04T23:40:40.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I rate this mastery 4 out of 4","replies":[]}]}
