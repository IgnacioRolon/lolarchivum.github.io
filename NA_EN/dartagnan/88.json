Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey all,\n\n7.14 is on the horizon! Coming with it will be our newest addition to the roster, Kayn! However&hellip; we can&rsquo;t help but feel like we&rsquo;re forgetting someone else as this horrifying by lonely feeling washes over us&hellip;\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KoCuD2Y.png\n\n&hellip; Did you guys hear something? Anyway, let&rsquo;s focus on making sure your patch goes smoothly and we focus on whats really important, the soul of Kayn, Check out the steps below for a solution to your issue. If you don&rsquo;t see one that helps, no worries, just post your problem below and we&rsquo;ll help you down there!\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n>#Why does the End of Game Stats screen take FOREVER to freakin&#039; load?!\n\nThis might be due to the &quot;Close Client During Game&quot; option in the client.  This option makes the client close out when you enter a game, which means after the game it has to completely reboot to start.  Low Spec Mode should be enough to keep things running smoothly, so disable this option by entering the client, clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner, [and unchecking the box.](http://i.imgur.com/smwR8be.png)\n\n>#I&#039;ve  tried the Updated Client before, and it was sooooo laggy\n\nWe&#039;ve made some massive changes to the Updated Client make it run as smoothly as possible, even on the proudest of potatoes.  Enable Low Spec Mode if it isn&rsquo;t on already.  You can find out by clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner of the Updated Client and then [click &quot;Enable Low Spec Mode&quot;](http://i.imgur.com/rPGRnYW.png)\n\n>#Patching Failed and we&#039;re not sure why Error: 004\n\nThis error usually occurs when Operating System Permissions isn&#039;t set properly.  Essentially, the patcher is trying to access files found on your hard drive, but it is being denied from doing so.  [Follow the steps in this guide to get this resolved!](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)\n\n>#Something&#039;s up with our servers and it&#039;s preventing you from patching Error: 003\n\nOccurs when the patcher isn&#039;t able to maintain a stable connection with our Patcher Servers.  If the patcher loses connection to the server to get the necessary files, it will simply stop working.  To get this resolved, [make sure to complete all of the solutions in this guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nIf you have a problem that isn&rsquo;t here or those solutions aren&rsquo;t working, drop a comment below and we&rsquo;ll be sure to respond and help you out!  ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Tueur de Dieu","date":"2017-07-13T00:40:13.128+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem with a lot of people here, unable to connect to the login queue.
