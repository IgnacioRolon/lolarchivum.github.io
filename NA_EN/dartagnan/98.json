Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"#***NOTE:  This thread will be unlocked once the new patch is live!***\n\nHey all,\n\nWe all need to pick a side:  Pirates vs Ninjas, Batman vs Superman, Genesis vs SNES, Star Trek vs Star Wars, and now -- Yasuo vs Riven\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KrKt8i9.jpg\n\nWhile new rivalries are born every day, there is one that we can definitely put an end to: You vs LoL Patcher.  If you want to land that knock out blow and make sure your patcher will bend to your will, check on the steps below!\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n>#Why does the End of Game Stats screen take FOREVER to freakin&#039; load?!\n\nThis might be due to the &quot;Close Client During Game&quot; option in the client.  This option makes the client close out when you enter a game, which means after the game it has to completely reboot to start.  Low Spec Mode should be enough to keep things running smoothly, so disable this option by entering the client, clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner, [and unchecking the box.](http://i.imgur.com/smwR8be.png)\n\n>#I&#039;ve  tried the Updated Client before, and it was sooooo laggy\n\nWe&#039;ve made some massive changes to the Updated Client make it run as smoothly as possible, even on the proudest of potatoes.  Enable Low Spec Mode if it isn&rsquo;t on already.  You can find out by clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner of the Updated Client and then [click &quot;Enable Low Spec Mode&quot;](http://i.imgur.com/rPGRnYW.png)\n\n>#Patching Failed and we&#039;re not sure why Error: 004\n\nThis error usually occurs when Operating System Permissions isn&#039;t set properly.  Essentially, the patcher is trying to access files found on your hard drive, but it is being denied from doing so.  [Follow the steps in this guide to get this resolved!](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)\n\n>#Something&#039;s up with our servers and it&#039;s preventing you from patching Error: 003\n\nOccurs when the patcher isn&#039;t able to maintain a stable connection with our Patcher Servers.  If the patcher loses connection to the server to get the necessary files, it will simply stop working.
