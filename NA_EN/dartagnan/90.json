Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nWelcome to 7.15 folks. Got a ton of technical updates for this patch; military grade weapons from Omega Squad... shot gun knees from Urgot... and even MORE Duskblade!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JOcVxvt.png\n\nWe wanted to come up with a footer for this, but Urgot came out and took all our spare feet. So let&#039;s cut to the chase; if you need help patching check out the advice below or post your issue below for the Poro Bros and the rest of Support can help you out one on one!       \n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n>#Is it true you can now bind auto attack to left-click?\n\nYes!  While** in-game**, select Hotkeys in the options menu and scroll all the way to to bottom.  [Screenshot included.](https://i.imgur.com/aAxGzpC.png)\n\n># New skins where?!\n\nNew content like skins slated to release during a patch doesn't necessarily mean it will be on the same day.  Bookmark the [News](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/) page for news and info on new or upcoming content.\n\n\n>#Why does the End of Game Stats screen take FOREVER to freakin&#039; load?!\n\nThis might be due to the &quot;Close Client During Game&quot; option in the client.  This option makes the client close out when you enter a game, which means after the game it has to completely reboot to start.  Low Spec Mode should be enough to keep things running smoothly, so disable this option by entering the client, clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner, [and unchecking the box.](http://i.imgur.com/smwR8be.png)\n\n>#I&#039;ve  tried the Updated Client before, and it was sooooo laggy\n\nWe&#039;ve made some massive changes to the Updated Client make it run as smoothly as possible, even on the proudest of potatoes.  Enable Low Spec Mode if it isn&rsquo;t on already.  You can find out by clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner of the Updated Client and then [click &quot;Enable Low Spec Mode&quot;](http://i.imgur.com/rPGRnYW.png)\n\n>#Patching Failed and we&#039;re not sure why Error: 004\n\nThis error usually occurs when Operating System Permissions isn&#039;t set properly.  Essentially, the patcher is trying to access files found on your hard drive, but it is being denied from doing so.  [Follow the steps in this guide to get this resolved!](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)\n\n>#Something&#039;s up with our servers and it&#039;s preventing you from patching Error: 003\n\nOccurs when the patcher isn&#039;t able to maintain a stable connection with our Patcher Servers.  If the patcher loses connection to the server to get the necessary files, it will simply stop working.  To get this resolved, [make sure to complete all of the solutions in this guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nIf you have a problem that isn&rsquo;t here or those solutions aren&rsquo;t working, drop a comment below and we&rsquo;ll be sure to respond and help you out!  ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"0101100001000100","date":"2017-07-26T17:51:24.857+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is my patch taking forever?\n\n[Screenshot](https://i.gyazo.com/ae492652e140ac8f1b1931fd00d7ce78.png)","replies":[{"poster":"Base Skin Olaf","date":"2017-07-26T18:00:05.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-26T18:00:38.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of how fast your internet is, your network can still run into instability or outright blocks reaching specific services, like the patching server.
