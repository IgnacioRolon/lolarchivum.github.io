It may seem kind of complicated at first, but it&rsquo;s pretty straightforward once you get into it.  Below are some of the more specific details and nuances of the event, but feel free to ask any questions you have in a comment!\n\nSince so many Rioters asked me how the event works, I took one of them into a room and recorded a [video explaining how the PROJECT event works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UrA4Xn7R-I&feature=youtu.be).  I wanted to share with everyone here!\n\n>#What you need to know:\n\n* There are 3 separate PROJECT Caches: Blue - Project Ashe, Green - Project Ekko, Red - Project Katarina. These are like Hextech Chests and can be purchased by IP *(750)*  or RP *(75)* and give you the following:\n  * An immediately unlocked Summoner Icon:  Ekko Cache - Decrypter, Ashe Cache - EM Caster, Katarina Cache - Hyper Edge\n  * A Project Ashe, Ekko, or Katarina First Strike Summoner Icon ***[Blueprint](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/210155266-PROJECT-DISRUPTION-FAQ#h2)***\n   * To permanently unlock this Summoner Icon, you will need 7 [Project Cores](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/210155266-PROJECT-DISRUPTION-FAQ#h2) (like keys or essence gained from PROJECT/Augment Caches).  This will also unlock a special Loading Screen Border for the associated Project champion.  It is ***NOT*** possible to purchase/unlock/craft these summoner icons outside of the Cache/blueprint. Keep in mind that to get the border you need to own both the First Strike Icon and the associated Project Skin ***before the event ends***.\n     * For example, if you own Project Ashe and craft the First Strike Ashe icon, you&rsquo;ll get the Loading Screen border as well as long as this happens before the event ends on August 16th.  It does not matter which happens first, you will unlock the border within 24 hours of owning both pieces of content. The summoner icon ***DOES NOT*** need to be used for the Loading Screen border to appear.\n  * 1 [Project Core (Material)](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/210155266-PROJECT-DISRUPTION-FAQ#h2)\n  * 1 Augment Cache Fragment (Material)\n     * Combining 3 Augment Cache Fragments will create (unsurprisingly) an Augment Cache!\n  \n>NOTE:  ***You can only buy each Project Cache ONCE*** -- meaning, once you buy the blue cache, you cannot buy another blue cache again.\n\n* There is a separate Augment Cache that can only be either bought with RP (295) OR can be created by crafting 3 Augment Cache Shards together. This is a buffed up cache that gives you the following:\n  * Standard Hextech Loot Chance - Such as a champion shard, skin shard, ward skin shard, etc\n  * An additional guaranteed Champion Skin Shard\n  * 2 Project Cores\n  * A chance to earn a Augment cache fragment\n\n>NOTE:  Unlike Project Caches, there is no limit to how many Augment Caches you can purchase\n\n* Disruption Cache - Gold.  It can be purchased through IP (1500) or RP.  Similar to the PROJECT Caches, it gives you:\n * A Disruption Summoner Icon that automatically unlocks once the cache is purchased\n   * NOTE:  This does not provide any special Loading Screen Border.\n * One Random old Project Skin ***Blueprint*** (either Yasuo, Yi, Zed, Fiora, Leona, Lucian).  The randomness of each skin is weighted equally at a ~16.7% chance.\n   * Since this is only a ***blueprint***, you will need 11 Project Core materials to craft them into a Champion Skin ***shard***. Once it is a shard, you can then unlock it as a permanent skin through normal essence.\n * 7 Project Cores (Material)\n * 2 Augment Cache Fragments\n\n>NOTE:  You can purchase one and only one Disruption cache, similar to the Project Caches.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n>#FAQ:\n\n* The Project event will end at 23:59 PDT on August 16th for ***all*** regions.\n* If you own (purchased or crafted) PROJECT Yasuo before 23:59 PDT on August 16th, you will be given a special Loading Screen Border for this champion.\n* Can I get the new Project Skins in other chests?  Such as Mystery Chests or Normal Hextech Loot chests?\n * Yes!  These skins are considered normal skins, so they follow normal skin rules. They can be gifted, received through mystery skin/chests, and their skin shards can be gained through hextech crafting.\n* What happens to my unique Project Hextech Content after the event ends? (The project cores, blueprints, caches, etc)\n * Even after the event ends, your content will not disappear!  You can still unlock/craft Project content and receive the content, but not the special Loading Screen border.  You just will not be able to buy any new caches. Project content can also be broken down into essence if you don&#039;t have enough to craft something.\n   * NOTE:  It&rsquo;s possible we may forcibly remove Project Materials (Cores, blueprints, etc) from your account in the future.  If we do decide to remove this content, we&rsquo;ll give everyone a heads up so you can craft everything you want to!\n * For the [Merch Quest for the Project Hoodie](https://na.merch.riotgames.com/en/landing/2016/project/), here are the specific content you&#039;ll need to have equiped while you win 3 Matchmade games (Matchmade Game -- any game mode where you enter an actual queue/matchmaking)\n   * ***Ward Skins*** -- Optic Enhancer, Recon Drone\n   * ***Summoner Icons*** - PROJECT, PROJECT Fiora, PROJECT Leona, PROJECT Lucian, PROJECT Yi, PROJECT Zed, PROJECT Ashe, PROJECT Ekko, PROJECT Katarina, EM Caster, Decrypter, Hyper Edge, Recon Project: Ashe\n    * ***Champ Skins*** -- PROJECT Fiora, PROJECT Leona, PROJECT Lucian, PROJECT Yi, PROJECT Zed, PROJECT Yasuo, PROJECT Ashe, PROJECT Katarina, PROJECT Ekko\n\nFor some more general info about the event, check out the [announcement ](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/skins/project-2016)and our [KB Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/210155266-PROJECT-DISRUPTION-FAQ) as well!","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2016-08-02T18:37:31.297+0000","up_votes":94,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://media.giphy.com/media/5yLgoceFO3BdJW1zvFu/giphy.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2016-08-04T16:54:12.772+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/db/db7c912f4acb1be132a37324a4254f404333d7e471d39b347b04a301a775c3f0.jpg?noredirect","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rozzeta","date":"2016-08-03T23:29:10.338+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll let this gif speak for me, as well.\n\nEDIT: Basically, log in, purchase 3 boxes with IP, wait a week, then purchase one more box.

So please, correct me if I'm wrong because I'm genuinely uncertain and want to be clear exactly how this works.\n\nThe maximum amount you can get without spending RP is one of each character caches (Ashe/Ekko/Katarina), plus the Disruption Cache, which gives 5 Augment Cache fragments which allows you to get 1 Augment Cache and be one fragment short of a second one. From all those caches combined, you will get 12 Project Cores, and it takes 7 Project Cores to get a loading screen border for Ashe, Kat, or Ekko, or 11 Project Cores to get one of the previous Project skins, chosen at random. If you are lucky, you may get an additional Augment Cache Fragment in your one free Augment Cache, allowing you to get a second one. Beyond that, if you want anything else, you MUST spend RP, there is no other way to obtain any additional Project Cores, Augment Caches, or Augment Cache fragments by either playing games or spending IP, correct? RP becomes mandatory beyond that point to get anything else?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-08-02T18:37:03.804+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":3,"body":"You more or less have the long and short of it.

Still, if you like the icon/s feel free to get them, they are pretty nice :)\nAnd last, I didn't want to sound like a d*ck, just wanted to clarify something which can be found in the KB Article, actually I'm pretty happy with the event.\n\nThank you all,  have a great event and don't forget to enjoy it while it lasts !  ^_^","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordGwaihir","date":"2016-08-03T20:33:43.698+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm shocked someone at Riot thought this system would be a good idea, and then the Big Wigs actually put their stamp of approval on this crap...We have to jump through extra hoops just to earn the privilege to spend MORE money to earn something that we just got automatically the last time.

For example typing, \"Fuck I died\" in a game of League will not get you punished.  However, saying, \"Fuck you Zed\" might get you a punishment since its being used to insult another player.  Both use the swear word \"fuck\", but they are used in different context. One is an exclamation and one is an insult.  That being said, there are certain words that are outright derogatory no-matter the context of which they are used, and those will always get you punished.  Frankly, there is no need to list them out, I'm pretty confident you know which words I am talking about.\n\nTo further go off your example, \"ggez\" is meant to both insult and demean the other team, which is why the community has consistently reported players who say that as \"this is not ok\".\n\nLanguage can be damn tricky.","replies":[{"poster":"DemiMax","date":"2016-08-03T00:05:26.842+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":11,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2016-08-03T16:17:57.928+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah..... no.","replies":[]},{"poster":"StainlessTweedle","date":"2016-08-03T17:26:27.090+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can't get punished just because 4 people reported you when you did nothing wrong.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"vampirekid13","date":"2016-08-20T08:36:45.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"please take down the sticky already, its over. this sticky makes my eyes twitch with that terribly unprofessional title.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-08-22T22:28:03.936+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've left the sticky thread up purposefully until patch 6.17 drops and everyone can disenchant content.

Do I need to create the skin NOW to get his border? I dont really have the dust atm. \n\nAlso, consider doing these loading screen borders more in the future. For example, if you charged 750RP for a project loading border you could put on ANY CHAMP ON ANY SKIN, I think that many people would hop on that and buy it. \n\nThis is a really cool product / customization. You (ie riot) should look into investigating if releasing multiple loading screen borders for free use is a good idea. Like a Project border for 1k RP I could use for any champ, or a Pool Party or Arcade loading screen borders.\n\nI'm saying we dont have to couple the borders with the skins ie project border only with project skins. I think this customization would be really cool for any skin (ie a project skin with an arcade border, etc).\n\nPlease pass it off to the team that made this.\n\n\n\nAlso just to sum up my opinions on this whole event:\n\n-Firstly thank you very much for giving us a 'free' project 'skin'. I didnt expect you guys to be so generous. Arnt you guys chasing a billion dollars in revenue? Why you giving out free loot?\n\n-I dislike all the fkn microtransactions. You're giving league a really bad image as a chinese micro-transaction based game. A few years ago there were only skins to buy with real money. This was acceptable. \nNow there are all sorts of baubles like chests, keys, caches, chromas, and other bullshit. For me, its not fun dealing with these things as it really cheapens the game and it looks like it was created by Chinese devs hungry for money. (but thats true in a sense about league, isnt it?) Honestly it looks like Riot is really greedy and wants to charge for EVERYTHING. Next youre gonna charge for runes and masteries, the rate this is going. \n\n-Shop sucked for this ! \nHoly crap what happened to the store. When I clicked to buy the crate for 750IP it only said \"ICON\" Like what? You need to add more descriptions to the store so we know exactly what the fuck we're buying. It should say:\n>Included:\n>1 Player Icon\n>1 Crate (to be opened in hextech crafting). \n> -1 blue\n> -1 augment cache\n\n-Hextech Crafting is a complicated mess.\nLegit, its way too complicated and unnecessary. I think theres a good product hidden underneath all the bells and whistles and bullshit materials you guys have in this system. Remove the garbage and I think you'll be left with a crafting system that is enjoyed by all, and doesn't look like a bloated cash grab. \n\n-Charging for borders\nLook I know you guys are really hungry to make a billion this year. Its really obvious in the amount of bullshit mtx you guys have come up with this year. But charging for something that should be included in the base skin? Thats really disappointing. Didnt expect this sort of ridiculous cash grabbing from you guys. But now I know what to expect. \n\nSo overall: great event, but your management really needs to dial back the greedy/cash hungry mentality they have this year. Hopefully once you guys make a bill this year, the chinese stakeholders will dial down the pressure. The MTX is really not good for any game (IMO). \n\nCheers, have a great day.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-08-11T19:23:58.366+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really appreciate you taking the time to write up your thoughts and feedback about the system and event!  Your post had a lot of real-talk in it, but you did it in a non aggressive way, which was awesome to read!  I know that my post won't have nearly as much time put into it as yours, but I do take the time to read through every word of feedback that everyone's written.  Some of the criticism I feel is fair, and we'll definitely do a lot of analysis after the event ends for possible future events.\n\nTo answer your question more directly though, once you spend 11 Project Cores on a Project Skin Blueprint, you then need to use essence to craft it into permanent content.  As for the borders, the only Project Skins that have special borders are Ashe, Ekko, Katarina, and Yasuo.  Therefore if you craft Project Yi, there will be no special border from this event for that skin.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nautoday","date":"2016-08-02T18:12:05.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just  bought a ton of Augmented Chests, and I opened one and received Debonair Vi, and a Draaaven Icon Shard.\nWhy didn't I receive this additional 975 skin shard you speak of that is guaranteed?\n\n> An additional guaranteed Champion Skin Shard (worth 975 RP or higher)\n\n\nEDIT: Just opened another one and did not get a Shard worth 975 RP or higher.\nEDIT again: This has happened an additional 4 times.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-08-02T18:46:07.205+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"This is entirely on me.
