Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":11,"down_votes":6,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nAfter kicking Aatrox out a few years back and forgetting about him, we decided after much deliberation and heartbreak to open our *~~blinds~~* hearts and let him back in. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BraoulZ.gifv\n\nIf you&#039;re only now realizing that you&#039;ve been a closet Aatrox main this entire time and want to take the updates for a dive, don&#039;t let the patch get in your way.  The steps below should get you back on the Rift!\n\n{{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}}\n\n#***Updated Client (Beta Client)***\n\n>*** Error: &quot;League of Legends has encountered a problem. Please re-install League alpha client or try again.&quot;***\n\nThis issue rears its ugly head if something went wrong in either the updating or the installation process of the Client Update. The solution is to complete a full and clean reinstallation of League by following [**this guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) to a T.\n\n>***My IP Balance in the Store is incorrect***\n\nThere have been some issues with the client pulling correct IP balances. Some players have been able to resolve this by launching into the Legacy Client and making a single purchase to resolve this. If this does not work, hit us up in a [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we&#039;ll work together to resolve this.\n\n>***I toggled the language filter off but still see words too rich for my tastes***\n\nWe&#039;ve seen a few reports of the mature language filter not toggling correctly.  It&#039;s now possible to disable and enable the filter in-game by typing:  **/chatfilter** into the in-game chat.  For the more visually inclined, [check out this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/K92fiCb.png).\n\n{{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}}\n#***Legacy Client***\n\n>***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n&gt;***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. To get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n{{champion:266}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kayn Zedphyr","date":"2017-03-09T08:13:37.542+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got a fucking low priority queue because this crap couldn't reconnect me to League.
