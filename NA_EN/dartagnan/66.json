Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":21,"down_votes":8,"body":"Hey all,\n\nNew Champion Select and Dynamic Queues are back!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MFSbAkt.jpg\n\nWith the Lunar Revel celebration in full swing as well, we want everyone to break out their fireworks and head to the Rift.  So if you&#039;re hitting any roadblocks getting patched up, the steps below should help resolve them.\n\nIf you have tried everything to light the fuse but are still just sitting in darkness, don&#039;t panic!  Drop us a comment below and we&#039;ll be able to help out!\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n> #***LoLReplay causing crashing in the Loading Screen***\n\nWe have been seeing tons of reports of LoLReplay causing crashing in the Loading Screen.  If you are running this program, try uninstalling it temporarily to see if it resolves this issue!\n\n> #*** Client Version Rejected by Server Error***\n\nWe have been receiving a lot of reports regarding this particular error:\n\nCLIENT VERSION 6.1.16_01_20_13_46 IS REJECTED BY SERVER\n\nIf you get this error after patching, it appears that something went wrong in the patching process that failed to get you to 6.2 (You'll notice that the client is saying it is still 6.1, which is why you are not able to get into the client itself).  We are currently investigating whether this is a problem internally, but to do so we need to collect some logs.\n\nIf you're experiencing this issue, get the latest 3 patcher logs titled LoLPatcher.log NOT LoLPatcherUX.logs. You can find your patcher logs here:\n\nC:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\Patcher Logs\n\nCopy/paste the contents into http://pastebin.com/, which is the easiest and fasted way to get us this information.  Copy/Paste the unique URL generated into a post in this thread.  We'll collect them and pass them on to the appropriate teams!\n\nIn the meantime, forcing a re-patch should help resolve this issue.  Head over to our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#wq5) to find steps how to do this!\n\n> #***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n> #***Patcher never pops up, or disappears after you press &quot;LAUNCH&quot;***\n\nThis can be caused by corruption with the patcher itself or it failed to properly self-patch. Additionally, it may be due to some issues with the configuration of your computer system&#039;s permissions (meaning it can&#039;t properly save the files in the correct location). To resolve this, make sure to complete all the steps in our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!\n\n> #***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. Many of the most common Anti-virus programs [have already whitelisted LoL](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), however make sure to update yours to the latest version!\n\nAlso, even though you may have set specific exceptions in place before for your security program, League of Legends has gone through a major update. Therefore, your security program may recognize the old version of League of Legends, but not the new version. \n\nTo get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, and you still do not see the glorious orange &#039;LAUNCH&#039; button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!
