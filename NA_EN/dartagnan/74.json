If you run into any issues, let us know. \n\n*** Update Above ***\n\nHey everyone,\n\nThe Openbucks payment method, such as [Subway/Shell and other retailer Gift Cards](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201753254-Cash-and-Gift-Cards-Openbucks) has been temporarily disabled due to maintenance with our payment provider. Unfortunately, there is no estimate for when the service will be restored. In the meantime however, you can use an alternative payment method such as Paypal or prepaid RP cards.\n\nWe&#039;ll provide some updates in this thread once this gets resolved!","replies":[{"poster":"Complexly","date":"2016-04-27T22:14:38.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://imgur.com/JMO55O5","replies":[{"poster":"Complexly","date":"2016-04-27T22:15:14.070+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please fix asap I want to use my 35 dollar already.\nCan't eat Subway for a week.","replies":[{"poster":"great in kalista","date":"2016-04-27T22:24:24.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah.... can u guys post it like a week ago before we buy the gift card... this is so.. like it suddenly just come up{{summoner:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"Complexly","date":"2016-04-27T22:30:50.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the thing is that day u wouldve said this or someone if they bought a card that day LOL","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"W4terboy","date":"2016-04-28T00:38:58.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey All,\n\nOpenbucks was re-enabled just now.
