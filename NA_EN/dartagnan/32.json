Bookmark the [News](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/) page for news and info on new or upcoming content.\n\n\n>#Why does the End of Game Stats screen take FOREVER to freakin' load?!\n\nThis might be due to the \"Close Client During Game\" option in the client.  This option makes the client close out when you enter a game, which means after the game it has to completely reboot to start.  Low Spec Mode should be enough to keep things running smoothly, so disable this option by entering the client, clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner, [and unchecking the box.](http://i.imgur.com/smwR8be.png)\n\n>#I've  tried the Updated Client before, and it was sooooo laggy\n\nWe've made some massive changes to the Updated Client make it run as smoothly as possible, even on the proudest of potatoes.  Enable Low Spec Mode if it isn’t on already.  You can find out by clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner of the Updated Client and then [click \"Enable Low Spec Mode\"](http://i.imgur.com/rPGRnYW.png)\n\n>#Patching Failed and we're not sure why Error: 004\n\nThis error usually occurs when Operating System Permissions isn't set properly.

Also minions dont move, other players champions lag horribly and jungle camps dont spawn client side. This happens all while i have a 125-90 FPS and 55-45 ping.
