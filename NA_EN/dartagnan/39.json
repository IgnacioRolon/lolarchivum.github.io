Those who were originally missed due to not have enough skins/champions were given Kayle and Riot Kayle.  Those who have Riot Kayle already now have Sweetheart Annie.***\n\nHey everyone,\n\nMany of you have seen your friends receive their Mystery Skins with you left wondering where your Mystery Skin is, or whether you even qualified for one.  Never fear!\n\n**Mystery Skins are still being sent out!**\n\nWe are sending them out in waves every single day, and it may take the next couple of weeks (until the end of January) before they are all distributed.  We'll update this thread once the last wave has been sent!\n\nAs a reminder, here are the qualifications:\n\n- All Riot Regions qualify - NA, EUW, EUNE, LAS, LAN, BR, OCE, RU, TR, and Korea\n- You need to be level 5 (reached level 5 in 2014)\n- You need to have played and ***completed ***at least one game of any mode (including Custom Games) in 2014.\n- You did not receive a 14-day suspension\n- You did not receive a ranked restriction (a single game ranked restriction will disqualify you)\n- You did not receive a chat restriction (a single game of chat restriction will disqualify you)\n- If you received a Leaver Buster Penalty, you still qualify for the Mystery Skin\n- If your account was compromised and suspended by Riot until it was recovered, we will double-check our list to make sure you receive one\n- If you have under the 10 skin minimum for Mystery Skins, we will check the list again and make sure anyone who did not receive one, but met all other qualifications, gets one!\n- If you recently transferred to another Riot Region, you will still get a Mystery Skin, as long as you meet the previous qualifications","replies":[{"poster":"EL Wizard","date":"2015-01-13T01:44:56.628+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-01-13T02:01:27.208+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"You did receive Chat restrictions on your account in 2014, so unfortunately you are ineligible :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BritterBugs","date":"2015-02-07T16:36:05.653+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"*** If you still have not received a good behavior mystery skin and KNOW that you for sure met the requirements, then you should read this. ***\n\nFirst, I noticed the same pattern between all of my alt accounts; The ones that did not currently possess enough champs to fulfill the available 10 skin minimum were not granted a reward (you can check this by clicking on the skins tab and viewing how many skins are available for purchase if you select the \"owned champions\" box. If it's at least 10 that show up, then you most likely originally got it. If its under 10 skins that populate, then you don't have enough purchasable skins available.\n\nSince Riot advised that they will be double-checking the list, I took that time to buy a few more champs so that there would be at least 10 unowned skins to select from. Here's what happened...\n\nSo I just happened to notice that I owned the champion Kayle after logging in. I specifically know that I shouldn't have owned that champ since I don't like her at all. After clicking on it and reviewing the skins I noticed I had owned the \"Riot Kayle\" skin. I'm assuming this is the good behavior mystery skin as the exact same thing occurred on my 5 other accounts! There was no pop-up message advising of the reward. I just had to navigate to Kayle in order to see it. \n\nNow here is the issue I have with this. Even though I had 12 available skins to choose from, I was gifted a skin for a champ that I don't even play (or own). I thought mystery skins were randomly selected from one's existing champion pool. And if that isn't bad enough, the exact same thing happened for all 6 of my accounts that missed the first disbursement. Although I can appreciate the free gift from Riot, I can't help but feel like this is a lazy, half-hearted attempt at quickly pacifying the remainder that didn't initially receive their skin. I'm sure this is great for Kayle fans, but it kind of sucks for the players that took the time to earn the IP to buy champs that they actually play and would like a mystery skin for. ie: I bought Annie, Morg, and Sona on all of my accounts, w/ the hopes that I might get a good skin for one of those champs that I actually use. That's a lot of time spent farming for the IP if you multiply it by the 6 accounts I did it for.\n\nSo TL:DR, It would seem that Riot has gifted the remaining players awaiting skins, both the champion (if unowned) Kayle, as well as Riot Kayle skin. If you are CERTAIN that you did not receive any punishment for negative behavior, then you should check your Kayle and see if that skin is now owned. There was NO pop-up message indicating that this transaction occurred.\n\nI just wish that they would have stayed true to the \"mystery\" skin rule that was implemented the first time around. Instead they opted to gift a singular skin to all of the accounts, regardless of whether or not the player even owns Kayle. :/","replies":[{"poster":"Faded Rasta","date":"2015-02-09T21:28:27.272+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"A few days ago I going through the champs I own and found an extra champion, Kayle. I was confused at first thinking that I bought her, but I try not to buy champs before using them through free rotation. I looked and found all this news about her and realized what happened. I was extremely happy to receive her even though she not my usually play style. I feel that Riot did a great thing. They didn't have to give anyone anything, but they did. I canto really afford to spend money on the game, but riot still cared enough to give me something.
