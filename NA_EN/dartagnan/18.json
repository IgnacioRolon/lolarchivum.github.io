{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-01T19:36:42.518+0000","title":"Having issues Patching 6.11? Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":9,"down_votes":10,"body":"> #UPDATE 6/3:\n\n>Our patcher team has noticed a higher than normal amount of ***\"Unspecified Errors\"*** occurring with the recent patch.  From doing a bit of digging, they suggest doing the following if you are getting this specific error:\n\n>1. Go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\ and delete the entire lol_game_client folder.\n2. Go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\solutions\\and delete the entire lol_game_client_sln folder.\n3. Launch patcher and patch \n\n>This deletes your entire game client so not an ideal solution for those with bandwidth caps because this means you will have to re-download the game but you won't have to go through the entire scanning process.\n\n>If you have some bandwidth caps:\n\n>1. Go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_game_client and delete 0.0.1.72 and 0.0.1.74.\n2. Go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\solutions\\lol_game_client_sln and delete 0.0.1.133\n3. Launch patcher, wait for scanning to complete and observe patching.\n\n>This method may take longer than method 1 but you will download less data since you're not deleting everything.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey all,\n\nSometimes League requires a little TLC (and no, we don&#039;t mean tender, loving, care).  When its a fight to the death, whether in lane or a steel cage, you throw anything you have at your opponent.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/haQZxI1.gifv\n\nIf patcher errors suddenly made an unexpected entrance and reveals itself to be your nemesis all along, the following steps should be able to help out and pin the issue down (Hype announcer not guaranteed to be included).\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n> #***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n> #***Patcher never pops up, or disappears after you press &quot;LAUNCH&quot;***\n\nThis can be caused by corruption with the patcher itself or it failed to properly self-patch. Additionally, it may be due to some issues with the configuration of your computer system&#039;s permissions (meaning it can&#039;t properly save the files in the correct location). To resolve this, make sure to complete all the steps in our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!\n\n> #***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. Many of the most common Anti-virus programs [have already whitelisted LoL](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), however make sure to update yours to the latest version!\n\nAlso, even though you may have set specific exceptions in place before for your security program, League of Legends has gone through a major update. Therefore, your security program may recognize the old version of League of Legends, but not the new version. \n\nTo get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, and you still do not see the glorious orange &#039;LAUNCH&#039; button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!  Rioters as well as Wrenchmen volunteers will be on hand to respond and provide some additional help!*","replies":[{"poster":"Senpai Noodlez","date":"2016-06-02T19:31:12.209+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"so i love this riot i have 50mbps but your stupid patcher is only using 34-40kbps for \"updating interface\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kushinade","date":"2016-06-02T20:38:06.161+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Game is NOT patching no matter WHAT.
