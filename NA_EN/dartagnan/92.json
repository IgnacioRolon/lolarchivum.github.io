Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nCongrats to all you agents of Order and Chaos out there for an awesome battle of the ages!  It&#039;s been an impressive fight, but what better way to celebrate an excellent battle between honorable opponents than with the soon to be released renewal of the Honor System?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qEdhtS6.jpg\n\nWe&rsquo;re really excited to get you guys your own golden laurels of positivity, but if your patch is going not-so-positively, we&rsquo;re here to help! Try some of the steps below, or post your problem here and we&rsquo;ll be happy to help you out!\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n>#Why does the End of Game Stats screen take FOREVER to freakin&#039; load?!\n\nThis might be due to the &quot;Close Client During Game&quot; option in the client.  This option makes the client close out when you enter a game, which means after the game it has to completely reboot to start.  Low Spec Mode should be enough to keep things running smoothly, so disable this option by entering the client, clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner, [and unchecking the box.](http://i.imgur.com/smwR8be.png)\n\n>#I&#039;ve  tried the Updated Client before, and it was sooooo laggy\n\nWe&#039;ve made some massive changes to the Updated Client make it run as smoothly as possible, even on the proudest of potatoes.  Enable Low Spec Mode if it isn&rsquo;t on already.  You can find out by clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner of the Updated Client and then [click &quot;Enable Low Spec Mode&quot;](http://i.imgur.com/rPGRnYW.png)\n\n>#Patching Failed and we&#039;re not sure why Error: 004\n\nThis error usually occurs when Operating System Permissions isn&#039;t set properly.  Essentially, the patcher is trying to access files found on your hard drive, but it is being denied from doing so.  [Follow the steps in this guide to get this resolved!](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)\n\n>#Something&#039;s up with our servers and it&#039;s preventing you from patching Error: 003\n\nOccurs when the patcher isn&#039;t able to maintain a stable connection with our Patcher Servers.  If the patcher loses connection to the server to get the necessary files, it will simply stop working.  To get this resolved, [make sure to complete all of the solutions in this guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nIf you have a problem that isn&rsquo;t here or those solutions aren&rsquo;t working, drop a comment below and we&rsquo;ll be sure to respond and help you out!  ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Malforte","date":"2017-06-28T10:34:38.237+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"if the update is live why the hell my game client is the same sistem of honoring??? i already did the update and its all the same???","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-28T16:02:32.312+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honor is aimed to launch during 7.13, but it's not live yet.
