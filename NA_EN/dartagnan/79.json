Assuming things continue tracking well, the fix will be going out in the next patch.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey everyone,\n\nWe have been reading everyone's posts and comments, and it's pretty clear that the Windows 10 Tech Preview doesn't currently work with the latest patch of League of Legends.  We are currently investigating, and you can get more information from **RiotAether **here:\n\n> Hey everyone, thanks for the Windows 10 crash reports. As a lot of you have pointed out, we don't support Windows 10 yet so your mileage may vary as we work toward full compatibility. That said, MMACheerpuppy hit the nail on the head - we still want to do what we can to help those of you who've opted into the preview.\n> \n> Speaking concretely, we're currently looking into a few leads from the log information that's been provided (animation and/or sound files appear to be the culprit at this point). No promises on timeline but we're hoping to get something out before the next patch.\n\nSource:  http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2yshlb/windows_10_preview_users_patch_55/cpcueg3\n\nOnce we get some additional updates, we will make sure to update this thread!  In the meantime, if you have the capability to run your computers off of Windows 7/8, make sure to do so in order to update League and play normally.","replies":[]}
