When we first began making these updates we were mindful of the fact that we were altering content to which players might be very attached, and with that in mind we agreed to the handful of refund requests from the passionate players who owned updated champions and who sent a ticket to Player Support. \n\nBack then we could do these individual gestures of goodwill because the number of refund requests was pretty low. Requests came largely from players who mained the champ. Once the policy was made public, there was a 10,000%+ spike in requests. We looked at the data and found that a very large majority of requests were from players who werenâ€™t actively invested in the champion pre-update, but were trying to get back RP or IP without using a refund token.\n\nTo give you an idea of the impact, every recent champion update has resulted in a storm of support tickets larger than what we typically see from a full day of major server instability. Combine this with the fact that we're on pace to double our annual number of champion updates (6 in 2013, already 7 in first half of 2014) and it begins to significantly impact Player Support's ability to handle critical issues like account recoveries and tech support.\n\nAs a result of these factors, we've decided that beginning with the Karthus champion update, we will stop processing refund requests for updated champions. It would be awesome to have a process that specifically targets those players significantly impacted by an update and doesn't interfere with Player Support's ability to quickly solve vital support issues, but we are far off from a good solution to this.\n\nWe know this may be disappointing for some players, particularly those actively playing and invested in updated champions. To help address this issue, the champion update team is working on [increased transparency](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-skins/txxQETbY-champion-updateupdate) when it comes to which champions they're working on. Additionally, the Player Support team has created a [central hub](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/40116190-Champion-Rework-Schedule) with info on past, present, and future champion updates. These efforts should both help you plan your purchases and use of refund tokens and give you better places to voice your feedback and help us fine-tune updates. \n\nStill have questions about this change?  Feel free to [submit a ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) to us and we'll be more than able to discuss this further!","replies":[{"poster":"Swordngun2","date":"2016-03-30T04:09:51.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm very iffy on this policy. I can understand where Riot is coming from, but this hurts long time fans and essentially customers a lot more than I think you realize.\n\nFor example, I've played League for around 5 years now. It's been just about as long since I've had any refund tokens. I personally do not care about the money, as 2 of my refunds were IP champs I decided I didn't actually like, and the other was to refund the Full Machine Viktor for the Creator Viktor as it came out mere weeks after I purchased FM Viktor. \nSo none of them was simply to get money back to try and use elsewhere. It was because I had made mistakes. \n\nNow granted part of this is my lack of foresight, but after my refund tokens ran out, I started waiting til Brand new champs received their usual nerfs, and waiting for sales on Skins so I could not only be more informed on the skins, but also so I wouldn't be upset if a new skin came out for a champ I like. (I'm a one skin per champ kinda guy.)\n\nNow for a while I thought just as you had, and thought most people were just whining, because I tended to enjoy/see the practicality of the new reworks.\n\nHowever, after Shen was remade (before I had even played his new kit) I knew I was going to absolutely hate his new kit. I bought Shen because I liked working off his shield trades and sustain game. Now he has none of that, and is much more of a fighter than before. I was much more interested in the tank Shen.\n\nNow I am an avid ARAM player. In fact, if it wasn't for Aram, I would have quit this game. I can't stand the toxicity of SR and I don't play this game to compete, I play to learn and enjoy all the different scenarios and playstyles this game continues to offer at any second. Learning how others play and working out new strategies is fun to me. But SR has so many more toxic players, whereas people in ARAM are more laid back (but you can still try hard and do pretty well.)\n\nSo imagine my disgust when I roll Shen on ARAM, a character I used to love, inspired by TPA (I even own the original skin, not the sale one) and instead of being overjoyed, I am resigned to hoping I have a reroll. \n\nIs Shen bad? No\nIs he still a ninja with a taunt? Yes\nIs he a completely different playstyle? Absolutely.\n\nSo back to ARAM. I know I never want this champ that I USED to play all the time, _but I can't refund him. Hell, I don't even care that I have the skin. I would honestly be happy to just have him and his skin removed from my champion list, no refund period_. I **_really just don't want to play him at all_**. Now I can understand why people are upset about things like Fiora or Karma who, though you tried to maintain their character Style, you ended up completely changing their gameplay style. To some people, the moves make the champion, and I can see that now. It's just a shame that others helped ruin this for us, and that Riot  had to cave.","replies":[]}]}
