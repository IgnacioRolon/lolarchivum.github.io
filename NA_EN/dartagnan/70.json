We'll let everyone know if we any future issues!\n\n-----------------\n\nHey all,\n\nEarlier today around 6:30PM PDT, we noticed that players were not being able to login, an shortly thereafter games were not properly starting out of Champion Select.  Almost immediately after, we activated Loss Forgiven.  We called up all of our resources and immediately started to investigate and triage.  We don&#039;t have a smoking gun just yet on what prompted this, but we aren&#039;t going to rest until we find it and resolve it.\n\nWe&#039;ll provide more details and updates as we get them.","replies":[]}
