At around 2am, a nationwide ISP backbone provider experienced issues causing players to have issues logging in and connecting to League of Legends.  While many of these issues have been resolved, we are still seeing players having issues logging in successfully.  We are working with this provider to ensure that this issue gets fully resolved while we investigate things on our side to cover all of our bases.\r\n\r\nI know these issues have sucked, but we are working non-stop to ensure that everyone can login normally!\r\n\r\nFor the latest updates, make sure to check the Server Status Page!\r\n\r\nhttp://status.leagueoflegends.com/?en_US#na","replies":[{"poster":"God Of Gold 5","date":"2014-12-15T08:37:48.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obligatory joke about Rito forgetting to pay the internet bill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"God Of Gold 5","date":"2014-12-15T08:37:15.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1","replies":[]},{"poster":"superslysi","date":"2014-12-04T19:04:40.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try using the .admin.exe that seemed to work for me although I'm afraid to log out and try again now...","replies":[{"poster":"TekkunDashi","date":"2014-12-14T04:50:48.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CONFIRMED using the .admin.exe for me logged me in, the admin.exe is in the same folder as where the regular launcher is","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PaladinJupiter","date":"2014-12-04T17:58:15.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any clue on what exactly happened?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-12-04T18:51:28.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our Network Engineers and Network Operations guys probably have pretty in-depth knowledge on what happened.
