Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":14,"down_votes":10,"body":"Hey all,\n\nWith the Client Update in full swing, our old patch megathreads just weren&#039;t cutting it given we haven&#039;t included anything about the beta client.  So we changed a bunch of things around and added some common problems from the beta client that you might be experience.\n\nIf you&#039;re updating to the new client, make sure to check out the steps below and it should help you out!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#***Updated Client (Beta Client)***\n\n>*** Error: &quot;League of Legends has encountered a problem. Please re-install League alpha client or try again.&quot;***\n\nThis issue rears its ugly head if something went wrong in either the updating or the installation process of the Client Update. The solution is to complete a full and clean reinstallation of League by following [**this guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) to a T.\n\n>***My IP Balance in the Store is incorrect***\n\nThere have been some issues with the client pulling correct IP balances. Some players have been able to resolve this by launching into the Legacy Client and making a single purchase to resolve this. If this does not work, hit us up in a [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we&#039;ll work together to resolve this.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#***Legacy Client***\n\n>***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n>***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. To get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, and you still do not see the glorious orange &#039;LAUNCH&#039; button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!  Rioters as well as Wrenchmen volunteers will be on hand to respond and provide some additional help!*","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Riven Main","date":"2016-12-07T21:48:22.192+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I cannot log in and when I do, the client is very buggy and keeps disconnecting from the server, my internet connection is fine, I turned off my firewall etc. I just cant log in please help, it seems to be a client issue","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-07T22:14:51.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What error are you receiving, and what version of the client are you on?","replies":[{"poster":"xPeache","date":"2016-12-07T23:42:41.669+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"everytime i open my launchers its giving me error code 004 reopens my launcher tells me its opened an older version of the client to try and repatch and then fails to download the patch giving me the error code 004. plz halp","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lupart","date":"2016-12-25T14:39:05.665+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the last two days whenever I join a game, the champ selection page will appear blank.

No matter which client I try or how many times I click \"Initiate Full Repair\" and various other solutions, it always comes back at some point, forcing the players to either wait for me to try my best or remake. I have suffered 5 total matches where my team remade the game, resulting in Leaverbuster penalties and ranked losses. I now have a 20 minute Leaverbuster penalty for 5 games due to another recent remade ranked game, and I am very frustrated with League of Legends. Other issues I now have include being unable to launch directly into the new client, having to instead open up theo ld launcher (lol.launcher) and clicking Launch from there, and when I am fixing the connection issue in the Legacy (old) client, it says I am already in a game and prevents me from performing any actions. When I test out if this issue will happen or not in a custom game, it often has the game open in one window, with the alpha/new client open in another with the \"reconnect\" button for no reason. This issue has never happened before this point, and I hope someone will help me sort this out.
