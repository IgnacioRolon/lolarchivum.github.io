This thread is closed and completed!***\n\nHey all,\n\nWe&rsquo;ve been working towards [building a dedicated direct network across North America](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204246204-NA-Server-Roadmap#h2q2) to give players the most direct and efficient path to our servers as possible. We&#039;ve finished setting up all of our[ PoPs (Points of Presence)](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/0hVNFnPH-na-server-roadmap-update-pops-peering-and-the-north-bridge) in North America and we have also peered with the [most common ISPs](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204246204-NA-Server-Roadmap#h3) in NA. Doing so has allowed us to optimize connection paths for the majority of players around North America, but we also know there might be some holes or inefficient paths causing some of you to have higher ping than you did before.\n\nWe want to clear out any cobwebs from the rafters, and fix any inefficient paths that may have occurred since we worked on getting everything in place. If you&rsquo;ve experienced a ***consistent streak of higher-than-usual ping within the last 6 months***, reply to this thread and provide us the following information:\n\n***City/State/Location:***\n***ISP:***\n***Type of connection:***\n***Approx date when you first started seeing an increase in ping:***\n\n> ***Note:*** If your ISP is not on our list of peered ISPs, feel free to reply to this thread with the name, and we should be able to provide an update on whether we are in talks with them.\n\nThe following architects of the dedicated network, as well as our Player Support Tech Specialists, will be on hand for the next few hours to tackle your questions and see if we can identify and resolve issues with your ISP/location and your ping:\n\nRiot Foro\nRiot Lasiow\nR3lick\nKorensky\ndArtagnan\nSteeb\nMorgageddon","replies":[{"poster":"QuiteDwarff","date":"2015-08-07T16:11:05.524+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amarillo, Texas, USA\nSuddenlink\nBroadband\nJust started the increase in ping today.
