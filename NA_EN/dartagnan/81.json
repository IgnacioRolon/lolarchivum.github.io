Unfortunately, it would require us to take down the entire server to deploy the fix.  Because of that, right now we are looking to get this fix in when we deploy patch 6.10.\n\n>Once 6.10 is live, we'll update everyone on whether this should be fixed!\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nHey everyone,\n\nYesterday on May 5th, we noticed that some players were experiencing issues with creating club tags and clubs without tags were displaying as &quot;null&quot;.  We started to dig into this issue a bit deeper and found out that we made some back-end bug fixes to clubs earlier on the 5th that seemed to cause these [additional issues](http://i.imgur.com/HTisMpC.jpg).  \n\nIn an effort to resolve this, we disabled the ability to create club tags, but this also caused an [obscure error message](http://i.imgur.com/uAEQda5.png) to start popping up for all players talking about a processing error from the server.  This error message actually doesn&#039;t actually affect anything, but is incredibly flippin&#039; annoying.  Additionally, this may also cause the invite list while in lobby to not display properly.\n\nWe are working on getting a hotfix out in the near future to get this to stop appearing, but don&#039;t have an ETA just yet.  We&#039;ll let everyone know if anything changes!","replies":[{"poster":"SKT TezKar","date":"2016-05-10T13:02:41.005+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"is this acctually gonna get fixed ?","replies":[{"poster":"Apoeman","date":"2016-05-12T18:32:47.871+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Get this fixed pls.. **","replies":[]},{"poster":"REPXZ V2","date":"2016-05-16T12:32:34.718+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"10 days later , still nothing lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sup Bro Im Rob","date":"2016-05-09T23:35:34.386+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something is going on with the servers or something.
