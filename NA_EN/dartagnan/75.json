If you haven’t verified the email on your account, you won’t be able to log on.  So make sure to verify your email address! \n\nOn the other hand, you won’t need to login if you are submitting a ticket about:\n\n* Account Recoveries\n* Chargebacks/Unauthorized Charges\n\n***NOTE: If your account is banned/suspended, you ***CAN*** still sign on to submit a ticket***\n\n> #***WTF?  Why?***\n\nBecause Stone Cold said s--\n\nActually, because having two accounts is stupid.  There is no reason to have a special support account when we all already have a League of Legends account.  This should make things easier for all of you as well as us.\n\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to drop a reply!","replies":[{"poster":"YerrOwStaR","date":"2015-11-25T00:34:53.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reunited and it feels soooo goooood xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"slamor","date":"2015-11-25T00:31:04.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for implementing this change Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ada Wong","date":"2015-11-25T21:42:29.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Thanks Riot, but could you please make a proper Ban Appeals department ** that will truly investigate bans, I have no doubt that A lot of bans are issued correctly due to common toxicity mostly chat, but there are a couple of cases I have seen recently myself included of being accused of \"Intentional Feeding\" I admit that I did \"Feed\" I did bad, I submit two tickets closed out one because it wasn't going to get anywhere tried to open another, and all Riot wants to do is tell me about their statistics, and how I \"Intentionally Feed\" Having a 3-4 + year old account I would never do such but rather just had an Awful 3 day experience and went on a Tilt because of forced roles in the game with players who just don't want to listen, and I wasn't even toxic in chat I knew it was going to be toxic I muted everyone and played but did badly.\n\nNow I am permanently banned from the game and all the support does is accuse me of \"Intentional Feeding\" without even offering the chance to prove this was not the case, nor do I think support actually fully reads the ticket or understands rather than giving automated responses which is a problem especially when I know I did not just Intentionally Feed as has been told to me, If I was doing this I would have been banned long time ago.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2015-12-05T04:02:15.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the 1 universal account, I can no longer change my Support Name or Support Avatar.

I suppose I could just open a new ticket, but I'd like to think that keeping the same ticket (Since it's related to the same problem) can give the support team the logs and files that'd help them figure out the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-11-25T01:44:39.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One possible solution is to access your account on the website and simply change your email on your account to the zendesk email.  Once that ticket interaction is done, you can switch the email address back if you want.\n\nIf you do open a new ticket, the agent can always merge your new ticket with your old ticket, so you don't have to start over from scratch.\n\nLastly, you can always just reply to your ticket through email without ever logging in to the support site (for an already existing open ticket).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2015-11-25T01:43:07.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this, but I also like having 2 accounts, makes me feel cool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5hark","date":"2015-11-25T08:19:31.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"how about fixing the thunderlord's decree ratios while youre at it","replies":[]}]}
