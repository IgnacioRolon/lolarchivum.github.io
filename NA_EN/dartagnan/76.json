Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":37,"down_votes":25,"body":"Hey all,\n\nWith every new patch comes the possibility that some players may experience issues properly patching correctly. There are two main errors that can occur:\n\n> ***Launcher/Patcher never pops up, or disappears after you press \"LAUNCH\"***\n\nThis can be caused by corruption with the patcher itself or it failed to properly self-patch. Additionally, it may be due to some issues with the configuration of your computer system's permissions (meaning it can't properly save the files in the correct location). To resolve this, make sure to complete all the steps in our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!\n\n\n> ***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general \"Unspecified Error has occurred\" message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. Many of the most common Anti-virus programs [have already whitelisted LoL](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), however make sure to update yours to the latest version!\n\nAlso, even though you may have set specific exceptions in place before for your security program, League of Legends has gone through a major update. Therefore, your security program may recognize the old version of League of Legends, but not the new version. \n\nTo get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n> ***Still Having Issues Patching? Itching to get First Blood?***\n\nIf you are still unable to properly patch League of Legends, make sure to [submit a new ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to us here in Player Support where we can investigate your issue in-depth, and get it resolved. If you do submit a ticket, make sure to include the following:\n\n1) [Network Analysis ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq1)\n\n2) [Network Info Log](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq4)\n\n3) [Process List](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq3)\n","replies":[{"poster":"Kim Jong Krill","date":"2014-09-15T23:34:50.924+0000","up_votes":59,"down_votes":5,"body":"It gives that its scanning files and is just doing this forever, any solutions?","replies":[{"poster":"Castiel 12","date":"2014-09-26T07:22:23.902+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":4,"body":"Originally Posted by Tseu Tsey  View Post\nHi Guys\n\nI had the same error too, did what I did the last time I got this error and its worked \n\nGo to your: rads\\projects\\lol_patcher\\releases\\0.0.0.7......co py the S_OK file that you find there\n\nThen copy it into the following folders: rads\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\0.0.0.84\nrads\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\0.0.1.112\n\nThen try run your lol launcher again....worked for me \n\n\nTHIS WORKED FOR ME!!!

This basically resets the connection your computer has to the internet creating a temporary stable connection allowing the download to take place.\n\nThe only downside I see with this is the fact you have to repeat this step every time you see the (x kbps) declining.\n\nHope this helps some of you in the same situation! sorry if it doesn't help everyone, but it helped me!\n\nCheers!","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheChaosPanda","date":"2014-09-16T04:07:00.358+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sooo i'm using the internet that is \"broken\" on my side, to post on the forums.
