We are currently planning further actions to make sure that this doesn't happen again.\n\n>Everyone should now be able to access the client!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey all,\n\nEarlier today at around 9:55AM PDT, we noticed a sharp increase in the number of errors players were getting when attempting to Login (or patch).  Generally, this manifests as a RADS error after entering your login credentials.  This is intermittent and does not happen every single time, but it would block you from entering the client.  Currently, this is affecting all players in Riot regions globally.\n\nThrough our immediate investigation, we&#039;ve discovered that the problem mainly exists somewhere on the internet backbone and are attempting to work with the backbone provider to get it resolved. We have all hands on deck digging into this issue and attempting to get it resolved as quickly as we can.\n\nMore updates to follow once we have them!","replies":[{"poster":"isolate plz","date":"2016-05-16T20:44:18.561+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot ur match history is glitched I have a talon game played and it doesn't show up on client Ive logged in again and it didn't fix it","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-05-16T20:43:32.876+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"everytime I see you guy say you have all hands on deck all I wanna say is\n\nGet off my deck","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazyRiceFarmer","date":"2016-05-16T20:50:51.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played an hour ago.
