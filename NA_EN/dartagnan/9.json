I have seen several posts about players still experiencing issues with abilities or champion movement delayed.  This sounds like it may be a different issue entirely, and may be due to an unstable connection/Packet Loss.  Given its hard to say, make sure that you try the steps in our [Connection Issues guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), which should help to eliminate this as a possible root cause to look at other possibilities!**\n\n**If you are still experiencing these weird delays, or if your still having problems with your clicks, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!  One of our Tech Specialists should be able to work with you to get this resolved!**\n\n**********************\n\n**Update 2/3: We did deploy a hotfix that should have resolved this issue!  Let us know if your still seeing these same issues!**\n \n\n \nHey everyone,\n\nThere have been a lot of reports from everyone experiencing delays in clicking - either the click will not be recognized or occur 2-3 seconds later. Suffice to say, this is annoying as shit and makes the game incredibly difficult to play. We are actively investigating this issue and are working on getting a fix ASAP.\n\nI'll make sure to update this thread once we get some further information!","replies":[{"poster":"Sherlock Clones","date":"2015-01-30T02:34:20.071+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"omg thank god a rioter finally responded to this issue....plz fix.

I seem to be finding that rather than clicks not registering at all it is actually the 'un-clicking' of the mouse button which is not registering. This accounts for pathing issues that people have found as the game believes you are holding down the right  mouse button and therefore tries to walk your champions towards the pointer. The also explains why people think further clicks are not being registered as you have to click repeatedly until you get a successful button un-click to continue with normal play. I have also noted that this bug only seems to be occurring with the right mouse button, and pressing the left button will cause the right mouse button to 'un-click'. This issue also only seems to appear on SR and not on TTL. \n\nTLDR: It is the release of the mouse button that is not being recognised, not the depression. \n*******************","replies":[]},{"poster":"Angelo Isaiah","date":"2015-02-03T05:21:23.806+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just played a game and absolutely nothing has changed. The **click/skill/smart-ping delay** is still occurring, and it gets progressively worse the longer the game goes on. There also seems to be some sort of **frame rate malfunction** even though my FPS displays as 40~55 at all times in the top right hand corner. My ping also stays at a consistent 80ms. I have a Logitech G700 and have tried lowering both the **DPI** and the **Polling Frequency** from max settings to minimum settings and everything in between and not a single difference was made. If this comes off as whining or complaining then I apologize because that isn't my intent. I only wish to inform you that, while some people seem to have had the issue solved with the deployment of the hotfix, others of us are still dealing with it! So please, Riot, don't put this on the back burner just yet!! I understand that this is probably an extremely annoying and possibly complicated problem to deal with, so as long as I know you're working on it I'm satisfied. Don't let these impatient people get to you ;) .\n\nGood luck Rito!
