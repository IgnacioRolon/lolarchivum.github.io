For other regions, we are still investigating a full resolution.\n\n>If you are in NA and still experiencing Patching Issues, it is probably a different issue altogether!  Be sure to check out our [Help and Support Board](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/osqw6G4M) or our [Support Site](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) for help!\n\n------------------------------\n\n>#Update 5:15pm:\n\n> We believe we narrowed down the root cause of this issue: There was a misconfiguration on the Patcher Servers for players on either Windows XP and Windows 10.  Essentially, anytime you boot up the patcher, it checks to see if you have the latest patch.  With the misconfiguration, it would instantly pop-up an error message the moment it checks, regardless if you have the latest patch.\n\n>We're still heads down working on a complete fix.  I'll update everyone once I learn anything more!\n\n------------------------------\n\n\n>#Update 4:05pm:\n\n> There is a temporary work-around that works for some players:  If you are getting this \"unspecified error\", make sure to dismiss the error by pressing \"continue\" and you should be able to Launch normally immediately after without the error popping up again.\n\n------------------------------\n\nHey everyone,\n\nWe&#039;ve seen a bunch of reports of players getting errors (\"Unspecified Error\") commonly associated when you download a new patch, but for most players (NA, EUW, EUNE) hasn&#039;t actually patched yet.  \n\nThe correct reaction is most definitely:  Da fuq?\n\nWe&#039;re currently digging into this issue right now, but we don&#039;t have much to share just yet.  Some individuals on our patcher team initially started to look into it, but as the the investigation started rolling, we&#039;ve been dragging more and more in Katamari Damacy style.  \n\nOnce I get some more information from our teams, I&#039;ll make sure to update everyone!","replies":[{"poster":"MSUXGjsWYR","date":"2016-08-23T23:29:31.636+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"My mum has just had to tie me down to my bed this is making me go crazy, I'm hitting my head off the wall, what happens if I miss out on the chroma skins going on sale for IP what will i do with my life?
