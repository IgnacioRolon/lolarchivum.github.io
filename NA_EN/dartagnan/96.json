Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nNew Heartseeker skins?  Subtle hints from our significant others about &#039;reservations&#039;?  Mad googling for gifts?  This patch is definitely going to be during either the most loved or hated of holidays, Valentines Day:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/aGL0By1.jpg\n\nGet back to making sweaty, hot, passionate clicking with League by following our tantalizing guide if you aren&#039;t able to patch properly!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#***Updated Client (Beta Client)***\n\n>*** Error: &quot;League of Legends has encountered a problem. Please re-install League alpha client or try again.&quot;***\n\nThis issue rears its ugly head if something went wrong in either the updating or the installation process of the Client Update. The solution is to complete a full and clean reinstallation of League by following [**this guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) to a T.\n\n>***My IP Balance in the Store is incorrect***\n\nThere have been some issues with the client pulling correct IP balances. Some players have been able to resolve this by launching into the Legacy Client and making a single purchase to resolve this. If this does not work, hit us up in a [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we&#039;ll work together to resolve this.\n\n>***Weird or corrupt formatting on login screen for Mac players***\n\nIf you're running Lion or an older operating system version then you may run into these weird visual problems.  Updating your OSX to a more recent version or Sierra should resolve this.\n\nYou can update your OS version to the latest available from Apple to resolve this problem:\n\n* Click the Apple icon on the top left of the screen, and choose \"Software Update...\"\n* The App store will open and display any software updates available for OS X and the App Store. OS X updates will be at the top of the list.\n* Click \"Update All\" to install all available software updates. If prompted, enter an admin name and password, then your Apple ID and password\n* If required, restart your system\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#***Legacy Client***\n\n>***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n>***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. To get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!","replies":[{"poster":"Hufflepuff","date":"2017-02-10T18:58:31.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I should've mentioned: I'm using a PC (running on auto-updated Windows 10). Sorry -- Didn't notice the screenshots were from a Mac.

The FPS is choppy and drops to 55FPS at spawn and up to slightly past the first allied turret. After that it is fine, totally playable at my self-set 80FPS cap. That wasn't always the case, but for the most part, it held true. While we were fighting near those choppy areas, the FPS would not be choppy, strangely enough. Rift is choppy throughout, regardless of location or fighting. \n\nI tried the legacy client, despite being on a PC, and it didn't seem to change anything.
