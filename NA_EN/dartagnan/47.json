Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":12,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nLong holiday weekend means one thing, tons of League.  Since there will be plenty of time to catch up on some penta-kills, we want to make sure you have no problems getting League fully patched up.  Make sure to follow the steps below if you encounter any issues!\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n> #***Temporarily Uninstall Ad-Aware Anti-virus/Firewall***\n\nWe've received many different reports that Ad-Aware is currently blocking League of Legends from starting and opening correctly.  Make sure to temporarily uninstall this piece of software to launch League of Legends correctly, or consider switching to a different Anti-virus/Firewall.\n\nTo help us get this problem eliminated, [make sure to reach out to Ad-Aware directly](http://www.lavasoft.com/support/supportcenter/) and let them know about the issue!\n\n> #***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n> #***Patcher never pops up, or disappears after you press &quot;LAUNCH&quot;***\n\nThis can be caused by corruption with the patcher itself or it failed to properly self-patch. Additionally, it may be due to some issues with the configuration of your computer system&#039;s permissions (meaning it can&#039;t properly save the files in the correct location). To resolve this, make sure to complete all the steps in our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!\n\n\n> #***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. Many of the most common Anti-virus programs [have already whitelisted LoL](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), however make sure to update yours to the latest version!\n\nAlso, even though you may have set specific exceptions in place before for your security program, League of Legends has gone through a major update. Therefore, your security program may recognize the old version of League of Legends, but not the new version. \n\nTo get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, and you still do not see the glorious orange &#039;LAUNCH&#039; button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!

While it may seem like a lot of people are having issues in this thread, compared to the dozens of millions of players who have patched without problem, the issue is more than likely local.
