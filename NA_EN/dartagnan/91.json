Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hey all,\n\nHave you been introduced to the Warwick ARH-WOOOOOOO meme yet?  Generally sick of reading ARH-WOOOOOOO on random threads? Well, too bad.  Cause this patch is going to bring them back in spades with the Warwick rework:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/U78xvxE.png\n\nIf you&#039;re looking to give him a try so you can make the ADC&#039;s life even more miserable by CC&#039;ing them from a few screens away, we don&#039;t want the patch to slow you down!  Complete the steps below if you are having any issues!  If they don't help, leave us a comment!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#***Updated Client (Beta Client)***\n\n>*** Error: &quot;League of Legends has encountered a problem. Please re-install League alpha client or try again.&quot;***\n\nThis issue rears its ugly head if something went wrong in either the updating or the installation process of the Client Update. The solution is to complete a full and clean reinstallation of League by following [**this guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) to a T.\n\n>***My IP Balance in the Store is incorrect***\n\nThere have been some issues with the client pulling correct IP balances. Some players have been able to resolve this by launching into the Legacy Client and making a single purchase to resolve this. If this does not work, hit us up in a [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we&#039;ll work together to resolve this.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#***Legacy Client***\n\n>***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n>***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. To get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!","replies":[{"poster":"GloomySkies","date":"2017-01-30T13:54:57.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having trouble with the \"Unspecified error at 33%\" problem as well since the release of 7.2.

What I'm trying to say is the bug splat is NOT consistent. It'll just happen once every 2 or 3 games.\n\nI bought a gaming PC about 2 months ago and I've still been struggling to get this league client to work I've even gone through hours of surfing the internet and tried everything literally everything from wrench mans toolbox and stuff to connection issues and all the KB Articles.It's not a resolution problem as I've even tried that one too!!. I've uninstalled it so many times and Actually done it clean so there are NO REGISTRY FILES LEFT OVER no traces of the game Then reinstall go into a game then get the bug splat and then get the leaver busters. Got nothing open no anti -viruses disabled firewall windows defender that includes any sort of anti-virus that might be the cause of this. My brother doesn't have these problems at all! so i doubt it's anything to do with the internet but still tried those Internet related things like changing to a public DNS or lol dns and then flushing it tried the hex tech repair tool and all kind of different things. I even made sure I had the programs required and made sure they're not outdated the same with the drivers they are all up to date. The only reason why I got a gaming PC in the first place was to play league and I can't even do that :( .It really is a shame that after all of this I still can't play ranked due to the fact I'd just get bug splats at champion select. I really don't know what to do anymore I even have a ticket here providing all the information you rioters will need so Please go check the ticket out for like dxdiag and stuff rather than asking me as it'll just delay the process.
