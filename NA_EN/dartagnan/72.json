This is known as clamping, and occurs when you're up for a Tier promotion but your MMR is far lower than expected. You can read a bit more about how and why this happens in the Season 3 FAQ - http://competitive.na.leagueoflegends.com/season-3-faq.\r\n\r\n**I won a game but lost LP / I lost a game but still gained LP**\r\n\r\n1. This is a visual display bug that can occur when the LP system is delayed. You did not actually lose LP for a game you won, it's just showing a previous update, and you will still get your points as normal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---***Leaver Issues / Bad Players***---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**I have a leave, but it wasn't on purpose**\r\n\r\n1.
