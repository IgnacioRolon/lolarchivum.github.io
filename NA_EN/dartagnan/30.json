Anti-virus issues with 4.17 patch","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nWe have seen many reports of players experiencing false-positives with the latest League of Legends patch when AVG or Avast! are running in the background.  ***Just to confirm, these are false-positives!***  There are no hidden virus's, malware, or other harmful files found within the patch.  We are working to make sure that this is resolved, but in the meantime there are some steps you can take to resolve this:\n\n1) Make sure to update your Anti-virus! If it has been a while since you have updated it, it might be causing the false-positives. \n\n2) Make sure to add the following exceptions to your Anti-virus:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/26932010-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq2\n\n3)  If all else fails, try temporarily disabling your Anti-virus until League of Legends properly updates.  Once updated, turn your Anti-virus back on and you should not encounter any further issues.\n\nIf anyone has any further questions about this, don't hesitate to [submit a request](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) over to us and we'd be glad to help further!","replies":[]}
