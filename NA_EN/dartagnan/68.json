We will update this thread when we have more information!*\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n***EDIT July 1st:***  *Mystery Champion rewards are still in the process of distribution for all Riot Regions.  There is no specific ETA as to when it will be completed, but we will update this once it has finished!*\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey all,\n\nWe have received a lot of questions regarding how the Pool Party rewards will work exactly.  There is a lot of information that already exists out there, but here is everything in a single place:\n\n> **Level 1 -- Team Up IP Rewards**\n\n* These rewards were unlocked and given to players during the Pool Party Team Up week (June 14th, 23:59 PDT - June 21st 23:59 PDT).  Once the event ended, the Team Up bonus expired.\n\n> **Level 2 -- Tons of Discounts**\n\nFrom June 25th 23:59 PDT - July 2nd 23:59 PDT, the following sales/promotions are available:\n\n* Pool Party Palooza Bundle available in the Client Store\n* Frozen Pool Party Bundle available in the Client Store\n* 50% off the RP price of the original Pool Party Champions and Skins\n* 25% off the ARAM Battle Boost\n* All T-shirts in our Merchandise Store discounted by 30%\n\n> **Level 3 -- Pool Party Icon **\n\n* Any account level is eligible\n* You needed to have contributed one point (sent a gift, or won a premade 5 Matchmade Game) during the Pool Party Team Up Week (June 14th, 23:59 PDT - June 21st 23:59 PDT)\n* You are ineligible for this reward if you have received multiple severe Leaver Buster Penalties, a chat/ranked restriction (of any length), or a 2 week suspension within the past 6 months.\n* **This reward distribution has been completed**!  If you are convinced you met this specific criteria, but have yet to receive one*, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can investigate!\n\n**Note: The Icon may be buried in your list of Icons.  Make sure to check this list thoroughly to ensure you've received it!*\n\n> **Level 3 (con't) -- Mystery Champion**\n\n* Any account level is eligible\n* You need to have registered your Facebook account to the Friend Discovery feature in your Friends List by June 28th 23:59 PDT, and remain registered for 24 hours.  You **did not** need to have added any friends using this feature to be eligible. \n* If you have less than 10 champions left un-purchased and therefore are ineligible for a Mystery Champion, then you will be awarded a Mystery Skin instead\n\n> **Level 4 -- Pool Party Minions**\n\n* Currently live since patch 5.12 was deployed\n* Only on Summoner's Rift (Any mode)\n* Will be disabled once Patch 5.13 is deployed.\n\n> **Level 5 -- Party IP Weekend**\n\n* Active from June 25th 00:01 PDT - June 28th 23:59 PDT\n* Applies to any queue/game mode in which you can receive IP rewards (or have received more than 0 IP)\n* No additional rewards for Solo queue'ing\n* Rewards for parties of 2 or more is as follows\n\nParty of 2 - 100% Bonus\nParty of 3 - 150% Bonus\nParty of 4 - 200% Bonus\nParty of 5 - 300% Bonus\n\n* If you have an active IP Boost, it worked additively to the Party IP Weekend.  For example, if you earned a base 100 IP in a match during the Party IP weekend while having an IP Boost, this breaks down as follows:\n\n100 Base IP\n+\nDay IP Boost = Base IP (100) x 2 (Per Win boost simply adds 100 IP, regardless of base IP earned)\n+\nParty IP Weekend = Base IP (100) x Bonus size amount (as an example, lets say 100%)\n=\n500 IP\n\n> **Level 6 -- Pool Party Mundo**\n\n* Not achieved","replies":[{"poster":"Rito Senpa1","date":"2015-07-01T02:12:00.161+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"Hi , I played  5 premade games and won them with my Friends yet I didnt get the icon , im afraid that it didnt count the point(s) that I got \ncuz I didnt get the Icon , Yet my friend got it and he was ( as far as i know ) in evrey 5 premade game  And he got the icon \ni hope that it doesnt happen with the Mystery Champion Too \n\nAnd i have a game that im sure we played as 5 and won it \nso why didnt i get my icon ? \nand will i get the Mystery Champion ?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-07-01T04:14:18.716+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are several reasons why you may have been made ineligible, as seen here:\n\n> You are ineligible for this reward if you have received multiple severe Leaver Buster Penalties, a chat/ranked restriction (of any length), or a 2 week suspension within the past 6 months.\n\nIf you don't think you hit these requirements, and don't see the icon, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can investigate it a bit further!","replies":[{"poster":"BrokenKaos03","date":"2015-07-01T06:33:31.607+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dArtagnan,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=3VhOeAbf,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2015-07-01T04:14:18.716+0000)\n>\n> There are several reasons why you may have been made ineligible, as seen here:\n> \n> If you don't think you hit these requirements, and don't see the icon, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can investigate it a bit further!\n\nthe leaver buster thing is whack and needs fixed. game crashes should not affect you. afking yes, quitting, yes, dcing due to game crash, computer issues and reconnecting should erase any penalty flags on you as in those are not controlable.","replies":[{"poster":"Xayhri","date":"2015-07-02T01:24:31.321+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"I completely agree!

It's not fair to me or anyone else that technology can have a hissy fit when ever it wants. I think toxicity or rage quitting is a much better reason to report than a technical error. I know other's get problems too so i don't report unless i really feel like they did so intentionally and are not sorry for it at all. I try to make sure everyone know ally and enemy that there was a problem and that it was not my intention to have been disconnected from the game.

Any computer, no matter how beast it is or new, has the possibility of something going wrong.  Maybe it locks up, or the power goes out, cat chews on the cord, whatever it may be.  This is why we never punish someone for only disconnecting only a couple of times.  LeaverBuster penalties are only given to accounts where there are consistent pattern of disconnections.\n\nIf it is due to your hardware, then a lot of this is out of your control, as your intention is not to leave.  However, you are still ruining the gaming experience of 9 other players every single time this happens.  The penalties are there to give you time to help resolve whatever computer hardware issues you may be having.  \n\nThe solution may not be simply buying a new computer, but it may be simple maintenance steps you complete yourself.  For crashing specifically, make sure that you complete all of the steps in our [Crashing Guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes)  I hope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"SWINDLING Turtel","date":"2015-07-02T20:22:00.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"is someone going to mention that over 50 people have 5 sets of 20min que time due to riots cable being cut? you say that we need to make sure our cable/internet and computers are not the ones causing the problem, now riot has confirmed that and 50 plays are mad b/c the one time we are right, you guys wont do anything about it.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-07-02T20:53:03.353+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There appears to be some confusion here, and I want to clarify:\n\nThe Fiber Optic cables that were cut, were the cables that connect the internet across North America and are maintained by ISP back-bone companies.  League of Legends traffic also uses these lines (they are not 'our' lines), which is why players in the Southwest were impacted so heavily.\n\nAdditionally, we re-routed traffic as best we could, causing higher than normal ping.  However, this did not directly cause any inherent stability issues.  If you played a game at the exact moment the cable was cut, you may have experienced a disconnection.  However, a single disconnect will not result in any LeaverBuster penalty.","replies":[{"poster":"SWINDLING Turtel","date":"2015-07-02T21:43:47.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"so your still pulling the, \"not our fault\" act? *claps hands* \"well played detective, well played\" You did counter my argument, but this still doesn't make things right, over 50 players received penalty due to a problem, they did not cause, and i will stand up for those people, if there's nothing you can do, then tell me, tell your supervisors to tell me, tell their supervisors to tell me, But when it comes down to the end of the day, it will have been a sad day in riot support history. All these people came together and asked that you may at least think about setting up loss prevention in ranked games for ~11:00am june, 30th, yet no one really responded to the forum that got ~60 bumps. This baffles me, one supporter even claimed riot would wait till it blew over and act like nothing even happened. Sadly this has ended up becoming true, i'm not shaming you, your not riot. I apologize if i made it come out this way, not mad at you, riot just needs to work a little harder on making the small things of LoL better instead of pumping out new stuff constantly. (by stuff i mean, skins ( that most of the community makes anyways) new champs, etc.))\n\nhere are many forums talking about this very such thing: \nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/w0sAEjE8-what-the-hell-demotion-not-my-fault\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/P37KGvdu-unfair-leaverbusters\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/sOoWqqjs-riot-just-lost-my-series-cannot-connect-to-server\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/lpkcGvLr-fix-leaverbuster-petition\n\nThis being the main forum i'm speaking of: (this was only a partial list)\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/YEhIYEmJ-please-set-ranked-games-to-loss-prevented-for-1100-am-est-063115?comment=002b","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-07-02T22:59:44.643+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to emphasize again that leaving one or two games will never result in LeaverBuster penalties.  Shit sometimes happens, and we know that.  There are always things that are out of your control.  That is why penalties only exist after there is already a consistent pattern of leaving games.  \n\nEncountering a disconnect due to the Fiber Optic cables being cut would not have triggered a penalty, unless you already have a consistent pattern of leaving games.\n\nAs for the visibility, we did put up messaging in our Server Status Page as well as the ticker about players that will encounter higher ping due to the cables being cut.  This is definitely something we actively tried to communicate about, and worked with the IPS back-bones to ensure it was fixed ASAP!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DUBECTRIX","date":"2015-07-01T15:55:27.109+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does a low priority queue count towards me not getting the icon?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Relentless Rogue","date":"2015-07-01T00:46:22.950+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"So for clarification, if I only am missing one champion ( {{champion:114}} in my case) I get that champion unlocked automatically right?","replies":[{"poster":"Sky Shadow","date":"2015-07-01T00:50:53.665+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Relentless Rogue,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=3VhOeAbf,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-01T00:46:22.950+0000)\n>\n> So for clarification, if I only am missing one champion ( {{champion:114}} in my case) I get that champion unlocked automatically right?\n\nNo, you will receive a Myster Skin instead.\n\nYou must have at least 10 champions that are not unlocked to receive a Mystery Champion.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-07-01T01:25:41.035+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edited post for further clarity!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sky Shadow","date":"2015-07-01T00:49:18.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dArtagnan,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=3VhOeAbf,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-06-30T23:49:36.318+0000)\n>\n> Pool Party Mundo\n> * Not achieved\n\nDo you mind if I ask how close we were to getting it?\n\nI haven't seen anyone comment or give us a number yet.

Even though, as you said, not everyone participated in the pool party event I still think a client thing would not be a bad idea. Another idea is communicating it through the facebook page since most likely many of the people who linked their facebook accounts probably have liked the League page on it. It is more of a thing of being as efficient as possible in communicating the message to as many people as possible. Twitter would also be useful through the main riotgames twitter and not just the support twitter since again, not as many people follow the latter twitter account.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2015-06-30T23:59:33.206+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm guessing we'll see the Pool Party minions again someday.It would be a shame to only see them for one patch,then never again.","replies":[{"poster":"Bodkins Odds","date":"2015-07-01T01:09:51.812+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully they'll change it in a future patch so that if your whole team is using Pool Party skins then you'll get Pool Party Minions on your team.","replies":[{"poster":"James T Karkat","date":"2015-07-01T17:22:15.034+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BodkinsOdds,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=3VhOeAbf,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-07-01T01:09:51.812+0000)\n>\n> Hopefully they'll change it in a future patch so that if your whole team is using Pool Party skins then you'll get Pool Party Minions on your team.\n\nI kinda doubt that will happen often","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"baljasweg9001","date":"2015-07-01T00:03:17.494+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we have minion skins like the pool party minions that would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"DamnationsHound","date":"2015-07-01T07:20:33.160+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, that would be so good.\nMaybe also have event minion skins, like Halloween or Snow Day","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Keyrtyn","date":"2015-07-02T07:29:02.312+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes the rewards are still being distributed, BUT it would be a very good idea if Riot made an actual news update about why its taking so long and how things are progressing.\n\nthat way ppl will stop freaking out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BrVInd Taibaner","date":"2015-07-01T23:27:53.837+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I own all champions and I'm missing just 9 skins (I can't receive any mystery skins).

You guys set an ABSURD goal for us to hit for the Mundo skin, then you refuse to give anyone the official numbers of how close we were as many people have requested. What exactly do you have to hide? Did we actually hit it, but it was decided by your superiors to lie to the community because if you gave everyone free skins it would hurt the potential money that you guys would have made off the bundle?\n\nMeanwhile the goal you guys set for yourselves of \"By the 1st\" you can't even meet. I have no idea why you guys waited until only yesterday to start the distribution as you've had over a week to start the distribution. By saying \"By the 1st\" it could have been any time before then, yet you chose the last minute? Why? Now look at the situation you're put in. I understand problems happen, but damn. Things like this can easily be avoided with better preparation and I feel sorry for your PR team because they are the ones getting hammered for it by the community.\n\nI'm trying to stay positive through this whole ordeal, but it is a bit frustrating at how this event has been handled so far. This is probably the worst handled event I have ever experienced in an online game ever. I am thankful for Riot for keeping us updated and continuing to give them out and I apologize for the frustration, but I had to get that off my chest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HonorForAll","date":"2015-07-06T03:28:03.281+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still haven't received my mystery champ yet...

There are millions of accounts that you have to go through and you don't want to mess up. But it's not like this event happened yesterday, it's been like 2 weeks. I think that there should have been further planning for this, especially since you gave the entire community a date and you knew that you were going to possibly end up having to do this when you came up with the idea of this event. I appreciate your gifting, it's just that it's very frustrating to wait all day for it and not get it when it was promised for today.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miel Vanhaider","date":"2015-07-01T21:10:13.872+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It says Pool Party minions are in summoners rift any mode.
