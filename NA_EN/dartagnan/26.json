Thanks to your posts here we were able to track a hiccup in the system that caused a group of North American players that have not receive their points yet.  \n\nFor now, we have been able to manually award the RP for credit card purchases, but other payment methods are taking a little longer to credit properly.  Rest assured we have &#039;Top Men&#039; working on getting the rest of the RP purchases completed!","replies":[]}
