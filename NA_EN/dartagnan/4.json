PS cordially invites you to a Gentleman's game...","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":25,"down_votes":2,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/bvnnmCz.jpg\n**PS - 3 / Community - 2**  Player Support takes the series!!!\n\nHey all,\n\nBetween the crazy Ezreal double-kills with his ults, the out of control Cho'gath fast stacking, or the unstopable Morgageddon Karma play, the URF games today were absolutely insane!  We couldn't have nearly as much fun with all of you playing and chatting with us on stream, so thank you so much for spending time with us! We don't have another even planned just yet, but we'll let everyone know once we do!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Game 5!**\n\nGAME END!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RHXmw95.png\n\n**MVP:** Eggstealer!  They couldn't dodge a wrench, so they couldn't dodge a ball!  {{champion:134}} \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Game 4!**\n\nGAME END!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RHXmw95.png\n\n**MVP:** Crysofear for the on nom's {{champion:31}}!!!  Feasting all day!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Game 3!**\n\nGAME END!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RHXmw95.png\n\n**MVP:** I Dukes! {{champion:67}}  For surviving the onsalaught that was Riot Morgageddon and coming out with the most kills!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Game 2!**\n\nGAME END!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bfILTp0.png\n\n**MVP:** Strawbiri coming in with the plays {{champion:35}} .  Time to be featured on 'The Penta'?!?!  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Game 1!**\n\nGAME END!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bfILTp0.png\n\n\n**MVP:** Hellioning!!!  Froggen...is that you?!?! {{champion:34}}\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey everyone!\n\nWe know that everyone was looking forward to the exciting turn based NURF combat, but Crit-Strike Animation Appreciation Day will have to wait! With the skumbag induction of ham into the servers, URF has been re-born and our fingers are cramped and raw from the amount of punishment inflicted on our keyboards. After icing down over the weekend, Player Support is challenging the community to some good ol’ fashioned URF games!\n\nWe’re planning on starting the insanity tomorrow, April 6th, from 3:00pm – 6:00pm PDT! Also, based on the feedback from our last event, we’ll have a stream for this one! It'll be fairly basic this time around, but we want your feedback on how we can improve it further!\n\n[Here's the link to the stream!](http://www.twitch.tv/riotsupport)\n\nIn-between games, I will be updating this discussion with the Lobby Name and Password.  Once its filled, the game will start!","replies":[{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-04-06T19:42:31.360+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://downloadwallpaperhd.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Memes-Challenge-Accepted-Wallpaper-HD.jpg\n\n{{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}}","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-04-06T19:57:28.868+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"errrrm......that number of Urgots is the same number of Acid Hunters I will take in the face >.> ....","replies":[{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-04-06T21:05:41.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dArtagnan,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=EU7kydAW,comment-id=00090000,timestamp=2015-04-06T19:57:28.868+0000)\n>\n> errrrm......that number of Urgots is the same number of Acid Hunters I will take in the face >.> ....\n\nS'all good dArtagnan, I'll likely take just as much rockets, bombas, and bananas to the face :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2015-04-06T22:53:27.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urgot to be kidden me","replies":[{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-04-06T23:26:03.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=usul1202,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=EU7kydAW,comment-id=00090001,timestamp=2015-04-06T22:53:27.374+0000)\n>\n> Urgot to be kidden me\n\nHaha, yeah.
