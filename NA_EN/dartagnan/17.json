Where did they go?!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":27,"down_votes":74,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nSeveral players have noticed that content they were gifted has been removed from their accounts.  If this content was removed, its not usually due to an error regarding the account.  Typically, this content is removed due to gifts being sent as a result of fraudulent activity.  There are two main ways this occurs:\n\n1)  If a player participates in Refer-A-Friend fraud to acquire IP or RP, then any champions/skins gifted with this IP or RP are removed.\n\n2)  If a player purchases RP and gifts content with it, and subsequently issues a chargeback for the money spent on that RP, we will remove that content.\n\nIf you believe that content you have purchased/received on your account has gone missing and is not due to either of these two scenarios, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!  We can look into your account and investigate further!","replies":[{"poster":"Jiggawatz","date":"2014-12-07T16:48:42.431+0000","up_votes":110,"down_votes":9,"body":"So let me get this straight, you give thousands and thousands of Rp, to the tune of over 80000 rp away every day in \"tournaments\" like victorious gaming, where people smurf in bronze to earn craploads of rp, but your main concern is to punish people who got scammed by a refer a friend bot.... taking away the skins from not only them, but any friend they gifted, and not even giving them the option to pay for those gifts using other RP.

I only own a few skins so i remember exactly how I got them.  When first reading this, like many others i got very frustrated.  I decided to take a look, fearing i would loose some of the skins I bought or ones that i knew I got from my friends legitimately.  I was ecstatic to find that all my legitimate skins were still there.  I know for a fact that my friends friend was involved in the RAF botting and got a ton of rewards from it.  With this, he gave everyone gift skins (at the time I was not aware how bad it was to do that).  These were the only skins i had taken away, which shows its not \"random\"  Riot is finding exactly what the player was given illegitimately and taking it away.  I have two MAJOR problems with it.  For one, i only got a generalized message about what happened.  I had no idea what i lost and i realize that for people with a crap ton of skins, it would be a pain in the butt to sort out.  Is it really THAT hard to tell you what the player had removed.  I get that there are a bunch of people that this message goes out to, but lets be honest, this isn't affecting the majority of League players.  The other problem is that this is targeting the people that received the gifts who had not control over the sending.  What you are doing is trying to cut down this \"tree\" of illegitimate rewards.  Every time another person is brought into it, another \"branch\" sprouts.  All you are doing is cutting these branches, which will ultimately grow back.  You need to attack the \"roots,\" the people that engage in the botting.  Ban them or take away their skins and champions. They broke the summoner e, they should be punished.  People will often trade mystery gifts because it is a cheaper way to recieve skins.  One person may give a gift payed in legitimate RP while the other's gift is payed illegitimately.  With this \"system\" the person that actually bought RP from you is getting punished, way to make then want to buy from you again.  All you have to to is take away skins from the person that's actually breaking the code (what an idea).  Now all these people that did the botting are waltzing away with their new skins and to this day they have not been punished.  You've made a new RAF system to stop the botting, GREAT... wait... that just prevents it in the future.  You now do this, take away the gifted skins from people that may have not even known it was illegitimately earned... still not hurting the botters.  You guys need to do something that actually punishes the botters for what they did.  Neither of those two things did that.  Banning them for a week inst gonna do anything.  Make them unable to receive gifts and take away their illegitimately earned skins.  Make them unable to earn IP until they have made up the amount they earned from the botting.  Its really not rocket science, just set your minds to it and do it.  All THIS is accomplishing is making players that actually buy your RP close their wallets to you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Renkid","date":"2014-12-11T15:48:31.061+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's bad enough you take 30 of my skins away with no warning but now you even take my rp and all the ip i saved up?

I have been supporting this game for 4 years, me and my boyfriend purchased more than 100 skins during that time. The skins that got deleted were gifted to me by my friends for Xmas. I dont know how they got their rp was it fraud or not but even if it was I dont think it is fair you should be punishing innocent people who havent done anything. You can take away skins/champs/etc and rp from fraud from the people who did it but deleting skins from everyone else is pure greediness. Riot , I have been always defending LoL from friends who quitted and bullsh1tted it but I think they might be right. Only think you care about is making profits. There are many other mobas like Smite for example where every month there is Gem events ( equal to RP ). My friends that play it for 2 years got 40 skins for free and here you just rob us and make new skins but never gift RP or make events for us to acquire it.\n\nAnother thing is , even if people did fraud by RAF system and got RP you lose nothing. Yes , its true you dont profit from that RP but you do not lose anything because most likely people who did fraud would never purchase your RP anyways.\n\nIt is highly likely all comments here will be ignored but if you do read them you should really reflect on what greedy bastards you have become!
