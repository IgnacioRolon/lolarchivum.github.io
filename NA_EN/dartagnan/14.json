Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hey everyone!\n\nAs we all ice down our fingers and get some wrist exercises in from the Party IP weekend, we need to be prepared for the next patch!  We know some of you may have issues that crop up during the patching process, and we want to make sure you can get back onto the Rift ASAP.  Take some time to check out the steps below, which should resolve most issues.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n> ***Launcher/Patcher never pops up, or disappears after you press \"LAUNCH\"***\n\nThis can be caused by corruption with the patcher itself or it failed to properly self-patch. Additionally, it may be due to some issues with the configuration of your computer system's permissions (meaning it can't properly save the files in the correct location). To resolve this, make sure to complete all the steps in our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!\n\n\n> ***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general \"Unspecified Error has occurred\" message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. Many of the most common Anti-virus programs [have already whitelisted LoL](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), however make sure to update yours to the latest version!\n\nAlso, even though you may have set specific exceptions in place before for your security program, League of Legends has gone through a major update. Therefore, your security program may recognize the old version of League of Legends, but not the new version. \n\nTo get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, and you still do not see the glorious orange 'LAUNCH' button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!  Rioters as well as Wrenchmen volunteers will be on hand to respond and provide some additional help!*","replies":[{"poster":"Blaynesfurd","date":"2015-09-02T21:21:27.935+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"My client gets to 32% then an unexpected error pops up and says to check the logs for more details.

I figured i'll just let it take its course but after waiting for around 30 mins reaching to about 10k+ and with no sign of it ending. I started looking around for possible fixes, nothing really worked for me so i started to messing around with the LoL folders and i ended up getting it to work again ._. and i figured it may help some people as well, though i'm not entirely sure if it'll work for everybody. (PS. sorry if this didn't help you)\n\n1) Right click on LoL icon/ Open file location/RADS/projects okay when you get into Projects there should be \"Lol_air_client\" and \"LoL_air_config_na\". There should also be \"Lol_game_client and \"LoL_game_client_en_us\". \nDelete the folders \"lol_air_client\" and \"lol_game_client\" but DO NOT delete \"lol_are_client_config_na\" and \"lol_game_client_en_us\".\n\n2) After you deleted the following folders in step 1. Open \"lol_air_client_config_na\" -> releases -> and find the highest number. For me it was (0.0.0.55) it may be the same for you.. i'm not sure but after you do so, open it. Once you open it you should see a file titled \"S_OK\".\n\n3) Copy \"S_OK\" and back out onto \"releases\".  Find that highest number as you did in step 2 and paste \"S_OK\" behind it. So for example, mine was \"0.0.0.55\" so after you paste it, it should look like \"0.0.0.55S_OK\" \n\n4) After you've done the following, run League of Legends on Administrator. You should no longer be stuck on 33% but back at 0% :D and it'll patch back up from there . Oh btw, when you hit 33% it is going to go back to calculating differences BUT this time it should only go back up to about 80~100 before passing through and finishing the patch. \n\nAgain, sorry if this doesn't work out for you as i just fiddled around with the files a bit and it somehow managed to work for me.
