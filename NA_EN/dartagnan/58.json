While we finished the vast majority of the work on-time while most everyone was sleeping, we left a few un-patched devices to be completed in the near future.  Unfortunately, while we were shifting around traffic as we worked on getting devices patched up, we actually triggered the very bug we were trying to resolve on the remaining un-patched devices.  We attempted to get this resolved during the day, but the fix will required fairly in-depth work.\n\nWe’ve decided to perform another set of maintenance again on 4/28.  Ranked will be disabled at 12:30AM PDT.  Once all games finish and at 2:00AM PDT, we will deploy our fix and keep ranked disabled while we work.  We’ll update everyone once we start getting our hands dirty.","replies":[{"poster":"UnckyBadTouch","date":"2016-04-27T23:40:47.270+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":4,"body":"So...By this time tomorrow those of us who use WoWway and CenturyLink will be able to hop in a game?\n\nDo we get 2 free days of the first win xp boost, as we are going to miss out on a days worth.
