Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":12,"down_votes":9,"body":">#Update 5/18:\n\n>We've been seeing many reports of players getting a \"The game has crashed\" message when they try to enter the Loading Screen after Champ Select.  From our initial investigation, ***this seems to be due to LoLReplay interacting oddly with the latest patch.***\n\n>In order to get this resolved, we strongly recommend that you temporarily and completely uninstall LoLReplay.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHey everyone,\n\nWith 6.10 heralding our resident Stone Weaver Taliyah to the Rift, it means just one thing:  Really.  Bad. Rock puns.  Don&#039;t worry, we&#039;ll keep this thread pretty down to earth though.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/12EV232.gifv\n\nIf your patching progress gets petrified, follow some of the easy steps below, or post your problem if you can&#039;t find a solution and we&#039;ll help you out!\n----------------------------------------------\n\n>#***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n>#***Patcher never pops up, or disappears after you press &quot;LAUNCH&quot;***\n\nThis can be caused by corruption with the patcher itself or it failed to properly self-patch. Additionally, it may be due to some issues with the configuration of your computer system&#039;s permissions (meaning it can&#039;t properly save the files in the correct location). To resolve this, make sure to complete all the steps in our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!\n\n>#***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. Many of the most common Anti-virus programs [have already whitelisted LoL](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), however make sure to update yours to the latest version!\n\nAlso, even though you may have set specific exceptions in place before for your security program, League of Legends has gone through a major update. Therefore, your security program may recognize the old version of League of Legends, but not the new version. \n\nTo get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, and you still do not see the glorious orange &#039;LAUNCH&#039; button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!  Rioters as well as Wrenchmen volunteers will be on hand to respond and provide some additional help!*","replies":[{"poster":"wtfrick","date":"2016-05-18T21:13:57.283+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I keep getting the \"Update failed, Unspecified error has occurred\" message.

The commonly skipped steps are:\n\n1. [Switch to a wired connection](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq2) (WiFi is convenient, but it's terrible for gaming, and often provides an unstable connection)\n\n2. Uninstall your Firewall or Antivirus completely. Simply disabling it won't do the trick in a lot of cases, so taking a few minutes to get rid of it completely to see if it resolves the issue won't kill your computer.\n\n3. [Switch to a public DNS server](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5), as your ISP's default DNS servers are slower to look up servers you connect to, and this is a simple, yet commonly effective fix for a lot of connection issues. \n\n4. [Try a VPN (Virtual Private Network)](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq9) to reroute your connection. If this causes a change, it means the problem is with your ISP and the way they route your connection to the League servers. Reaching out to a tier 2 agent at your ISP and letting them know a VPN was a successful workaround for your issue can point them towards running traceroutes and figuring out where the connection is running into trouble. Hotspot Shield and Tunnelbear arre the two most effective VPN's to give a go.\n\nIf a player still runs into issues after taking those steps, they'll want to reach out to Riot Player support in the form of a ticket, where a member of the Tech Team can analyze and resolve the issue. \n\nGL:HF!\n{{champion:81}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sleepy b1tch","date":"2016-05-22T14:44:07.348+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"My boyfriend is having trouble with his game.
