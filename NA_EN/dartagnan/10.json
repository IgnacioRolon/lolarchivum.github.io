Round 2!  Level 3, a major ISP backbone, is performing major maintenance once again near Chicago, IL starting on June 17th 10:00PM PDT and completing sometime the following morning. The maintenance will be very similar to the last where they&rsquo;ll be cutting one of their main fiber optic lines to alter its path.  This also means that the Riot Direct Network is going to be hit hard.  We&rsquo;re going to proactively re-route player connections that go through impacted areas slightly before Level 3&rsquo;s maintenance at 9:30PM PDT to offset the impact of their work.\r\n\r\nHere&rsquo;s what you need to know:\r\n\r\n* If you&#039;re in the Dallas area, your ping during this time may rise as you&rsquo;ll be off the Riot Direct Network. We don&rsquo;t expect it to increase drastically, but you may want to factor this in when you decide to play!\r\n* If you&rsquo;re in Southern California, Arizona, or the general Southwest your connection will probably be taking a slightly longer path via Northern California during this window.You&rsquo;ll also see a slightly higher ping time while we have these paths out of service.\r\n\r\nAs we did before, once the maintenance by Level 3 is complete, we&rsquo;ll check everything out on our end to make sure it looks stable. If everything is glowing a bright green, we&rsquo;ll re-route players back onto our Direct Network. \r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;ll provide updates as we get them!","replies":[{"poster":"Demon King Maou","date":"2016-06-18T20:34:45.074+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My ping has been spiking from 50 - 1500 for the last 2 weeks will this fix any of this?\nLiving in Canada/Ontario\nPing is fine for first 15 mins but i find after 15 it just goes insane","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkolaVale","date":"2016-06-18T22:05:35.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I am from Washington State and my ping has increased a lot. My fps will drop and the MS will jump upto as high as 2000. I have a new pc with a core i5 and 12 gigs of ram. My game play has been fine up until 4 days ago. for the last 4 days the lag spikes and ping have been unplayable. This makes me very sad since I have put in a lot of time and effort into my game play. not to mention all of the money I have spent on RP since I have been playing.
