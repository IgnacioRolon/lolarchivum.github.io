This is part 1 of a 2 step process where we are making some improvements to our network infrastructure between the LoL Platform (PvP.net) and some of our [Point-of-Presences](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204246204-NA-Server-Roadmap#h3q2).  We know that this may cause some stability problems where players could experience disconnects, packet loss, or high ping, which is why we&rsquo;re doing this in the wee early hours of the morning.\n\nWe&rsquo;ll also be disabling ranked as a precaution.  The last thing we want is an epic backdoor to fail due to the ADC disconnecting and autoing minions instead of stopping the backing of the enemy team.\n\nDrop us a comment if you are seeing any extreme issues during this time.  We&rsquo;ll have some people on-deck keeping an eye on the thread and responding when possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Utlaga Warlock","date":"2016-04-13T04:00:13.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would have been lovely to know before trying to queue up and finding myself stuck in a dynamic queue for 5 minutes just stuck in the banning phase.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-04-13T04:50:34.237+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind that this particular maintenance is for 2AM, tomorrow (4/13).
