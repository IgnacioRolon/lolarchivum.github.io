We are going to continue monitoring closely, but once the initial login queue is drained, there should be no long waits getting into the client.\n\n>  Thanks for everyone sticking with us during this! &lt;3!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> #***UPDATE 3:46pm PST***\n\n> Fixes have been deployed and we re-enabled the Login Queue.  We are still in the testing phase, so we are going to keep a close eye on things to see if anything changes.\n\n> More updates to follow once we get a better idea!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> #***UPDATE 3:43pm PST***\n\n> We got another round of fixes that we are going to try and deploy out.  Unfortunately this means we have to disable the login queue again.  For the time being, no one will be able to enter the queue!\n\n> Once they are deployed and the queue is back up, we'll update everyone.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> #***UPDATE 3:29pm PST***\n\n> The fixes we deployed earlier hasn't seemed to resolve the root cause of the issue.  We are currently looking at other possible solutions and are heads down focused.\n\n> I wish I could give some better news, but once we have some new information, I'll update everyone!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> #***UPDATE 2:44pm PST***\n\n> We deployed the fixes and brought the login queue back up.  We are still heavily monitoring and testing to see if this has helped drain the login queue and allowed players to get into the client quickly.\n\n> Once we get some further info or confirmations, we'll pass it along!\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n> #***UPDATE 2:31pm PST***\n\n>We are deploying some additional fixes that should hopefully get everyone into the client faster.  In doing so, we actually have to pause the login queue.  For the time being, no one will be able to get past the queue.\n\n>As soon as this fix is deployed (no exact ETA just yet), we are going to flip the switch back on and hopefully get everyone in quicker.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n> #***UPDATE 2:16pm PST***\n\n> We are currently testing some changes to the login queue that should help get players in smoothly.  We haven't pushed the change out completely though. We want to make sure to do a limited test first to make sure it doesn't cause any further issues.\n\n>Once we get some results from the test, we'll update all of you!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey everyone,\n\nWe know that many of you are experiencing a hefty login queue getting into the client.  We have been tracking this issue since it started around ~9:30am PST and have all hands on deck investigating and triaging.  While we can’t provide an ETA currently, we will provide further updates once we get more information.  You can also check out the [Server Status Page](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/?en_US#na).\n\nIn the meantime, if you get into queue to login, just sit tight and we’ll get you into the client as quickly as we can.","replies":[{"poster":"underflame46","date":"2016-02-26T22:00:43.637+0000","up_votes":170,"down_votes":10,"body":"This wait time is taking a zilean years {{champion:26}} \nim so jhinterested when i can play again {{champion:202}} \nthis wait time is making me so mad i might burst into flames {{champion:63}} \nsays im behind 20k people...the only person i want to be behind is{{champion:201}} \nthe wait time \"ez\"real{{champion:81}} \nriot made a grave mistake {{champion:104}} \nWHAT IN THE HEC IS GOING ON?!?!?!?!{{champion:120}} \ni would say i will eventually be able to log in but i might jinx it{{champion:222}} \nthis is naut fun waiting {{champion:111}} \nill become nocturnal from staying up all night waiting for the servers to come back up{{champion:56}} \nnu nu nu nu nu nu this cant be happening!{{champion:20}} \ni bet all the people that dont like league are lafing alot {{champion:2}} \nwhy is my wait time ryzing!!! {{champion:13}} \nim just shacing my head {{champion:35}} \nif you have the patience to wait then you have talon\"t\" {{champion:91}} \nis riot trolling us? {{champion:48}} \nfate is not in our favor {{champion:4}} \nlooking at the screen this long is making my eyes twitch {{champion:29}} \n\"u\"deer the wait time is forever{{champion:77}} \nURGOT TO BE KIDDING ME{{champion:6}} \nwaiting this long to play will not go in vayne {{champion:67}} \nthere better be a good koz for this {{champion:161}} \ni think this will take vi hours to resolve or so it seems {{champion:254}} \nall this waiting might make me explode{{champion:115}} \nim getting close to the point where i flip my lid!!!{{champion:106}}","replies":[{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2016-02-26T22:30:28.663+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"The wait times are phe-nami-nal.\nRiot never Garen-teed us any compensation for this wait time.\nThis is not nasus-arily the end of the world, just be patient.\nThere are plenty of vi-able alternatives to playing league.\nI urgot to tell you, your puns are udyr-ly ridiculous. \nI just saw twisted fate get decked.

The problem here is that the \"players getting in\" part is fluid.  Every so often the system re-calculates the rates in which players are getting in, realizes it is slower than it thought, so it pushes your wait time further back.\n\nThis is why one of the main focuses of us is not only to solve this at the root cause level, but also find ways to get players past the queue and into the client as quickly as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2016-02-26T22:48:10.574+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":24,"body":"I'm terribly sorry about the players asking for free handouts as compensation. To me that defines their character and integrity and in my opinion \"free stuff\" should NEVER be expected. The point of getting free things is that you don't expect them or they aren't required; if people are going to flame the company for not getting free skins when the game is already free to play I only see them as spoiled. I NEVER ask for free anything, no matter if my pizza was late, or there was a hole in my jeans, because that's a direct insult to the company that you think doesn't care about you, the player base. Imagine if you got a free skin every time riot had an incident. That's just not profitable. And before you start whining about them being filthy rich, WHO DO YOU THINK IS MAKING THEM THAT WAY? YOU! So why are you complaining about people taking your money... when you are giving it to them? I can only assume that if you are buying skins, you like the game? They have more than 1 employee to pay, along with servers and legal rights and lawyers and all that jazz. It's not a bunch of bozos sitting on their couch at home drinking kool-aid and going hey, let's draw a new skin today!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-02-26T23:05:15.975+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really appreciate the kind words, but no need to apologize on behalf of anyone, I completely understand the anger (and demands) some players have.

Subsequently we updated our Server Status Page, our RiotSupport Twitter, and made this Boards post to get as much information and transparency out there as possible.\n\nWe have people working non-stop to get this resolved as quickly as possible, and we aren't going to stop until we do.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"takingittoofar","date":"2016-02-26T21:48:44.025+0000","up_votes":88,"down_votes":33,"body":"I dont understand how it is that you dont feel it your responsibility to make it up to your players when you guys poop your sheets like this.  you mike INSANE money yearly on a great game, but you continue to allocate that into just about anything but client/server stability, 'yeah lets make stuffed animals, i bet we could make money that way too!'  and i get it, get paid.  but when you take away the opportunity to play from so many players why would you not offer like a free skin cupon or even a ward skin. something, it just feels disrespectful. if we have connection issues in a game 'god forbid' we can get leaverbusterd, what happens to you guys when you dc?","replies":[{"poster":"Megachrist","date":"2016-02-26T21:59:23.521+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":13,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=takingittoofar,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=MqQlkEm0,comment-id=0064,timestamp=2016-02-26T21:48:44.025+0000)\n>\n> I dont understand how it is that you dont feel it your responsibility to make it up to your players when you guys poop your sheets like this.  you mike INSANE money yearly on a great game, but you continue to allocate that into just about anything but client/server stability, 'yeah lets make stuffed animals, i bet we could make money that way too!'  and i get it, get paid.  but when you take away the opportunity to play from so many players why would you not offer like a free skin cupon or even a ward skin. something, it just feels disrespectful. if we have connection issues in a game 'god forbid' we can get leaverbusterd, what happens to you guys when you dc?\n\nAgreed.
