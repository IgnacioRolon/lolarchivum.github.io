Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":19,"down_votes":9,"body":"Hey all,\n\nIn the coming days in NA, we&#039;ll be celebrating the birth of Canada, the birth of the United States, and most importantly, the birth of Patch 6.13!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/buBwDqg.jpg\n\nIf you plan on lighting up the Rift with some fireworks, or maybe just blowing parts of it up, but the patcher won&#039;t cooperate, we got you covered!  Follow the steps below and let your patcher know freedom!\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n>#***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n>#***Patcher never pops up, or disappears after you press &quot;LAUNCH&quot;***\n\nThis can be caused by corruption with the patcher itself or it failed to properly self-patch. Additionally, it may be due to some issues with the configuration of your computer system&#039;s permissions (meaning it can&#039;t properly save the files in the correct location). To resolve this, make sure to complete all the steps in our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!\n\n>#***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. Many of the most common Anti-virus programs [have already whitelisted LoL](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), however make sure to update yours to the latest version!\n\nAlso, even though you may have set specific exceptions in place before for your security program, League of Legends has gone through a major update. Therefore, your security program may recognize the old version of League of Legends, but not the new version. \n\nTo get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, and you still do not see the glorious orange &#039;LAUNCH&#039; button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!  Rioters as well as Wrenchmen volunteers will be on hand to respond and provide some additional help!*","replies":[{"poster":"Tanman8400","date":"2016-06-29T23:16:29.881+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"So earlier today as the patch was installing, I had some issues with my computer which caused me to have to exit out of my League client and restart my computer multiple times. After opening my League client and closing it many times, it says \"calculating differences\" and keeps scanning files. Is there a fix for this or should I wait for the files to be scanned like the article said? I'm worried that if I wait for files to be scanned it'll eventually end up wasting my time and not work. Feedback would be appreciated!

I have questions.\nRecently got a new laptop with windows 10.  Upon installing the installer and opening lol.launcher.exe or the admin version.  With both set to run as admin anyway, in compatibility mode for either win 7 or 8 (tried both) firewall disabled. And even still an exception for league added to it. Even under a port forward. I have the following issue.\n\nI open the installer, mind it's a fresh install of league. It goes to update the launcher , the league logo with a download bar beneath it. The bar will fill as if it's downloading the updates. As the bar fills to just about the end of the L in league sometimes a bit sooner. The launcher update closes, all background processes of league stop. No downloading continues and it does not reopen as if it simply needed a restart after a certain part of the download was completed. \n\nAgain, firewall disabled, still with exceptions made. Ran as admin in compatibility mode for win 7 8 n even XP Sp 2 with all virus software turned off, I'm using Norton for the time being as it came with my laptop, on its initial install of windows, but I've also uninstalled it. My windows is currently up to date at version 1511. \n\nLeague is not the only thing I'm having a problem with as my windows updates also have a similar issues where they fail to download or fail to install, as well as final fantasy XIV will stop downloading. \n\nAt first I'd believed a corrupt install of windows or drives so all have been re installed. But to no avail has anything I've tried worked. \n\nSide note: I haven't had any issues downloading and updating steam, and various steam games. Aside from also trying to install the FFXIV which opens a separate update after the download of the full game is completed.\n\nIt seems like my computer dislikes certain updater programs, I haven't downloading any programs outside of what's mentioned here.\n\nAny insight is appreciated either from riot or fellow summoners. Please help.\n\nThanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ahmed355s","date":"2016-07-08T06:25:46.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i get ban 5 game  -____________________- i lost connect in pvp  and last game i get ban in bot game -________________-BOT GAME !!!!!!!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"jordan1916","date":"2016-07-07T14:34:16.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My account was stolen and I want to get it back","replies":[]}]}
