Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":8,"down_votes":6,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nWelcome to Preseason!  Rolling out with Patch 6.22, we&#039;ve got a lot of cool new things in store and we can&#039;t wait for you guys to give it a try; assassin changes, new support items, and PLANTS! So many plants...\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eMFU34F.jpg\n\nTo help get you back to your roots, we&#039;ve got some troubleshooting you can try in the event you&#039;re getting any problems. If you have a completely different issue with the patch, just hit us up below and we&#039;ll help you further!\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n>#***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n>#***Patcher never pops up, or disappears after you press &quot;LAUNCH&quot;***\n\nThis can be caused by corruption with the patcher itself or it failed to properly self-patch. Additionally, it may be due to some issues with the configuration of your computer system&#039;s permissions (meaning it can&#039;t properly save the files in the correct location). To resolve this, make sure to complete all the steps in our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!\n \n>#***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. Many of the most common Anti-virus programs [have already whitelisted LoL](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), however make sure to update yours to the latest version!\n\nAlso, even though you may have set specific exceptions in place before for your security program, League of Legends has gone through a major update. Therefore, your security program may recognize the old version of League of Legends, but not the new version. \n\nTo get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, and you still do not see the glorious orange &#039;LAUNCH&#039; button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!  Rioters as well as Wrenchmen volunteers will be on hand to respond and provide some additional help!*","replies":[{"poster":"Hikkii","date":"2016-11-11T21:57:52.496+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hi, I've been having problems lately with my ping. After patching 6.22 with no errors. I manage to load into champ select, and go in game as usual. But for some strange reason, I cannot play well in game at all, because of continuous lag spiking after the patch. It's been going on for days now, and I'm very upset as I keep losing most of these games because of it. I found out that some others are having the same issue with lag spiking after patching, but their's don't seem as severe as mine. I usually have a steady ping of 25, but since 6.22, ping jitters have shot up my ping to 500, then it goes away, then up and down, etc. I need help asap so I can play peacefully without fuming over some stupid issue. Only when I play League does the ping spike starts, other things like other games and internet have been fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Wambulance","date":"2016-12-04T19:40:54.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having the exact same problem.
