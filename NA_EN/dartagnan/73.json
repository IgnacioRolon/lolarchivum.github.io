Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":13,"down_votes":6,"body":"Heyo,\n\nThe long awaited Marksman changes are here!  Between Champion Updates and the item changes, there's a lot of things to try out!  We don't want any patching issues to stop you from enjoying the new changes, so if you are having any issues, check out the solutions below!\n\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n> ***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scanned already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n> ***Launcher/Patcher never pops up, or disappears after you press &quot;LAUNCH&quot;***\n\nThis can be caused by corruption with the patcher itself or it failed to properly self-patch. Additionally, it may be due to some issues with the configuration of your computer system&#039;s permissions (meaning it can&#039;t properly save the files in the correct location). To resolve this, make sure to complete all the steps in our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!\n\n\n> ***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. Many of the most common Anti-virus programs [have already whitelisted LoL](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), however make sure to update yours to the latest version!\n\nAlso, even though you may have set specific exceptions in place before for your security program, League of Legends has gone through a major update. Therefore, your security program may recognize the old version of League of Legends, but not the new version. \n\nTo get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, and you still do not see the glorious orange &#039;LAUNCH&#039; button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!  Rioters as well as Wrenchmen volunteers will be on hand to respond and provide some additional help!*","replies":[{"poster":"sry im bad","date":"2015-11-11T11:15:35.203+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it just that the patch is unreleased ATM?

Help!!! :(","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-11-17T01:14:52.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Black Screens after Champion Selection (where the Loading Screen should be) is some of the most difficulty problems to troubleshoot due to the fact that it can either be a network issue, or a hardware/software issue.  Let's break this down for everyone:\n\n1)  Network Issue -- When Champion Selection ends, your computer needs to take two steps almost at the same time.  First, it places your connection to PvP.net (the client) into a dormant state.  This is why it minimizes after Champ Select.  Secondly, it attempts to connect to the individual game server your game is going to play on.  If something blocks this connection, or if its unable to connect to the game server, it will only display a black screen as it can't retrieve any of the information from the game server.  \n\nMake sure to go through all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).  While there are a lot of steps found there, they are the most common solutions to get around this kind of issue.\n\n2)  Hardware/Software issue -- If your computer was able to connect to the Game Server, but your computer itself is not able to display or render the information the server is telling it too, then it will display the back screen and nothing else.\n\nIn this situation, make sure to complete the steps in our [BugSplat Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes).  The steps there will allow us to rule this out as a root cause and hopefully get you into the actual game!\n\nIf you are still experiencing issues, even after completing all of these steps, I recommend [submitting a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to us here in Player Support.  A Tech Specialist should be able to investigate further and work with you one-on-one in order to get this resolved.   If you do submit a ticket, make sure to include the following information:\n\n\n1) [Network Analysis](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq1)\n\n2) [Network Information Log](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq4)\n\n3) [Process List](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq3)\n\n4) [DxDiag](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq5)\n\n5) [Your latest R3d Log (check the date!)](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq7)","replies":[{"poster":"Shad0wGun","date":"2015-11-21T18:27:52.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I cant even update, have tried everything on the connection issues page.
