Servers are a bit different than normal gaming PC&rsquo;s, but hardware still works the same way -- every piece of hardware has a shelf-life, and eventually it&rsquo;ll degrade or stop working.  By pro-actively upgrading this hardware now, we can ensure the servers will remain stable in the future.\n\nWhile we are switching out the hardware, we&#039;re also going to need to reroute connections to our game servers.  This is where we may encounter some issues with disconnects, which is why we are disabling ranked pre-emptively.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LC5FaF6.png\n\nIf you get into a ranked game before 4:00AM PDT, you will be allowed to finish the game; we just won&rsquo;t allow new ranked games to start.\n\nWe&rsquo;ll make sure to update everyone on the progress or if we hit any issues!","replies":[{"poster":"Zou Yuan","date":"2016-07-19T23:10:23.133+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":36,"body":"instead of updating a server that got like 0 problems in compare to others, you could update somestuff on euw.\nI got the feel that euw has atleast 1 problem that is ruining the game for hours every week.","replies":[{"poster":"BADxW0LF","date":"2016-07-19T23:19:07.473+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering this is an NA Rioter making comments about NA servers, you should try discussing your desire for \"updated stuff on euw\" on the euw LoL boards?

As power surges through a piece of hardware, and heat builds up, it does degrade. The heat statement is especially true for Graphic cards, while the power statement is mostly true for Power Supply units. It just depends the hardware. The degradation is minor and it would take years to burn out if kept at proper temperatures, but my statement stands.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Urgot Update","date":"2016-07-20T09:37:14.311+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guess they're constructing additional pylons\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-07-20T01:46:54.075+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"How am I going to pass the time at night now...\n\"A man shouts : SLEEP\"\nhttps://cdn.meme.am/instances/400x400/14688807.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"SAO D3m1try","date":"2016-07-20T12:07:15.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot please this is a s#$%S im unranked and why i have to play with diamonds and platinums?  this will be really borring","replies":[{"poster":"ÂFRÏCÂN GØD","date":"2016-07-20T12:59:04.671+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"what?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"gamesavor","date":"2016-07-19T22:14:39.757+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":30,"body":"FIRST COMMENT!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2016-07-19T22:16:24.364+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=gamesavor,realm=NA,application-id=6WpmgL9O,discussion-id=90RHmevE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-07-19T22:14:39.757+0000)\n>\n> FIRST COMMENT!!!!!\n\nWhy does that matter?","replies":[{"poster":"DREADN0UGHT","date":"2016-07-19T23:43:20.787+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it means he is Alpha.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"2TaNkEd","date":"2016-07-20T15:26:30.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're going to miss that E-machine so much! {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Reshaos","date":"2016-07-20T16:16:58.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Logged in just to up vote lol.
