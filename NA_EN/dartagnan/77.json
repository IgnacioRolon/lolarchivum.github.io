The last iv successfully played the game was Tuesday (Aug 26th) and the only issue i had was when i got in game and opened up the item shop it would lag and then log me out of game. \nNow today I tried launching league and it wont even get past the launch icon. It'll try to load and then an error pops up saying \"LoLLaunch quit unexpectedly\" with the more details option okay option and Reopen option. Even if i click the Reopen it will try to open for about 30 seconds then the same failed to launch message pops up. \nI read on several other forum threads that just uninstalling and reinstalling work fine so i did that but it would still do the launch failed error. So i tried looking that up as well and encountered the UserKernal issue with the actual file being rather buggy. In those posts everyone is saying to use your original UserKernal file but i no longer have it. Now iv tried downloading league from the website 8 times now (each time id check the Kernal file to see if it was the corrupt one and if so completely wiping it from my computer) but even then its still failing to launch.\nIm at a loss at what to really do at the moment any kind of help is really appreciated iv never had huge problems with my league before this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dacsgoddess","date":"2014-08-28T23:59:06.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, Me and my friends were doing ranked 3's and the game ended we won and the Victory popped up and then we waited like 10 min for the stats and just went past them.
