Everything may seem different and confusing, but this is still the same place to get help, now new and improved!  \n\nOne you’re comfortable, here are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n* ***Check if your issue already has a discussion about it:*** Upvoting this discussion and commenting in it will allow us and Wrenchmen to identify trending issues quicker.  \n* ***The Wrenchmen are still here:***  The Wrenchmen are community volunteers that live in this community and take time to help Summoners with their issues. Look out for their orange name and Wrenchmen icon!\n* ***Take advantage of the new and improved search feature:***  Let’s be honest, the search feature in vBulletin sucked.  The new Boards search feature is robust and will often find a discussion/solution to an issue you’re experiencing!\n* ***Use the filters at the top of the page:***  You can custom set your view for this community by filtering discussions for Recent, Hot (recently upvoted), or Best (highest upvoted of all time).\n* If you don’t like the nested comments you can switch to ***“Chronological View”*** to have it appear just like the old forums.  You can find this option in each discussion here:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/hjEWSBD.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Meriipu","date":"2014-09-16T22:10:37.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where did the old threads go?
