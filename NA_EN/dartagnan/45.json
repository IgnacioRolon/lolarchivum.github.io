We almost immediately noticed the issue and worked to figure out what was causing it.  Given that games were not starting, we decided to simply revert the change completely to solve it as quickly as possible.  The most important consideration here was to get everyone back into game ASAP.  Everything looked good and healthy/recovered by around 9:30AM PST.\r\n\r\nAfter getting this fixed, we identified a key area that would prevent an issue like this from happening again and implemented it accordingly.  We never stop short at just identifying the root cause and fixing it, but always look for ways to make sure it doesn&#039;t happen again.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate all the quick reports!  Hopefully this helps explain a bit!","replies":[{"poster":"Çhåryzård","date":"2016-04-07T03:23:33.830+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"this happened to me earlier and I started panicking because I had just gotten out of low priority queue yesterday and I thought I was gonna be put back in lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2016-04-07T03:01:45.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good job.\n\nIn other news, the only way I know to get to this live incident breakdown board is via the red tracker unless I'm missing a link somewhere, so I don't know how many people would actually see this sort of post.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-04-07T03:05:07.769+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are several boards not shown on the list.

Seems like a board only a Rioter would post in. I don't think players would be like \"I'mma put this problem in the live breakdown thread\". lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gossa","date":"2016-04-08T22:33:15.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOOK!
