Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nPulsefire Caitlyn gave us a glimpse of what could be in the far future, but why not take a little peek into the near future that is 7.11?

If you&#039;re having issue patching during 7.11 make sure to check out the information below or drop a comment! The Poro bros will be on top of it :)\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n>#Why does the End of Game Stats screen take FOREVER to freakin&#039; load?!\n\nThis might be due to the &quot;Close Client During Game&quot; option in the client.  This option makes the client close out when you enter a game, which means after the game it has to completely reboot to start.  Low Spec Mode should be enough to keep things running smoothly, so disable this option by entering the client, clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner, [and unchecking the box.](http://i.imgur.com/smwR8be.png)\n\n>#I've  tried the Updated Client before, and it was sooooo laggy\n\nWe&#039;ve made some massive changes to the Updated Client make it run as smoothly as possible, even on the proudest of potatoes.  Enable Low Spec Mode if it isn&rsquo;t on already.  You can find out by clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner of the Updated Client and then [click &quot;Enable Low Spec Mode&quot;](http://i.imgur.com/rPGRnYW.png)\n\n>#Patching Failed and we&#039;re not sure why Error: 004\n\nThis error usually occurs when Operating System Permissions isn&#039;t set properly.  Essentially, the patcher is trying to access files found on your hard drive, but it is being denied from doing so.  [Follow the steps in this guide to get this resolved!](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)\n\n>#Something&#039;s up with our servers and it&#039;s preventing you from patching Error: 003\n\nOccurs when the patcher isn&#039;t able to maintain a stable connection with our Patcher Servers.  If the patcher loses connection to the server to get the necessary files, it will simply stop working.

I have a brand new custom built PC that I put together myself. Now my PC Plays everything under the son that's been released recently and if it was old by a few years or months. of course naturally i installed League immediately upon finishing the build and proceeded to lose games as I'm silver. But let me get to the point, when i was playing these games i had very decent FPS amounts. We are talking uncapped no V-Sync an easy 275-300+. But my problem as of i believe patch 7.3 or later or even earlier not sure, has rendered my FPS to a heaping 80--100 with super heavy fluctuation and crazy amounts of input lag. Abilities work fine and on time, it's the mouse movement that feel sluggish and delayed. i did some research and compared usage levels of my GPU (GTX-1060 3gb) in a triple a title and in league, I noticed in league i only use 45% of my GPU (but i know that's normal as this games not very taxing on Graphics) but in a triple a title such as The Witcher 3 I'm utilizing 95% and getting solid FPS 80-100, So now I ask the question, When do you guys plan on taking a deeper look into all the FPS complaints that are circling the web, as I'm sure I'm not the only one with a nice computer but cant seem to play a game that came out like 7 years ago. I just want to get back to smooth game play so i can lose on my terms not because the game felt like it was poorly optimized. Sorry for the long winded speech but as you can imagine this is rather frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-10T01:54:57.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there might be a few different issues coming up for you here, and this might actually be happening from one of two possible issues.

Here are some things I learned about it through my own experience.\n\n1. The Hextech Repair Tool was not deleting things properly.  In fact, I was unable to delete the old files and folders manually (despite being Admin) due to the system preventing deletion.  I am guessing that the culprit was some process or other which refused to die.\n2. After uninstalling, I had to restart my computer and then delete the files/folders manually.\n3. Only after complete deletion was I able to manage a \"clean\" installation.  This (finally) allowed proper patching to proceed as normal.  \n\nThe only error messages I was getting out of the HRT were those connected with sync'ing the system clock.  It kept telling me that I needed Admin permission to sync the clock, but the HRT is an .MSI file and therefore runs at Admin level.  In any case, I suspect that others having this \"failed patcher\" issue will need to follow the same steps I took.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tentacle Slappin","date":"2017-06-05T21:17:00.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya.

That definitely shouldn&#x27;t be happening. If you could actually grab a video of that happening I&#x27;ll be able to better see what&#x27;s happening and make sure we get this figured out!\n\nI decided to let it continue and see what would happen, after about an hour and a half (I left the room at points) I came back to see it at 97 percent and then after 8 or so minutes it finally finished. Only other issue I'm seeing now in my first game is my fps are sticking at 30 instead of the usual 60 I used to get. =/","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"H Λ D Ψ","date":"2017-06-02T01:22:01.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When this patch came out and I tried to launch the game there was a 24.8 Mb update if I remember exactly.. I left the launcher to update and my internet stopped for a minute so when it came back I pressed retry and now I've a 1065 Mb update although I downloaded those about a week ago.\nI've tried restarting the game and my PC but it appears that the game is stuck with this 1065 Mb update, Once I start it scans few files then says Upgrading your client (1042 Mb) then it jumps to 1065 Mb and starts downloading I've tried to wait till there's 1040 Mb left if the rest is just useless text but it isn't.\n\nThe reason why I can't just wait because my connection is slow and I can't keep my PC open few hours for a patch that isn't necessary...

You should be able to speed that up a bit if you switch to a hardwired connection, but let's also double check some of your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) just to be safe.
