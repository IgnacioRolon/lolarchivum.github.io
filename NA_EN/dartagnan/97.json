Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":14,"down_votes":11,"body":"Hey all,\n\nGalio is here and....wayyyyy taller than we remember.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/D0WULsw.jpg\n\nSuffice to say, Malphite and Nautilus have to be a little peeved to have  someone they could&#039;ve simply stepped on before, now look at them in the eye when he stands up.\n\nIf you find yourself in a staring contest with the Patcher as it slows to a crawl or seemingly doesn&#039;t work, make sure to follow the steps below to turn the tide of battle in your favor!  If nothing seems to help, drop a comment and we&#039;ll be happy to help!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n#***Updated Client (Beta Client)***\n\n>*** Error: &quot;League of Legends has encountered a problem. Please re-install League alpha client or try again.&quot;***\n\nThis issue rears its ugly head if something went wrong in either the updating or the installation process of the Client Update. The solution is to complete a full and clean reinstallation of League by following [**this guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) to a T.\n\n>***My IP Balance in the Store is incorrect***\n\nThere have been some issues with the client pulling correct IP balances. Some players have been able to resolve this by launching into the Legacy Client and making a single purchase to resolve this. If this does not work, hit us up in a [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we&#039;ll work together to resolve this.\n\n>***I toggled the language filter off but still see words too rich for my tastes***\n\nWe&#039;ve seen a few reports of the mature language filter not toggling correctly.  It&#039;s now possible to disable and enable the filter in-game by typing:  **/chatfilter** into the in-game chat.  For the more visually inclined, [check out this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/K92fiCb.png).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n#***Legacy Client***\n\n>***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n>***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. To get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBreakers","date":"2017-03-22T17:08:59.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I love this game but it says my patch has failed.
