Keep calm and have a spot of tea, just like Cait here.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NemHJca.gifv\n\nDon&rsquo;t stay stuck in the past! If you&#039;re in need of troubleshooting, we have our ace in a hole to help take take &#039;em down! Check out these steps, or post below!\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n> Why does the End of Game Stats screen take FOREVER to freakin&#039; load?!\n\nThis might be due to the &quot;Close Client During Game&quot; option in the client.  This option makes the client close out when you enter a game, which means after the game it has to completely reboot to start.  Low Spec Mode should be enough to keep things running smoothly, so disable this option by entering the client, clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner, [and unchecking the box.](http://i.imgur.com/smwR8be.png)\n\n>I've  tried the Updated Client before, and it was sooooo laggy\n>\n\n We&#039;ve made some massive changes to the Updated Client make it run as smoothly as possible, even on the proudest of potatoes.  Enable Low Spec Mode if it isn&rsquo;t on already.  You can find out by clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner of the Updated Client and then [click &quot;Enable Low Spec Mode&quot;](http://i.imgur.com/rPGRnYW.png)\n\n>Patching Failed and we&#039;re not sure why Error: 004\n>\n\nThis error usually occurs when Operating System Permissions isn&#039;t set properly.  Essentially, the patcher is trying to access files found on your hard drive, but it is being denied from doing so.  [Follow the steps in this guide to get this resolved!](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)\n\n>Something&#039;s up with our servers and it&#039;s preventing you from patching Error: 003\n>\n\nOccurs when the patcher isn&#039;t able to maintain a stable connection with our Patcher Servers.  If the patcher loses connection to the server to get the necessary files, it will simply stop working.  To get this resolved, [make sure to complete all of the solutions in this guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nIf you have a problem that isn&rsquo;t here or those solutions aren&rsquo;t working, drop a comment below and we&rsquo;ll be sure to respond and help you out!  ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-25T15:37:01.524+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys,\n\nI wanted to give a heads up that we have a [pinned thread](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/2aNwwPQY-5232017-older-macs-unable-to-launch-league) regarding launch issues for some mac players.
