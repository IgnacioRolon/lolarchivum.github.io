Click Here","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\n6.19 is here folks! While we get to experience the future of League, Worlds 2016 will be staying with 6.18. With the first day of groups just days away; we finally get to see which teams rise above the rest and which ones get devoured like broccoli in front of Faker:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eLZ5vUC.gif\n\nWhile you get to watch the past, we want you playing in the future! If anything is getting in the way of a smooth patch, try some of the fixes below, or shoot us your questions and we&rsquo;ll help you out there instead!\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n&gt;#***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n&gt;#***Patcher never pops up, or disappears after you press &quot;LAUNCH&quot;***\n\nThis can be caused by corruption with the patcher itself or it failed to properly self-patch. Additionally, it may be due to some issues with the configuration of your computer system&#039;s permissions (meaning it can&#039;t properly save the files in the correct location). To resolve this, make sure to complete all the steps in our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!\n\n&gt;#***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. Many of the most common Anti-virus programs [have already whitelisted LoL](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), however make sure to update yours to the latest version!\n\nAlso, even though you may have set specific exceptions in place before for your security program, League of Legends has gone through a major update. Therefore, your security program may recognize the old version of League of Legends, but not the new version. \n\nTo get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, and you still do not see the glorious orange &#039;LAUNCH&#039; button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!  Rioters will be on hand to respond and provide some additional help!*","replies":[{"poster":"lovedoctorxxx","date":"2016-09-21T18:03:13.849+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"hello, just downloaded the newest patch and i have the same problem as i had with the previous patch. \nAfter downloading i launch everything is still okay but when i try to play i get into champion select but when the loading screen needs to come an error occurs. i get the popup to reconnect but when i push this button it doesn't work and i keep getting redirected to the reconnect screen. In the previous patch this problem lasted 2 days until my launcher downloaded some new files 2 days after downloading the patch. I really want to play :( can you help me. I'm not the only one with this problem. i looked at the forum and red about 10 different treats about this problem.

It comes up after champion select is done and when the game try's to load.

Got my first leaver game because of this nonsense. \n\nWhat's super silly is that I can play on the EU servers and on the pbe easily but on the NA server which is where my main account is from I can't play at all. I have no idea what I can do to fix this since I've literally tried everything listed on your support website: \"https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\" to no avail \n\nSince it's only happening on the na server I feel like it's coming from your patch or something from your side as I had the game fully playable on na literally a day ago.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LEDception","date":"2016-09-27T07:31:11.088+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi everyone,\n\nI have a problem going into game after champ select. I am able to pick a ban, a champion, and wait for the count down until you get to loading screen. BUT, once the timer hits zero it won't go to the loading screen. It freezes on champ select. \n\nThings I have done when champ select freezes:\n1.  restart league\n2.  sometimes league doesn't load, so I start a new one and terminate the old one (I continue this until it lets me sign into league.\n3. Once I am in, it asks me to reconnect because I have crashed. If I'm lucky, then it loads me into game\n4. If when I reconnect and it shows me a notification on how I'm not connected to the internet, I well keep trying again until it does.\n\n(by this time most people have surrendered by now because they think I went ask)\n\n5. If it continues to not reconnect I restart the computer\n6. After I restart it, I try sign into league. After this point I give up and play another day.\n\nI have tried sending my technical problems through the website, but have not got a response. I have had a MacBook Pro for about 6 years (any specific information you would have to tell me, not a computer guy). I only play league on it. I have: restarted all settings to my computer, I have taken it into apple to check if it was my computer, and I have tried to uninstall and reinstall.\n\nExhausted all my options and have exhausted all the players by taking the time out of their league play to surrender and do a remake. I would like to be able play league again like normal. I am even ok with a little lag.

When I updated to this patch the icon for the non-admin launcher turned into an error icon, and I didn't regard this as much aside from an annoyance; looked ugly in my taskbar, but who cares, right? After a few days of using the admin-launcher becuase it had a proper icon, I uninstalled the client and reinstalled in an attempt fix the wonky icon but found, much to my chagrin, that it simply returned with an error icon. I uninstalled again, and then manually uninstalled any remnants that I could locate on my system as it says to do on the support page. When I re-downloaded the installer and ran it, it did... not work as it should, simply put. The installer itself worked fine, as I'm able to tell, but when I ran the client it created on my system I ran into some major errors that render it practically unusable. Firstly, it reverts my monitor to the lowest possible resolution that it can support (640x480, 256 colours, 60 hertz), and then loads the client window in an absurd size; in fact, I was able to get a screenshot once I set the screen resolution back to it's highest setting (1366x768, true colour, 32 bit, 60 hertz), and here it is ->http://i.imgur.com/fvQ1UOP.png<- the bottom of the client window is around the bottom of the left paw, but this is undemonstratable through screenshot as I am unable to drag the client window. I attempted to do a clean install once more after encountering this issue, but it has happened again nonetheless. Does this sound like a run-of-the-mill issue, and is there anyway this can be resolved? I quite enjoyed playing the occasional match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"feed is succeed","date":"2016-09-27T00:13:00.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ever since iv'e updated to patch 6.19 I keep crashing when at the home screen or in game and it doesn't crash to the desktop it just freezes and has the Windows troubleshooter pop up, is there any way to fix this, other than turning off the IP Helper.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nymph","date":"2016-09-23T01:13:21.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey so i cant connect to any games anymore every time i try to i get a bug splat, i have tried to reinstall and sadly it didn't work.
