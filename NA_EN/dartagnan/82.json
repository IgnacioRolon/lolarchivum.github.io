You've come to the right place!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":22,"down_votes":34,"body":"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/retiringair_alt_1080.jpg\n\nHey all,\n\nIt's a new age!  With the deprecation of the Legacy Client (AKA, the AIR client) now completed, there might be a few unfamiliar errors or issues you might get when launching the Updated Client.  We took some of the most common ones and investigated them to give you the best and easiest solution so you never have to see it again.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n>#***Why does the End of Game Stats screen take FOREVER to freakin' load?!***\n\nThis might be due to the \"Close Client During Game\" option in the client.  This option makes the client close out when you enter a game, which means after the game it has to completely reboot to start.  Low Spec Mode should be enough to keep things running smoothly, so disable this option by entering the client, clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner, [and unchecking the box.](http://i.imgur.com/smwR8be.png)\n\n>#***“I’ve tried the Updated Client before, and it was sooooo laggy”***\n\n We've made some massive changes to the Updated Client make it run as smoothly as possible, even on the proudest of potatoes.  Enable Low Spec Mode if it isn’t on already.  You can find out by clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner of the Updated Client and then [click \"Enable Low Spec Mode\"](http://i.imgur.com/rPGRnYW.png)\n\n>#***\"Patching Failed and we're not sure why Error: 004\"***\n\nThis error usually occurs when Operating System Permissions isn't set properly.  Essentially, the patcher is trying to access files found on your hard drive, but it is being denied from doing so.  [Follow the steps in this guide to get this resolved!](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)\n\n>#***\"Something's up with our servers and it's preventing you from patching\" Error: 003***\n\nOccurs when the patcher isn't able to maintain a stable connection with our Patcher Servers.  If the patcher loses connection to the server to get the necessary files, it will simply stop working.  To get this resolved, [make sure to complete all of the solutions in this guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\n>#***Weirdness with Rune Pages***\n\nThere can be an issue with rune pages not saving correctly when they have ***special characters*** in their name.  We're working on solving this in the future, but if this error happens to you, reach out to us in a [ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we'll get you squared away.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nIf you have a problem that isn’t here or those solutions aren’t working, drop a comment below and we’ll be sure to respond and help you out!  ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"what r u stupid","date":"2017-04-25T00:43:38.147+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":3,"body":"I cant launch the league client when I click the launch button the client just disappears","replies":[{"poster":"Acnologia68","date":"2017-04-27T11:23:18.185+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me a white window with a url saying something is missing and the day before was working just good.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sFs Butterfly","date":"2017-04-25T04:30:27.975+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":"TO EVERYONE WHOSE LAUNCHER CRASHES WHEN YOU ATTEMPT TO LAUNCH THE GAME ON THE NEW CLIENT...
