So hopefully a little something for everyone?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WFNEKpj.jpg\n\nIf you&#039;re itching to try out the Mid-Season changes or looking forward to how Ms. Rift Herald might shake up the meta but patching issues are keeping you down, check out the steps below which should get you into the client!\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n>#***Why does the End of Game Stats screen take FOREVER to freakin&#039; load?!***\n\nThis might be due to the &quot;Close Client During Game&quot; option in the client.  This option makes the client close out when you enter a game, which means after the game it has to completely reboot to start.  Low Spec Mode should be enough to keep things running smoothly, so disable this option by entering the client, clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner, a[nd unchecking the box.](http://i.imgur.com/smwR8be.png)\n\n>#***&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried the Updated Client before, and it was sooooo laggy&rdquo;***\n\n We&#039;ve made some massive changes to the Updated Client make it run as smoothly as possible, even on the proudest of potatoes.  Enable Low Spec Mode if it isn&rsquo;t on already.  You can find out by clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner of the Updated Client and then [click &quot;Enable Low Spec Mode&quot;](http://i.imgur.com/rPGRnYW.png)\n\n>#***&quot;Patching Failed and we&#039;re not sure why Error: 004&quot;***\n\nThis error usually occurs when Operating System Permissions isn&#039;t set properly.  Essentially, the patcher is trying to access files found on your hard drive, but it is being denied from doing so.  [Follow the steps in this guide to get this resolved!](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)\n\n>#***&quot;Something&#039;s up with our servers and it&#039;s preventing you from patching&quot; Error: 003***\n\nOccurs when the patcher isn&#039;t able to maintain a stable connection with our Patcher Servers.  If the patcher loses connection to the server to get the necessary files, it will simply stop working.  To get this resolved, [make sure to complete all of the solutions in this guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\n>#***Weirdness with Rune Pages***\n\nThere can be an issue with rune pages not saving correctly when they have ***special characters*** in their name.

Update: 20 minute low priority que due to the one game I didn't participate in because I couldn't because I was trying to figure out how to fix my screen problem (Mac resolution / window can't see and low frame rate).  Punishing players for a crappy patch update that makes game play impossible and even costs games and elo because there isn't even a fucking NOTICE on behalf of Riot warning Mac users that this problem is common so it's best they don't jump straight into a game after updating/ patching and should instead test their first match on a custom for no penalties. Some of you may say it's common sense to do that, but really, it isn't. I wasn't expecting my game to fuck up and be unplayable after patching, this is NOT my fault. And really, from a game company this big, are we to expect such crappy patches/ updates? I don't think it's unreasonable of me to expect that Riot send out good, working patches for both Windows AND Mac. Or what, did they forget to test the patch on Macs? FFS. This is just ridiculous, feels like salt on top of a wound to get punished for not being able to play BECAUSE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO. FYI, I ended up re-installing Windows on another partition through Bootcamp because honestly, the Mac client always has more problems and Riot hardly even communicates with Mac users or cares about its Mac client. Problems on the Mac client typically take forever to be patched / addressed or fixed by Riot. Frame rate still reads 60fps when I run League on Windows partition, but I doubt it's accurate; gameplay feels smooth as before. Definitely not the same as the 60fps when I run League on the Mac OSX partition, which is unplayable. Way too laggy / glitchy / delayed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yuugenshu","date":"2017-05-03T14:02:46.955+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, kinda need help please\n\nUpdate got stuck at 677.6 MB left to download, tried restarting the same thing happens.
