Click Here!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey all,\n\nThe ye ol&#039; Mid Season Mage Update is upon us. Ready your spells, wands, and whatever that adorable void creature is for battle in the Rift. The age of the Mage is here! \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SFfQCll.jpg\n\nIf your client is unruly and saying, &quot;You shall not patch!&quot; We have some incantations that can solve your dilemma below. \n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n>#***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n> #***Patcher never pops up, or disappears after you press &quot;LAUNCH&quot;***\n\nThis can be caused by corruption with the patcher itself or it failed to properly self-patch. Additionally, it may be due to some issues with the configuration of your computer system&#039;s permissions (meaning it can&#039;t properly save the files in the correct location). To resolve this, make sure to complete all the steps in our [Patching Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)!\n\n>#***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. Many of the most common Anti-virus programs [have already whitelisted LoL](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), however make sure to update yours to the latest version!\n\nAlso, even though you may have set specific exceptions in place before for your security program, League of Legends has gone through a major update. Therefore, your security program may recognize the old version of League of Legends, but not the new version. \n\nTo get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*If after completing these steps, and you still do not see the glorious orange &#039;LAUNCH&#039; button, feel free to drop us a post in this thread!

That doesn't make sense, if their client is what's wrong, everyone would have issues. It doesn't matter if I use Vista,  or windows 10 or play on a mac or a Linux,  if the issue was the client itself,  EVERYONE would have issues. If the client wasn't replacing files on my computer properly and it was causing errors, but it updated just fine for others, then the variable is the computer, not their client.","replies":[{"poster":"r33f3r M4dn3s5","date":"2016-05-05T17:47:42.666+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same problem so it's not a user issue.

If you look in your game folder, you will find that it may be scanning more files than even exist in the folder! The reason for this is that when it fixes a corrupt file, it will re-scan. This raises the file count visually. When players are going upwards of 20-30k files scanned, that means that their install is corrupted and it's having to fix a lot of files. If it's a reoccurring issue each patch, then something is causing those files to corrupt after they've been made healthy.
