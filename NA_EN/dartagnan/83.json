For more information on what the updated client offers and why we&rsquo;re making this change, [check out this article](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/legacy-client-officially-retires-april-24). This means that if you try to launch the old client on the 24th, you will immediately be prompted to switch over to the new Updated Client.  You&rsquo;ll get a notification that looks like this: \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mUT2GB5.png\n\nWe&rsquo;ve been preparing for this on the backend for a long time, so there shouldn&rsquo;t be too much you need to download when the switchover happens.  Once everything is set, you should be able to login normally. We ***_strongly encourage_*** you to switch over starting now!  That way if you do hit a problem we can get it resolved while the AIR client is still there as a back-up!\n\nWe know that with any change there is always a risk of some unforeseen bugs and errors that may crop up.  The following issues are some of the most common that pop-up with their solutions:\n\n*NOTE:  You may want to [temporarily disabling your Firewall](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3) before switching over to the Updated Client, and re-enabling it the moment its finished. This should help the switchover go smoothly.*\n\n>#***Important notice regarding Rune Pages***\n\nWe're investigating an issue with rune pages not saving correctly when re-arranged or have special characters in its name.

This option makes the client close out when you enter a game, which means after the game it has to completely reboot to start.  Low Spec Mode should be enough to keep things running smoothly, so disable this option by entering the client, clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner, a[nd unchecking the box.](http://i.imgur.com/smwR8be.png)\n\n>#***&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried the Updated Client before, and it was sooooo laggy&rdquo;***\n\n We&#039;ve made some massive changes to the Updated Client make it run as smoothly as possible, even on the proudest of potatoes.

I understand that you want a smaller footprint on your computer's resources; just because something is new doesn't mean it's better unless it delivers something worth upgrading towards--like features and utilizing less resources.\n\nI've tested this on my system at home, at work, and even one of the test machines we have, but they've all told roughly the same story (just launched, logged in, waited ~5 minutes, no games played):\n\n* **Legacy Client**: 3 processes - \n678,564K + 2,948K + 5,772K = **687,284K**\n* **Updated Client** (Normal Mode): 4 processes - \n66,268K + 47,436K + 234,536K + 61,468K = **409,708K**\n* **Updated Client** (Low Spec Mode): 4 processes - \n65,612K + 58,912K + 59,088K + 217,704K = **401,316K\n**\n\nIf you're seeing something drastically different, I definitely want to know what you're on your Task Manager and get down to why it's taking up resources differently than we expected; we can pass what you're seeing along so we can get to the bottom of it.","replies":[{"poster":"xMichaelx3","date":"2017-04-18T22:33:46.733+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Did you also try playing a game or 2 and then looking at the memory usage?

So when I got home, I booted up my notebook and started playing Coop v AI Games to see what results I got (and yes, I died in a few of those games... to bots). This is the test format I came up with:\nClean Launch > Login > Wait 1-2 minutes > Played 1 Coop v AI Game > Home > Store > Clicked on each Store tab > Loot > Profile > Home > Played 1 Coop v AI Game > Home > Wait 1-2 minutes.\n\nHere are the results I got:\n**Legacy Client**: 3 processes -\n640,208K + 848K + 2,272K = **643,328K**\n**Updated Client** (Normal Mode): 4 processes -\n36,604K + 38,256K + 23,604K + 321,036K = **416,500K**\n**Updated Client** (Low Spec Mode): 4 processes -\n40,924K + 37,772K + 16,388K + 310,016K = **405,100K**\n\n_Note:_ My notebook at home has different specs than the desktop I use at work.\n\nInterestingly, between my notebook at home and desktop at work, there's an increase in resource usage with the Updated Client in both Normal and Low Spec Modes, but they're still both lower than with the Legacy Client.

You know like the players know, that this client is, lets be real, piss-poor. It's even to the point where people CANNOT even play the game because of it. And I'm not just referring to people with toasters or low spec laptops. I've tested the alpha beta bs client on multiple desktops and laptops and it is uhhhh, well I strongly prefer the smoothness of the legacy client. The legacy client itself was actually just getting good. This is coming from someone who's played since the beginning. The legacy client was not always the best and I honestly can admit that it took years for the legacy client to even be what it is today. To just scrap it for some half-assed polished pos is bogus. I get it tho, deadlines and manpower. Why keep working on 2 clients when you can focus on one, It's clear the new client needs attention, that is why I'm guessing you are scrapping the obviously better optimized legacy client. But the reality is as the players, we have no real say and we do understand that you aren't concerned with us as much as you lead other people to believe. I've seen a real shift in company/player relationships since around Season 3/4. Bottom line is you're worried about your bottom line. Which is understandable because it is a free game so I appreciate what you do, I just wish you were more honest, straight up and transparent with your community. This is really starting to feel like a dictatorship. I no longer fall for the illusion that you really care about all of the community because you are definitely catering to e-sports and people with high-end computers. It's fine tho. All companies shift once they see that money, respect and attention coming in. League of Legends is the only MOBA like it so you pretty much have that going for you right now. Once that is factored out and LoL becomes stale and old, remember the reasons that happened were entirely your fault and not the fault of your loyal playerbase. I'm excited to see where League is going, it really has come a long way but again, work on your honesty because you've blatantly lied in the past and have done it here.

I don't have a ton of time to play so I legitimately plan around it.

If people are not using it its hard to test things. Also having to update things that work with both clients is super annoying as a coder. So getting people off the old client is totally where you should be moving and I get that. \n\nSecond, as for item sets, yea I want them and I use them and it sucks they are not in the new client. I do however accept that in order to work on them its better to wait until your not coding for both clients as they are a feature and such. \n\nThird, the lag issues associated with the new client. The visual nonsense and such that causes click delay and all of the \"we are reaching super far to be cool\" and making things break additions. This makes ranked play especially troublesome because users are missing picks/bans and other things. My computer is by no means a potato and I experience game lobby lag where the chat box doesn't load or the team members are invisible and all sorts of graphical glitches and such. Not being able to click on your ward skin or change your summoner spells happens around 20% of the time. This is pretty frustrating when you play ranked. I usually dodge cause its not worth the annoyance. -3lp has become the unfortunate norm. I unfortunately see no way around this until we are all on the new client and you guys have time to work things out. #hopeforthingstogetbetter\n\nNow, for for my actual reason for posting. No I don't like the new client visually, but thats not enough of a reason to not play. My problem is that it actually doesn't work for me. I've sent in bug complaints recently and support tickets on multiple accounts cause well we all have them. The client was annoying at first but I tried forcing myself to get used to it. Now in doing so I started editing rune pages and was working with reordering them in the new dropdowns and renaming them. This new \"feature\" corrupts my rune pages and causes them to duplicate in the game lobby and makes them uneditable. This persists through closing the client and relaunching it. I'm currently able to play and manage rune pages via the legacy client but not in the new client. If I open it I can play, but I have no ability to edit pages or even tell which one I'm selecting. (accurately that is) \n\nAgain, I've sent in bug reports I've complained and in 4 days I just wont be able to play...  So I'm venting...  I've played this game for quite some time. I have multiple smurfs with all champs and all runes. I've spent plenty on this game over the years. Just wondering if the issue is being looked into. I can recreate this issue 100% of the time I go into the new client. It happens every time and has for weeks. I can't be the only player who OCD messes with rune pages and such to have caused this issue...\n\nScreenshots, system data, eyes that can sift through code and figure it out for you if you don't have them. all things I can provide you with if needed. I'll be sitting here hoping you guys have a fix for this before you make us switch. (suggestion: don't make dropdowns for runepages in the collection screen. Or don't allow reordering or something. Check the unique identifiers for them and see if there is an issue with how they are called) \n\nAnyways, I'm rambling now so I'll go. \n\n-\nslimofq\n* first time posting in 10 years.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-20T20:37:27.901+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Slimofq, thanks for taking the time to share your feedback with us and the experiences you’ve had so far with the client.  I wanted to let you know that we’ve received your ticket, and our tech team will be reaching out to you with a fix.  Even though this might be your first post, you’ve seen a lot of shit since Season 1 and still today you help the community with bug reports and being a stand-up summoner.  Don’t think for a moment that we’re just going to let you or anyone else behind just because we’re moving to an improved platform.  You’re coming with us!  \n\nFirst and foremost, I’ll be updating the thread with info regarding this rune page error.  We’ve been tracking this, and while investigating have found that it might be caused through a combination of re-arranging rune pages or using special characters in the name.  Our tech guys will be manually fixing this up for you in your ticket!  I don’t have any eta on a more permanent fix, but it’s on our radar.\n \nThe lag issues you’re mentioning could certainly be an issue with the client, but to be honest it sounds like an unstable connection to me.   More specifically, the delays in selecting masteries/spells and invisible teammates sounds a lot like your connection to champion select could be degrading. Your network settings might be optimized for the legacy client, but the updated version is a different application that could use some tweaking. Just to help rule out that possibility, the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide has some solid steps to tune things up.  If not, let your specialist know in your ticket and we’ll go from there!\n\nYou’ve offered so much already and it means a lot, so I kind of went into an ‘omg fix it mode’ to tackle as much as we could here.  Thanks for letting us hear your voice.   _Hug_","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HammerSlammer21","date":"2017-04-19T21:18:17.735+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Besides the fact I get a bit more lag everywhere than in the Legacy client, the only problem I have is that it takes me 5-10 min to connect to the end stats page after the game ends","replies":[]}]}
