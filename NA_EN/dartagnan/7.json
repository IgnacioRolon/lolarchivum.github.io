As a precaution, we will disable ranked at 12:30AM PDT (existing ranked games will be allowed to finish) and start the actual maintenance around 2:00AM PDT.  Hopefully, we should get this all wrapped up in a few hours, but there are some players who may encounter some disconnects during this period.\r\n\r\nFor some additional info, this maintenance is something we want to complete ASAP due to the issues EUW experienced this past weekend.  After we resolved the issues, we investigated further and realized there was an issue with some of our routers on our network.  We checked our routers we have in NA and found that they had a risk of a similar problem.  We are doing some pro-active maintenance making sure we don&rsquo;t shoot ourselves in the foot twice.\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;ll make sure to provide further updates as they come in!","replies":[{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2016-05-25T01:50:38.736+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"pro-active maintenance \n\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/LDyl6dzOr6Njy/giphy.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2016-05-25T01:53:53.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know right?

You are not special and deserve to receive information on Riot's most inner-workings.  Second of all, they do keep us informed, at their own pace mind you, but it's better than some of the other gaming companies.  As for the \"novel\", I'd rather have too munch information than too little.  Sounds like you need to watch the \"Happy Chewbacca\" video and take a chill pill.
