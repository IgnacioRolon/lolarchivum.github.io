So i've tried logging off my skype account and it still disconnects me and won't let me reconnect until after the game is over and after i lost... So i queue up into a normal and ranked team with my friends and it works perfectly fine but when i go into a normal ranked game it disconnects me and i lost lp that i should/shouldn't have lost depending on if i actually played or not which in this case not because I cant play.

The top right is what it says when i disconnect from server and clearly you can see that my internet is working fine. When i try to look up league of legends in the firewall to enable it, well it doesn't show and it's in alphabetical order. So i click allow another app which brings me to no apps as you can see on the bottom left so i click brows and i don't see league of legends and in the second link i browsed riot games. \n\nIn conclusion I think it is because of my firewall not allowing league of legends as stated on the top right but it clearly shows that i have internet just want to know why i don't see league of legends in my firewall and why doesn't it show league of legends in my allowed/add an app area. I even tried redownloading it and i still get no results","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rray","date":"2016-08-03T07:46:12.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the exact same problem. and i have actually tried everything to fix it. it also only happens in ranked games for me","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
