I think they're dodging but then as the timer hits zero nothing happens. I wait for a little bit and then boom, all the other players are really fast at banning or selecting. While talking to my friends, they don't see that and everything is normal. I tried a blind pick today and it was stuck waiting for players to join and nothing happened. My internet is fine is fine and runs other games well, its just league that this happens with. Please help!!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-13T22:34:05.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This often happens when you have an unstable connection to the League servers. To be clear, it's possible to have a good connection to one server, but not to another, as each server is in a different physical location and your connection travels differently to each. I recommend trying the solutions in our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to resolve this.\n\nLet me know if this caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
