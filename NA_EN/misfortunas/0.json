And their isn't much tanky support itemization, they're are tanky items that tanks buy << and if you are a tanky support you can buy them too albeit they don't necessarily HELP your team thaat much. {{item:3060}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3050}} {{item:3023}}\n\nSona suffers the problem of just qwe w/e and you're helping your team, thats why its difficult to buff her because shes really not doing anything that demands too much skill, shes like low risk low rewards as she dosen't take much risk so she has basic rewards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MCBiggah99","date":"2015-08-22T02:15:48.120+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gHZJdGTi,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-08-22T01:04:29.937+0000)\n>\n> Current thinking: Zyra's a good candidate for some small work.

Later on mid-late game, her plants would die instantly or become useless if being hit by AOE abilities like Miss Fortune E (Make It Rain). So I think that you can buff her plants' health by Zyra's level? or make the plants take at least take some damage from abilities and not die instantly? \nI also like the idea that Zyra gets some movement speed when she is close to her plants. This could be her passive or her W's passive. I think the cool down on her W passive is not that useful and can be remove because I think most Zyra's players max Q first and then E second, then Ultimate, and finally W. This means that you only need to put 1 point in W (2% cd bonus) which later will be max last. So exchanging the CD bonus to movement speed bonus when Zyra is close to her plants should be meaningful in her kit. \nSorry for my bad English lol. Thank you for reading.\n\n http://st.elohell.net/public/chill/fe623bf8e12595d86941c6d14fc002ed.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2015-09-01T20:42:28.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree with plants using health that could scale instead of 3 attacks<< its so annoying when you place plants and they instantly died because enemy champion used a skill or minions just agro it @-@","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NausicÃ¤a ","date":"2015-08-22T01:19:05.305+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Higher base stats please?
