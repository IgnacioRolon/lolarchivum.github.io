If you're not getting an email, two very likely options are the message is landing in your spam folder, or you may be looking in the wrong email. Check your spam folder in your email for the message. If it's not there, be sure to look at [**your account settings** for a hint at what email is tied to your account.](https://account.leagueoflegends.com/na/en/protect)\n\nIf you're definitely checking the right email, then something on our end might be wrong. In that case, we still got you covered but you'll need to open a ticket. Head over to our Support site, make sure you're logged out, and [**open a ticket for help recovering your account**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to get in touch with the folks who can help reset the password for you. You'll likely need to prove ownership of your account, so work with them and answer any questions they ask you best you can! Hope things get cleared up fast. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"kingsofallgods","date":"2018-01-08T23:16:52.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"üôè thanks","replies":[]}]}
