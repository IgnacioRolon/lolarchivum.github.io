But troll will feed, steal CS, tell other team where jng is, use ultimate on own team in teamfights only ({{champion:432}} ), etc.\r\n3- Click on report player button\r\n4- Fill in proper report, including correct filter.\r\n\r\nNow with this reporting system, you can report folks for pretty much anything. However, nothing will be done about it. I have emailed support about it, receiving links to &quot;tribunal is still updating&quot; pages.\r\n\r\nSuggestions on how to fix this issue:\r\n\r\n1- Have Riot make a public statement on the status/ lack of functionality of the tribunal system.\r\n2- Notify people that their report(s) have been received.\r\n3- Actually ban people who deserve it.","replies":[{"poster":"Archon X","date":"2015-09-11T09:34:10.697+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1946315072/200594532?tab=overview\n\nThat game?

We pinged/ warned him away, telling him that we'd just take their blue instead.

When they first took the Tribunal down, there was a News post about it.\n\n> 2- Notify people that their report(s) have been received.\n\nReports are always received. It seems redundant to inform people of the basic function of something. Should your refrigerator inform you when it receives the food you put in it?\n\n> 3- Actually ban people who deserve it.\n\nThey do. That is to say, with only an extremely rare few exceptions, the players who are banned do deserve it. But they're never going to catch everyone. That would require a perfect system - and there's no such thing.\n\nTo speak to what I assume you're implying here, though, they *do* ban trolls and feeders. Right now, it takes rather longer to do so, because those cases have to be addressed manually, but they *are* still addressed. It's not like they just ignore them. That would be silly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"freya od","date":"2015-09-11T19:40:13.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they only have systems in place to deal with toxic people for right now until patch 5.18 comes. even then, they're blank-slating people's punishment (including bans) and they'll be eligible for season rewards. Why? Because riot finally realizes after a year and a half, that they're automated system is severely flawed. Otherwise, they would never ever freely blank-slate people.\n\nSomeone else was on here even thanking lyte for free toxicity week, since come 5.18 the punishments will be removed anyways. So reporting between now and then doesn't even do any thing.","replies":[]}]}
