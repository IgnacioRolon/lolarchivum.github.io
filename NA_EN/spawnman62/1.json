I just made the mistake of letting my queue know that I was in my qualifiers to get out of silver 5. BIG MISTAKE. It was like black friday shopping for 1 of the 10 copies of a teenage doll set at the mall. This in addition to all the wonderful games that I've had recently has made me want to stop playing ranked. Maybe even uninstall. What do you all do when you want to punch your monitor in hopes that it will reach through the internet and connect to that punk who throws/trolls your games? Seriously, this is getting bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2015-01-16T01:21:54.139+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just don't play ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Purple Bees","date":"2015-01-15T22:17:19.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never had the opportunity to play fair ranked games because my internet connection keeps my ping a 200+. In normal games, sometimes my ping spikes to 1-2k and my champion refuses to move or use abilities when I click for input, and I end up dying or missing my ultimate ability because of lag. So I can't really reply know what you're going through, since I've only ever been in Bronze IV.\n\nWhat I can say, though, is that when I do get the rare chances to play League of Legends without lag, and I play my champion well, I'm still happy when we lose. I have fun regardless of the end screen, unless I just ended up playing badly, myself. Sometimes my team wins and my score looks something like 2/16/0, where my only two kills were accidental, and that leaves me with a sour feeling inside. \n\nI've played ranked games and lost and it sucks. And I've played ranked games where *I* was the person who died 40 or 80 times. But that wasn't intentional, and I don't ever try to make someone else lose the game If you play ranked games and it's something that you feel you need to take a break from, then maybe that might be a good idea.","replies":[{"poster":"spawnman62","date":"2015-01-18T08:19:25.426+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel really bad for you just reading this post.

Sounds cliche and old but it really is true, yes losing sucks I am one of the most competitive people you can meet, but keep in mind this game is something you (most likely) do simply for fun. It isn't your job, if you lose 20 LP you are n't going hungry for the week. It really doesn't matter. I understand it's completely frustrating but at the same time even with trolls you can win. If you don't win there are many things YOU did that hurt more than someone picking Teemo or trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"spawnman62","date":"2015-01-18T07:59:26.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So how do you analyze yourself in these instances? No, I do not play LoL to pay my bills. I don't really care if I lose LP or not, I am not the best player in the planet. However I cannot carry my entire team as a support. Do you have fun when you lose? I don't.  Focusing on my errors will help me become a better player, I completely agree. What I'm trying to get at is what's the best way to go from tilt to focus on yourself?","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-01-26T03:09:08.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly if you are going on tilt don;t play, it only makes matters worse. Answering this while taking a break because I am on tilt, just find something to distract yourself for a bit. As far as in game trying to turn it around just focus on what needs to be done to secure the next logical objective, focus on the tasks that need to be done to win isntead of \"OMG you feeders\"","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FizzOnMyJayce123","date":"2015-01-16T15:38:24.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ranked may be full of trolls.
