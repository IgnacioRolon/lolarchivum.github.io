However, the whole Shurima theme going on now is \"Ascension.\"  Has Azir/Ascension been in production since then? Or did it just happen to serve as a happy coincidence?  With the understanding that the Face of the Mountain line is from Mount Targon, and that the Frost Queen's Claim is related to the Freljord, are we to see more stories and lore related to these items?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-09-12T02:48:20.164+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, we had plans for the Shurima event in mind last year when we were retheming some items, Talisman of Ascension included. We didn't have the game mode in mind at that point, but did know that ascension as a concept was something we'd want to do more with, both in regards to Azir and other Shuriman champs.","replies":[{"poster":"TheTyeGuy","date":"2014-09-12T13:40:31.706+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, since the Kage's items became Freljord themed, and the Shuriman items came out, how long til we see a Mt.

Azir ideas date back a long time, but it's likely that these relationships were created with the current iteration of Azir on purpose - make Azir and shuriman ascension symbols look the way they do so that they match the Talisman of Ascension.\n\nTalisman of Ascension was called Shurelya's Reverie, once upon a time. The icon and name were changed after Shurelya left Riot. In a lot of cases, these things are not planned, people just look at stuff thats been done and say \"Oh, we can base this new stuff on that old stuff and draw a connection that will build on the lore!\"","replies":[]}]}
