I&#039;m interesting in discussing the topics in the documentary with others and sharing insights, in addition to other subjects that are relevant, and just out of curiosity getting a number of how many people are aware of this and how they view the topics discussed in the documentary Unacknowledged. Pertaining &quot;Unacknowledged&quot;, this is an oversimplification, but It&rsquo;s a documentary that informs on illegal secrecy regarding new energy technology that surpasses oil and gas being suppressed by corrupt people in our government in the USA and corporations, and topics relevant to that.  Here is the trailer for it, and the full movie is free on Netflix.\r\n\r\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-duAuIqsOQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-duAuIqsOQ)\r\n\r\n\r\n#For those who have watched &quot;Unacknowledged&quot; please send me a friend request on League if you would like to discuss it more outside of the thread, and share insights on the topic, but please at least partake a bit in the threads discussion before doing so, so others can get an idea of what you think about the documentary, and that subject of the UFO phenomenon and Extraterrestrials.\r\n\r\n___________________________\r\n___________________________\r\n___________________________\r\n___________________________\r\n___________________________\r\n___________________________\r\n___________________________\r\n___________________________\r\n___________________________\r\n___________________________\r\n___________________________\r\n___________________________\r\n___________________________\r\n___________________________\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#Note before reading below:\r\n\r\nIf you are not willing to read this entire thread which is understandable, at the very least watch the trailer before you make any comments or ask any questions. Also please be respectful to others who may disagree and give constructive criticism if you are critical of something.\r\n\r\nThis thread is a discussion of the &quot;Unacknowledged&quot; documentary and what you liked or disliked about it, but please DO NOT go in depth into certain things regarding politics, even though the documentary discusses corruption and that encompasses is, but it&#039;s not what I want the core focus of the thread to be. Also don&#039;t go into debate or an excess elaboration concerning politics or the corruption the documentary discusses here please, and please be mindful of trolls that may be baiting you into conversations revolved around this. This is not what I want the focus of this thread to be on.\r\n\r\nThe core of the purpose of this thread and what I want to discuss is what you think about the existence of extraterrestrial beings, your impressions of the documentary and the evidence it provides for that, and whether you liked it and agreed with it or not, or have heard of it before coming across this thread if you haven&#039;t watched it yet. I really would like peoples thoughts on this in the League community.\r\n\r\n_______________________\r\n_______________________\r\n_______________________\r\n_______________________\r\n_______________________\r\n_______________________\r\n\r\nIt gives a variety of strong evidence to support the claims being made, such as relevant declassified documents on the official FBI website. One such topic that is a part of the movie consists of Extraterrestrials and the &quot;debatable&quot; UFO phenomena, and the first document in the trailer that he discusses I have linked below from the official FBI website. I put debatable in quotes because all someone needs to do is a decent amount of research to know that it is not debatable in the slightest. Credible Politicians and other notable people have spoken of the UFO phenomena. Also pertaining the movie correlated to Dr. Steven Greer&#039;s work who is discussing much of what is in the movie, there is a method with a set of protocols that is connected with deep meditation, in which you can initiate contact between Extraterrestrials and UFO&#039;S will appear a large amount of the time once the protocols are followed properly. I have followed those protocols, and have had enormous success with this myself, and have seen UFO&#039;s several times as a result. I am one of MANY people who have initiated contact with these beings from another world, and it is by no means difficult to do, but you must adhere to the protocols in addition to having a certain mentality and understanding the concepts behind the meditation involved with that. You don&#039;t need any experience in meditation practices to do this. Anyone can do it regardless of their experience.\r\n\r\nPeople often believe what they want to believe regardless of evidence and the facts staring at them, and many simply don&#039;t care to look into it which is understandable given how things are pertaining this subject, and there are a lot of wild and outrageous subjects brought up with false information so it is difficult to find what is legitimate. I would like to bring this up for those who have an open mind but also are critical thinkers, and actually seek to prove or disprove something regardless of how outrageous or unbelievable it might be, rather than quickly dismiss it regardless of trying to disprove it or not because of their experience beforehand with the subject or just simply on their beliefs. \r\n\r\nWhat&#039;s helpful about this though, is it is very believable, and the documentary gives evidence to support this and bring this from belief to fact.\r\n\r\nLastly for the trolls who are on the forums, as well as the shallow minded, close minded, and none critical thinkers out there ready to make fun of or attack me and this thread, ask yourself this first. Of the boundless universe do you really believe, key word is BELIEVE and not know, do you believe that there is no other intelligent life out there, given the empirical evidence that there are an estimated 100 BILLION planets in our milky way galaxy alone, just our galaxy and NOT the observable universe or another galaxy such as Androma which is the galaxy closest to ours; additionally right now there are over 3800 exoplanets have been confirmed, and over 2,600 of those have been discovered by Nasa&#039;s Keplar telescope. Lastly do you believe, again key word is believe and not know, do you believe that all has been discovered and learned regarding physics, and think the only way to traverse a MASSIVE distance is linearly through the speed of light, despite concepts in theoretical physics proposing other methods such as worm hole/another dimension to bypass a large distance? Thus if you believe both intelligent life is not out there, and even if they were, that they could not have mastered a way to traverse such distances, then well... I have nothing to say other than watch the documentary, test the evidence in it and what is out there, and you will likely change your beliefs, but first you have to challenge those beliefs if you want to enlighten yourself of the truth. On a side note if you are devoutly religious, there is synchronicity to certain aspects in religion with the subject of extraterrestrials, but you will have to pursue other parts of Dr. Greer&#039;s work for him to elaborate more on that though.\r\n\r\nLastly there&#039;s another against this involving of ,&quot;if they exist why have they not blatantly showed themselves or done something that everyone would be aware of and end the debate.&quot; My answer is they can do that, but they choose not to because doing so would bring about much chaos and hysteria, and very likely much death and destruction because of the corruption of some people in our government and in corporations, as well as pertaining to very rich and powerful religious fanatics and psychopaths who through their belief system would result in much death and suffering. I&#039;ll give a link to a video that articulates this really well below and explains this in much detail if people ask about it, but I ask to first watch the movie and take an educated guess as to what is discussed about this, and then watch the link in which Dr. Greer explains this that I have below. I appreciate any constructive criticism, but regarding this please stay away from criticism that lacks substantial evidence to back it up, so I don&#039;t end up debating something not worth debating. \r\n\r\nThis documentary helps open the perspective and realization that there&#039;s a profoundly extensive amount of knowledge and concepts to be discovered. And that pertains to technology, ourselves, and the true nature of our existence and the boundless universe, and that movie is really just an introduction to that. It&#039;s enlightening and inspiring, and it will introduce and bring awareness to relevant topics and a part of Dr. Greer&#039;s work, and if Dr. Greer&#039;s work is pursued further beyond the documentary, it can lead to dramatically improving your overall well being because of the positive scope all of this centers on, and that eventually leads to the nature of the truths that give power pertaining to topics such as the benefits of meditation practices and the nature of consciousness. After watching It, if you strive to pursue more of Dr. Greer&#039;s work and topics related to that, it will very likely lead you on a path to finding more meaning and happiness in your life, and give you much hope and inspiration, especially pertaining technological advancements yet to be disclosed and discovered, and fascinating discoveries of our universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso I understand burden of proof is on me, so watch the trailer first, then cross check the claims in the movie, and I&#039;ll link the page where he has evidence on Dr. Greer&#039;s website, as well as some links I have read. Note that this is nowhere near the amount of evidence on this subject.\r\n\r\nBelow are links to evidence I have read supporting the claims, and I strongly recommend reading at least the first 2 which is from the official FBI website, and the youtube video on the 2001 National Press Club, and the video Crossing point of light part 18 explains the argument of why have they not clearly showed themselves to the world to end all debate on this issue and make themselves irrefutably be known. I give the descriptions of the links beside them so you can easily find what you want.\r\n\r\n[https://vault.fbi.gov/hottel_guy/Guy%20Hottel%20Part%201%20of%201/view](https://vault.fbi.gov/hottel_guy/Guy%20Hottel%20Part%201%20of%201/view) from official FBI website vault, declassified document\r\n\r\n[https://vault.fbi.gov/Roswell%20UFO/Roswell%20UFO%20Part%201%20of%201/view](https://vault.fbi.gov/Roswell%20UFO/Roswell%20UFO%20Part%201%20of%201/view) from official FBI website vault, declassified document\r\n\r\n[https://www.fbi.gov/services/information-management/foipa](https://www.fbi.gov/services/information-management/foipa) from official FBI website vault, this just gives you an understanding of FBI records, just wanted to put on\r\n\r\n[https://vault.fbi.gov/](https://vault.fbi.gov/) This explains the vault\r\n\r\n[https://vault.fbi.gov/search](https://vault.fbi.gov/search) where you can make searches in the fault\r\n\r\n[http://siriusdisclosure.com/evidence/](http://siriusdisclosure.com/evidence/) The official website of Dr. Steven Greer in the evidence section.

I provide a documentary giving substantial and legitimate evidence for their existence. There is also illegal secrecy and corruption in parts of our government in the USA connected with corruption in corporations and it pertains to illegal secrecy and revolutionary technology being suppressed that will change how we live, and will add significantly more abundance and prosperity to our lives, and again there is strong evidence for this that I have included above via links, and the documentary discusses this topic extensively. Watch the documentary. I include the trailer here.\r\n\r\n#AGAIN Note:\r\nThis thread is a discussion of the &quot;Unacknowledged&quot; documentary and what you liked or disliked about it, but please DO NOT go in depth into certain things regarding politics, even though the documentary discusses corruption and that encompasses is, but it&#039;s not what I want the core focus of the thread to be.
