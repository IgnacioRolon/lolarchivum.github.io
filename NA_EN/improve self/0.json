Upon messaging Riot support my account was 'banned' by a Tech Support member in order to stop the hacker from causing any major damage. Since then I have recovered my account and have full control but it got me thinking\r\n\r\nCould it be that a tech support ban to stop a hacker from using an account be seen by the rewards distribution system as a ban within the last 3 months; a ban within the last 3 months would mean that no rewards would be handed to that person\r\n\r\nNote: I have submitted a ticket to support but they are taking ages to reply so I'd like to try this in the meantime","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-11T17:00:07.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe that reward disqualifications would occur as a result of an account security lock; however, I'm not a part of the teams that overseas this.  Putting in a ticket was a solid plan, as our account team is best at handling your specific issue.  Keep in mind that we're still rolling out rewards, so you may have just been missed on the first pass.  I'm betting that you'll probably see your rewards before a response, hopefully!  Hang tight until then!","replies":[{"poster":"Carl Jungle","date":"2016-11-11T19:39:42.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a similar problem I posted here, http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/M1cwvNvk-support-problem-leading-to-no-rewards\n\nWould appreciate any information you could provide on my situation.

First time posting on forums and I'm pleasantly surprised :) Just as I created the post I got a reply from support saying that the 'tech ban' doesn't affect my season rewards and that they are still being distributed (essentially aligning perfectly with your reply)\n\nOnce again thank you!","replies":[]}]}]}
