Don&#039;t you think scripters should be banned before negative players. I mean at the end of the day anyone can get a little frustrated. Video games are a healthy way to manage stress, I don&#039;t encourage negative behavior but banning people from a stress reliever is a bit counter productive. Reform is very important. Those who curse should be chat banned, those who intentionally feed (which is rarer than people claim) should be placed in a new division that is lower than bronze that can only be left by having a series of games focused on positive kda. But even so, people who script do it very intentionally. They take the fun out of the game. They add to the stress. In fact I am sure many players become toxic after being matched up against scripters.  If there were no scripters there would be less toxic people too. I think riot should change its priority towards banning scripters over behavior management. Every year the community seems to become more toxic regardless. Getting rid of scripters seems like a much better way of improving the community. \n\nI played this game for 5 years and now I want to quit because scripters have taken my dream away of becoming high rank. How can you take pride winning when you cheat? That is like bragging about money you stole from someones life savings. Where is the honor?\n\n&gt; I know riot bans scripters, but to be ranked number one most played game before they really should up their priority for fair play.","replies":[{"poster":"mirageofpenguins","date":"2017-09-06T00:45:36.695+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looked into your last 100 ranked games and you played with exactly one scripter (on your team), who has since had his account nuked so hard that even his grandkids' grandkids won't be able to login.\n\nThey're a dying breed, my man.","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2017-09-06T00:55:15.646+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"but will his grandkids' grandkids' grandkids be able to retrieve the account?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Firethorn","date":"2017-09-06T00:54:25.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mirageofpenguins,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=9KbgJjvR,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2017-09-06T00:45:36.695+0000)\n>\n> Looked into your last 100 ranked games and you played with exactly one scripter (on your team), who has since had his account nuked so hard that even his grandkids&#x27; grandkids won&#x27;t be able to login.\n> \n> They&#x27;re a dying breed, my man.\n\nLOL this just made me laugh","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SavageConcordia","date":"2017-09-05T19:57:10.810+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":">How come there are so many scripters in league not getting banned?  \n\nRiot bans scripters in waves, this results in points when there are very few people scripting and times with relatively large amounts. \n\n>banning people from a stress reliever is a bit counter productive.  \n\nNot if your way of relieving stress is by verbally assaulting strangers. \n\n>I played this game for 5 years and now I want to quit because scripters have taken my dream away of becoming high rank.  \n\nBullshit. Look at challenger right now. Do you think all of them are scripting? No. They are very dedicated. You are in Bronze3, you are not being held down by anything but your own ability. For every feeder, toxic player, scripter ect. on your team, statistically speaking, there will be one on the other team. The only constant (provided you play solo) from game to game is you, focus on yourself before anything. If you are serious about climbing stop playing cheese builds, that will go a long way.","replies":[{"poster":"AP MISS FORTUNE","date":"2017-09-05T19:59:04.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":14,"body":"Could you not curse in the community forum.
