His abilities allow him to isolate key targets in numerous situations, protect himself or his allies through his utility, and still provide consistent damage for the team.\n\n**Basic Statistics**\n>**Attack Range:** 125 (Melee)\n**Intended Role (Primary):** Top\n**Intended Role (Secondary):** Tank/Jungle\n&asymp;  **Attack:** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■■■■■□□□□□\n&asymp;  **Defense:** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■■■■■■■□□□\n&asymp;  **Ability:** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■■■■■□□□□□\n&asymp;  **Difficulty:** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■■■■■□□□□□\n\n---\n#ABILITIES&raquo;\n**Innate - Approaching Rain**\n>After using an ability, Setsu initiates a 4-second timer during which he gains 20% movement speed. At the end of the timer, enemies within 250 range of Setsu are stunned for 0.5 seconds. Only one timer can be active at a time.\n\n>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**CD:** 6 seconds\n\n**Q - Thundering Squall**\n>On activation, Setsu charges his autoattack over 4 seconds reaching maximum charge after 2 seconds. This autoattack deals 20/30/40/50/60 (+40% AD)(+40% AP) to 60/90/120/150/180 (+120% AD)(+120% AP) magic damage to an enemy and slows it by 80% for 1 second. A fully charged Thundering Squall will echo dealing the same damage to nearby enemies and slowing them by 40%. Setsu can move and cast abilities like normal while charging. This autoattack cannot critically strike or apply on-hit effects.\n\n>**_Guardian's Embrace:_** Setsu's Thundering Squall attack will dash to target enemy currently chained.\n\n>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Echo Range:** 250\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**CD:** 10/9/8/7/6 seconds\n\n**W - Guardian's Embrace**\n>**Passive**\nSetsu&#039;s power burns through the earth leaving a short trail of Corrupted Energy in his wake for 1.5 seconds. Enemies on the trail or around Setsu take 7/14/21/28/35 (+2/2.5/3/3.5/4% of Setsu's current health) magic damage per second. Setsu&#039;s abilities also leave behind Corrupted Energy. \n\n>**Active**\nSetsu unleashes 3 chains in a cone that latch on to the first enemy champions they hit for up to 3 seconds as long as they are within an extended range. Setsu&#039;s next ability has an alternate effect during Guardian&#039;s Embrace. Guardian's Embrace can be recast for its alternate effect.\n\n>**_Guardian's Embrace:_** Setsu deals 60/100/140/180/220 (+60% AP) magic damage to each chained enemy. Setsu heals for half of the damage dealt and gains a shield for 2 seconds equal to the amount healed.\n\n>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Cast Range:** 825\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Leash Range:** 1100\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**CD:** 14/13/12/11/10 seconds\n\n**E - Passing Judgement**\n>Setsu commands two swords to strike target enemy champion dealing 40/70/100/130/160 (+60% AP)(+60% Bonus AD) physical damage to all enemies they pass through. Afterwards, the swords remain at their landing location for 1.5 seconds tethering the target enemy to them. The tethered enemy cannot move farther than 200 units from either sword.\n\n>**_Guardian's Embrace:_** Setsu commands one sword towards each chained enemy and tethers them.\n\n>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Cast Range** 675\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**CD:** 12/11.75/11.5/11.25/11 seconds\n\n**R - Final Judgement**\n>Setsu dashes forward. If he collides with an enemy champion, he drags it to the underworld removing both himself and the enemy from the battlefield. After 1.25 seconds, Setsu returns to nearby target location with the enemy dealing 175/250/325 (+80% AP) magic damage to it and half to nearby enemies within the area.\n\n>**_Guardian's Embrace:_** Setsu's dash becomes targeted towards chained enemy.\n\n>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Dash Range:** 600\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Return Range:** 325\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**AoE:** 325\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**CD:** 100 seconds","replies":[{"poster":"Blood4Thirst","date":"2015-10-19T22:53:11.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh damn!

That gives you a little incentive to level it first, but the W active's damage is a little low. It seems like you'd only level it for the passive, and then start maxing your Q, which deals 180 on-hit damage. Could I get some cooldown and mana cost estimates? Also, Guardian's Embrace seems to be the opening for a gigantic burst. It'd be better if you only proc the Guardian's Embrace effect once, and then buff it on each skill.\nFor example:\nOn the Q , have you and the target dragged together (like a Nautilus Q) and then they become stunned for 0.5 seconds\nI don't understand how the W works. Do you reactivate it and it just deals double the damage immediately (effectively dealing triple damage)? And doesn't that just make it so that it automatically deals that damage, because they're already affected by Guardian's Embrace? Whatever the case...\nInstead, have it deal another 45/75/105/135/165 +45% AP +45% bonus AD magic damage over the three seconds, but they have to stay within the tether range. If they stay in the tether range for the entire duration, Setsu is healed for 75% of the damage dealt.\nOn the E, the tether range is shortened to 200 and the duration is increased to 2 seconds.\nThe E doesn't exactly have counterplay, it's basically a glorified snare. If you made it a skill shot, it could be more like\nSetsu throws a sword in the target direction, dealing physical damage to the first enemy unit it hits and creating a tether, preventing them from moving more than 250 units. Setsu can use this ability another two times if the first sword struck an enemy. Hitting the same enemy deals 50% damage (effectively 200% total)\nThen you can just scale it down to 20/30/40/50/60 +20% AP +20% bonus AD per sword. \nThe ultimate is now just a point-and-click Zhonya's for you and the chained enemy, so I don't know what you're planning on doing with that. Is it supposed to be a clean up tool or an initiation? As a clean up in a teamfight, it incapacitates you for more than a second, which would be detrimental for your team. Maybe instead, Setsu can take them to the underworld for a briefer time, maybe 0.5 seconds, dealing the damage to them there every 0.1 seconds. If they die while under that effect, the Underworld can claim its soul or whatever and their death timer is increased, maybe (?) The Guardian's Embrace effect could be what increases the death timer, or it changes it to a full second, dealing the damage every 0.14 seconds (140% damage because seven ticks instead of five) but something minimal so that people don't ONLY use the ultimate to proc it.\nSorry this got so long, hope it helps","replies":[{"poster":"Secluded Death","date":"2015-04-27T21:13:58.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"W passive is 35 damage at max rank, not at level 1. W active damage is low because it can deal a lot of damage plus enhances the _next_ ability. Only one Guardian's Embrace skill can be used per cast!\n\nThe damage isn't necessarily triple on W active. The base damage is triple (30+60) but the scaling isn't since the first cast is 60% Bonus AD and the Guardian's Embrace damage is 60% AP. The damage is not automatic. In order to deal that damage, you would have to land a W, then activate W again which uses up your Guardian's Embrace.\n\nI reduced the tether range to 200, but I'm hesitant to increase the duration. It would not allow dashes or blinks due to it having the same properties as a root/snare. Also, 2 second tether on 3 enemy champions is a lot (although hard to land so I am thinking about it).\n\nI don't know when you starting typing your review, but the ult isn't targeted anymore (unless combined with Guardian's Embrace). It is now a skillshot dash that ults the first champion Setsu collides with meaning he can miss entirely or hit the wrong person. I like the idea of dealing damage to the enemy during the duration, but I also like the AoE on the return. Lots of choices!\n\nThank you for the review, it helped a lot! And I like long reviews, they are nice and thorough.\nI hope I cleared some things up as well. ☻","replies":[{"poster":"procrastinasian","date":"2015-04-28T02:28:53.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Computer crashed, nice big paragraph was lost.

Corrupted Energy lingers for 1.5 seconds.\n\nSinged Q damage is much higher scaling with an AP ratio meaning it ramps up in damage while also dealing damage outside of the trail for 3 more seconds dealing even more combined damage. Setsu has more opportunities to use this damage on enemies, but it deals a much lower damage and doesn't linger on an enemy.\n\nI think 200 range is good so I made it default.\n\nThe ult is a slight mix between malphite and lissandra but unlike malphite, it doesn't hard CC everyone and unlike lissandra, the enemy can't still be damaged.\n\nThank you for your continued support and sorry I hadn't replied for a while!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Colonel Lapoose","date":"2015-04-27T03:50:27.570+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does he drive a Sudan?
