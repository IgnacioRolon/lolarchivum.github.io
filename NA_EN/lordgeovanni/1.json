Meat sheilds with little damage that arent effective meat sheilds trying to cc the enemy meat sheilds so their 1 carry can rip the enemy meat shields in less than 10 seconds which in previous seasons would have taken the entire enemy team with 3 average damage dealers at least 15 seconds to do.\r\nThe meat sheilds die faster now but their spell cooldowns are still just as long as they used to be if not longer.","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2017-03-20T05:44:15.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> which in previous seasons would have taken the entire enemy team with 3 average damage dealers at least 15 seconds to do\n\nThat seems balanced to you?\nAnd why are you pretending there was no tank meta in season 5 or 6?

Why shouldnt you be able to survive at least 3 times at long as some one who does not spend a drop in defense when you invested all of your gold into defense and unlike offensive items building defense doesnt make it easier to obtain gold only  {{item:3751}}  does that which could just as well cause you to miss farm as it would get you farm (which makes you farm slower than they do in comparison so your item are shit and only work early game but you cant get them fast enough to contend with damage dealers early game). Compared to now where you survive 5 seconds with a meat shield champion and carries can infinitely drain tank you while killing you and instagibing any one squisher than you that isnt another drain tanking carry.\nThe problem is when Carry vs carry fights last longer than carry versus Some one building defenses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-03-20T05:58:44.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dynikus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AxE5kEop,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-20T05:44:15.787+0000)\n>\n> That seems balanced to you?\n> And why are you pretending there was no tank meta in season 5 or 6?
