Im forced to give up position just to not be caught out by enemy numbers where my allies then go futher back and so on.\r\nIm tired of not being able to farm past half of laning phase because anyone except the support and take my CS from me because they dont have to dilute their damage for Defense to not get instagibbed and they also have more range and high damage aoe spells that allow them to more reliably pick up Cs from a safer range.","replies":[]}
