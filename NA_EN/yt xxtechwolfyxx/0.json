I'm pretty tired and needed a quick warmup game. I am a very toxic person but I try not to be so toxic in chat.(I'll even type something and delete it just to get the anger out) I start the game as kayn just as I normally would, I sit in a bush to get vision in case of a invade and I get ready to do red buff top side. But my laner doesn't help, this isn't the first time so I don't think much of it. because of not receiving a leash im a little lower health than usual but im only 100 health down so It's pretty okay, do my normal early top gank to help our laner out and notice the akali is haveing some trouble so I think sweet this will be good. I gank waste her spells and get her to half, it is a riven and she almost kills me, my top akali never comes and I panic cause I'm going to die so i flash and e into the wall, sadly the riven also flashes and kills me. \r\n\r\nThis is pretty much the end of the game because it all goes downhill, but the backstory is important to understand my chat logs(Also the Yassuo mid(Enemy) went barrier and started cloth armor and our talon called him a pussy.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: damn a riven 1 trick\r\nAkali: Why did you int my lane?\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: well\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: yea i ask myself that aswell\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: why do i get troll tops\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: who have no idea how to play theirr champ\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: u just picked akali\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: and u dont know how to play her\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: i ganked\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: u didnt hit her\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: once\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: my first gank is always a test\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: to test how useless the laner is\r\nThis is where i gank the mid laner and their yas has barrier and flashes\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: what a pussy fuck me lol\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: ive never seen barrier yas before\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: lol\r\n(akali flames me again)\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: yep\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: sucks that i have a 65% winrate\r\nAkali: What in 5 games?\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: no\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: in 5 its 100%\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: in 30 its 80%\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: this is gold3 elo..\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: yea\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: im gold 4?\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: ive played 70 games\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: started in b4\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: not close\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: i did\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: rammus was right there\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: because they have cc\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: we dont 1 shot\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: theirr cc is 6 sec\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: betterr jg not better player yes\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: a counter to me and is very strong champ atm\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: gank fed lanes?\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: riven is fed beyond believe\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: belief\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: this is a toxic team\r\nAt this point I had realized how this game was going and didn't really want to gank and have them complain more but sadly no matter what happened they complained.\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: why would i care about ganking?\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: i dont lose anything frorm this loss?\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: you literally blamed the gank on me?\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: and then i said something\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: lol\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: yep im wrong lol\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: idc about this loss\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: i can just play another game\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: yea\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: chekc my match history?\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: 14/5/17\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: 10/4\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: 6/2\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: 14/2\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: im literally afk...\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: im just walking around\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: watching netfliux\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: for what?\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: you literally cant report me?\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: ...\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: i wanted the xp\r\nYT xXTechWolfyXx: oh vayne\r\n\r\nNot saying I wasn't in the wrong but this is not what I would consider toxic expecially considering how they treated me.\r\n\r\nAs I know leagues banning system is far from perfect and by far i mean its basically useless","replies":[]}
