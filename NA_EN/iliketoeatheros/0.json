I can't alt-tab, ctrl alt delete or anything. It first started about a month ago and I started playing again a couple of weeks ago. I played 1 game with no issues and ever since that I've had the same issue. 2 games I was marked as a leaver because of it and I've tested it in a custom today and it's still happening. I wasn't sure if repairing the client would help or what else would be the problem so I was hoping somebody would know here!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-18T20:24:12.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The buzzing noise and freezing has been an issue for a few players after a Windows 10 update.
