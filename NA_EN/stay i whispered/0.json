I restarted the client and its said it needed to update it and the game would restart in 10 seconds. When this happened it went through and did the same thing over and over. So, I deleted the game entirely and downloaded it again. This reverted it back to the old client which I didn't have in place and said it needed to update. Once it was done updating it said the message in the image linked. So, now every time I open the client, it automatically downloads the new client but that message pops up and the process repeats.\r\n\r\n                                                               If anyone could help me, it would be greatly appreciated.\r\n                                                                                                  Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-18T22:21:21.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to help but just need one more piece of detail to figure out what's happening.
