It would also be appropriate to not assume that it's a problem with the physical comfort of his mouse and that OP should replace his with another when Its quite likely the issue originates from him using the scroll button for another function.  That makes it an issue of preference which will be lacking on nearly all mice with a middle button as they are almost exclusively implemented under the scroll wheel and his personal preferences likely include said wheel.  \n\nSuggesting he buy a replacement mouse when you don't know if it's a problem with the mouse or his preferred settings is like telling someone to replace their car's master cylinder when you don't even know if the brake pressure is wrong or if they just want to adjust how the pedal sits...\n\nAdditionally while directly disabling them has never been possible it used to be possible to set the scroll wheel's speed to 0.  Perhaps you could find out if there is another method of doing so as the previous method https://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-en/6nq2XPXE-how-to-disable-mouse-wheel-zooming seems to no longer be possible?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"R31W1NG","date":"2017-06-13T21:04:34.488+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It used to be possible by editing your config files as shown here https://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-en/6nq2XPXE-how-to-disable-mouse-wheel-zooming but riot appears to have removed this functionality...  That or I'm too incompetent to figure it out.  My best guess is it got dropped with all the anti-cheat changes they made when implementing the new client as riot seems to think zooming in serves some 1337 purpose.  That or it got dropped when they started storing settings settings server side.\n\nBut in all honesty the ability to implement it into the persistent settings file was probably accidentally removed with the supposed(late night twisted treeline is still full of bots apparently) anti-cheat changes.  If you do somehow get it working please let me know.","replies":[]}]}
