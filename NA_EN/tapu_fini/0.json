For some reason I haven't been able to the past few days but it seems to be fixed.\n\nAs a thought, this probably doesn't have to do with anything on your side; it's probably just an issue with Boards not being able to continuously see you're logged in.  If it thinks you're not logged in, it probably says \"guests don't need the 'my updates' bar\".  That's just one of the things I'm thinking the problem stems from.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-08-10T04:29:08.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mine's back now, but it just came back earlier today.
