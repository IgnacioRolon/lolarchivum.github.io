For instance if you are Zed with Dark Harvest on Aram the buff will say the differences in dark harvest. Then if you go over to Nexus Blitz on Zed the buff will show the stat differences between rift and blitz?\n\nI feel like for people that dont look far into it, it can cause some unexpected misunderstanding for champions from 1 mode to another.\n\nIs this possible?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blackii7","date":"2018-11-20T21:09:04.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=syzwxbct,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2018-11-20T02:47:27.292+0000)\n>\n> Those are Nexus Blitz specific balance changes that for some reason are showing up in other modes on the PBE today.
