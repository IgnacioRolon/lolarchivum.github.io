I think you are down playing just how big a 42 heal is (especially in the early game.) It's the same reason why people get so frustrated with lane Kindred even though their heal is - only - 60 + 3 x their level. It is a reliable way to stay in lane and win extended trades at no cost to the player.\n\nBecause of how yasuo's crit chance functions, while it is still relatively speaking, more rng early game, it turns out to be a reliable way to sustain. I'd wager he could actually out heal kindred in lane after this patch. With two otems (statik + cloqk og agility) he hits 100% crit chance. That means on literally everything he does, he gets that heal as well as having an INCREDIBLY flexible build path since he only has to worry about two item slots for crits.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2015-11-12T20:13:14.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Comparing the crit mastery to the on hit bonus damage, the crit mastery seems a bit weak in comparison.\n\nIt gives 80 bonus damage on every Q and auto, unreducted and can be stacked up using any ability.

The problem with the other option is that it forces you to stay in combat and needs to ramp up.
