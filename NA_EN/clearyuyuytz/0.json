But as i logged on one of my other account (which was also member in), i can still see that i am supposed to be the leader and the ownership didn't transfer.\n\nI am Ydg, from the server EUW.\nI hope you could maybe do something,\n\nThanks ~","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-20T21:02:45.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically we prefer that you make your own post, which is mainly just to make sure that we see your message and don't miss it!\n\nSince we're here already, I went ahead and fiddled around with that club a bit.
