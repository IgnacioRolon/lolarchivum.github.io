I've been using this website (Link at Bottom) lately and all's been fine, until recently. I can't seem to find the arrow to swap the sets anywhere, and it just shows the recommended sets, anyone know why? I think my League just isn't using the \"Champions\" folder in general, but I may be wrong, any help is appreciated. Thank you for taking your time to read this.\n\n(P.S: Sometime's it works, whilst the others it doesn't, not sure why)\nhttp://lol.item-set.com/#!/editor","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-01T22:50:55.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not 100% sure how that website works since it's not managed by Riot, but we did just add custom item sets into the client with this latest patch! You should be able to find it under your collections, and I've linked and image to help as well! ^_^\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/c67c17259aa4f159b1a3e4c5032cdc65.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoobLearninGame","date":"2017-06-01T13:03:51.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked at the new Item Set creator after the patch, and from what I can see so far I'm finding it somewhat limited.. maybe I need to play around with it more. I only looked at it for a few minutes, we'll see. Might just need to figure out a few things.\n\nI might stick with that website you linked to, which I've been using for a while.\n\nAs far as the answer to your question, I went into the folder the item sets were in (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\\Champions) and saw that all of the original sets Riot included were removed. It's possible that if you'd altered those default sets into customized sets (saved under the same name), they were deleted. The only sets that remain for me are my separate custom sets I made. I originally was setting them each to be named for specific champions (for example: \"Shaco0.json\"), but started making them all \"Global0.json\" sets, and putting them in each champion's folder.\n\nI realized by making a default \"Global\" template that I could reuse/reupload at that website with the most common base items for any role, and by deleting unneeded items for each new champion I'd create a set for, I'd save a lot of time not having to find many of the items I needed. Instead I just need to find the 6 main items for any champion I want to play, some alternative items, and I'm ready to go.\n\nI could post a couple screenshots to show what I mean if you want.","replies":[]}]}
