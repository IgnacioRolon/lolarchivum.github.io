Ended up being a problem with my router/modem (which were brand new) router was set to receive IPv4 and it was suppose to be set for IPv6.

I play on mac client if that matters, but its just constant DCing or it doesn't let me move but everyone else around me can move and i can still type to them and all that so I know I'm not lagged out. At first i thought it was my ISP and my Mouse for both problems but after swapping out mouses and also checking the pads on the old one i now know it wasn't the mouse. i called my ISP and asked them to restart or \"Ping\" it for me and it didn't change. I have perfect connection on ANY other games i play and i can even type to my friends in the game chat while it says I'm dc'd. To be honest I'm not really sure how i can help with this problem but some feedback would be nice","replies":[]},{"poster":"Existencexx","date":"2016-05-06T23:49:58.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i myself have done most if not all of these LoL is the only game im having an issue with out of no where.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Existencexx","date":"2016-05-06T22:10:41.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im having the same issue almost accept everything is completely unplayable but every other game ive played is fine and same with browser videos etc..","replies":[]}]}
