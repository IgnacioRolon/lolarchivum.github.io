But I do enjoy playing Garen because he is very reliable if you know what you are doing. The villain mechanic introduces a huge amount of unreliability that you have no agency over to a reliable champion. Unlike with Gnar where you can at least choose when to go in with Mega Gnar and some reliability over his transformation, the only way Garen has any control over his Villain mark is if he feeds the champion he wants marked. \n\nAnd even then it adds no interesting gameplay decisions as most of the time the villain mark should have no influence on who Garen goes after as one of three things will happen:\n\n1. The mark will be on a target he doesn't want to go after. In which case the mark should be ignored.\n\n2. The mark is on a target he can't reach. In which case the mark should be ignored.\n\n3. The mark is on a target he can reach and does want to reach. In which case he was going to go after that enemy anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"OneSmoothDude","date":"2015-08-14T12:09:15.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try to think of the Villain mechanic as a straight buff, instead of only looking for all the ways that it _might_ not be game-changing. That fact is, this mechanic buffs Garen so he is able to do tons of true damage to a given enemy.** This is never a bad thing.** It's all in how you use it (as Repertoir mentioned with Gnar's transformation). This doesn't change Garen's abilities in any way except make them more powerful, so unlike Gnar's unpredictability, Garen's has no downsides. Only buffs.\n\nThe way I see it, there are two possibilities:\n1. It's on somebody that you want to kill. Great! This will help with the killing of that person.\n2. It's on somebody that you don't think is a good target (can't get to them, they're a support who got lucky last teamfight, they are a better duelist and the added damage won't make a difference, etc.)...oh well? Do a jungle camp. Hold down your lane opponent. Group for Dragon. Basically, do Garen stuff elsewhere, and no harm done. Eventually it will move to a better target, at which point I will direct you to point #1.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-08-10T20:20:38.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gnar actually has some interactivity to control your mega gnar form. If you skirt the edge of combat and only AA sparingly you can keep yourself at ~90 ish rage in order to get your form change on demand. That interactivity is hard to do but it helps distinguish great gnar players from good. \n\nIf Garen had some kind of interactivity with the villain mechanic i would absolutely agree with your Gnar analogy here, but if that interactivity exists i have overlooked it somehow.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
