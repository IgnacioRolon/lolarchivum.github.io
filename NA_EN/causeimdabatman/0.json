I want to disable chat for the people who are in the same game as me sake&#039;s. I am naturally toxic. I will not hold back in game especially when i want to win, but i don&#039;t want to be punished for being who I am. So just give me the option to completely remove chat. pings should be sufficient.","replies":[{"poster":"Android Cowboy","date":"2015-06-21T18:02:25.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, get one of those squishy stress toys or a cat.......... or a girlfriend. {{champion:150}}","replies":[{"poster":"causeimdabatman","date":"2015-06-21T18:36:45.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Android Cowboy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=s05nVq5b,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-06-21T18:02:25.641+0000)\n>\n> Dude, get one of those squishy stress toys or a cat.......... or a girlfriend. {{champion:150}}\nI have a girlfriend lol and that's not going to make me not toxic","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"injourn","date":"2015-06-21T05:56:31.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What the heck kind of logic is that?

I can't help the fact that people on this game get offended easily and I can't stop myself from being harsh, so the only way to meet at middle ground is to let me disable my chat completely.","replies":[{"poster":"injourn","date":"2015-06-21T17:05:32.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here we have the ad hominem fallacy in action. As well as the refusal to improves one's self disguised as an inability. \n\nI really don't understand how it is so hard just to not be toxic. Never mind the fact that there are already several ways to disable the chat, but no just like every thing you want it to be clear and cut like a fucking child. I honestly can't take you seriously because if you were looking to turn off chat or not be toxic, you would know this.\n\nP.S. You also don't seem to know how analogies work.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-06-21T07:35:18.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear Dairy,\n\nWhen i grow up i want to be a jerk.

Also i can tell you must not have fully developed your reading and comprehension skills well. I want to win. But at the same time i can not stop myself  from being toxic. So In order to not reduce my chances at winning i want to remove chat so i can no longer be toxic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-06-21T07:16:53.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey kids you wanna learn about god complexes?","replies":[{"poster":"causeimdabatman","date":"2015-06-21T16:29:05.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Darkmind1212,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=s05nVq5b,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-06-21T07:16:53.551+0000)\n>\n> Hey kids you wanna learn about god complexes?\n\nHow does that even pertain to this?
