DJ Sona has already been confirmed to be the ultimate skin so, goodbye. Moving on though, They are making a ultimate skin for every lane. For example:\n{{champion:77}} - Jungle\n{{champion:81}} - ADC\n{{champion:37}} - Support. \n\nNow we wait for the other two.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2015-02-02T20:31:24.783+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was nice knowing you I guess.

When you are picking a high cost skin you don't want to give it to a champion that doesn't have many other skins. It pigeon holes people into feeling like they need the Ultimate skin which is a really sucky thing to do to the fanbase. Sona is a lot better option than someone like Zed, Zac, or Xerath because of their limited range of skins. Naut has a new skin in the making, Vi recently got a new skin.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rustling Bush","date":"2015-02-02T20:30:32.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait dj sona is a thing? where did you hear of this lol?","replies":[{"poster":"causeimdabatman","date":"2015-02-02T20:52:52.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Summoner Grey,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=4FY3jcVF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-02T20:30:32.086+0000)\n>\n> wait dj sona is a thing? where did you hear of this lol?\n\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/01/dj-sona-promo.html#more","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2015-02-02T20:32:33.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it was in the game files a couple of months ago and if you check Surrender @ 20 Riot sent out emails with VIP passes to DJ Sona recently.
