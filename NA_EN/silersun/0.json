He excels at dealing high damage to close enemies, and at controlling his domain.\r\nHis body is comparable to Cassiopeia to an extent. His lower body is more of a snake&#039;s, oozing where he moves. His upper body is more of a wasp&#039;s. He has two antenna, which are dark green and leak of venom.\r\nHe has 500 attack range, and a mana resource bar.\r\n\r\nLevel 1 Health: 460\r\nHealth regen: 9\r\nMana: 325\r\nMana Regen: 6\r\nAttack Damage: 55.5\r\nAttack Speed: .680\r\nMovement Speed: 310\r\n\r\nPassive: Lord of Venom\r\nThis passive has 3 parts to it. The first part: Ostium leaves a trail of venom wherever he moves. This lasts 18 seconds. When he is on the trail, he gains 40-80 MS based on level. When a non-Ostium enemy is on the trail, they lose 10-30 MS.\r\nOstium&#039;s attacks only deal 60% of AD damage. However, they also apply _Deadly Venom_ (rename this cause Twitch). This venom stacks up to 4 times, and deals 2-20 (25% AD) (4%AP) bonus magic damage over 5 seconds. When auto attacking an enemy at 4 stacks, he unleashes a blast of venom at his target, consuming the debuff and 12-60 (125% AD) (32% AP) magic damage. This effect has a 20 second CD.\r\nOstium takes 3-39 less damage from any single target spell that hits him (not auto attacks or damage over times), and 5% reduced damage from area of effect spells.\r\n\r\nQ: Stinging Shot: 700 Range, Skill shot. 120/110/100/90/80 Mana. 10/9.5/9/8.5/8 second CD.\r\nOstium blasts venom out in a line in front of him, dealing 30(20% AP) magic damage to enemies hit by it. Minions and small monsters take 3 times as much damage. When it comes into contact with a large monster or champion, it detonates after .5 seconds. It can be reactivated to detonate early. The explosion deals 45(30% AP) physical damage, and applies _Stinging Venom_. Stinging Venom deals 10 (10% AP) magic damage every second for up to 12 seconds, based on how far the shot traveled. Minimum duration is 4 seconds.\r\n\r\nW: Corrosive Skin: Passive\r\nEnemies that damage Ostium are poisoned with _Corrosive Venom_, This venom causes enemies to take 70(25% AD)(5% AP) physical damage over 10 seconds, are slowed, and causes their non-ultimate cooldowns recharge at a 5% reduced rate for the duration.\r\n\r\nE: Toxic Minion: 1200 Range, 3 Charges, 36-9 second recharge\r\nOstium summons a minion at a target location that will act in 3 different ways:\r\nSummoned in lane: Follows other lane minions\r\nSummoned in jungle near Monsters: Will attack the monsters with Ostium, then follow Ostium.\r\nSummoned in jungle: Remains stationary, and attacks enemy champions that gain vision of it.\r\nUp to 2-6 Toxic Minions can be summoned. They last 120 seconds if they remain stationary, up to 30 seconds after attacking an enemy. If summoned to follow a lane or Ostium, they last 20-56 seconds based on level.\r\nToxic Minions gain the effects of Lord of Venom, and only have 1 AD. They also gain the rank of Corrosive Skin. They gain AD and AP based on Ostium&#039;s bonus AD and AP.\r\nPassive: Toxic Wards. Wards placed last 10% longer, gain the rank of Corrosive Skin, and have bonus health. They also will attack when revealed, dealing 30% of Deadly Venom&#039;s damage.\r\n\r\nR: Corrupting Venom: 600 Range, 40 second CD after the effect ends on a champion.\r\n\r\nInstantly corrupt an enemy champion with _Corrupting Venom_ who is affected by Deadly Venom, Stinging Venom, and Corrosive Venom. While corrupted, they are initially slowed for 90% of their movement speed, reduced to 10% over 1.5 seconds, and take 30 (20% AP) magic damage every 3 seconds. This effect lasts up to 30 seconds. If cast on an enemy below 20% of their maximum health, the damage is increased by 50%, and ticks 3 times faster. If the champion dies while effected by Corrupting Venom, the cooldown of Corrupting Venom is reduced by 40 seconds, and Ostium gains a movement speed boost of 10% for 15 seconds. This effect stacks up to 10 times.\r\n\r\nI know the numbers could be off, but I wanted to whip this all together and just see what people thought about it. I don&#039;t expect much, just a cool concept.","replies":[]}
