I may just copy and paste them from my discord, or I can give a general idea on what some of them do, and I could leave a discord link to anyone if they were actually interested in the stats and such.\nFirstly, and I think importantly:\n\nHecarim. a Knight and Phantom, I designed this sortof to replace Mordekaiser. I love Mordekaiser to death, but I think the champion itself in TFT needs a change. Compared to other Knights, Morde simply offers a high costing ability. Hecarim will offer a low costing ability and consistent damage.\n\n\nActive: Rampage costing 0/50\nThis ability deals damage that isn't too high, and hits multiple targets around Hecarim. Every time Hecarim casts this ability, he reduces further costs of the ability for this round by 5. This may stack twice/thrice/four times.\n\nI don't want to give him Spirit of Dread, because that would make him a copy of Darius basically. I get that mordekaiser has phantom for early game, but I don't think he should be that weak.\n\n\nRiven, an Exiled Blademaster. She's designed to be a new 3 GP character, who uses her passive, Runic Blade, Broken Wings, and Wind Slash.\nActive: Broken Wings/Wind Slash, costing 0/50\n\n\nRiven slashes out, dealing spell damage to a nearby enemy (ranking riven grants her more damage and more enemies hit).\nAfter casting Broken Wings twice, her third attack will become Wind Slash (used once).\nUsing Wind Slash grants Riven (either bonus AD, or bonus damage on each attack) and deals damage to enemies in a cone. This damage is amplified against low health targets, in a very similar manner to Evelynn's Last Caress ability.\n\nI have a few other ideas, but I figured these were two of the good ones. I don't know if i'll receive hate for saying 'replace mordekaiser' but in my honest opinion, he is very weak compared to other Knights, and I know it partially might be because of him being a phantom. But I still think Hecarim would fit more for this than Morde would.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, whoever. :){{champion:92}} {{champion:120}}","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2019-07-03T00:07:35.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:92}}  3 cost Exile/Blademaster\n\nPassive (broken wings): every third attack hits all adjacent enemies.
