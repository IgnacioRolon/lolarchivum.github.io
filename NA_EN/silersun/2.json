I understand the difference between say Twitch and Karma's visual and audio. Twitch received an overall makeover with what he looks and sounds like. Karma received a voiceover change, but not a massive look change.\r\nSo my thought was, considering the change from Twitch's new to old model is huge, maybe people would enjoy a skin (maybe a cheap one, maybe not) that renewed and refreshed his original audio. Maybe tweak the visuals on it a bit as well, but maybe not.\r\n\r\nI just thought i'd throw this idea out in the open, and see what the community thinks.\r\nThanks for listening to my idea guys!\r\n\r\nAndrew","replies":[{"poster":"CoolSkeletons95","date":"2016-12-28T22:12:22.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot said no more traditional skins, but Id love to see this.","replies":[]}]}
