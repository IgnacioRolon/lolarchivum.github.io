I obviously sucked this game and felt a bit on tilt, but then this happened and I just raged at myself, but then realized that I really wasn't able to see this ward. I am not sure if this is a bug for this game or what, but this obviously was a weird bug.\r\nIf this isn't a bug, can I get an explanation? Only thing I could think of before watching those videos was that the ward was on the edge of the bush. \r\nThank you!\r\nAlso, excuse my friend talking unreasonably.","replies":[]}
