The results are absurd-- in any game, like, half the champs will be A or S tier for the map, and in my experience, concentrated heavily on one team.\n\nGod forbid you do well on a champ you don't own though, any rewards earned through the loot system will not be eligible because you should've bought RP and bought the champ, you rancid free-loading piece of shit.\n\nDisregard that we called it the \"mastery\" system and not the \"own-the-champ\" system, but I digress.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brutalitops01","date":"2018-05-23T20:43:47.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not completely random, it's random from your available pool of champions.
