When I tried to go into a ranked game my client crashed and then patched. After the patch the client crashed again and now every time I try to open the client and press the \"Launch\" button I get a crashed client and then this message:\r\n\"The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000000005). Click OK to close the application\".\"\r\n\r\nI've scrolled through the message boards and did some Googling to find a fix to my problem. Everyone said it was probably an antivirus or firewall problem. I've given the League Client/Patcher/Admin Client permissions through the firewall, disabled my antivirus (also tried uninstalling it) set League into compatibility mode with Windows 7, clean uninstalled/reinstalled, refreshed my computer, and I'm still getting the same message. \r\n\r\nIf it helps: I have an HP Laptop, Windows 8, Norton Internet Security Antivirus, please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-19T03:15:34.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It almost sounds like something might actually be blocking League from running the way it's supposed to. There's a number of different things that could be causing it, like firewalls or antivirus so good job starting there. Let's make sure to cover all our bases though, so check out [**these steps **](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues) and let me know how that helps.","replies":[]}]}
