In fact, I'm pretty sure you can't have a 20 minute leaverbuster without having a 5 minute one first. A few months ago I was a lil baby and went on a bit of a rage quitting spree, I probably rage quit 4-5 games in about a month or 2, and I got a 5 min leaverbuster for that. Lying to the boards and yourself won't help you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SapotoKami","date":"2019-02-24T01:48:23.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point of the system is it doesn't matter if you drop dead, your team is still down a player and at a severe disadvantage.

You're not only expected to play the entire game, but also to take all reasonable precautions against disconnects.\n\nLosing power may have been outside your control (though not if you were, say, playing League during a massive thunderstorm), but the leaverbuster system has a lot of built-in leniency for such events. If you're on a 20-minute penalty, you must have left several games before this one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-02-23T19:55:21.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot can't tell for sure why you disconnect most of the time. Your electricity going out is indistinguishable to you just intentionally unplugging your computer from the internet. So the LPQ is sent out when leaves/disconnects are starting to become a problem. In your history I spot another game where you disconnected at level 4 so this would be your second disconnect within 10 games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Voldymort","date":"2019-02-23T19:54:13.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">dont u guys have something that can Detect Real Leave Buster and Connection Cut or Electricity Stop ?\n\nit's not like players can't unplug the pc's power cord or internet cable or anything...\n\n/s","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-02-23T20:14:48.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You have to disconnect at least twice within a period of 5 games to receive leaverbuster and 20 minutes is to frequent leavers ( like myself )\n\nSo you had to have disconnected recently for this to happen, but yeah I totally agree that if the client itself recognizes and even tells me that there was an issue connecting me to the game then I shouldn't be punished for something out of my control.\n\n: )","replies":[]}]}
