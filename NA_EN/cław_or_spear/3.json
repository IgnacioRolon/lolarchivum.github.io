I've gotten word from most that switching their region to something different and then changing it back to normal will force a patch and then they were able to log back in. Try out this method and let me know if that works!","replies":[{"poster":"Cław or Spear","date":"2017-05-26T22:17:55.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"R.I.P. I already did that I went to Oceania which made it force a patch. Then once that was done I switched back to North America tried to log on and still authenticating. What do you think I should do?
