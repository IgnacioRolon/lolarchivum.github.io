OBS related","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well its quit simple. I am trying to stream on twitch and I moved out for the first time, making sure I got a great internet for streaming. So now my connection issue is solved, I cant run OBS properly from what it seems. At first I couldn't get it to capture the client, but now that I finally did, it wont catch the in game part. I feel kinda stupid paying for more internet when I cant use it for the right purpose I got it for :l I try to use OBS Studio but either that will allow me to stream both clients would be great! I am not a pro player at all but just about that, I want to share my games and get feedback. If interested I can tell you more about me in game, just let me know! I need help &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-02T01:55:15.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not *super* familiar with OBS myself, as I've used Gameshow in the past, but I was able to find roughly how OBS works and it's pretty dang similar to what I had to do for my own streaming.\n\n- Open OBS\n- Right-click the Sources pane and select Add followed my Game Capture (name this whatever you want)\n- Open LoL and start a practice match\n- Start Game, select a champ and wait for the game to fully load\n- Tab back over to OBS and refresh the Application dropdown menu. You should see an entry similar to [League of Legends]: League of Legends (TM) Client. Select that one and hit OK.\n\nI also found this handy little video in case that doesn't seem to work or was confusing-> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKc3QgKVMfM","replies":[]}]}
