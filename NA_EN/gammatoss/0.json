If there are issues along your route to the server with your ISP or along the backbone network your ISP partners with, it's unlikely you'll see a message up about that. \n\nI'd like you to run a quick trace to our server using [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/). After booting up the app, simply plug in **185.40.65.1** into the hostname/focus area, then start the trace. After it's run for 5 minutes or longer, export the results as text and paste them here. We can take an in-depth look at your route to the server this way.\n\nLet me know if you have any issues with this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kryptonitebe","date":"2016-10-12T21:48:37.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same for me and a friend.
