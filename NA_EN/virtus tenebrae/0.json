So the ranked season is giving bonus rewards if you get gold in both Solo/Duo and Flex queue. But what's never directly stated is whether Flex 3v3 will apply to this bonus, or if it's exclusively for Flex 5v5.\r\n\r\nPeople keep assuming it will since the game is still allowing ranked Flex 3v3 to be a thing. I have Gold V in Solo/Duo and Flex 3v3, but Silver III in Flex 5v5. Do I get these mysterious bonus rewards?","replies":[{"poster":"Virtus Tenebrae","date":"2017-09-07T21:39:17.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that's a little lame.
