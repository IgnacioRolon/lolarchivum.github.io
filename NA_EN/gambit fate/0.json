This doesn&#039;t cause the ult to cancel 100% of the time, but this is the best cause i could find as i tried it in the practice tool. \nI tried looking up the bug and havent seen anyone post / encounter it yet so i thought i&#039;d get the job done.\n\nThat&#039;s all i got to say thanks in advance! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\n( I have replays of it happening but im not sure how to post them on here if anyone could help me out)","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2017-04-23T12:30:57.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q: why would you flash into R? its not a big problem if it no matters amigo","replies":[{"poster":"Gambit Fate","date":"2017-04-23T14:23:24.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stated that im not 100% sure about what the cause could be but it seemed to happen after i flash into r and you might want to flash r in some scenarios, for example flash over a wall to get away and use your ult to create more distance :/..","replies":[]}]}]}
