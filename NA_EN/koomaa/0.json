I've also witnessed hundreds of related posts and I hope I'm not exaggerating (but admittedly across the years not at all at once). I personally even complained about it in those surveys that they periodically ask the players to partake but apparently people that think that way are part of a negligible minority cuz it's been this way since the beginning and they refuse to acknowledge this issue. If memory serves me right they only addressed it once officially and said it was no issue at all cuz normals have different MMR and that's been their stance on it ever since. Go figure. Just go play some other game, they don't care about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Koomaa","date":"2019-12-27T09:22:06.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's honestly depressing.","replies":[{"poster":"Ashe mage AD","date":"2019-12-27T11:49:41.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stopped caring a long time ago for a multitude of other reasons then I thought I could enjoy the game again after some changes that I liked but it didn't last long cuz changes, always changes.
