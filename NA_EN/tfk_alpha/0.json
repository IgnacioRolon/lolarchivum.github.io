Not to mention, after the game you block all 4 of them cause they were in a premade gang-banging the shit out of me, only to get matched up against all 4 of them the very next game. You mute them cause you already know it's gonna be a fucking shit show, but you end up losing hard cause your top and supp feed 1/12 collectively, but it doesn't matter, because the post-game lobby is full of toxicity and shit talking fuckfaced assholes. How do people like that get away with shit like that, but when you defend yourself against them you're the one Riot punishes. Fuck you Riot, this isn't the first time this has happened to me and I know for a fact it won't be the last because you refuse to take a look at the actual situation and punish the people who actually deserve it.

Which, you won't get punished for unless you are constantly taunting with it.\nExample: \"I'm muting\" \"wonder if x is still talking. I muted them.\" \"So much more peaceful after muting\" etc.\n\nIf you retaliate, or argue; then you are simply worsening the situation.\n\nBlocking also doesn't prevent you from matching with someone. It is best to wait 5 minutes or so before re queuing if you want to avoid someone.","replies":[{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2020-01-08T10:53:57.960+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"what if the other person wants to avoid me aswell and thus also waits 5min...","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2020-01-08T15:45:18.405+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it is one person, I would be surprised at being put together again after 5 minutes.

It's an unpopular one, but the fact that LoL is free pretty much ensures toxicity. People get banned? New account, ruin more games.\n\nThere are plenty of people out their with like 20+ banned accounts, if the game was like $15-20, it'd still be cheap enough for people to play, but at the same time would reduce alot of the toxicity with people knowing \"oh f-ck, if I'm toxic I have to PAY to play this game again\".\n\nI make like $10 in 15 minutes, so even one game with an int feeder costs me more money than the account would.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-08T20:02:57.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Hi, welcome to the Rift!
