To be entirely honest I have no idea if it could or not other than overload on the servers..

I played one game this morning and it was fine, tried two this afternoon and had ping spikes of up to 700.  Basically couldn't play and just lost automatically, I couldn't even see what was happening.\n\nAre you also having ping issues?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-16T00:09:08.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The number of players currently in matches won't affect your personal ping. Your ping is a measure of how quickly the signals are going between your network and our servers so other players connections won't be influencing it.","replies":[]}]}
