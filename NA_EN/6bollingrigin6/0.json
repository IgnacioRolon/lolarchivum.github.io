You know my friend is a hacker and he can get to whom he wants an account. He chose me because he knew I was playing League of Legends and didn't want to create an account because he thought someone could come to him. And when he gets into my account, he does what he wants. He once asked me if I wanted Riot Points to hack them because he knows it. I didn't let him. He is a very toxic player and all the curses that are in the games are not mine but his. For all those mines, he and I can't. So please, Riot Games, cancel permaban. Sorry for my English. And when you cancel it, I promise you that nothing will ever happen again, and I may report that friend for hacking. I should have done it a long time ago.\n\nMy nickname: 6BollingRigin6\nMy region: North America\n\nThank you very much for your time.\nHave a nice day.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-06-07T15:25:57.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From the **Terms of Use** (emphasis mine):\n\n>When you create an account with us, we require you to select a unique username and password (collectively, your “Login Credentials”), which you’ll use each time you access the Game. ***You can’t share your account or Login Credentials with anyone.
