You want to know what your problem with your matches are? The moment someone like you enters with that asinine attitude, games always go south, and very rarely supersede the hate you seem so intent on bringing.\n\nIf you want better games, clean up your behavior. Otherwise, you're better off not playing the game.","replies":[{"poster":"SnakDatSmilesBak","date":"2017-05-27T00:34:41.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"....?\n\nI think his behavior is ok.

Anything that gets replaced with \"%%%\" on the boards is something Riot's got zero tolerance for, and it will get you a 14 day ban or permaban pretty quick. If you're using that language on the Rift, then yeah, you'll get punished for it.\n\n> it makes it impossible for people to play jg when the rest of the team is shit.

You can politely tell players to knock it off, or even say \"knock it the fuck off, guys\" and not get banned, provided you do not fill your entire logs with criticism towards them. If your behavior crosses the line into toxicity, you are punished. It's fairly simple.\n\nIt is updated, it is effective, and it seems to be working from how you chose to respond here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-05-26T17:16:39.040+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Homophobic slurs like that aren't ok in-game or on the boards. The community is largely against that short of behavior and it won't be tolerated. Everybody has bad games; even Faker, even you. If they are getting hostile about it a sure way to make it worse is to get toxic back at them. Instead, try leading by example and be a positive force in your match. If they don't want to take *constructive and respectful* feedback or direction, leave them alone and do what you can with the team you're given. If they are being jerks in chat, mute them and rely on pings.\n\nPlease be respectful on the boards, and don't use language like that slur.
