First, they added mmr modification for how experiences you are on a champ. That kind of tampering with matchmaking was bullshit. Second, it became nothing more than an endless stream of op champs with even less variety than ranked. At least in normal draft and ranked you can force a little more variety through bans. The second is more a problem with the player base not team builder though.","replies":[{"poster":"SirPhyllis","date":"2016-01-14T19:51:59.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't need variety when all i play is MF... there is so much variety to this game and unfortunately they just removed the only ensured way i can play my champ every game without playing bots.... and even then keyboard hounds are all over typing adc faster than anyone else....

The reality wss i often spent more time getring kicked from group to group trying to get a match where people woyld accept my strange pick than i did playin. That is why it became a problem for me and I stopped playing it. If it was originally advertised as a tryhard mode, I wouldn't have been so upset with it.
