I mean at least akali isn't Slark.  Slark  is cancer.  Love him, but always ban him if I am not him.  Kalista should have a maximum of stacks of 5 or so.  I mean, no one is proposing twitch have higher max stacks or Tristana.  Definitely feels bad when she can out damage smite with a basic ability.\n\nAlso, Zoe doesn't bother me, but I don't play mid.  I mean mid has Leblanc...  who is complaining about Zoe anymore?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ADCsRCrybabies","date":"2018-10-15T02:31:19.291+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Circlejerk thread, but yeah, I want this abomination out of the game. {{champion:122}} \n\nAt least you get a ban every game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kárma","date":"2018-10-15T00:25:17.902+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is so true.\nhis champions are nicely designed, playing his champions are fun but playing against them isnt. its either you play them too or you get rekt by them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMADEUSdotEXE","date":"2018-10-15T02:54:36.995+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"No. Why? \n\n{{champion:84}} Fun to play and unique\n{{champion:142}} Fun to play and unique playstyle (walls become more important)\n{{champion:429}} Design wise easily one of the most thematically interesting and has a distinct and fun playstlye.\n\nAre they fun to fight?

Like I ENJOY playing up against her because abusing her lack of mobility is so easy. I like a lot of the champions that guy makes, and so does the majority of the League community. All of the champs he's made have a huge following (minus kalista cus they just nerfed her too hard and everyone lost interest, but before that this applies). Yasuo is annoying, but he's really not that good of a champion, so I don't really care, same with Akali. I think it's less of you don't like the creator and more like you don't like bursty type champions. I would've loved to see you on the boards when Annie was actually played by more than one person (AnnieBot) or when Veigar's stun was point and click. He's not getting removed, he's created some of the game's most loved/hated champions. He brings emotion to this game. More than the people who created: Heim, Kog'Maw, Teemo, Master Yi, Gragas, etc can say. These champions are literally only played while in the meta because even if they're below average, no one wants to main them except an exceptional few. You nerf Yasuo, Yasuo mains keep playing Yasuo. You nerf Zoe, as you can see they still playin Zoe. You nerf Kog'Maw??? K bye Kog Maw, I don't enjoy playing weird dogs anyways. You're probably like ok but what about Kalista? Well that's kinda different because that was less of a nerf and more of a don't play this champion until we can think of a way to fix her. Like what they did to Evelyn a while back. And Kindred.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lunar Strain","date":"2018-10-14T21:05:11.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yay circlejerk","replies":[]}]}
