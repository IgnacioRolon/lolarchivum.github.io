This is my first trouble , to get the chest you must win the game ? isn't matter if i receive s+ with owned champ ?\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes i won some matches with an owned champion (i received S) and i didn t receive any chest (my number of  chests was like 3) .","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-02T22:28:34.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No winning required, just earning an S or higher for a champion you own.
