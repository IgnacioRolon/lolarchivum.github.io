A solid first step would be to see if another keyboard would fix this to rule out hardware possibilities.\n\nTry resetting your config as well, there could be corrupted settings not allowing input:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nDepending on your keyboard, review any third party programs you have in the way to make sure it's not impacting your in-game inputs.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MD22LOL","date":"2017-12-01T16:26:36.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It works , but for few games .. like 3-4 games , after the problem showed again ..","replies":[]}]}
