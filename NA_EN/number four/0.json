But in my case, it's different. In a single ranked game, I get to 500 pings twice and disconnected. That's not even the strange part. The first point is that while I was playing, I was listening to music through Twitch. Guess what? Twitch was completely fine, at source quality. No lag whatsoever. Normally, when I play while I listen to music on Twitch, my ping should be around 21 to 25, with another family member also playing league at the same time. But for a few minutes in that game, my ping raised up to about 130 to 150, while I was the only one at home. Thankfully, I did not die during those random disconnection sessions. However, my team did lose(But that's irrelevant since we were losing either way). What is so strange about this is the fact that someone else(A complete stranger) in my team also experienced the same disconnection problems the same time I did. I don't know if others have the same problems, but I would like to see if there's a logical explanation for what happened to me.","replies":[{"poster":"FooI","date":"2015-10-23T16:36:23.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have strange problem .. if I disconnect and try to reconnect game won't let me in any more as I get stuck in 0% loading screen \nNo matter how much I restart client or game or router or pc nothing change..
