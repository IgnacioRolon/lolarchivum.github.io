I proposed a [solution](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/VPJupcy1-league-is-just-who-can-be-a-meta-slave?comment=00070023), but it was buried so far down that I thought it warrented its own thread.\r\n\r\nMy solution (if you didn&#039;t bother to click the link or read the title) was to make a queue for SR that was specifically FOR playing Off-Meta, where people queue up just to try crazy stuff for crazy&#039;s sake.  It would allow people the opportunity to have a place where their teammates couldn&#039;t just be like, &quot;Hey, you can&#039;t play that!&quot; because everything goes, making the current meta meaningless; and the purpose would be to goof off and just have fun, whatever it is you want to try, and that alleviates the number one purpose being to win.  You&#039;re not there to win or be salty when you lose, you&#039;re there to do [purposely ridiculous stuff](https://youtu.be/BrP0H-n0x3Q) or have a place to try out your [crazy ideas](https://youtu.be/RqwfLPlx_cs) in a real match instead of against AI or in the practice map.\r\n\r\nAs an added thought, it could also be a queue where some other restrictions are alleviated.  Why not see if your custom-made one-for-all Jinx team can win against a full team of 5?  Maybe too far-fetched to make a queue that allowed that, but it was a thought.","replies":[{"poster":"Shuriman Curator","date":"2018-03-19T01:45:58.395+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP {{champion:86}} here I come!\n\nIn all seriousness though I'd play it","replies":[{"poster":"VØIÐ","date":"2018-03-19T15:22:09.920+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about AD {{champion:427}}?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2018-03-19T01:50:13.117+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then people will get there and play meta champions, honor system is never a good system.\n\nI woudl propose a randomizer.

The reason people play off meta and the reason why off meta has the potential to completely wreck some people is because off meta can specifically target things in the meta to specifically throw them off balance. Furthermore, people playing the meta are typically operating on meta \"calculations\" (even if they don't consciously do it) in order to predict play patterns from their opponents. When something off meta occurs, their focus and ability to predict goes out the window, because they won't be prepared for something they don't typically run into. Volibear support is one such off meta pick that can be devastating if undervalued or ignored. \nThat's not to say it's not without risks. Some off meta picks can be terrible, just as easily as some can be indomitable. It's a total risk-reward thing, but it does require the environment of the meta to be functional. If _everyone_ is off meta, off meta picks become less of a risk-reward thing and a lot more of an act of RNG and luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LightIsMyPath","date":"2018-03-19T13:21:55.354+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wouldn't have enough traffic to maintain a stable queue, but it seems really a fun suggestion for a game mode.

There doesn't HAVE to be a lot of traffic to maintain the queue.  Dominion and TT have been left to the wayside because they are completely different maps which require different tuning, items, and bug fixin'.  If we make this queue just for SR, no extra work really needs to go to maintaining the queue except to make sure there is enough server space.  They start with enough for a small queue, see if it does well, and resize to accommodate, but otherwise, it doesn't really require a heck of a lot to keep around.\n\nAs for keeping people from playing meta, I have two thoughts:\n - Preferably, you don't have to.  If you have one team pick meta and the other plays what they want, you have a chance to learn in real time if your off-meta nonsense would work in a real game.  It becomes a learning opportunity either way.\n - If the problem became truly rampant and people were just using it as a place to get an easy win over others who are literally just playing to have fun, win or lose, then maybe you introduce a reporting system that bans people temporarily from just that queue.  I don't think this would actually happen enough to be a problem, though.  The spirit of the queue is basically, \"I don't care if I win or lose even if the other team curb stomps us.  I'm here to see if AP Tank Yi can be fun.\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JustCallMeSPED","date":"2018-03-19T00:10:53.877+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm gonna quick respond to my own post right away because I had a thought.

That's the scenario I am trying to prevent.  The mindset of all the current Normal queues for the vast majority of players is that winning trumps all other parts of the game.  If you aren't winning, or your teammates are not performing in a way that would be most likely to give your team the win, then you are not having fun.  I'm saying we basically need the 4chan version of the Random board, a place where, as long as you aren't breaking the basic rules of the game (flaming, inting, AFKing, etc.), ANYTHING goes.  You don't go to the Random board and get mad because you saw something disturbing.  You go to the Random board HOPING to see something disturbing or at least willing to take the chance.  Same here.  You don't go to the \"Off-Meta Queue\" and get mad when you lose.  You go to the \"Off-Meta\" queue and then laugh with hysterics when your build as attack speed Singed gets you killed in a ridiculous manner.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2018-03-19T02:35:26.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about Smogon tiers?\n\nHave the OU/Ubers/Everything Goes meta be standard competitive, where anybody can play anything.\nHave UU/RU/NU be the \"Off-Meta\" Queue, where \"meta\" picks are auto banned.\n\nCreate more tiers and and/or move champions up and down tiers as the community sees fit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2018-03-19T21:38:13.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sounds like garbage if you are gonna do off meta shit you can do it in normals and perform well if your good the ops reason for losing so many times was his severe lack of personal skill to make them work","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhantomPrankster","date":"2018-03-19T13:35:18.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"that APi nonsense is a load of shit\n\nits the people who shit talk people that want to have fun in normals and gets away with it is the problem\n\nwebsites like lolking and NA.OP.GG have been around for a long ass time and the state of normal games has never been like it is now.","replies":[]}]}
