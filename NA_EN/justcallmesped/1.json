I have only been playing for two seasons, and even I have noticed the shift from &quot;Please tune down this one OP champ&quot; to &quot;Please make all ADCs not assassins&quot; or &quot;Please make tanks viable again.&quot;  It seems that even in the short two years, the game has gone from a more &quot;little by little tweaks&quot; approach to &quot;risk introducing ALL the balance issues as one and then never address them except by large sweeping changes, which further introduce ALL the balance issues.&quot;  It seems to have really gotten out of hand, and I feel this is in part because continuing to introduce new characters while leaving old ones out to dry for VGUs is making the dichotomy between useful and useless champs even more stark.  Therefore, I have a proposal:\n\nStop champion creation for 1 season to focus exclusively on balance changes and VGUs.\n\nDouble-down on communication with the players; make smaller, more manageable changes and give them time to settle before the next one; and stop introducing brand new characters who are just going to shake up the meta and need special tuning for 4 patches before they stop breaking the game.\n\nPeople have said it before, and I am feeling this way now as well.  LoL is falling, and it&#039;s picking up momentum the longer these huge issues go seemingly unaddressed while simultaneously seeming to introduce changes no one wanted.  Even the Lore team has been getting attacked recently for unwanted (why did Varus need to have his entire history completely retconned?) or half-baked changes (Karma&#039;s story non-ending).  There needs to be a complete re-evaluation of direction before this careens too far and too many players get fed up and find another MOBA.\n\nEdit: Literal hours after I wrote this, Reav3's new [Champion Roadmap](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/2018/04/champion-roadmap-april-2018/) says they're scaling up VGUs and scaling down new champs, so...step in the right direction?","replies":[]}
