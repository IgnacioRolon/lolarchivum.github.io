The rant by faker recently was amusing\n8) Your lead dev is a know troll from WOW, that no one respects nor likes, but you hired him anyway because you were too dumb to understand what that would result in\n9) You&#039;re incapable of making any other game, so once league is completely dead, your company will disappear too.\n10) Your prize pools for tournaments are unbelievably awful, your greed is astounding.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-06-10T00:30:06.680+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/sc0Gq7RM-this-shows-you-how-much-a-failure-riot-is-as-a-whole-this-my-friends-gets-you-banned\n\nAfter making this post where you attempt to throw dirt on Riot's banning system by intentionally leaving out game 1 and 2 of the chat log, you **still** continued to go on and play 9 games today.\n\nRiot was so much of a \"failure\" that you still came back to play 9 games in one day, over four hours of gameplay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Athina","date":"2018-06-10T00:23:05.017+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Citations needed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-10T01:26:20.660+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Proof?\n\nLeague does not appear to be losing players in any great numbers, Queue times are stable, for example.\n\nDont ride the circlejerk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shandrake","date":"2018-06-10T01:59:03.256+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Aw, sounds like somebody got banned and is pwetty angwy\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}
