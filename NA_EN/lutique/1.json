Ever game I get a swain, second he ults my jg and I have to backoff because he&#039;s just too damn strong. Anyone who defends his ult is literally just trolling, there&#039;s no logical or reasonable defense of why it&#039;s not super broken. Also why does his pull go through minions and have such a short cd? he&#039;s like a super thresh, completely absurd.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2018-04-24T04:14:46.195+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grievous wounds.","replies":[]},{"poster":" Elisheva","date":"2018-04-24T06:25:43.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"~waiting to see reply saying none of those things makes the ult weak~","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phieldworker","date":"2018-04-24T05:22:03.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obviously you never played against old swain. His ult was bonkers with healing himself. Not to mention it’s toggle and low CD. I think he’s fine in the state he is. You can counter and out play him. And learn to dodge skill shots.his e isn’t impossible to dodge. And it’s can get caught in minions if you position right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-24T04:22:29.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3165}}\n\nOr {{item:3033}} {{item:3123}} {{item:3076}} if you happen to be some sort of melee champ, but then you are screwed anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Caretaker Jack","date":"2018-04-24T04:47:53.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}\n{{summoner:14}} {{item:3123}} {{item:3076}}  ------------------>  {{item:3033}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3075}} ","replies":[]}]}
