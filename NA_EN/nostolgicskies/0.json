I also see the flip side that buying a 75 gold item complety  shut them down ( that sux for ppl that like those chaps).

Warwick is coming during or shortly after Preseason. Once his team goes dormat, they will get a new champion to do a VGU. Considering that Evelynn and Urgot are extremely high on their list, and given their vocal discussions about the two, one of them will likely be chosen after Warwick. Even then, once Galio is done in like March or April, that will open up the slot for the other one to get their VGU, meaning it is a very real possibility to get both Urgot and Evelynn next year.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-10-11T19:57:51.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because they couldn't find her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-10-11T01:22:43.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is being affected by stealth changes, even though she still is affected by pinks (other small changes might happen to stealth).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wulften","date":"2016-10-11T04:07:31.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} {{item:3632}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-10-11T02:49:48.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"She's not an actual assassin and if her gameplay is tied to assassin, she will never be healthy. \n\nShe's more of a diver/flanker type bruiser/fighter than an assassin.\n\nC'mon, Riot's stated this several times.","replies":[]}]}
