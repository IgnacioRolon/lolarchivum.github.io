Closing and opening the game(not the launcher), will \"reroll\" and give me 1 of these 3 again. So every game, if i don't start with the right ping, I have to keep restarting my game until I get the good ping. I don't know how many times I've missed the first few minutes of the game because of these, causing my team and sometimes myself to tilt and cause the loss. {{item:3070}} \r\n\r\nSometimes I also randomly just get disconnected with the \"Attempting to Reconnect....\" message, which again, requires me to restart my game or else it would just stay like that forever.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-15T16:09:08.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having a pretty unstable connection reaching the game servers, resulting in high spikes like that and ultimately disconnecting.
