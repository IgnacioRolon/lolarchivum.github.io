But the thing is I think that they were baiting me into saying the things I said, I am thirteen and I was told to drink bleach, go back to Minecraft, uninstall the game, they both hoped I get cancer, die, they said I suck at they game, ( i have only been playing around 2-3 weeks) . This being told to a thirteen-year-old is a lot and really offended me which made me say things back to them.  I hope you would appeal your ban on me it was the worst time I have ever had on this game and I don't think I deserve this ban.  Please give me another chance and I won't let you down.\nThanks,\nCaptainLLamaFace","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2016-10-23T04:25:17.628+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm 27.\nMinecraft is still pretty damn awesome.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joe Mana","date":"2016-10-23T02:48:39.507+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainLlamaFace","date":"2016-10-24T04:19:45.337+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I only got one punishment","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-10-26T00:16:58.457+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"It was a zero tolerance escalation for hate speech.","replies":[{"poster":"Constantiine","date":"2016-10-26T15:07:54.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"if you only played for 2 weeks make a new account.
