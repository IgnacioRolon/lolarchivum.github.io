This is not necessarily a bad thing. Perfect timing, sound analysis of a situation, quick reflexes, and being able to recognize opportunities are all part of what makes Shaco so rewarding to play. A large part of Shaco's skill-cap lies in a player's strategic knowledge rather than game mechanics. \n\nHow this relates to my original point is that other assassins don't have to make these kinds of decisions. They are more mechanics-based; they require a different kind of knowledge to play well. Shaco's general inability to escape from fights when his Q is down puts him at a disadvantage when compared to similar assassins. \n\nThere's also the problem of red trinkets and pink wards that the other assassins have no fear of.

WTF?\n\nFirst of all, Bloodrazor was only just released a few days ago. So you can't say with certainty that Bloodrazor is the best way to build him. Furthermore, while there may be optimal ITEMS for certain champions, the best players change their builds almost every game. On-hit Shaco will not be useful every single game, and you shouldn't constrain yourself to a single line of thinking just because a build is seen as \"optimal\". \n\nShaco's E has 210 base damage at max rank. His ult damage is 300/450/600 at each rank. Mind you, both these abilities do magic damage, and his E scales with bonus AD, not total AD. This means that if you're not building AD, that E isn't going to do shit. His clone base damage is high, but the explosion radius is shorter than his auto attack range, so the chance of it hitting is dependent upon the opponent's idiocy.\n\nShaco's Q has an 11 second cooldown at all ranks; compare this to the mobility skills of other assassins whose cooldowns get lower at every rank. They also have multiple dashes, whereas Shaco only has one. You also forget that Shaco doesn't take Flash because Ignite is too necessary on him. Securing early game pressure is so important to Shaco's success that he's FORCED to take Ignite instead of Flash. Without that Ignite to secure kills, Shaco cannot properly snowball.\n\nClone micromanagement is the only mechanically intensive part of his kit. Granted it does take a lot of mechanical skill to pull off perfectly, but in terms of understanding and executing Shaco's basic skill rotations, he is far simpler than most champions.\n\nShaco is an assassin at all stages of the game. Rumors of his loss of power in the late game are greatly exaggerated. A properly built Shaco can either instantly kill an enemy squishy, or maintain an unstoppable split push no matter what phase of the game it is.\n\nI rarely, if ever, build Shaco pure glass cannon. My usual build consists of Warrior > Hydra (Titanic or Ravenous depending on the game) > Shiv (if I'm doing well/they have a lot of squishies) > Maw/Steraks (if I'm behind/they have mostly bruisers) > Deadman's Plate (sometimes Randuins, depending on team comps) > Boots (usually Swiftness, Mercs or Tabi based on enemy team comp). Notice how my build is quite variable, and I'll sometimes build items that I haven't even mentioned, such as GA, Trinity Force, Spirit Visage, or Sunfire. I only build full glass cannon Shaco when I'm extremely fed, or the enemy team is trolling.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"THE RlVER KlNG","date":"2016-05-09T22:35:01.569+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed.

If a player makes a mistake, Shaco is there ready to gut them, if you just pick the wrong champion but are decent it doesn't really matter who you picked, Shaco has issues against almost every character in the game that you will see on a regular basis. Against other assassins his damage or mobility falls short, against tanks he just doesn't deal damage, against ADCs if they can get a few steps on him he's very hard pressed to keep going. Shaco is the reality check for most people who just want to play the flavor of the month with no real knowledge on how to do so, moreover Shaco must be played against in a different way than the norm, he makes players uncomfortable by changing the way the game is played and punishes them if they cannot adapt.\n\nShaco is an interesting assassin as he requires more than just a knowledge of combos and when to go in, you have to learn how the enemy players play the game and twist that far enough to make them unable to perform at a normal level giving your team an edge. Shaco also relies so heavily on the level 1-3 moments unlike most assassins who wait until level 6 to make any moves. Judging in those brief early game moments on where to gank, if you should invade, if the enemy jungler is looking for early ganks and where they will go so you can show up to tip the scale in your favor. It's a very different way of playing the game, and it makes it all that more interesting to play both with and around, maybe not enjoyable sometimes, but interesting none the less.\n\nShaco for me is the perfect assassin. In the game right now so many assassins focus on flashy plays, long combos, repositioning at every step of a fight, and then you have Shaco. Shaco is the embodiment of lethal efficiency, paired with confusion and deception to give you an upper hand as opposed to just walking into 5 people and walking out of a pile of bodies, it requires more... finesse I suppose is a good word for it. Sorry, I could go on about Shaco and his design points and such for hours, and already have a handful of times in the past, I'll leave my thoughts here and move on, good post OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beacon 0F Light","date":"2016-05-10T04:46:34.898+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just add\n\n* Infuriating to play against\n* Insanely feast or famine\n\nand yeah I suppose so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2016-05-10T11:41:40.247+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summarized: Stealth is a great mechanic for assassins. Why? Because it's a mechanic that allows you to get close without being a gap-closer. Stealth creates a mind game, but your opponent is still as fast as you. If you run towards the wrong direction, you're screwed. That makes stealth assassins less safe than for example zed, ekko, leblanc who can blink back a long distance after having done their job, being out of any danger without any possible counterplay other than instant perma-CC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iceborn Pippin","date":"2016-05-11T01:35:01.709+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say {{champion:91}} and {{champion:35}} are very good examples of healthy assassins at least in today's meta. \n\nI would say {{champion:238}} and {{champion:245}} are very good examples of unhealthy assassins at least in today's meta.\n\nYet between the unhealthy ones i mentioned I would say that {{champion:245}} is the least healthy of all assassins. Not his damage, an assassin with damage is fine. Its how much utility he packs that allows me to view him as unhealthy. As the more utility a character has, the stronger they are in the meta.

Yet it simply goes beyond utility for Ekko.\n\nYet what differentiates these two melee assassins {{champion:245}} and {{champion:35}}?\n\nShaco: A passive that increases the damage on his (E) and when attacking an enemy's back. A blink that also keeps hims stealthed for a few seconds on his (Q). A small construct that stealths and when an enemy gets to close it fears it and damages them for a few seconds on his (W). A point-and-click damaging slow on his (E). A ultimate that is both used for its damage and mindgame potential as it creates a controllable minion for the Shaco that can also attack and when slain can also damage enemies around in on death.\n\nEkko: A slow and movement speed boost on his passive. A skillshot that damages and slows on his (Q). A large AoE sized field that slows and stuns, shields him, passively provides him health shred; all of this on his (W). A dash that also applies extra damage and procs on-hit effects on his (E). An ultimate that allows Ekko to do a lengthy retreat, heal and damage any who are within the area he retreated to. \n\nAmount of CC on Shaco's kit: (1) slow.

Absolutely.\n\nBut if Riot ever deletes Ekko and brings back the feast or famine model that is necessary for all assassins, he's going to be one of the worst of them because of his stealth. An assassin should be a hyper mobile glass cannon, and the vast majority of them could function with zero utility. Rengar, Kha'zix, Evelynn, and Shaco used to absolutely piss everyone and their mother off. We've just forgotten because it's been so long. The only reason they aren't now is because other assassins have taken their place at the top of the meta. (Ekko, Zed, Fizz, LeBlanc, etc.)\n\nI think assassins as a whole should be a niche pick.

I think Kha'Zix is the \"perfect assassin\". Shaco IMHO feels like he completely lacks counterplay and can get away with anything, to the point most don't even get flash on him. When you fight him, you either die or he gets away and wastes your time. There is no scenario in which you win, unless he's a really garbage player. And with a slow and a point and click ranged nuke as well, flash built into his kit with extra stealth capability, uncounterable ganks... balanced? Not really. If he is not completely clueless, there is no way you can catch him or get away. Other assassins AT LEAST have no way to escape if they fail to one-shot. Kha'Zix for example is a much more high skillcap assassin; you better be on point with your positioning and all-ins, or you will just die. But he can be countered by any amount of decent teamwork (I.E. vision and grouping). \n\nShaco is on par with Zed and LeBlanc as far as one-shotting everyone with little to no risk involved, but he doesn't even have the problem of having the possibility of being starved for gold, cause he does not need to lane, and you can call yourself happy if HE does not invade YOU. Practically nothing you can do except hoping he's a bad player. And yes, he falls off late game. But he will still split push and never be punished for it.
