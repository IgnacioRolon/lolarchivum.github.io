In a section dedicated to feedback on the balance of the game, you're going to run into a majority of people complaining about X, Y and Zed (particularly Zed in some cases).\n\nNow, personally speaking, I would love it if people would learn to format their complaint and give it some thought. It would be even better if they'd also look through the boards and find a thread talking about the subject they want to discuss, so they can get into a discussion (unless it's too big or isn't quite the same subject they want to discuss).\n\nBut, really, I wouldn't change it other than that. There are times where I wish people could post less childish-sounding threads...but the point of this section is to talk about the game's balance and design, and a lot of that involves complaining about what needs work. It's nice to see the occasional, \"Thanks for this well-designed bit of the game\" thread, but it accomplishes much less than criticism.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UPfreely","date":"2015-03-11T18:16:07.758+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":17,"body":"try playing {{champion:45}}  against the popular mobile mids {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:7}}  with {{champion:76}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:254}} ganking you and then try telling us its not rage inducing that he got olafed when he wasnt even that good.","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-03-11T23:24:32.242+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UPfreely,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1vQ9o6KH,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-11T18:16:07.758+0000)\n>\n> try playing {{champion:45}}  against the popular mobile mids {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:7}}  with {{champion:76}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:254}} ganking you and then try telling us its not rage inducing that he got olafed when he wasnt even that good.\n\nSo what?

They also had the entirety of LoL, the original DotA, and every other MOBA before them to perfect their formula off of. Now, Dota 2 doesn't have perfect balance (no game with constant DLC will be) but what makes theres better since its initial launch is that they patch the game much, much more frequently on a smaller scale allowing for faster output of material that course corrects the game more frequently. That kind of design model could help LoL a lot, but its problems run deeper.\n\nLoL as a game is stuck in a state of transition. On one hand we have the old school content like Urgot, Mordekaiser, Urgot, Ryze, etc. and on the other hand we have all of the game's newer content, like Azir, Yasuo, Jinx, Kalista, etc. These champions really do not fit in the same balance universe because the design standards for everything from mobility to counterplay to number tuning has changed drastically since League's inception. Riot frequently updates their older content, but because there is so much of it and they have decided to stick to LoL instead of doing what DotA did and launching a sequel game that is fresh and new from the start, we are left with a game that is losing some of what gained its initial audience and hasn't yet ironed out what it should ultimately become. This is the Reason League can't have DotA 2 balance. If DotA hadn't launched DotA 2 as a whole new game, they would undoubtedly face similar issues with outdated mechanics and game style, not to mention the fact that it would have a ton of Technical issues much like LoL does because League runs on a comparatively old system.\n\nThings Dota 2 does that League should do better (and can do if Riot puts some effort into it): \n\n* The whole Melee vs Ranged dilemma (you hardly notice when someone is ranged or melee in DotA 2 except in certain lane setups). \n* The concept of role (In Dota, roles are much more flexible in general). \n* The frequency of patches and balance updates. \n* The maleability of the meta (DotA 2 has a lot of different ways to play the map, like Trilanes, Offlanes, Duo lanes, Roaming supports, Designated gankers, etc.).\n* All playable characters are unlocked from the get go.","replies":[{"poster":"Mogwailux","date":"2015-03-12T02:13:26.142+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So here is the easy fix....there are over 100 champs in this game.  Stop making new champions.  And balance the ones you have left.  There are more than enough to choose from.  If you can't find a champ to play out of the list this game has its time to find a new game.

There is no reason for that. \n\nNo, it hasn't.  It's actually just the opposite: the most skilled players have gotten skilled enough that even tiny differences become decisive.  High MMR is defined by everyone in it being very skilled (duh), which also means that they're very close to equally skilled.\n\nIf you ever see a game where there is a substantial difference in player skill, then you'll see that it doesn't matter what champions anyone is playing.  But of course you don't see that in pro games, because genuinely bad or even mediocre players don't get or keep spots on pro teams.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saint Jupiter","date":"2015-03-11T18:54:35.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are so many champions in this game, If you know how to play the champion then any one of them can be good.\nEven those who aren't played all that often. . .\n\n\n{{champion:6}}","replies":[{"poster":"BerserkInferno","date":"2015-03-11T23:19:03.580+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jupiter112,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1vQ9o6KH,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-03-11T18:54:35.304+0000)\n>\n> There are so many champions in this game, If you know how to play the champion then any one of them can be good.\n> Even those who aren't played all that often. . .\n> \n> \n> {{champion:6}}\n\nurgot wrecks face.","replies":[{"poster":"Knalxz","date":"2015-03-12T00:25:55.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ikr\n\n\nI played him as support and dominated with my Poke and the top with the same results.
