Yes I said create... Allow me to explain; I have been playing for sometime and I have been reading lore and backstories more often now more than ever. While doing so I wanted to look up something. **_What does Runeterra&#039;s geography  look like?_**  That is where I ran into trouble. I found plenty of art of locations and lots of general concepts but nothing that helped me to make what I wanted to build, Runeterra itself. _That&#039;s right I want to make a scale model of the World of League Of Legends._  The two most prominent pieces of art that gave me the idea of where things are are attached. However not a lot is solid proof or doesn&#039;t help me a whole lot (or maybe I just font understand what im looking at). I&#039;m asking anyone for help in references or thoughts that could help me build Runeterra as a physical creation.\r\nhttp://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/c/cd/MapofValoran.jpg\r\nhttps://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/1/1e/Mapa_Piltover.png/revision/latest?cb=20170115122840&amp;path-prefix=pl","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-11-21T18:43:23.725+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would discount the old 'blob' map entirely, if you can - as bModesty said, it's no longer canon/official.\n\nWe're working on releasing an updated map in the future (no date given because the cosmos hates me) but in the meantime, the Medarda Heirloom is the most informative element that you guys have at the moment.\n\nAlso useful, though is:\n\nFirst Light After Harrowing map (showing the Shadow/Blessed Isles, the Blue Flame Isles, and indications of other regions)\nhttps://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/special-event/first-light-after-harrowing\n\nAnd the Freljord event map\nhttp://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/9/94/Freljord_Map.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/2000?cb=20161020025101\n\nUnfortunately, there are still many gaps between these things, but those are the most informational elements right now.\n\n\nCan I ask what medium you intend to make your scale model in?  Are we talking papier-mâché?  Voxels?  Clay?  Macaroni?  Pixels?  I'm interested to know.","replies":[{"poster":"Goalieth","date":"2017-11-23T08:16:37.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I plan on using clay though the medium is still up in the air.
