Because I politely declined to trade my support role for toplane. \n\nThe *ONLY* thing I kept repeating was some variation of \"Ok, report me if you want, I've done nothing wrong, the chat logs are checked and I won't be punished\".\n\nThis bloody game brought me to the edge of tears, and I get slapped with a chat restriction and my honor locked and sent back to level 1?

I want those chat logs for that game to be posted publicly if Tantram still does that, and I want to see how in God's name I deserve a chat restriction. Idk if I can post the match history link here, but if the rules state that I can, I'm happy to provide them. I'm so *hurt* and *upset* and pretty freaking *furious* about this. If it's a false positive in the system or something, that's forgiveable I suppose. But I want this restriction gone, and my honour reinstated, this is simply *not right*.\n\nEdit: I have to stress.

This is not needed and has been so widely stated that continuous calling for reports is punishable as well. Did it make you feel better or play better calling for the report? No. Did it antagonize even more? Yes. Were you meaning it to? Kinda.\n\n2) there was quite a bit of name calling.\n\n3) the system probably caught the \"bitch\" part and that is likely another additional part.... although it was not directed towards them. The system does not really distinguish that so much but it is a small additional part.\n\n4) You kept talking to them. Mute them. If you mute them you can not see their chat and you can focus on playing the game. You can do this by pressing and holding tab, then at the top right of their little info rectangle there is places for muting pings and chat. Utilize it. Trust me, you feel much better when you simply leave it at \"im muting and reporting you.

But not muting them isn't punishable. And under any other circumstances I would have quietly muted them, but they were going out of my way to troll me, and were actively keeping me hostage in the game, and also bad-mouthing me in all chat to the other team. There is a lot of stuff they said (which you *can't* see in the chat log) that I *didn't* reply to. Most of it in fact. Like I previously said, I was just trying to quietly get through the game until it ended and I could be free of the situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2019-05-05T01:52:07.223+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 4 toxic spaniards, an afk adc, an enabling fizz, and a trolling soraka.\n\nName calling. Also you were calling people toxic etc. Not saying the spaniards part is name calling.... but you were calling people trolls and toxic and etc which is a form of name calling.\n\nYou CONTINUED talking to them. There is no need to do that. There is nothing constructive being said, there is not banter going back and forth, it is not enjoyable, so why do it? Mute them. Because yes.... CONTINUING for 10+ minutes will get you a chat restriction. Yes i know because that was the main reason I got my last one about a year ago.\n____\n\nAlso, as someone who presses no on surrender votes nearly absentmindedly over the years.... and while I have played in your server I did not flame or badmouth at all, i just simply said no.... and there was constantly all this \"hostage\" talk that just makes me cringe. Im not holding anyone hostage, I am just wanting to play the game. If 4 people want to surrender at 15, i will respect that decision, but i will still say no. If they still all want to surrender at 20, then feel free. However my vote will still be no. I dont know what it is with the EUW server always feeling like they are some victims in a hostage situation..... but seriously, it makes me not want to play over there when mutual respect is not given about the surrender votes even.

What I meant was being kept in an unpleasant situation. My apologies if that didn't quite translate.\n\nIdk, calling someone who is toxic, is toxic? It's just calling a spade a spade no?

You are using it in a form of slandering/degrading. Thus, you are trying to insult them by calling them toxic. Also, there was a few other things like saying \"any idiot can say that\" then the chat itself was a bit passive aggressive as well after the line i pointed out.

However they were all put together. I will admit this is for sure the lower end of what would result in a chat restriction, but I do feel it is justifiable that you got one.

Because what? Because I politely declined to trade my support role for toplane. \n> \n> The *ONLY* thing I kept repeating was some variation of \"Ok, report me if you want, I've done nothing wrong, the chat logs are checked and I won't be punished\".\n> \n> This bloody game brought me to the edge of tears, and I get slapped with a chat restriction and my honor locked and sent back to level 1? What on EARTH for? How utterly, absolutely, categorically ridiculous. I want those chat logs for that game to be posted publicly if Tantram still does that, and I want to see how in God's name I deserve a chat restriction. Idk if I can post the match history link here, but if the rules state that I can, I'm happy to provide them. I'm so *hurt* and *upset* and pretty freaking *furious* about this. If it's a false positive in the system or something, that's forgiveable I suppose. But I want this restriction gone, and my honour reinstated, this is simply *not right*.\n> \n> Edit: I have to stress. All I did was try to play quietly and ask them to please stop flaming me. There is no reason for a chat restriction.\n> \n> Second Edit: Didn't realise I had to log out and back in again to see my logs. Here they are: \n> Game 1\n> Pre-Game\n> Kumungu Queen: apologies but no.\n> Kumungu Queen: ok\n> Kumungu Queen: still no\n> Kumungu Queen: also am reporting you.\n> In-Game\n> Kumungu Queen: report soraka please. banned my champ when i didn't want to trade lanes, then instalocked soraka. cheers.\n> Kumungu Queen: as you like\n> Kumungu Queen: how am i trolling you. i clearly queued for support. any idiot can see that.\n> Kumungu Queen: im not inting..\n> Kumungu Queen: what does that even mean\n> Kumungu Queen: i can't make you do anything mate\n> Kumungu Queen: stop what\n> Kumungu Queen: you banned my champ idk how to play this one. not my fault nor is it my problem premades.\n> Kumungu Queen: and i understand spanish. so please keep talking. more for me to report.\n> Kumungu Queen: riot actually *read* the chat logs. you 4 should just quit it.\n> Kumungu Queen: and what will they find.\n> Kumungu Queen: 4 toxic spaniards, an afk adc, an enabling fizz, and a trolling soraka. please. go ahead and report me. i look forward to that\n> Kumungu Queen: backfiring in your face.\n> Kumungu Queen: you're going to troll my bitch mother?\n> Kumungu Queen: oh yes toxic spaniards is racist.\n> Kumungu Queen: stating your nationality\n> Kumungu Queen: which is what you call people from spain\n> Kumungu Queen: a spaniard...\n> Kumungu Queen: i'm simply playing.\n> Kumungu Queen: look in a mirror darling\n> Kumungu Queen: go for it..\n> Kumungu Queen: ok pls stop talking about it tho.\n> Kumungu Queen: just play the game.\n> Kumungu Queen: what is mindblowing about what i said.\n> Kumungu Queen: i really don't care if you report me or not fizz. i've done nothing wrong. so do it. just stop talking about it.\n> Post-Game\n> Kumungu Queen: if you don't mind. please report my team mates except rammus. all very very toxic. cool if not tris.\n> Kumungu Queen: premades. were really horrible to me.\n> Kumungu Queen: ty\n> Kumungu Queen: u2\n\ni LITERALLY just got muted and honors locked for the EXACT same thing. my mid banned my pick and trolled me all game - and i ended up being the one getting muted and my chat logs were just as tame as yours.\\\n\nAlso id advise not even replying to that KFCreyton guy, he sits on these boards and trolls people in shitty situations like this to make them even more mad. thats all he does.","replies":[]}]}
