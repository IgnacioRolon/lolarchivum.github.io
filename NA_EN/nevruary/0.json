My logs will be below. I was wondering what in them constituted a permanent ban? In my opinion, it was marginal trash talk in the  chat log #2 but the 1st chat log was me trying to keep my team from surrendering and trying to stop a Kai'Sa from intentional feeding by warning them about the ability to be permanently banned.  Game #2 happened a few days ago (i believe) and Game #1 happened this morning.  I am still mentally processing everything and hope someone can shed light on what exactly in Game #1 triggered the ban (other than the player report and whatever it is that they wrote)?  My team was literally ahead by a very great margin other than our bot lane whom i planned on helping very soon.  I do have a ticket in but I am going to let the internet assault me with the brutal honesty first before they will probably be able to get back to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nPre-Game\r\nNevruary: you can get me Sylas\r\nNevruary: I own all and dont care for counter\r\nIn-Game\r\nNevruary: fun\r\nNevruary: calm down\r\nNevruary: yall win bot lane at 6\r\nNevruary: 99% sure yall win at 6\r\nNevruary: relax\r\nNevruary: go bot\r\nNevruary: please\r\nNevruary: do not troll\r\nNevruary: i am ahead\r\nNevruary: really?\r\nNevruary: so you int my lane because you're upset?\r\nNevruary: i did nothing to you\r\nNevruary: kai sa\r\nNevruary: please\r\nNevruary: do not int my lane\r\nNevruary: int bot lane\r\nNevruary: wtv\r\nNevruary: wtf\r\nNevruary: why\r\nNevruary: are you inting me?\r\nNevruary: really?\r\nNevruary: kai sa\r\nNevruary: stop inting\r\nNevruary: you can get perma banned\r\nNevruary: mute her and play please\r\nNevruary: stop inting\r\nNevruary: play\r\nNevruary: everyone\r\nNevruary: sigh\r\nNevruary: this is unreal\r\nNevruary: we were winning too\r\nNevruary: like\r\nNevruary: this akali is actual trash\r\nNevruary: and you int for no reason\r\nNevruary: Kai sa\r\nNevruary: you're getting banned lol\r\nNevruary: why int\r\nNevruary: doesnt matter\r\nNevruary: she isnt inting\r\nNevruary: you are\r\nNevruary: you're getting banned\r\nNevruary: hey\r\nNevruary: not everyone is equally skilled\r\nNevruary: you cant fault her\r\nNevruary: if she passive\r\nNevruary: like i said\r\nNevruary: 1st\r\nNevruary: stop typing in caps\r\nNevruary: 2nd\r\nNevruary: stop inting\r\nNevruary: 3rd\r\nNevruary: we can win\r\nNevruary: mk\r\nNevruary: enjoy your ban\r\nNevruary: there wont be a next game for you\r\nNevruary: you are litearlly getting banned\r\nNevruary: riot bans now\r\nNevruary: for actual int\r\nNevruary: like\r\nNevruary: lol\r\nNevruary: it's one thing to have a bad teammate\r\nNevruary: inting is another\r\nNevruary: and is bannable\r\nNevruary: you will get banned\r\nNevruary: and it can be perma\r\nNevruary: you lose the account\r\nNevruary: and all the skins\r\nNevruary: why risk that shit?\r\nNevruary: and?\r\nNevruary: they can IP ban fam\r\nNevruary: this isnt a joke\r\nNevruary: you have no idea lol\r\nNevruary: lol\r\nNevruary: their team is trash]\r\nNevruary: and yall want to ff\r\nNevruary: so\r\nNevruary: when you can longer play league\r\nNevruary: then what?\r\nPost-Game\r\nNevruary: it's sad\r\nNevruary: yall prob wouldve lost\r\nNevruary: even if she just farmed under turret\r\nGame 2\r\nIn-Game\r\nNevruary: taht name./..\r\nNevruary: sec\r\nNevruary: i need to buy\r\nNevruary: clear the ward\r\nNevruary: red then bot\r\nNevruary: didnt know he had ult\r\nNevruary: lol\r\nNevruary: i tried\r\nNevruary: good luck\r\nNevruary: wow\r\nNevruary: it really isnt\r\nNevruary: what's inting\r\nNevruary: is me wasting time mid\r\nNevruary: when Fizz is trash\r\nNevruary: couldve had you or bot fed\r\nNevruary: im not coming mid\r\nNevruary: ever again\r\nNevruary: lol\r\nNevruary: thought he would flash\r\nNevruary: calm down\r\nNevruary: lol\r\nNevruary: no one moves on this team otehr than nami\r\nNevruary: give\r\nNevruary: ocean has 0 impact on teamfights\r\nNevruary: tad late for that\r\nNevruary: he doesnt like yall bot lane lol\r\nNevruary: RAMMUS INC MID\r\nNevruary: lol\r\nNevruary: no comment\r\nNevruary: lol\r\nNevruary: recall quick\r\nNevruary: sivir get red\r\nNevruary: all top\r\nNevruary: lol\r\nNevruary: ^\r\nNevruary: and kayle has arrived\r\nNevruary: lol\r\nNevruary: had no choice\r\nNevruary: rammus was coming\r\nNevruary: lol\r\nNevruary: fam\r\nNevruary: had\r\nNevruary: no\r\nNevruary: choice\r\nNevruary: someone was dying\r\nNevruary: what part\r\nNevruary: of rammus was going in\r\nNevruary: was not clear?\r\nNevruary: lol\r\nNevruary: lol\r\nNevruary: and do what?\r\nNevruary: game's been over really\r\nNevruary: THAT\r\nNevruary: right there\r\nNevruary: what just happened to fiora lifebar\r\nNevruary: is why we lose\r\nNevruary: vote yes\r\nNevruary: move on\r\nNevruary: and next time\r\nNevruary: dont queue mid if you have no idea what you're doing\r\nNevruary: yupp\r\nNevruary: hmm\r\nNevruary: my items arent enough for her lol\r\nNevruary: lol\r\nNevruary: lol fucking l\r\nNevruary: useless mid laner\r\nNevruary: on a great champ\r\nNevruary: sad af\r\nPost-Game\r\nNevruary: ping me all you want\r\nNevruary: Fizz was weakest link\r\nNevruary: legit\r\nNevruary: trash bag\r\n\r\nI understand the chances are slim on the ban getting reversed but I am going to try anyways.

Valid reports for in-game toxicity don't result in 10-game chat restrictions, 25-game chat restrictions, 14-day suspensions, or permanent bans. They result in **the next level of punishment**. Was your last punishment a 14-day suspension?

Game 2 is more of the same. When you got a 14-day ban, it specifically and clearly warned you that any negative behavior would result in a ban.
