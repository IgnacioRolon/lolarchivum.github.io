But to require 5 man pre-mades is ridiculous. It&#039;s hard enough for me to get a 5 man pre-made going, and I&#039;m sure others are in this boat as well. Some are worse off, and don&#039;t have that many friends on at one time. And the difficulty besides, you&#039;ve done a good job to make a challenging map, but do you honestly expect every player to have 5 friends on at a time-- all of whom are good enough to win with the challenges you impose?\n\nThis needs to be toned down. It&#039;s going to be a nightmare for me, impossible for a lot of others. Please don&#039;t require 5 man pre-mades, it&#039;s a bad idea.\n\nEdit/Retrospect:\nSo, I tried a few more times but ultimately wasn't able to get friends together for the pre-made missions. Furthermore, as I'd been dealing with a bout of depression, I was playing League just to focus on something else. I couldn't even get the solo missions done because, despite being paired up with diamonds for most of my tries, we kept failing. No one stayed together, everyone wiped just before the boss. It was too frustrating; and I wasn't ready to deal with more of said frustration and the associated pressure I place on myself to complete the missions - so I didn't, I stopped playing that game mode.\n\nSo, ultimately: I stand behind everything I have said. Too much was asked of most players. Honestly, I was excited for the star guardian event, even bought a couple of skins (I'll buy the Syndra skin next, when I can). But the missions kind of killed it for me.\n\nWith the way they have made me feel, I'd be okay if missions just went away forever. I'd rather feel energized for big events and releases, not pressured.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-09-07T19:20:38.290+0000","up_votes":98,"down_votes":4,"body":"What I don't understand is that in one blog they ackknowledged people don't like being rectriced by what mode they must play but they found 5-man premades okay.

That said, looks like the way they're displayed is throwing people off (You don't see the full flowchart), so that's something we'll talk about going forward\n\nThere's 6 missions total: 3 of them should require a premade (Get an S and the two team comps) and 3 don't (Beat base, Win as all 3 roles, Get an A). If one of those in the second set isn't unlocking as a solo, that's a bug: Please let me know and we'll try to sort it out as quickly as possible (There is some update lag we're seeing: Once you win the game, if your mission isn't updating, try leaving the EoG, then Close + Re-open mission tab)\n\nBoth \"Sets\" of missions give a total of 4 tokens. So as a solo player, completing every mission gets you one of your choice. \n\nThe 3 missions we chose required premades because for the team compositions, we wanted to avoid as much champ select tension as reasonably possible (\"Hey guys don't pick ADC. Oh, you did? I'm dodging\"). The S was because we didn't realistically think you could do it without being coordinated, and didn't want to set the expectation you should. \n\n2) re: Difficulty.\n\nUh... yeah :) You're right, these missions, particularly the premade ones, are hard. This is the first time we've experimented with missions like this (\"Do something hard\" vs \"Participate with these conditionals\"), so we are definitely curious how they'll go, and any feedback is appreciated. In this particular case, we wanted it to be additional goals to strive for once you have beaten the mode. The missions were made for those who really enjoy the mode and are interested in mastering it, and for them, we wanted some additional commemoration, but also just fun objectives/ \"Achievements\" to aim for.","replies":[{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2017-09-07T22:00:41.722+0000","up_votes":164,"down_votes":8,"body":"please tone down on the \"Que as X premades \" quest types.\n\nOther Moba's like both SMITe and HON do similar things and its super annoying for solo warriors like me who enjoy playing by themselves. \"b-but dont you wanna get out and make friends and blah bla-\" NO! not everyone is a social animal who enjoys hanging out and giggling with buddies. like 80% of the time I just want to play league quietly alone at a time of my choosing and leisure while chilling to some nice music or my favorite streamer. \n\nPlease do not try to force A-social people to be social. you are forcing a situation completely out of their control and it feels awful.

Not only this, but the people grinding it are super salty )and who could blame them?) because they have to sit there and explain how to do each stage with each new group and hope to god they get it right or are skilled enough to pass the requirements of the stage.\n\nRequiring people to be in a 5 pre made team is just a god awful idea. After 2 attempts with my 4 other friends who were excited about the new mode, they found it irritating and said it wasnt for them. I find a good grp of 4 randos, we grouped up and get two parts of one quest done (took us like 3 hours) and that was the best grp I got all day doing this.\n\nIts buggy as hell. Sometimes my character will get stuck in the summoning animation while starting the countdown, making me float around like janna but stuck in this awkward position that makes it hard to dodge the millions of vel koz casts. 1350 for each regular non legendary skin (extra if you want an icon) and somehow, we just cant get the game in the type of quality you'd expect for the money being asked. I dont mind supporting, but cmon, this mode was in PBE, NO ONE caught this? I know for a fact ppl were complaining in PBE that this stuff was way too hard, but I am sure along with those complaints there were bug reports too.\n\nThe game mode is asking waaayyyyyyy too much of some people. I can go an entire mode not getting hit by one vel koz laser, but my team of 4 randos or 4 friends might get hit by like 5-6 and thats enough to wipe us.\n\nThe game is far too limited, some items are not in the mode (fine I get that), but then gold is very limited too (why?), you can only play SG characters (I also get this), and for some reason since almost all of the SG toons are squishies, each mode is littered with tanks and assassins who...if you were to get caught out with in a normal match on an adc/support/mage, you would be punished by death. And oh ya, they are buffed and you are debuffed in stats. WHY? And by the way, each restriction isn't so bad, but you tie all of these limitations together and its just... frustratingly not fun.\n\nAll of this cancer, for one simple ward skin that looks like a glorified baby rattle.\n\nIts just not worth it. I managed to luck out and almost finish 2 of the quests out of the 3 left after the intro one. But, ya, I think I'm good. I hate grinds, this is why I dont play chinese mmo's and why I don't play WoW. Overly excessive grinds in any game are not okay for a good majority of people, I am not alone in that opinion.\n\nThis mode could have been really fun and had creative quests. Instead it is almost as if rito wanted to try and be dark souls hard thinking people would somehow enjoy this in a moba. I dont get it. \n\nFunny thing is, even patching a quick fix and toning it down wont even fix it at this point. Almost every group I got in to tonight had at least 1 person saying that the mode just wasn't fun. Most of these people had only played once or twice and most people seem to be really turned off from it at this point and it's only been out a day.
