I have lost about 13 Lp total and i could've been in promos if it hadn't have happened. Is there someway to implement something that where if your client crashed you don't lose the lp?","replies":[{"poster":"Slimm Shaney","date":"2016-08-13T03:08:22.587+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it needs to save your instance and allow you to rejoin. it's happened twice today, now i'm on a 30 min delay to requeue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-13T15:06:31.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you crash during champion select, do you receive any error messages like a bug splat?
