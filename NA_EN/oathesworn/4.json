NOPE. Oh you flashed? TOO BAD. Oh you used a dash? SORRY. You can&#039;t run from me when I have this up.\r\n\r\nHonestly, why should an assassin that can turn invisible for 8 seconds have such an easy kit to deal damage? Just Q R _auto_ E and delete everyone and there is no chance they can dodge this because Q is a click on, R is also a click on, E deals damage around her so after she Rs, she&#039;s right on top of you. Maybe they flash after she Rs? Good luck, she has another one. You used a dash ability? She has another one. You have another dash ability? Nope, still one more.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s pretty annoying when you are Zed and have used all of your shadows **and** your flash and she can STILL get right up in your face. Akali got Hextech Gunblade and healed all the poke I did with my full combo in one wave. A literal joke this champion. I know this is going to get down-voted but this is my honest opinion. League is a &quot;smash or get smashed&quot; game and rarely if not ever are you going to have a balanced game where the deciding outcome is skill.\r\n\r\nI can already tell those Akali mains are going to argue in the comments on how Akali is difficult to play or how bad I am but to be honest? I&#039;d like to hear that. I actually want to know how this champion is balanced because I cannot think of a single reason. Assassins are supposed to go in, kill someone, back off, recharge, then re-engage and strike again but you have Akali who can literally nap in the middle of the fight after killing someone and for what. After she goes in and kills someone, she just presses W and waits for her team to cover  for her. What can the enemy do but try and guess where she is or retreat? If they stay, it&#039;s a 4 v 5 and Akali&#039;s spells are all on low CDs and so by the time the team is there, she&#039;s up and ready to go again.\r\n\r\nAkali is a burst-type champion and so I know that after she has used her spell rotations, she is vulnerable but that&#039;s where the W comes in. I don&#039;t think that her W should last 8 seconds, that&#039;s way to long. It has a long CD but it doesn&#039;t really matter if she plops that down and waits for her spells to come back up, re-engages and kills you. \r\n\r\nI talked to the Akali after the game was over and you know what her opinion on Akali was? &quot;A no skill, free win champion.&quot; Awesome. I was at least hoping for her to deny it a little bit but nope. Completely agrees.\r\n\r\nJust me venting but still, I think Akali is way to strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2018-04-29T23:53:59.476+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"she gets reworked soon.\nwhich scares me even more tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"Grutakiller666","date":"2018-04-30T00:04:50.219+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"InB4 built in true damage and %HP damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2018-04-30T00:34:21.148+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"well...\nsince almost 1 year riot loves 2 things.\n%max hp dmg.\nand stacks.\n\nand they start to consider more and more true dmg. so yea.\nif i play adc and akali is in the game, i usually wish for the game to end before she hits lv 6. \nso yea... akali rework... yaay...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2018-04-30T11:29:46.808+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Grutakiller666,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QrvXR9t4,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-04-30T00:04:50.219+0000)\n>\n> InB4 built in true damage and %HP damage.\n\nThat isn't the CertanlyT way.\n\nExpect a combination of Yasuo windwall and mobility combined with Zyra's plant zoning plus having thresh's hook all while having the sustain from a gunblade rush.
