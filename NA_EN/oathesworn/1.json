Getting auto-filled into a lane you didn&#039;t want/pick for obvious reasons such as inexperience already gives the enemy laner an undeniable advantage. I don&#039;t care what your reasons are Riot, I could and am willing to wait for as long as it takes just to get my chosen lane. \n\nI already know there will be &quot;those&quot; players that say dumb crap like &quot;learn the lane&quot; or &quot;get better&quot; but to me, that&#039;s just dumb advice from people with a superiority complex. Why would I play a lane I have no interest in, if the whole point of a game is to have fun? Why would I spend 30+ minutes of my time in a lane I&#039;d rather not play, and quite frankly my team wouldn&#039;t want me to play either? Occasionally you&#039;d get the willing switch but that&#039;s rare. Please remove.\n\nEDIT: When I say I'm willing to wait, I mean it. I could wait 10 minutes if it got me my lane. Auto-fill is seriously not cool.","replies":[]}
