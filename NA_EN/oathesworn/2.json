Instead of the animation moving towards the target, it plays over in the opposite direction. I&#039;ve been waiting for Riot to disable the gamemode already because it makes everything extremely confusing and annoying to play. Just a few games ago, there was a Warwick on the enemy team whose Q&#039;s launched him backwards--roughly 800 units--but the hitbox was still on the target. This literally made him invisible until the game caught up and made him nearly impossible to play against. Just imagine getting feared/ulted by an invisible unit all game, every fight with no counter-play other than to predict his movements or panic-flash. Actually ridiculous how long this bug has been going on.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2018-07-22T06:38:13.789+0000","up_votes":60,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm not on the teams, but I know there were a number of people investigating this on Thursday/Friday.
