I flagged Zed but unfortunately the enemy team picked him before me so I went to my second pick (Fizz) but he was banned. Third pick Yasuo? Banned. My only option was Katarina who I rarely play and am not good with but I knew this and so I asked my teammates if I could maybe switch because the only champion I had left was Katarina who I could not play. They weren&#039;t bothered and said it was ok. I specifically remember one of them saying &quot;You main Zed and so you should win because you know him better.&quot; I tried again for switch but this time none of them replied and so I had to lock Kat (the timer was at less than 10 seconds).\n\nI go into game, not knowing what I&#039;m doing and just as I thought, lost lane. Darius immediately starts flaming me, &quot;You can&#039;t even play Katarina, never play her again. Why&#039;d you even pick her.&quot; I was trying my best, I didn&#039;t recklessly engage, played safe, and didn&#039;t try to cs because he was zoning me but even after all that Zed was 6/0. It&#039;s a little after mid-game and my tower is gone. Sejuani (Jungler) finally decides to come but at this point, Zed is too strong. I was pretty sure he could 2 v 1 us and so I ask her &quot;Why come now? It&#039;s too late. I&#039;d rather you gank another lane where you can actually do something, mid is lost.&quot; Darius pipes up, &quot;Stop crying, you suck. What are you whining about.&quot; Sejuani then says in [All] to report me for flaming. Doesn't mention the Darius who was picking on me all game. I wasn't flaming, all I meant was that there was nothing she could do.\n\nI honestly don&#039;t understand people like this. Whenever this happens I **always** warn them that I can&#039;t play mid because (reason) and that if anyone is offering to switch I&#039;d take it. Sometimes someone does offer a switch but the times they don&#039;t they either encourage me or ignore me but it doesn&#039;t matter because end result is always the same. I get flamed and reported as trolling even after I told them I can&#039;t play the role.\n\nBecause I run into this problem so often, I tried to broaden my champion pool and who I can play decently. I&#039;ve bought Ahri, Veigar, Annie, Ryze, Brand, and even Galio for this purpose but unfortunately I&#039;m not good enough with them to go against Zed. I am utter garbage at all of them. I can sort of play Galio but whenever I play Zed against him I win and so I didn&#039;t pick him.\n\nI don&#039;t know what else to do, I bought more mid lane picks, warned my team of why I shouldn&#039;t play my role, asked for a switch, was denied this and ultimately flamed at and reported. I&#039;m starting to dislike League because most players are so toxic or so focused on themselves, they don&#039;t care about other&#039;s situation until it starts to affect them.","replies":[{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2018-03-26T06:55:41.179+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should really pick up some easier low mechanical champions that you can fall back on.

She's also pretty boring (my opinion, don't flame me Annie mains) compared to Zed and I typically don't play as well when I'm not having fun. It's like I can't focus and I constantly make simple mistakes. Never tried Malzahar but I have played against him many times. He is the most annoying champion in the game next to Lulu so I'm surprised he slipped my mind. I'll save up for him next.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2018-03-26T12:46:14.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might try playing someone you're more comfortable with mid.

You can't just group your understanding of Zyra to Zed's and expect it to be the same, it doesn't work like that. Can Zyra teleport to 3 different areas and still manage to kill a target? Do you honestly believe that just because you main someone, you cannot lose to that certain champion? That is half-baked logic and I sincerely hope you don't believe this. The only way a person can benefit from facing off against their main is being more aware of what they can and cannot do but it doesn't help much if you yourself cannot pull off your combos correctly or at the right time and place to take advantage of that.\n\nP.S. I don't think I could have climbed to Platinum with the majority of my wins being with Zed if I \"didn't know my main enough\" so make sure you check a player's stats before making assumptions. I think that a 61% winrate on a champion in 225 games is good enough to be considered decent and would likely point towards that person knowing their main don't you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-03-28T11:36:24.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HigherTier,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=MkBuwYIE,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-28T08:40:37.740+0000)\n>\n> The only way a person can benefit from facing off against their main is being more aware of what they can and cannot do but it doesn&#x27;t help much if you yourself cannot pull off your combos correctly or at the right time and place to take advantage of that.\n\n Doesn't this say that you don't have enough mastery on zed?\n\nIf you were that good on zed, you would have known when and how to trade with him and when you should just back off.

Meaning, even if there was a chance for me to kill him, because I can't efficiently position myself or my daggers and the fact that I am terrible with Katarina's combo and not fast enough, I would miss the opportunity. You also forgot where I said that I played safe all game, even at the cost of cs. I hugged tower, rushed Zhonyas, got boneskin as my rune, and didn't needlessly put myself in dangerous situations but as I stated, it wasn't enough. Once he got his ultimate he started giving me under tower and because my low cs, I got my Zhonyas at a much later time than normal.\n\nI've also specifically said above that I have bought simple champions but even with them can't beat Zed either from my lack of understanding or skill. I'm currently saving up for Diana because in my opinion, she is the most difficult matchup against Zed. I have not ever stated that I am a \"master at Zed,\" just said I consider myself decent or at least sufficient enough to reach Platinum with much of my success tied to him.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DrTeath","date":"2018-03-28T14:02:29.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Against a mid Zed?
