Since you mentioned that you're on Windows 10, I suggest disabling the *Windows Game Bar*, as it has been causing lots of FPS issues for some players. You can do so with the guide on [this site](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).\n\nLet me know if that helped.","replies":[{"poster":"midorii","date":"2016-10-27T22:07:25.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems to have fixed the issue.  \nUnfortunately I should have done one change at a time so I better know the exact root of the issue...however I feel it was the nVidia Optimus that was the root of the problem. Physically disabling the game bar through the registry may have improved performance slightly overall, but reverting to a much older video driver allowed Optimus to work properly and utilize the GPU when running the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"midorii","date":"2016-10-26T02:24:36.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought I had both the xbox app itself and the Game Bar disabled, however the latest Windows 10 Anniversary update may have re-enabled it somehow. I've ensured to disable these through the registry to make sure they are dead.  \n\nAnother issue with the latest update may specifically be due to my graphics card. Apparently the GeForce GT 500M in particular is having a hard time after this Anniversary update for Windows 10 as the card is known to crash often afterwards and the Optimus functionality is on the fritz.\n\nAs a result I've rollbacked my video card driver all the way to version 347.88 (most stable for this particular card) and hopefully nVidia Optimus will properly use the graphics card resources when running the game, as it should be and as it has been doing the past few years. nVidia themselves are having a lot of trouble with the update it seems, and they have been releasing multiple new driver updates out recently to try and fix everything.\n\nI'll report back with results.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akaterina","date":"2016-10-24T01:16:38.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you running windows 10?

Yes meaning there is a rollback option, however if you are connected to the intenet windows 10 will just redownload the update in the background and the next time you restart your computer, or if the power goes off and you need to start it again the update is back, There is no way I know of to actually turn off windows 10 updates.
