I have an idea as to why it may not be functioning but I'm not sure..\r\n\r\nFor a time, I used to have an overly sensitive mouse that had an unruly scroll wheel. It used to always zoom the camera in unintentionally. To fix this issue I added the line : [MouseSettings] RollerButtonSpeed = 0 to the config.ini file.\r\n\r\nSome time passed since then and now I have a better mouse with a normal scroll wheel and always wanted to revert it back. However when removing the added line or even deleting the config.ini file, my mouse scrolling never came back.\r\n\r\nI am running out of things to try to revert this. I know a while back, user settings became saved on the server side (a great change!) however I wonder if this is causing my \"[MouseSettings] RollerButtonSpeed = 0 \" line to ALWAYS be present in the config.ini file as it was present when that server side change happened.\r\n\r\nNormally this shouldn't be an issue, because settings changed in the client and saved are overwritten in the server side ini file, but RollerButtonSpeed does not have a configurable option in either client.\r\n\r\nCould this be the reason I cannot restore my mouse wheel functionality in game?\r\n\r\nPlease help me out! How can I fix this??","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-28T00:35:09.749+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I strongly do believe this was caused by some settings in your config file along with the settings going server-side. You should be able to resolve this by resetting your input file entirely.\n\nYou can do this by logging into the client, then going to your install locale, which should be located here:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends**\n\nDelete the folder called **CONFIG**, then hop into a custom game to see if your mouse wheel works. Let me know if this helped!","replies":[{"poster":"Procott","date":"2018-01-29T07:35:08.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bless you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"midorii","date":"2016-10-31T19:43:25.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you soo much!
