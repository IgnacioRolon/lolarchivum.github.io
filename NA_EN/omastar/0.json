Somehow, my email and password were changed without me even receiving emails notifying me of this (it is not possible they got into my email because I have a 2 Step Verification on it). It was a verified email with more than one account linked to it.\n\nFirstly, I emailed support@riotgames.com but Blitzcrankbot answered me in Spanish so I tweeted at @RiotSupport and they sent me a link for me to fill in with all the information. I filled it all with accurate data and even gave them more arguments proving that the account was, in fact, mine.\nIt's been more than 30 hours and no answer. My account is being abused by some Leona main who has played over 70 Ranked games in one week (I noticed my account was compromised a bit late since I've been busy). Neither the Spanish ticket or the English ticket got an answer/were closed. \n\nI demand explanation and I would like to fix this problem ASAP, I have more than proof that the account is mine.\nTicket NÂº: #24055300\nAccount compromised: http://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=Roukaysa\n\nThank you for reading,\nRoukaysa","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-06T22:51:36.058+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a fellow Leona main, I feel for you. Security breaches really suck when they cause other accounts to become compromised. =/\n\nGoing forward, I definitely recommend using a different password for every account you have. Regarding your ticket, the wait times are a bit higher than normal right now for replies on tickets. This is caused by the end of the season typically generating a lot more tickets than normal. We'll have an account specialist get back to you as soon as it's possible, we're not going to leave you behind!

I actually got to talk with the hacker and he gave me my account back. (As you can see)\nBut when I tried to login it said my account was \"permanently suspended\".
