He seems to have fallen off the face of the earth since like S4, If you even attempt to play him in queue, if your laning opponent even has the slightest of MR you do the smallest amount of damage. Even without MR he is so weak right now. With all these mage buffs it would be nice to not have him left out, because seeing the same counter matchups midlane is starting to get extremely repetitive. I feel like just by nerfing currently good champs and not even attempting to touch out-of-meta ones that could actually balance out games instead of having to nerf into the ground *cough* Lux *cough* it could prove to bring decent fights in-game. {{champion:115}}","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-03-25T18:51:37.148+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're looking into some low scope work on Ziggs as part of the smaller mage updates also coming mid year. That'll be focused on encouraging riskier play on his part (use of passive to get him closer to danger, more offensive use of W etc) rather than buffing his ability to just clear out minion waves safely from long range.","replies":[{"poster":"WarWork","date":"2016-03-25T20:19:33.800+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why? Global ult, long range poke weak disengage, no escape, no tankiness and you want to get him closer to danger? If you do this what will you do about other characters that can deal reliable damage and have more reliable ways to escape or protect themselves?","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2016-03-25T21:02:25.948+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"My guess would be that they don't want to go back to a Ziggs who can clear waves almost indefinitely, making certain team comps impossible to win with. Too much stalling is a bad thing.\n\nProvided he doesn't lose power in other parts of his kit, buffing the riskier parts won't make him weaker as you can choose to opt out of them. You don't *have* to take the risk. However, it will give Ziggs extra power in windows that the enemy can take advantage of (or not if Ziggs is good and takes note of the enemies cooldowns, positioning etc.).","replies":[{"poster":"WarWork","date":"2016-03-25T22:28:05.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot man, your post really calmed me down and informed me. I understand not wanting a lame game i'm just wondering how this will combo well into his already established kit rather than give him something gimmick or extremely feast famine (Skarner, Morde etc).\n\nI think he should've gott Vel'koz's place in that mage update.","replies":[{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2016-03-30T17:07:52.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not gimmicky, they could probably accomplish what they're going for by just shifting power to his passive.

The satisfaction of \"dunking\" a target with q after airborne was great. However it led me to believe that the possibilitys with the satchel could aspire to much more.\nYou may not want direct telling what to do but could I suggest making his spells interact with eachother.\n\nW>Q ; satchel interacts with q bounce, affecting where the q bomb goes , increases range, but hard to control and can dodge due to travel time, travel time may be reduced due to the acceleration or momentum thatsatchel provides.\n\nW>E spreads the minefields around ( not sure how to make this mechanic more interesting)\n\nAnd lastly the short fuse passive, could actually be timed, after he casts a spell as in like if a fuse is alight, he has that much time to pick a target and attack it. Instead of holding a bomb, that feels more like a long fuse.\n\nAnyway , hopefully that dunking will remain and maybe the w interaction may be considered. Ty for the time and I await my mages being reworked #Ibelieveinaswainrework\n\nP.s Dunkmaster ziggs skin to go with my arcanist and snow day and pool party ziggs plz.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2016-03-30T13:16:11.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry if I sound rude but like this it looks like only Xerath isn't seeing changes to help him dealwith the current meta.

His play pattern is just unhealthy to the game.  If he's ahead he just bullies his opponent relentlessly, and if he's behind he can always ult for CS or to help a lane out.  Due to this he just creates, he becomes uninteractive and makes a very unhealthy environment in just about every game he is in.  It's not just ziggs, there are many champions that are in similar situations","replies":[{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2016-03-30T17:09:54.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not uncommon for me to think \"This game should've ended 20 minutes ago\" when I lose as Ziggs.
