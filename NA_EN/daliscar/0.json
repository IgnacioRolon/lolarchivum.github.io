And what did I get?\r\n\r\n-Sherwood Forest Ashe - I NEVER PLAYED ASHE, I don't even know what her new kit is used like.\r\n\r\n-Assasin Master Yi - This one is legit-ish, I used him when I was LEVELING TO 30! Two years ago!\r\n\r\n-Steel Legion Garen - I \"Fail picked\" 1 time Garen, and that's why I'm getting an epic skin on him, Thanks!\r\n\r\n-Order of the bananna Soraka - Same as Ashe mostly. And Soraka?\r\n\r\n-Uncle Ryze - Yep, that's okay and is understandable, since my second main is Ryze, I must have like 10 or so games on him. Thanks!\r\n\r\n-Jack of Hearts Twisted Fate- I have not played TF more than once or twice. If ever.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-19T15:51:48.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer to main a small pool of champions and I already have most of the skins for them, so I won't really find discounts for it.  At the same time, the options I did get gave me some incentive to expand my pool a bit and with some style.  \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/q6cLSFQ.png\n\nThose skins are bundled with champions if you don't have them, and at a solid discount.  If you don't want to grab those it's totally cool, but the opportunity is there for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Avelden","date":"2017-05-19T23:12:19.509+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if this is your department or something, but with every one of these events I have had \"Deep Terror Thresh\" come up on my sale. I love Thresh, but I hate that skin (it's literally the only one I don't own). Could we have repeats filtered out in the future? Plus, like the op, my picks this time around were pretty disappointing in terms of what I play to what came up.\n\nOn another note, I had a skin actually become more expensive.

Also, you're saying that this might have happened cause of me having unlocked the available content or a part of it, if so, then that is not the case since I do not own any of Viktor's skins. Welp I guess it's only my absolute garbage luck. Never again will I expect anything anymore in league for I've been disappointed every time unfortunately. Your customer support is 10/10 though Riot, you are nice guys.
