Seems theyre promoting bad manners. Yet also, when in game and someone is clearly trying to tilt anyone they can by playing as poorly as possible, you get another low priority queue for 5 games. And I didnt even get an afk warning. The new \"honor\" system is bs. Especially when players honor those who bm instead of those who are actually there to have a good game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-13T21:43:18.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's understandable that you wouldn't want to play in that match where the other players were being obnoxious, but leaving that match still made the others get dropped out of the lobby as well which is why you ended up with a leaverbuster. The best thing to do in cases like that is to mute them and report them in the post game lobby.","replies":[]}]}
