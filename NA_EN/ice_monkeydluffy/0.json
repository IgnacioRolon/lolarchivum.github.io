WTF!!!!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys,\r\n\r\nLast night, I got a message that $200 of RP had been bough on my card. This was like 4am! I try to logon to my account to see what happened, and the client says \"you're account is being transferred. If you're having further issues, please reach out to player support .\" WHAT!???? On top of all that, I come to find that my card was indeed charged for $200!!\r\n\r\nSO, I submit a ticket and I'm yet to hear back. I changed my password as soon as I noticed what was going on, but I still can't login. I can't even login to the LOL site because my region isn't matching up. The problem is, I don't know which region I'm under now. I actually tried each one and none of them worked. BUT I'm sure I have the right user/pass because I reset them both!!!\r\n\r\nRIOT PLEASE HELP ME!!! Is anyone else experiencing this? I'm writing this from my smurf because I cant login to my actual account. Please refund me my money.... and if anyone else knows how to fix this while I wait, please let me know. I'm trying to have my bank account this as fraud at this point.\r\n\r\nMissing the ranked climb....","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-07T22:07:50.232+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds like a scary situation, but rest easy knowing that we can help with this.  Do you have a ticket number?  Due to the sensitive details of account information and security, we can't assist with this on the boards.  \n\nI'd be happy to look into this for you and check on your status, otherwise, I recommend hitting us up through an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416).  That form is preferred by our Account Recovery team, and doesn't require logging into your account through the ticket center.  We'll be able to assist with recovery and will get back to you as soon as we can.","replies":[{"poster":"ICE MonkeyDLuffy","date":"2017-02-07T22:56:09.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG YES! That would be amazing!!! Someone just responded to my ticket!!! #25427548\n\nThe biggest annoyance here is that even when I try to login now, it still says \"your account is being transferred.\" So, when I try to login to the website, while my user/pass are correct, my region is messed up, so I cant even login to see the status of my ticket! And I KNOW the user/pass are correct, because i did \"forgot user/forgot pass\" and updated my pass. I can only rely on email at this point. \n\nIt would be super helpful if you could check on my status. Since I already have a ticket open, is it helpful to open yet another through \"account recovery form?\" I believe my original ticket was submitted through a similar (though not the same) form.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-07T23:09:44.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like things are moving along!  Your specialist reached out to get some more details to verify ownership.  It's a super crucial step because our account recovery won't restore account access unless they are absolutely sure it's being returned to the owner.  Your specialist will review your case and assist with potential reparations, such as the transfer.  This isn't something I'm able to expedite or force, but hopefully knowing things are going smoothly will offer some relief.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ICE MonkeyDLuffy","date":"2017-02-07T21:34:06.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man, I've been playing league for 4 years now. I've never had an issue with someone hacking my account. \n\nI'm more surprised at how little contact/feedback I've gotten from Riot about my ticket. I love this game and I imagine I've spent enough on the title in that time (and played enough) to be considered heavily engaged/high-value user. I'm saddened that I may not be able to play on my account again but more so that I feel Riot has betrayed me. \n\nMaybe I'm just reacting too quickly because it happened so recently.....hope I hear from someone eventually.","replies":[{"poster":"Fox Taco","date":"2017-02-08T19:26:55.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"any word yet?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fox Taco","date":"2017-02-07T21:51:59.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is happening to me right now too.... except i' was still logged in on the website..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Undertoned","date":"2017-02-07T02:03:22.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"be really careful too, because if you didnt change your password, he will get into your tickets closing them out and submitting new ones saying he cant access the email account. i changed my password and he STILL messed with my tickets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Undertoned","date":"2017-02-07T02:02:06.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"dude this is literally happening to me RIGHT now except at 7am today. $200 and transfered to EUW. i got an email this morning saying my account is banned in GERMAN! i dont speak german!!!! this wouldnt be a problem if riot, the multi billion dollar company hired a couple indians to run phone lines for them.","replies":[]}]}
