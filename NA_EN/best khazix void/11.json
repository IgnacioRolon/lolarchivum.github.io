I think he could use a texture update and maybe some new animations/particles. He is just so iconic even if he is cartoony that's kind of his thing. He's a big monster that reminds of games of the past. I wouldn't want to see him changed and updated to be a sleek Aliens type monster. Leave him big and chunky but he could definitely use new particles and animations including spell, movement/attack that work better with his increasing size.","replies":[{"poster":"NoxiousIce","date":"2014-02-19T13:00:16.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fairly certain that Cho is based off of a [Carnafex](http://www.games-workshop.com/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m3700235a_99120106031_TyranidCarnifexBrood02_873x627.jpg) from Warhammer 40k, so I doubt they'd reduce his thickness.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Veraska","date":"2014-02-18T12:47:17.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he could use some love, especially with his Voice, it sounds really really dates, he kinda reminds me of something you would blow up in Duke Nukem","replies":[]}]}
