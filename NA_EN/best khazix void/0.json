As you've seen with his other skins, it can absolutely be done. \n\n> are there any specific color combinations off the top of your head that wouldn't destroy that immediate \"read\" on his champion, or is he just off the table for chromas indefinitely?\n\nTBH, I kind of want a ladybug Kha'Zix, but it doesn't really fit with who he is, haha.  I think Kha'Zix is a good candidate for a chroma. He's insect-like, which opens him up to a wide range of color palettes.  As mentioned above, as long as there's a strong differentiation, I don't think it'd prevent him from receiving a chroma.","replies":[{"poster":"Lady Septimus","date":"2015-09-15T20:32:29.637+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"omg lady bug khazik would be amazing!

I could also see Rammus being a lady bug or a potato bug actually lol it could be a pretty fun spring theme","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-15T20:35:28.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"O___O Yes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Best KhaZix Void","date":"2015-09-15T20:31:01.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=Rw241mWL,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-15T20:24:53.071+0000)\n>\n> Hiya! \n> \n> As long as there is a clear difference between the regular color and evolved ult, changing the colors isn't a big deal in terms of clarity.
