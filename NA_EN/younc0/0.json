I waited 5 minutes and did not reconnect. After that I tried to leave the game and re-enter but I could not. My client was like as if the game had never happened. I had not lost LP nor was there any game in match history, I could even start another ranked. This problem happened twice and I wanted to know what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T21:41:49.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaa it sounds like you ran into a game that crashed entirely on the server. When that happens, everyone else is disconnected as well and nobody gets any kind of penalties for it.","replies":[{"poster":"YounC0","date":"2017-08-11T23:05:26.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty","replies":[]}]}]}
