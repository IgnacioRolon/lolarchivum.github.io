Caitlyn has only been able to be relevant due to her range and the fact that her W is so good to play around. Aside from that most Auto attack reliant champs have been nerfed or fallen to the way side due to buffs in items that benefit caster type ADC's for what seems to be a majority of the ADC changes this season. You slightly reduced the cost of Cutlass but Botrk is still  a very weak first item compared to Essecne reaver or Yomous.

The interaction between {{item:3087}}  and {{item:3094}}  was a very specific issue that was handled. Have you missed the several patches that Lucian was way too relevant due to {{item:3508}} , {{item:3142}}  and {{item:3071}}  being such efficient items, in both build path and completion. To this day these items and build paths keep said champions powerful. Currently all the best ADC's right now are have damage and relevance mostly due to the efficiency of these items. {{champion:202}} , {{champion:15}}  and {{champion:22}}  all heavily prioiritize Essence/Yomous. They give them a lot of power early game.\n\n {{champion:67}}  has a naturally \"weak\" early game whenever the ADC's who are strong in the meta are basically given tons of raw stats/damage, which is exactly what these items do. Is {{champion:222}} , {{champion:51}} , {{champion:18}} , or {{champion:429}}  an issue ever early game right now? No reason being they dont hit big points of power until 2-3 items and even when they are hitting these items they are matched and or outclassed by the ADC's mentioned before, who either move on to crit items or more Armor pen. {{champion:96}}  is literately the only Auto attack focused ADC (I dont not consider Ashe a true Auto attack reliant ADC due to Her Q,W, R spells which are powerful spells that are frequently used) whose item path matches or exceeds the damage output of these carries. \n\nSuch that it reaches a point where they are truly relevant and comparable in terms of damage and influence. {{item:3124}} +{{item:3085}}  is pretty damn deadly and with his attack speed steroid he's a monster  in this regard. Even so considering Kog maw, the items needed to build into his core two arent nearly as efficient or effective in lane versus say an Ashe or Jhin you can build {{item:1038}} , {{item:3134}} , {{item:3133}} ; and get CDR and Armor Pen, both of which are highly potent and relevant in the laning phase. Essence Reaver even gives crit, so theres quite literately just a few overtuned items for caster/hybrid ADC's that dont exist for heavily auto attack reliant ADC's. Attack speed isnt as valuable early on as CDR/Armor pen+ tons of Raw AD. Where are the component attack speed items that give Auto attack reliant ADC's 30+ AD?\n\nHow about considerable amounts of Life steal, Raw AD AND attack speed. {{item:3144}}  and {{item:1043}} pale so much in comparison to the other components the really strong ADC's build now, not to mention Cutlass is still way too pricy for what it gives. {{item:1053}} is a much better buy because at least you get good life steal, SOME AD and have the option to buy a {{item:1042}}  for some attack speed. But does 15 AD, 10% life steal and 10-15% attack speed really stack up to 40 AD? How about 25 AD+ 10 Armor Pen in the cost of one item rather than two? Whats supplementing Auto attack reliant ADC's so they can actually fight back against some of these items that really give big spikes to these caster type ADC's? \n\nHonestly if there were a legitimate first item you could rush that was a good alternative to {{item:3153}}, a considerable decrease in price for some of the more auto attack focused components or better yet just straight nerfs to alot of the components currently present in {{item:3508}}  {{item:3142}} , the whole \"vayne looks weak currently\" would probably fade. HEr level 6 is a pretty big spike that allows her to outplay almost any ADC currently, with less oppressive statistical power in the form of REALLY stacked components being given to caster ADC's she would become a legitimate skill matchup/counter {{champion:15}} , to any ADC out there currently.

I'm only d4 on EUNE, that's about equivalent to p1 EUW, but I think I've spent enough time playing this game (probably above 5000 hours and above 2000 vayne games) and gathered enough knowledge about the game to have something interesting to bring to the table. I have an idea for a moderate buff to vayne that would also bring something cool to her gameplay:\nActivating R without Q available is very awkward on an otherwise very smooth champion, RQ is the standard way to engage fights as vayne.\n\n**Make R activation reset Q's cooldown.** This gets rid of the aforementioned situation, allows a new, interesting combo of QRQ double tumble, doesn't increase vayne's damage by much (doesn't at all in the QRQ combo because the first Q's auto isn't used) and at the same time increases vayne's slipperiness - something she's known for and something you could play with before you resort to giving her some raw power for fighting champions, as you yourself stated in your post.\n\nI assume the change to how Q crits is to prevent situations like base autoattack not critting but bonus damage critting, resulting in a weird small crit _and_ base autoattack critting but bonus damage not critting resulting in a bigger crit but still not the _full_ crit (which happened when both the base auto and Q bonus damage critted)? While personally I prefer smoother damage (more separate instances of crit RNG smooth out the results) I can see where you're coming from with this change.\n\nQ working on turrets would be a nice change, doesn't increase vayne's damage to turrets by much ans gets rid of another awkward situation - Q not going on cooldown despite autoattacking structures. We now live in an age of things like ashe Q, trist E and jhin's passive crit working on turrets, making vayne Q work on turrets is the least you can do to help her close the gap a little in this turret pushing power creep. Just be careful to not mess something up to the point where her Q will crit on turrets or something. Also I am curious about how the interaction with an inhibitor would be like - as far as I remember some (if not all) autoattack modifiers that work on turrets don't work on inhibitors/nexus. It would feel a bit inconsistent if vayne Q was going on cooldown after autoattacking a turret but not after autoattacking an inhibitor. A way to get around this would be to simply make Q go on cooldown when autoattacking an inhibitor but not apply the bonus damage.\nPotential for _kind of_ abuse with trinity force still exists and you should probably keep an eye out for thisif you implement that change - but then again vayne being rewarded with better turret pushing for building trinity force and getting closer at it to other ADCs which don't even need any specific items to have the turret pushing they have - seems fair to me.\n\nAnyway I am curious about what you'd have to say about my \"R resets Q\" idea. It was probably suggested before. Maybe it already is in your notebook of \"ideas for possible buffs and reworks of champion X\". I would like to know why it's a bad or good idea, why wasn't it implemented if it was brought up before, what's the chance of it being implemented in the future etc.\nIn any case it's nice to see that you are aware that vayne is \"on the weaker side\" and actively looking for a way to fix that instead of listening to the cries of low elo players stomped by smurfs.\nRegards, Firestorm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ExecutorDill","date":"2016-07-22T22:16:14.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4ecIqkus,comment-id=000e,timestamp=2016-07-22T17:52:08.851+0000)\n>\n> Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s in 6.15:\n> \n> * Tumble - Changed so that the basic attack and bonus damage can no longer crit separately. \n> \n> Previously each used a different calculation, now both use the same one.
