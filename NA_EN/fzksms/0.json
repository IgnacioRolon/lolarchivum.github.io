But it wasn't always like that, I used to have 300+ fps in League and suddenly it started to lower, bit by bit.\r\nChanging video settings doesn't seem to impact the performance and i have no idea what is going on... How come just LoL runs badly?? The only program which could be causing issues is Owerwolf so i have tried uninstalling it to check it but nope.. nothing changed. I just hope you'll manage to find a sloution to my problems.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n\r\nMy rig:\r\nCPU: AMD FX8320 3.50GHz\r\nGPU: AMD Radeon R9 390 8GB GDDR5\r\nRAM: G.SKILL RipjawsX DDR3 1866MHZ 2x4GB\r\nMotherboard: Gigabyte GA-970A-DS3P\r\nHDD: WD Caviar Green 1000 GB\r\nSSD: Kingston SSD 120 GB\r\nPSU: Toughpower 850W Gold \r\nOS: Windows 10 Professional","replies":[{"poster":"Peanix","date":"2017-05-04T13:37:27.931+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xd I'm having the same problem but what's weird is that while i was playing on my old laptop on 30-60 fps i could manage, and now that i changed to a new Pc the lag is still here in the beginning 220 fps and now 90, like wtf fix your shit Rito no offence !?{{champion:24}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"theman1616161","date":"2017-05-02T18:44:43.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here man I think it is the client but riot keeps denying.

Let me know if it helps!\n\nThank you for the reply,\ni have gone through all the steps in your guide\n\n1. My video drivers are up to date\n2. I have tried changing the in-game settings and as I said, it had no impact on performance. same framerate on low and high settings... i really don't understand how and why...\n3. Tried resetting the graphics cards software - nothing\n4. I have repaired the game files and also did a fresh install but nothing\n5. Tried setting the windows settings for best performance - also had no impact\n6. Pc isn't overheating.\n7. Disabling sound also has no effect\n8. I cleaned the registry with cCleaner - also nothing\n9. I defragged the hdd and trimmed the ssd - still nothing\n10. Power settings are set to high performance\n\nNothing changed...\nI wouldn't have even posted this if I could've solved it with any of the guides out there.","replies":[]}]}]}
