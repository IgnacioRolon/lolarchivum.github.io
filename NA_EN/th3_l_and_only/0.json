Like execution for stealing a carrot.\n\nI think Life without Parole would be a more apt metaphor here. If you can't be trusted not to steal when the carrots are there then how can you be trusted not to steal when the carrots are removed? Same thing with chat basically, where how can you be trusted to behave properly without chat when you couldn't be trusted to do so with chat? Riot tried perma-mutes in the past and they didn't work since most people simply resorted to gameplay altering means of harassing other players when they couldn't do so in chat. From [Riot Tantram:](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/wsObUaFj-if-tyler1?comment=00010001000000000000) \n\n> It really breaks down into two categories.\n> \n> 1.) Helping players reform\n> 2.) Shielding others from the behavior, at a cost.\n> \n> We used to issue chat restrictions that essentially scaled indefinitely. \n> \n> We were able to determine that after a certain point the penalty no longer helped with reform. The 10-game and 25-game counts for chat restrictions are based on data that they were both light enough, and felt strict enough to encourage people to understand their behavior is unacceptable in game and change it.\n> \n> We also saw that the players in this &#x27;large restriction&#x27; category defaulted to gameplay altering means of harassing their team. It caused an increase in feeding and trolling.\n> \n> The sample size of this population and time frame is huge. Essentially the time spanning from the introduction of chat restrictions to the introduction of IFS.\n> \n> So my question for you is, would you rather have more feeders and less negative chat?\n\nIf someone isn't gonna behave properly despite being given multiple chances to do so then why shouldn't they be removed from the game? The line has to be drawn somewhere.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-08-24T00:39:59.453+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"how's it unjust? you flamed, got banned.\n\nSounds normal, hold your temper.\n\n\nand you got perma'd cause you most likely flame alot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RangerDanger5000","date":"2018-08-24T00:42:39.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually not sure if this is satirical or not - if it is, well played. Assuming this is serious though, the reason you were banned is because you likely have a record of flaming other players. No one, and I mean no one, get's banned because of one offense. Everyone get's upset sometimes, and RIot understands this, thus for you to receive a punishment of any kind you would have had to shown a history of this behavior. Additionally addressing the capability of players around you, understand that you are in the same MMR bracket as them, meaning they are approximately as good as you are. Everyone has off games, but those games only get worse when a teammate flames them. I understand being upset, I get upset too, but honestly just play a few games in which you don't type and you mute everyone. It allows you to focus on yourself and possibly even carry your \"noob\" teammates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Nocturne God","date":"2018-08-24T00:42:39.131+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You had a lead **but weren't good enough to end the game and win,** so you BMd a team mate and got banned.

Leave that to Riot. When another player does something like that Jhin did, report them after the game and/or submit a support ticket about their behavior. Don't flame them though, because it won't accomplish anything except to get you punished like it did here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2018-08-24T16:45:26.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat logs Chat logs Chat logs!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-08-24T12:08:11.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat logs plox.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2018-08-24T11:38:10.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to life.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Tiddy Fox GF","date":"2018-08-24T07:09:28.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TH3 l AND ONLY,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=HRpWoxbl,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-08-24T00:34:31.885+0000)\n>\n> i played a rank game in my main. went 11/3 and was in the verge of winning.

You thought that because it wasn't in-game you could behave however you wanted without fear of being punished. As you've found out you can't, as it's still poor behavior regardless of where it's done at. Assuming you're telling the truth about Jhin what he did was wrong sure, but that still doesn't give you the right to flame him over it.
