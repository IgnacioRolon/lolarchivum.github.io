Simply put, anyone within the area of effect of her Miasma spell can not use ANY movement abilities. This goes from everything to jumps like Ez and Lee Sin to Dashes akin to Fiora and Volibear and even things like Thresh&#039;s Lantern and the Summoner Spell Flash are all locked out. For a game that&#039;s been going through the growing problems of champions with insane mobility, having this introduced is going to be BIG.\r\n\r\nThat said, I&#039;m wanting to know from Riot themselves. Think we might be able to see this on more then just Cass? I&#039;m not saying give it to every champion around, specially since I don&#039;t want to see a sudden death of any champion who can jump around like a rabbit on meth, But a single champion isn&#039;t going to be enough when it comes down to this new effect, especially if Cassiopia&#039;s Miasma is in any way, shape, or form akin to her old spell in how it work. I would honestly love to see this kind of effect on a slow moving, limited mobility bruiser.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-03-26T22:55:55.600+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's certainly possible we'll see it on more than Cass in the future, though we'll likely want to see how this goes for awhile first.

It's something I think that needs to be tested and then moved in slowly into other kits. We don't want the sudden death of Movement based champions because some powerful champions suddenly got the ability to stop any and all movement effects from the enemy. It just got me excited, is all, when you I first heard about it because I tend to play the more immobile/tanky characters and it's never fun to see people never have to worry about fighting me because they can just blink away without any issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheJinxedOne","date":"2016-03-29T22:13:52.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a singed main..

Perhaps something akin to a Nocturne ult, where the entire map is modified; instead of becoming shrouded in fog of war, the surface becomes grounded and the enemy team is incapable of using movement abilities for a few seconds.
