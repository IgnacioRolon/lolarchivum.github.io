New skin line maybe? I think adding armour would either ultimately drag out a new skin entirely, or your end up with a partly armoured partly cloth design that, sadly, would probably get accused of sexualising her armour by making the armour more sparse. \n\nAgain, I totally get where you're coming from, but also think there's defnitely room to move past or overlook certain key aspects of a champion to get another take on them via a skin (Reaper Soraka for instance is sort of the exact antithesis of Soraka as a character but still works well)","replies":[{"poster":"Baval","date":"2014-12-06T10:11:49.157+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not if it looked similar to Death Stench armor.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Naughtilus","date":"2014-12-05T21:20:06.428+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Saw this one going around on Twitter yesterday and was impressed. \n> \n> However, one of my personal favorite things about Leona is her more heavy armor feel.
