AP champs have {{item:3089}} to grant them % bonus, {{item:3031}} does roughly the same thing for AD, yet only the current similar tank item requires you to have a certain summoner spell as a prerequisite.\n\nBesides, I thought the main idea behind giving junglers an item similar to {{item:3068}}  was to improve clear times, not improve their overall scaling. If Riot feels that tanks need such an item to improve late game scaling, it should be added separately from the jungle in order to benefit the entire tank class.\n\nI think Warmog&#039;s is a good fit for this effect. I rarely seen it built any more, and moving the health scaling here would, in my opinion, better align it to the \"ton of health\" theme. \n\nTL;DR: look at the title....\n\nSo, what does everyone think?\n\n___________________________________\n\n\nEdit: \n\nSo, of course we would have to tweak a lot of numbers to rebalance the items. Many stats would need to be shifted around. We would have to look at Warmogs current passive, and see if it could coexist with the added % bonus health. This part of the argument has to do with balancing this idea.\n\nHowever, I'm what I'm wanting to do is to give these items back a core identity. Cinderhulk for jungle clear and sustained damage in fight, Warmog's for mega-tanks. Currently, Cinderhulk's identity is being OP for everything a tank could possibly want. On the other hand, Warmog's identity has been somewhat lost in my opinion. Riot can make anything not OP by nerfing numbers, but I'm hoping to discuss whether these changes will give them a better role in the game.\n\nThank you all for your input!","replies":[{"poster":"LittleBlast","date":"2015-04-26T18:31:02.075+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":7,"body":"I think they should both have it, but as unique passives so they cant stack with eachother.","replies":[{"poster":"Tribbles Foxfolk","date":"2015-04-26T18:41:53.275+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LittleBlast,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cHqBMLcF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-04-26T18:31:02.075+0000)\n>\n> I think they should both have it, but as unique passives so they cant stack with eachother.\n\nI can get behind this.

An absolutely awful early game is what kept tank junglers out. What really lets them power through the early game is Cinderhulk's aura damage, which improves their clear speed. This is the primary reason tank junglers are now viable.\n\nObviously, if we remove the %HP, the flat HP on the item would have to be increased (or other stats added to it). This would technically make the item stronger in the early game than it is now. If you think % HP is needed to make jungle tanks relevant, when it only should affect late game when you have already built multiple health items, then I think that is a statement towards how tanks might be an underpowered role overall currently (unless they have the OP Cinderhulk). However, if they would still be able to build a different item with %HP after my suggested change, they will have lost very little of their current strength. Except their power will just not be entirely focused on one item.\n\nAnyways, I think we all know Cinderhulk is going to get nerfed soon.

Jungle bruisers have access to Warrior enchantment, one of the most cost efficient items in League of Legends, which gives them incredible early game burst that allows them to shit on your lanes 10 times harder than any tank jungler can. The only thing tank junglers have against the bruisers is Cinderhulk's jungle-exclusive %HP, which ensures that once late game comes around, tanks who build Cinderhulk will be much bulkier than Warrior junglers. If Warrior junglers want to be as bulky as Cinderhulkers, they have to either build Cinderhulk instead of Warrior (forfeiting their massive early game burst advantage) or sell Warrior for Cinderhulk late game (too expensive to do until 6 item full build). \n\nWithout Cinderhulk in its current state, bruisers can outburst tanks early game and then transition into a champion who does much more damage while only being slightly squishier. Same goes for if %HP is added to another item without being taken off Cinderhulk. The way Cinderhulk works forces bruisers to choose between damage-focused and tank-focused builds in a way they've never had to choose in League's history, and I'd prefer it stay that way unless we have a very, VERY good reason to let bruisers run the league again. \n\nTL;DR: Without Cinderhulk, bruisers burst you for 75% of your health while also being tanks, while tanks burst you for 40% and are only tanks. With cinderhulk, bruisers either burst you for 50% of your health and are also semi-tanks, or they burst you for 75% of your health while not being tanks, and tanks burst you for 40% of your health while being so bulky that they actually deserve the name \"tank\".","replies":[{"poster":"Zirzon","date":"2015-04-26T21:19:44.997+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"But isn't the whole idea of % bonus HP meant to benefit tanks more than bruisers?

Firstly, that it improves the early game clears of tank junglers without forcing them to build suboptimal damage items; secondly, and more importantly, it changes the definition of a tank from \"someone who builds 3 bulk items after their Warrior/Triforce start\" to \"someone who has Cinderhulk/boots/4 tank items\". \n\nEssentially, what Cinderhulk means is that if the Lee Sin/Vi/Jarvan/Wukong crowd want to be bruisers who do bruiser things, they can still do that by building Warrior, but they cannot be tanks because tanks are people who build Cinderhulk (thanks to the %HP). \n\nCinderhulk is so successful at reviving the idea of \"tanks\" in S4/S5's burst focus metas that aggressive top laners like Hecarim and Shyvana are GIVING UP SUMMONER SPELLS to be tanks instead of bruisers. Giving up flash is a substantial loss in safety, especially for those two who are balls deep, in your face fighters throughout the game. Cinderhulk is so good that it's causing bruisers, the class which has always been the \"have your cake and that of the assassins and tanks, and eat it too\" of League of Legends, to choose not to be bruisers so that they can be tanks.\n\nThat's the beauty of this item. If it's good enough that even top laners have decided that they want to be tanks (the black sheep of League of Legends), then it's having a positive impact on League that Riot hasn't hit in all its years are tinkering. Bruisers are finally the class they were always meant to be: they can be a tank if you need a tank, or a DPS if you need a DPS, but never both at the same time, and that's a GOOD THING. \n\nWe should be very, very careful about any change that risks throwing that away.

This is the part you junglers don't seem to understand.  Top lane isn't giving up ANYTHING, really.  Smite allows them to take a jungle camp and go to lane with an experience advantage, and then they rush buy the Skirmisher's Sabre, essentially guaranteeing they win every trade in their lane thereafter.  Smite allows them to get an early advantage, making their choice of Summoner Spells difficult to punish.  It allows them to do more damage, AS A TANK, because they reduce their opponent's damage by 20% and do bonus true damage to them in trades.  Finally, it allows them to build the only scaling tank item in the game.\n\nSimply put, the only scaling tank item in the game should not be dependent on choosing the right Summoner Spell, and taking the jungle Summoner should not help you win your lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2015-04-27T17:28:32.385+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> -Smite locked, for two reasons: any top laner who wants to abuse it must pay a very real price (1 summoner spell) to do so, and so that bruiser junglers can't go Warrior to snowball and use their gold advantage to get ahead on Cinderhulk as well-they have to choose one.\n\nIt actually can't be Smite-locked, and for the very reason you see right now; the item is impossible to balance. The item needed to be powerful enough to rock the jungle, but that power doubles as pure DPS for any laner as well, and there's where the problem lies. Sure, laner AD Casters can build Warrior, but it will never stack up to the effectiveness of other Brutalizer items for laners, and that's because there's a separate laner build path for the stats desired. In fact, the Immolation effect is also available (though with better damage potential through jungle item solely). The only truly unique effect that's far overkill is the %HP effect, which SHOULD be available to any laner, Smite or not. Closing lane diversity is the entire issue.\n\n\"Metagolem\" build has all but been removed since those old days, too. Mallet is absurdly clunky to build, Warmog's has been turned to fluff (partly because of limited tank stats... which OP is fighting for), Triforce can't slow, and Atma's was scrapped altogether. The fact we have no tank items available is not because it won't balance, it's because Riot dropped all the broken itemization resoundingly, and then decided not to compensate. What we're now getting is the effects of a starved item niche opening back up, which hardly means that Smite played any real part in it aside from being Riot's buildpath of choice.\n\nMy general point is: +%HP will not break laning in any way if it were a non-jungle item. It's still a lategame stat that is quite useful in multiple positions (not just jungle), but unlike the \"Metagolem\" Bruiser dependence, +%HP is exclusively usable by tanks, so it won't wear out from Bruiser usage. That's why it needs its own non-Smite buildpath. We should be working toward lane diversity, not away from it.\n\nAnother side-note: The DPS from Cinderhulk is meant to take the slow, drudging clear from tank junglers and give them near-Bruiser clear speed. However, if you take that clear speed and toss that same damage into lane, the effects are even greater because now tanks are hijacking the bruiser role. The real issue in the current meta is  that tanks are as irrelevant as ever in the jungle, and it takes a superpowered item to drag them back into contention. With overly powered monsters comes the price of needing longer consistency of DPS for clear speed, so if you add 50% to single-camp clear times while keeping the same travel distances as before, damage will be the name of the game moreso than ever. The free-DPS-effect from Machete & the upgrades works toward evening the field, but even that got nerfed to the point of uselessness by the time it hit live.\n\nCinderhulk is just a patch on a much bigger problem in the game, and it is throwing the balance completely out of whack. Tanks being relevant now doesn't cover that fact, and the price-raise in Cinderhulk is just the beginning of the balancing saga about to unfold, though it'll probably take all season to do, as usual.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-04-27T19:39:56.916+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They absolutely are not \"giving up\" a Summoner Spell to do it.

Please, pro players will hit the CS anyways and even most gold players will not need smite to help them last hit. \n\nSkirmisher's Sabre unenchanted is a waste of gold that gives no stats and costs 750 gold. With that 750 gold, the opposing Riven top is going back and buying two Long Swords to win every trade where you DON'T smite.

The Sunfire passive is there to help tanks with their clear speed near the transition from early to mid game. Without it, bruisers can build damage to clear faster than the tanks, granting them more gold which they can use to build more damage to clear even faster and instagib laners, granting them more gold which...you get the point.

AND THEN we factor in the bonus true damage Challenging Smite does to her, which is 27 true damage on each hit, approximately  (depending on how fast you attack, since the damage is static over three seconds).  Therefore, Challenging Smite adds MORE damage to each of your autoattacks AS A TANK than two Long Swords adds to Riven's autoattack.  Remember, we have not even accounted for the returned damage from abilities, and Challenging Smite is already doing more than two Long Swords.  Riven's ability damage isn't all that impressive early on, even landing all three Broken Wings for damage, because she depends on fitting in autoattacks.  Top lane tanks don't have much trouble matching that ability damage early on, Sion, for example, can easily match 300 damage with abilities, and his 69 attack damage plus the 27 true damage on hit is more than enough to win the trade.  After all, his shield does damage and lasts longer, and hers does no damage and is gone quickly, since to get damage on all three Broken Wings, she surely had to dash in.\n\nDo they risk either a lack of presence around the map by not taking teleport, or a lack of an escape in a gank if they don't take Flash?  Yes, but most of them give up Flash because winning your lane easily makes buying an extra ward or two no trouble at all.\n\nAdditionally, I fail to understand how requiring Smite prevents %bonus health from being bought by bruisers.  Bruisers do exist in the jungle.  They bought warrior because it was the most efficient item for them.  Jarvan still shows up in the jungle... but he buys Cinderhulk and still wants a couple of damage items.  He's still playing a bruiser.  It is easier for a bruiser to take Smite and then, because he has Smite, justify getting Cinderhulk than it is for them to justify spending gold on the much more expensive Warmog's.  Your argument that requiring Smite somehow magically makes it more tanky is ridiculous on its face, and doesn't even work out in practice.\n\nEDIT: Oh yeah, forgot to add that in the above example, there is also a chance that while Riven is level 4, the Sion hit level 5 because he started with an advantage in experience, allowing him to do even more damage.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LilxPaprika","date":"2015-04-26T19:17:49.650+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm surprised it took this long for this suggestion to be made.

It doesn't make them stronger since they would have to invest a lot of gold into an item that only gives them health and health Regen. Right now Cinderhulk gives them %HP AND sustained damage which deals more than Sunfire cape. I don't see why you can't break it up since the %HP isn't what makes junglers great, but the sustained damage to make them more safer to jungle. \n\nLast time Riot used %HP it was on Spirit of the Ancient Golem and was deemed to strong then and removed. I'm not sure why they think anything would change when its put on a cheap item. Back when Warmongs was useful it was almost 2900 gold which is 700 more than Cinder and was 900 more than SotAG when it was out. I really don't see why people defend Cinderhulk as Tank junglers savior when the reason they are strong now has already been deemed OP and removed by RIot (just to add it back) and people are just using the smites for the added bonus on top of the cheap jungle item for free %HP boost. \n\nIf Warmongs was to pick up the %HP boost it would be set for a late game item like %HP should be and where it actually starts being relevant. No top laner and nor jungler is going to build it first or even in their first 3, except {{champion:36}}. Its going to serve its same role and would be taken out of the early top lane. \n\nOverall regardless of what happens Cinderhulk needs to be nerfed or changed. Its too powerful especially with the smite buffs especially with champs in top sacrificing Flash and thats about the only champs we see being consistently productive in top.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-04-27T02:49:03.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because junglers are prohibited from buying Warmog's if they are a tank?","replies":[{"poster":"CubedJustice","date":"2015-04-27T03:03:20.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't be sarcastic unless you think it through all the way.
