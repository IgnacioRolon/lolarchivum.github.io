These games are not short and no one likes wasting their time which is exactly what it is when 'riot' gives a big thumbs up to these passive aggressive antagonistic clowns and punishes those who are trying to play competitively and actively participating to win. Its not like this is a rare occurrence this is repetitive scenario that happens in back to back to back to back games at times. The pandering of these immature provocative behaviors only entices them to continue ruining game after game and wasting peoples valuable time. For the comments stating ignoring them, report them and move on... move on to what? the next game facing the same issues with a different player? I have put a decent amount of money into this game for nice skins and champs but I am at the point where I could care less if I were to be banned because it is pointless to try and be competitive, it is difficult to play any champ at a role other than what mobafire says is its main without countless dodgers. Its a joke with the people wanting to benefit the game losing and the people who could care less with no investment money or timewise getting off scott free because they have no attachment to their accounts even if riot were to ban them. They create new and cycle just continues but maybe that's how riot likes it since a % of these people will inevitably reinvest in more skins and champions after being banned for lashing out at trolls and time wasters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SparklingLama","date":"2018-05-02T01:31:58.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Nice book you got there.
