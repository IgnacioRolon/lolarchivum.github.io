I am posting about the new client. The new client is to big for my monitor and when i try to drag it to the side to hit options the side goes away. Does  anyone else have this problem? also riot pls make the new client be able to fit any screen. I have never had any problems except this one. If i use the new client and i try to drag it to the side i cant login or talk to my friends or even accept invites because the side bar is gone.  So if anyone has a solution to this problem pls reply back.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-16T18:25:22.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should be able to rescale the client!  Try pressing Ctrl + Down Arrow while you have the client open.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"wizerdmanlenny","date":"2017-02-16T23:18:10.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"for some reason i cannot upgrade to the new client now. it keeps on saying to reinstall league but i have done that 3 times and have had no progress.

Try this manual workaround:\n\n- Navigate to your League of Legends installation folder. (Typically C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n- Scroll down until you find \"LeagueClient.exe\" and delete the file.\n- Open the client by using \"lol.launcher.admin.exe\"\n- Repair the client by selecting the “?” button in the top right-hand corner of the Patcher window (the first window that appears) and under the options menu, select Repair.\n\nLet me know if that works for you.","replies":[{"poster":"wizerdmanlenny","date":"2017-02-17T21:58:28.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IT WORKS!!!!!!!!! xD THANK YOU! i am now using the new client and using the practice tool!
