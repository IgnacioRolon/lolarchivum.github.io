You can use the same email on different accounts, even when they're on the same server! If you get a message during registration that says your email is being used, you can use another email and then change it via your Account Settings/Protection page.\n\nhttps://account.leagueoflegends.com/euw/en/protect\n\nHope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-29T17:29:24.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wuks' info is spot on, but I would add that you make sure you have access to that temporary email.  You'll be sent a confirmation email when attempting to switch it back to your main address.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}]}
