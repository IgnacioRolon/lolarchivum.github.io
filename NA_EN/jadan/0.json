I agree with *chocolate* that there are a few more factors that determine where you place other than just wins/losses. Your overall MMR and what you were last season also slightly impact where you place in the preseason.\n\nYou can find out details about the 2017 Ranked season [here.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/competitive/how-rank-2017-season) Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jadan","date":"2016-11-11T00:16:05.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won the first 3 games of my placement games and won the last 1 on the last game for placement","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chocalate Milk","date":"2016-11-11T00:12:11.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you play all of the games together? Because the first few games of placements matter a lot more than the last few, so if he won 3 then lost 7 and you lost 6 then won 4, he would probably do better than you in placements. Idk about getting a tier higher but still he should get higher if that happens","replies":[]}]}
