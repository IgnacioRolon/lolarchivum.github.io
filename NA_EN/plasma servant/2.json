Whoever gets these anti invis items is most likely going to have to be near the front to sweep where they will be most vulnerable, not hiding behind their team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"1 800 Top Lane","date":"2016-10-29T09:50:39.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo all around is just annoying, people like to say he's balanced, when he has the highest movespeed base and a move speed steroid allowing him to kite and do ap burst damage.
