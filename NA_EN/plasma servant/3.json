He has very bad early game because of the way he can turtle so easily and make himself difficult to kill. He normally builds full damage and come lategame he will half-health a squishy target with his barrel and q. \n\nThe only thing that keeps GP balanced  is the fact that he loses lane so often. \nSo by your logic, GP can be one of 2 things- completely broken in lane, almost no one can beat him because he does retardo damage and can turtle easily, and doesn't fall off, or he is a pile of shit, because he does no damage, scales no better than his opponents, and the only thing good about him is the fact that he can turtle easily.\n\nBasically, the meta would be, most ranged champs in lanes and most melees in jungle. Why? Because the melee junglers wouldn't be getting fucked by every laner being ranged and the ranged champs are the best laners because they will fuck the melees.\n\nOr, it would be don't play ranged champs, because at all stages of the game melees are to hard for them to kill.\n\n\nThis is what I could gather from reading this retarded post.\n\nOf you want to play a version of League where everything is equal, you are going to have to have 10 characters.

One for each team making the total of 10. In terms of character depth, they will probably be the equivalent of Nautilus for tank, Lux for ap, Lulu for support, Talon for assassin, and Ashe for adc.

There are several possibilities there. One side is right and the other wrong (about half the people are correct) or both are wrong (nearly everyone is wrong). It is NOT probable that both are correct, as both sides tend to say the other side is wrong and they are right.\n\n> You only need a small collection of champs to do well. Most pros don't even play many champs\n\nThat is almost assuredly true ... but I would think they need to have experience with nearly all champions to know the capabilities of each. Even if they scale equally, knowing combos and what they do is important (and why I own all champions).\n\n> If you are failing against a simple tool then you are a simple problem to solve\n\nI don't even like winning with imbalance in champions ... yeah, losing is more fun with a balanced team comp than winning with an imbalanced team comp.\n\n> This is where you just go over the deep end. \n\nMight be, but I'm sick of the imbalance.

Logic is the point. If someone says &quot;it can&#x27;t be done&quot; and they have not PROVEN that it can&#x27;t be done, then they are showing that they don&#x27;t know how to do it, and concluding that because *they* can&#x27;t think of how, then that would mean it isn&#x27;t possible. I&#x27;m sorry if I don&#x27;t think they are God and omniscient. If you want an analogy, look at how people vote for president in the U.S. .... each side thinks the other is stupid and can&#x27;t possibly know what they are talking about.

It is NOT probable that both are correct, as both sides tend to say the other side is wrong and they are right.\n\nThe conversation isn't the point its just something that has advanced far past what you are proposing which is an old mistake some people have fallen into and its really not a great idea at all.\n\n> That is almost assuredly true ... but I would think they need to have experience with nearly all champions to know the capabilities of each.

You don't have to play nunu to know what nunu is capable of nor what its like to play against him. Some have different learning styles of course\n\n> I don&#x27;t even like winning with imbalance in champions ... yeah, losing is more fun with a balanced team comp than winning with an imbalanced team comp.\n\nsounds like a personal problem\n\n> Might be, but I&#x27;m sick of the imbalance.

Some champions scale way better than other champions in duel, but no in teamfight. Example : Nasus is a good 1v1er but a terrible teamfighter.
