Dying isn't always a condition of YOUR mistake.\n\nIt's all about how the Team works with you.\n\nSometimes the RIGHT decision is to Hard Engage (say a Braum, or a Malphite, or a Leona).  So you do.  You set it up perfectly.  While your team runs away.\n\nIn this scenario let us assume the ADC was out of position and easy to pick off, and that doing so didn't risk putting your ADC or APC in danger... you made the absolute 100% correct play.  But the Team didn't follow.\n\nNow with your 4 Friends on Curse, you make the call and go all in... and your Team gets an Ace, AND you live.  \n\nIn one, you are an idiot who dies to much and the team rages you... in the other you are the hero who made the set up for the Ace.  But the trick is, it's the EXACT same situation.  Reality is you were RIGHT both times, but your team failed you in one while they supported you in another.\n\nIn other words, if you simply play not to die... then when you play with Teams that communicate and do the right things, you'll play at a Disadvantage and won't be as useful to the Team.\n\nThe key is to make the right choices for the right reasons.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gwellaouen","date":"2016-01-30T16:07:23.985+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Don Pavoni,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AZkwuo5E,comment-id=0012,timestamp=2016-01-30T13:50:54.079+0000)\n>\n> No, League **isn't** about not dying!

If you died:  Ok, you did something wrong. You should have probably move better, kite better...I don't know. \n\nI am trying to do this better now because I was within this stupid philosophy of not dying and because of that not improving. Try things, go for big plays ! It's like this that we will all improve:  by making mistakes. We will learn how to control those champions and maybe, someday, be a pro with fantastic moves with some of them.\n\nOk, just don't try a new champion and doing that in rank. XD' But you know what I mean. \n\nIt's pissing me off when I am a tank, a support and the adc just playing passively, not aa'ing a lot resulting in me probably dying when engaging or, by any chance, surviving low health. So, I am trying to be agressive and active when I am playing a carry role. Showing respect for when I am on the other side. ^^\n\nI think people are affraid of dying, of making mistakes because they think the others members of their team will be piss. Ok, if they just ran through 1v5. Yeah, it will be a good reason. But if they done well and just being outplayed by a better player on the other side. What's the problem ? For example, assassins tend to die a lot because they focus the carry. The carry will probably died but the assassin too. But the carry gone and the rest of their team using all of their spells on that assassin, the other 4th members can do something. ^^\n\nPS: Sorry about mistakes I can make in English.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NostolgicSkies","date":"2016-01-31T01:50:51.843+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Don Pavoni,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AZkwuo5E,comment-id=0012,timestamp=2016-01-30T13:50:54.079+0000)\n>\n> No, League **isn't** about not dying!

It's about not overextending just for a few extra gold.  It means not chasing someone under a turret when you're low, and not facechecking the brush just because you saw a weak laner flee through them.  It's about taking calculated risks, not needless ones.\n\nIt's about making your opponent die just as much as it is making yourself not die.\n\nThis is why good bottom laners don't engage without each other - solo is an unnessecary risk, and together, at the right time, is a calculated risk.\n\nThis is why, as a Sup, I leave my ADC to die.  They took a risk without me, dove at a bad time, and I'm not rushing in to try to save them because their risk was uncalculated because they thirst for kills, and mine says \"nope, bad time, we gon' get ganked, they haven't been poked enough to make it worthwhile, and I'm not giving 2 kills\" (aside: I play Leona and E relatively aggressively).\n\nThere is a difference between aggressive and reckless.

But i do point out issues. If they listen, i provide tips and tricks.\n\nThos that do listen send request and then improve. Seen Bronzies go from being 50 cs behind to cs-ing better than most of their opponents and with some champs, their main that are not my mains, they cs better than me.\n\nSo if you dont learn, that is what annoys me XD. Not that you may be bad, it is your inability to learn that bugs me. \"You\" not as in you, but anyone in general.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sir Yamazuki","date":"2016-01-30T08:17:10.497+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best part is they are normally giving up a lot of farm while trying to get kills, which means they aren't really even getting ahead of their opponent when they do get kills.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2016-01-30T08:13:34.904+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"While (as you already know) that is not 100% true across the board.

It is about objectives and pushing the advantage, not chasin like lunatics and dieing. We got baron, disengage and push lanes. We are doing drag, stick at drag when it has 1000 health and finish it asap. We got 2 kills, enemy is outnumbered and escaping, let them run and push the advantage, get drag or baron or get a tower or end. Kills are the goal, the nexus is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weasel Kensei","date":"2016-01-31T18:07:50.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I got placed in Bronze 3.... Anyway, I main support/Top in ranked and that basically means I MAIN SUPPORT IN RANKED. I dont know how many times weve... Iv poked people out of the lane and the ADC chases (sometimes even flashes) under their turret to try and get a kill on an enemy  ADC/Sup with less than 100 HP only to get themselves killed by the turret and end up giving them the kill.\n\nSame when Im jg, I execute a vicious gank 100-40'ing them and the laner gets in another 20% and rather than be happy they have to back, lose out on farm, take some turret chip, be set behind... my team mate dives, dies to turret fire, gives them the kill.\n\nMind you these stories are like 5th level and earlier stuff when the turrets can really mess you up with 2 hits, but they do this dumb shit anyway.\n\nMid/Late game Iv got people STILL emphasizing kills over game winning objectives. They will chase 2 people who flee a lost team fight ALLLL THE WAY up to their base wall, only to get caught out by the people who died, respawned, and swarmed by people with homeguards, when we could have probably taken 2 turrets, or a turret and the dragon.\n\nThe problem is the mentality of the people who play this game, the both want to win, and at the same time do things that dont help the team win. I actually mentioned why in that sentence though what the problem is. This is a team game, most people are pretty self absorbed, and dont function well in a team environment.\n\nPeople want to \"carry\" the team, and for that they need gold, and kills get gold. So they short-circuit their logic of winning the game by focusing on a thing that has them diving turrets and giving the enemy team kills thus losing them the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Plasma Servant","date":"2016-02-01T11:34:53.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My \"main\" is Malzahar ... yes, I've had games where I get lots of kills, but I don't really care. I scare the opposition out of creeps and build gold with cs. I am patient, and the times I get killed are usually because he is so slow and easy to gank. What I also notice is that many games I've won, I've done the most damage to champions had the highest cs on the team, and had fewest kills. Sure, I've had games where I've had tons of kills as well ... and it wasn't me that did that, but others on the team that made it possible, but it isn't my goal.

Anytime someone does that to me i just automatically assume theyre a shit player who doesnt actually understand league.     When did this game turn into team deathmatch?
