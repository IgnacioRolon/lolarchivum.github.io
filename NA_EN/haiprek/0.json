I don't make it to the load screen at all. I can use task manager to end and reconnect over and over again and it used to work eventually after 4-8 tries, but now it's so bad I've been placed in a lower queue for leaving/AFK. I've shut off my firewall, allowed all client processes, and run as administrator, nada.\r\n\r\nRunning Windows 8.1 and my directx is up to date.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any help folks can give, thanks.\r\n\r\n-H","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-22T03:30:48.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your connection to the gameservers is pretty poor, which could prevent a full connection from being established. Most of the time, this is caused by certain network settings that conflict with League. I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), as it covers the most common solutions for this issue.\n\nLet me know if those steps helped.","replies":[]}]}
