So instead of playing a game without masteries I decided to try and ask one of my team mates to dodge no one would so I dodged myself and now I have to wait for another low priority queue. Can I please have one of my leaver buster games taken away for this or could something be done to make up for the buggy client. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nDamnimacan","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-27T22:24:07.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, that sounds really frustrating for sure. Unfortunately, we cannot modify your low-priority queue in any way. If you're running a fairly low-end computer, the freeze in champ select may go away after enabling *low spec mode* and *disabling animations*. You can access these options from the menu in the top-right corner of the client after you hit the Cog icon.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or further issues with this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2016-12-23T21:02:17.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would suggest going into the client and submitting the bug through their bug report button at the bottom right of the home screen (with pictures of the incident). Riot is much more likely to see your bug report through there than through the forums. I'm sorry about this though, despite my lack of ranked playtime, that sounds very frustrating to deal with.","replies":[]}]}
