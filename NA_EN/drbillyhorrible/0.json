I get dropped 3-10 times a game, league isn't even that graphically intensive, wtf is your deal riot? Blizzard doesn't have these problems, hell I bet even EA handles their servers better. I've lost so many god damn games because of all the horrible problems on YOUR end. I even sent a ticket, it was promptly ignored because you know you are at fault, and you're too fucking focused on aesthetics that there IS NO BACKBONE TO LEAGUE ANYMORE. Every game at least 3 people are dced at some point, these aren't ragers or afkers they are vicitms of your shitty ass servers. FIX THIS AND FIX IT NOW. \r\n\r\nCan't wait till I get into Heroes of the Storm and leave this shit behind for good, I mean this used to be a good game, you know, when it fucking worked.","replies":[{"poster":"Tony Lewis","date":"2014-10-28T01:50:35.004+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed... too little attention to this shit lately, surely there must have been something that was changed around 4.17 and 18 to make everyone experience packet loss at once.... so many lost games zzzz","replies":[{"poster":"A Corny Name","date":"2014-10-28T23:43:27.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been around since August and riot keeps ignoring it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saennia","date":"2014-10-28T02:47:57.148+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"My favorite is their \"Server status\" part of their website is never even updated in real time. Their game has crashed yet their site says it's online and it must be my end. BS.

I cant help but agree that the servers are trash and need to be fixed and or replaced. Its every day something happens to these severs and Riot knows what they should do but lack the motivation in crossing over. Hands down the creators of this game are making this games down fall. Fix your servers or lose business. Very simple with the millions you all make, implementing a newer server should be top priority. Very saddened by the lack of attention the server issues have gotten. If issues persist a player you will lose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Kuno","date":"2014-10-28T02:34:27.517+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"None of these problems on HotS, none of these problems on Dawn Gate, DotA has a whole suite of serverr status tools available to players.\n\nGet with the times Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pahimakas","date":"2014-10-28T02:49:16.807+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"or...

Honestly I love league, and I just want it fully functional again and not just the DC crapshoot that the game has devolved into.","replies":[]},{"poster":"poodoo","date":"2014-10-28T02:59:39.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not that they are behind, it's that they are ahead.

The problem in this case isn't DDOS, it's packet loss, for some reason connecting with riots servers (and ONLY riots servers) causes a lot of packets to be dropped which happens no where else. Riot needs to figure out how the other companies handle their server set up so that a solution to these issues can be found.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ðèpressed","date":"2014-10-28T02:52:57.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue I have is the ping jump then I have to manually reset, I have a leavebuster or whatever on my account now.
