They're synonymous.\n\n>I never searched for league of legends racism cause no one does lets be honest. \n\nI'm just saying the information was available to you from the jump. Racism is unacceptable in most situations, it shouldn't have come as a surprise that there might be a punishment given if you were to use it.\n\n>Put yourself in my place, your playing a normal game , and u were just having fun , no one got hurt, then you get banned for it, \n\n Well, I wouldn't be in that situation in the first place. However, if I were to engage in that sort of behavior, I would know that it's taboo and I might get punished for it. Having fun at someone else's expense goes against the Summoner's Code and is just wrong in general. \n\n>but hey if it was a streamer or any youtuber he would flame for 10 games and still not get banned.\n\n\n Even if that were the case and a streamer showed this type of blatant racism and went unpunished {by the way, research [_Pants are Dragon_](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6jp2go/pants_are_dragon_calls_his_teammate_the_n_word/)} that still doesn't justify your own behavior. \n\n Sorry dude. This punishment is most likely going to stay no matter what you do, you can choose to learn from it and improve your behavior or go back to your old ways and receive a permanent suspension.
