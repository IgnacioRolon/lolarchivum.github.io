Top was 0/3 and rage quit, subsequently the mid then quit the game shortly after. \r\n\r\nI would like to know how this is an accurate reflection of my performance in ranked games going forward. \r\n\r\nIf I'm constantly being backtracked by AFK, rage-quitting, and Inting teammates it makes it 5x more difficult to effectively progress. At the very least, it frustrates me more going into my next game. \r\n\r\nIt makes the game become a chore instead of being what it should be. A game. \r\n\r\nI'm not just whinging for the sake of it, I'd honestly be interested in hearing a discussion in how your LP shouldn't be calculated off of individual performance versus just winning or losing the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Bloodpack Alpha","date":"2017-10-04T06:29:24.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, that was a super generic answer. You also said a lot without actually saying anything at all. \n\nWinning/Losing as a team doesn't even become and option when you have 2 people on your team quit your game. I have no control over that and it's automatically a loss. \n\nI know I'm not going to get anything changed from this post, that's not what I'm after. I'm just genuinely curious why there wouldn't be a system in place to cancel LP loss from the players on the team that didn't rage-quit / disconnect. That way their game isn't negatively impacted by something that's out of their control? Is that something that's too abstract or too complicated to code?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T01:40:35.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The simplest answer? League is a team game. It doesn't make the most sense to have everything weighted only on yourself when the entire game is played and won/lost as a team.\n\nWith that being said, there are already multiple systems in place that allow you to set yourself apart from the crowd. This was the main reason champion mastery became a thing! That's one of the best ways to actually showcase your own skill, as well as the new honor flairs etc. At the end of the game, League remains a team game.","replies":[]}]}
