Go to play the new game mode and right after the champ select countdown the game just vanishes. Says it's still running but when I try and click it just goes to the \"Game still in progress\" screen and never actually opens into loading screen. Can't reconnect no matter how many times i click it, tried restarting and currently doing a repair right now to try and fix this.
