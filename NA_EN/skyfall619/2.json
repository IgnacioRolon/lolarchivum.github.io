So battlecast skar by default isnt as futuristic as the other but more of a  garage made feel, which i like. But he for sure is more brutal and muderistic (doubt thats a word).\n\nOnly think about a bloodstone skin the colors are similar to battlecast but bloodstone would be much much more slick and shiny. Me like shiny things","replies":[{"poster":"Celio Hogane HD","date":"2015-08-09T13:01:33.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The word you wanted is Murderous","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Celio Hogane HD","date":"2015-08-08T18:43:21.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why not, That skin is amazing?","replies":[{"poster":"CursedByLight","date":"2015-08-08T19:15:52.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, compared to the rest of the battlecast skins, its only cool feature is the chainsaw claws.","replies":[{"poster":"Celio Hogane HD","date":"2015-08-08T20:12:41.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And his epic tank weels? no one thinks in the tank weels :(","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2015-08-08T00:28:13.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skins take months in advance to plan, according to Riot, because their artists are all so busy.

Currently his rework with the buffs, he is better at single target lockdown, can dual like a god in his buff zones, and he is fairly decent at getting the enemy red due to the positioning on his shrine. The cons of his rework is you have to position yourself just right if you want to peel several people attacking your carry, making him weaker against comps with several bruisers, and he doesn't do well against counter ganks, but boy oh boy you don't want to fight him in his zones.
