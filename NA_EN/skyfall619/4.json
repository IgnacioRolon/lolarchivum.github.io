While the lifesteal instead of building into vamomscepter it would build into a new item say blood scepter. It would give 10% lifesteal plus .5 lifesteal per 2 minutes. Up to 12%. Blood scepter would cost like 975 gold.\nThis item would also be used to build blood thirster. \n\nAlso blood scepter would have a unique passive on it that would dissuade people from stacking blood thirster with it.
