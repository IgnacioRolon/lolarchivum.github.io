He still is the only ADC with assassination potential, and still has probably the strongest teamfight in the game (What'll Kalista do when she can't hop out of Rat-A-Tat-Tat range?).\n\nBut Twitch has a really weak laning phase. And, right now, the meta favors aggressive ADCs and laners with good poke or engage potential in lane. Leona, Lulu, Sona, and Janna (Probably the best support pick atm) have knocked out the Namis, with Threshs and Braums being only subpar anymore. And aggressive ADCs with lots of kill potential in lane like Graves, Sivir, and Jinx have knocked out the bad laners like Twitch, Kog'Maw, and Vayne and the nerfed ADCs like Lucian (Who is still good late game just not as good early anymore). Corki gets a free pass because he has a long range escape and a lot of magic damage.\n\nAggressive laners win out right now because of the nature of Infinity Edge rushing, leading to massive early crits and in-lane BF Swords. Again, doesn't apply to Corki because he has a good escape, but any ADC who rushes BortK or Triforce besides Corki (Twitch, Kog, Vayne) is at a big lane disadvantage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoMonku","date":"2015-03-07T08:34:49.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel his main problem is he basically gets dumped on in lane.  Graves/Corki can just fight him straight up and run away if the fight becomes unfavorable(though in almost all instances they SHOULD win), while twitch is in it for the duration unless he flashes out.  He has an insane lategame, but can be counter hard by a good {{champion:201}}  or {{champion:157}} shield.  He still does okay and is really good in his niche, being able to pop out invisible and open up onto the ENTIRE enemy team, but this requires a LOT of coordination and skill to be able to pull it off correctly.  It would be easier imo to just pick {{champion:222}}  or {{champion:96}} instead because while they don't have the same AA power as twitch with his ultimate on, they have a superior laning phase and also have waveclear, at least superior to twitch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2015-03-07T08:11:14.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> What happened to Twitch?\nhavent seen him since he was played at worlds last year or maybe 1-2 times since then. is he that bad?\n\nHe's decent.\n\nIt's just - meta-sheep are gonna be meta-sheep. If the average person is going to be to lazy to test out what works the best, they're just going to look at what champion's considered the #1, gold-medalist, best-in class and run with that one. Nobody in their right mind is going to play the 4th best champion if they're aiming to play the best champion. Due to no mirror picks in ranked and LoL being balanced enough to often force rock-paper-scissors dynamics (and bands being a thing) you'll usually have 3 #1 picks for each lane (kind of like gold, silver, and bronze medalists).\n\nSo usually you wind up with the majority of players using the same ~15 champions, and the remaining minority of players being awesome and playing what they like.\n\nDoesn't mean the 4th~ picks are bad, there's usually no describable difference in strength between the ~6th best and 1st best in a roll, pros tend to pick champions for what works with their specific strategies and everyone tends to emulate those picks. \nA really important thing to note here is pros are the players that will be able to tell an 0.2% difference in power and abuse it for all it's worth, focusing on puddles and speedbumps, not the peaks and valleys a casual player will claim there are between champions because they don't know any better. There's 1st, 2nd, and 3rd picks mostly because 3 is a nice number, not because there's a massive cliff between those easily-seen picks and the next best choices.\n\nWhich can be silly when dominant pro strategy needs are clearly pushing a lane-swap, fast-push strategy or win within 20 minutes from a dominant early-game strat, 2 things which yoloqueue is pretty much incapable of intentionally pulling off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-03-07T07:35:21.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot this one {{champion:236}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-03-07T07:29:21.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man remember when twitch wasnt played for centuries until he got his visual update, then pros played him for like 2 weeks and he was nerfed to shit for being 'too overbearing'?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Truthteller","date":"2015-03-07T06:49:43.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kalista is probably the only champion in League that rushes {{item:3085}} after or before IE.","replies":[]}]}
