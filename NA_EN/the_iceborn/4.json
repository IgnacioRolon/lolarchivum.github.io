She was a firm, resolute witch who had goals and plans. Now she's some gutless redneck in a bunker hoarding weapons to prevent the end of the world and protect herself when it comes. You've taken away all of her agency and power as a villain, and made her a total slave to fear. I want to know why. This is a wretched direction for one League's most resolute villainesses, and it completely removes any power she had in the world.","replies":[{"poster":"Psyrix","date":"2018-08-22T00:55:45.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I Hardly think this is fair, If you look at her old lore as being from the perspective of the entities she's fooling, then it's still relevant.   What i don't understand tho, is why she keeps killing the reincarnations of her sissters if it seems like she'll need them to help her.   aaspects of the writing itself makes the new lore a bit weird.. but the underlying theme doesn't seem detrimental.   The Void wants Runeterra obliterated and consumed..

Dark Ice.\n2. Yes. (she still has nightmares because of it)\n3. From the Watchers themselves. (her story)\n4. The Watchers can't feel \"anger\" as humans do. (Vel'koz's story)\n5. \"Iceborn\" _refers to_ the descendants; they're not separate terms. (both her and Sigvar's story)\n6. ^\n7. Yes, it explicitly states so in Vel'koz's story. \n8. That's been retconned into the name of the things trapped under the ice. \n9. You have.\n10. It's likely referring to the fact she's blind. \n11. Probably most, since they pick from among children of different tribes for the Frostguard, but only those who survive training actually become Frostguard. \n12. See 5, again. \n13. Obviously as part of whatever magic she used.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FallingMeteor","date":"2018-08-21T01:57:39.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did Sejuani's ancestor, Serylda ever get backstory?
