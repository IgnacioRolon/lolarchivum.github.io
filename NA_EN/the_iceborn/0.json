I will be discussing some parts in the ashe comics so BEWARE OF SPOILERS.\nI have always wondered how the Frostguard find their warriors. So I made a thread about it to explore that topic. There will be question at the end that I cant quite figure out so if anyone has any ideas help.\n\n_*~~Frostguard~~*_\nStarting with the easier choice we can assume that nobody in the cult is allowed to have children. Generally we know that children are the result of an oath between a warmother and an oathsworn. Such children would be raised to, one day, lead the tribe through tough times, secure their survival. So why wouldnt frostguard be allowed to have any? The problem appears as we look into the 2nd issue of the comic. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/QXXPIMp.jpg[]\nSince a marriage/oath is mostly(not always) necessary for there to be children, the frostguard are prohibited of offering that oath to anyone but Lissandra. In the comic Ashe actually asked Maalcrom if he wanted to offer her his oath in order for her to have his children but he clearly couldnt. Looking away from the premise that an oath is needed before having children, I believe that there are also other rules that prohibit the frostguard from having them. So lets exclude the frostguard as a source.\n\n**_*~~Tribes~~*_**\nLets take a look at freljord tribes as a source of future frostguard warriors. As I previously mentioned warmothers should only have children with their Bloodsworn. Sometimes if a mother would have a child outside of her oath, that child would have a hard time being accepted, I would think that the child and the mother could be banished to live by themselves. The toughest position would be put on the child because its mother could still have children within the tribe without being excluded, so according to Odin she would give the child up to the frostguard. Here we have our first source from where the frostguard gets its warriors. Analyzing further sources, we know that Nunus tribe was actually attacked and slaughtered. No doubt that the tribes also have to endure other catastrophes like extreme cold, avalanches and dangerous predators like wolves or even trolls, in many cases the tribes would break apart or even die so children would be left on their own, sometimes \"saved\" by the frostguard.\n\n_***~~Foundling Village~~***_\nSpeaking of saved kids, the map shows us that there is a settlement near the citadel that actually ~~brainwashes~~ shelters orphaned kids. The actual idea here is that children orphaned by freljords cruel nature and culture are taken in by the frostguard. Now lets be realistic and say that the citadel isnt interested in taking in any kind of kid, they want iceborn in order to keep their royal blood going. So when the frostguard attack tribes they probably cherry pick the tribe for iceborn magic as most frostguard children are iceborn. Everyone in that village probably undergoes training and one of the first things they learn is Lissandras prayers. I assume thats the first step of making them obedient.\nIn conclusion we can say that most youngsters in foundling village are products of their mother having them out of wedlock plus they are also there because of natural catastrophes aswell as the treacherous wilderness. Tribes in such tough situations should be the main source of future frostguardians(?).\n\nNow you may be asking well, why take in other tribes youngsters and not have your own?... Well my idea would be that pregnant frostguard  warriors are of no use for 9 Months and wouldnt be able to do their task. Not only that but Lissandra does not want anyone to come between her and her immediate followers, especially no parental bonds or anything that would put a child above her in the sense of allegiance/devotion. She demands a will of  ~~iron~~ true ice when it comes to their faith and obedience. I have no doubt that even if a frostguard was to have a child, the kid would also become iceborn and they would be raised in the faith of the three.\n\n\n##Questions\n1. The cult wants iceborn children and we know that most people there are iceborn, but they also take non-iceborn children. Why? Would such children posess different gifts? Like having the potential to be a vedmah(oracle) or a frost mage?\n2. Would you say that the if a non-iceborn mother has a child out of wedlock and seeks refuge at the citadel, she would be taken in? Or only her iceborn child?\n3. Nunu talked about meeting Lissandra, would you say that most children meet her or just the ones she has special interest in?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2019-03-07T20:00:16.735+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nWhen I was working on the worldbuilding for this, I assumed Lissy was from the matriarchal, child-centric, culture of the Freljord.

So her motivations, world view, and religion reflect that culture and her somewhat rightfully paranoid point of view. \n\n  In a way her religion has its own rules, ranks and orders outside of the old culture.  But it was built from that culture of oathsworn and valuing children above all.  \n\nSo yeah.  She created a place for the orphans and the unwanted  (and as Nunu shows her cult sometimes creates orphans to get children.)  But the cult also takes adults and volunteers.   \n\nWas Maalcrom orphan or a bastard? there's a good argument there. (i.e. I'm not going to reveal his backstory.)   Maybe he originally choose that path because he liked the idea of being a healer more than being a warrior.  Or was he attracted to the notion of a life devoted to something larger than his tribe?  Or maybe he saw how badass they were and wanted in on that?     \n\nBasically I don't think of her cult in black or white terms, because I think it's made of a lot of people with a lot of different reasons for being there.  And I think she's too smart to only collect certain people.    The frost priests in Sejuani's tribe are pretty clearly \"baddies.\"  But I would argue the frostguard in Ant's story are heroes.    I think there are elements in Lissy's cult that have to be evil, but if we let it get too evil it wouldn't be realistic.

She may not trust all of them... but she knows she has to accept them if she wants to unite their followers.\n\nSejuani follows the old ways.  She wants the strongest tribe and believes that a tribe survives in part by preying on tribes weaker than her own.

During the \"imperial age\" the Three Sisters ahd united Freljord and made it into a great empire spanned though _a bit_ better than the actual Freljord, even though I think the Iceborn...werent exactly the kindest masters, I thought life conditions of that era were better than actual Freljord and that it's children focused culture was made after the fall of the empire, the Watchers etc made life in Freljord A LOT harder. \n\nSo was the \"children culture\" there since the start of Freljord, inclunding the \"imperial age\"?

(mostly)\n\nThank you for checking out my thread Odin!\nYou know she is the \"darkness\" in the freljord if you will, so lots of people just see her as an evil witch but forget about her time when she was human, before all this power was granted to her.. And Im also guilty of that..\n\nThat is also why I never actually thought of her wanting to shelter orphaned children and that its not all about power. It truly is a win-win for her since all the orphans may think she is weird sometimes(like nunu does) but they all appreciate the home she gave them and maybe a cause? A religion to serve with their lives. A home. When it comes to my dear Maalcrom, I think that he loved the cults strength, just like nunu actually! Nunu does find Lissandra a weird lady but he also wants to join her warriors, he admires them.. I think thats also what motivated Maalcrom to become frostguard! I always knew Lissandra was a mastermind, but you opened my eyes to the benefit that Lissandra would see in welcoming all kinds of people to her cause. Especially if those people are determined to serve her with their lives. I think that her cult should be mostly evil but there needs to be a part where there is lots of variety in behavior and people(non-iceborn), allowing different views and a certain grey-area if you will.\nI can also imagine Lissandra having a great influence over the culture in freljord since she has been there for thousands of years.\n\nAbout those volunteers, I think thats also good but no doubt she is very careful as to who enters her domain and with what intention (Using her dreamwalking, to see their secrets/intentions?)\nOh yes I love me a good \"baddie\". And now that you mentioned it, Maalcrom was \"only\" a healer and yet so skilled in combat wow.\nAnd yes I know Riot changes stuff a lot of time but I talked to Laurie actually and I told him you two are a powerhouse that work great together and make great things happen :)\nYoure an angel Odin, truly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AnotherPurple379","date":"2019-03-07T16:16:40.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In regards to your third question, Lissandra did have special interest in Nunu, since she wanted to know about the story of the Yeti from him.
