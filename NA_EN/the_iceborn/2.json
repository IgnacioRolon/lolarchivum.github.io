I found this image and I couldnt quite tell the function of most of these items.\n\nThe First seems to be some kind of an Orb, sometimes used by witches to scry( Gather visions of the future?)\nThe Second item looks like it could be a True Ice lantern or maybe even necklace?The dark Priest in ,,Eye of the Abyss“ wore one!\nThe Last item I find very curious and I couldnt think of any function for it.. I wonder what it is, tho it oddly looks like a dream catcher from true ice.. :/\n\nLissandra always talks about True Ice artifacts and Secrets frozen in ice, so naturally Im quite interested in the Items she posesses!\nThanks for any input :)","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-09-08T23:04:03.659+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Early concept art for items using that rare and powerful “true ice.”  ...if memory serves.","replies":[{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2018-09-09T02:44:08.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Odin can I ask what you are working on now for narrative since I heard Rayla took your spot on the champions team","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-09-09T17:55:57.696+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, whoever told you that is innaccurate.
