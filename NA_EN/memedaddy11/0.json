It works as intended on himself, but on Daisy or allies the slow doesn&#039;t place the healing mark on enemies.\r\n\r\nReproduce:\r\n1. Take Font of Life on Ivern\r\n2. Go into practice tool\r\n3. Spawn enemy dummy and ally dummy next to one another\r\n4. Use E- Triggerseed on yourself while standing next to the enemy dummy such that it is slowed. Note the Font of Life mark appearing on the enemy dummy\r\n5. Use E- Triggerseed on the nearby allied dummy. Notice how when this shield explodes and slows the enemy dummy no mark appears.\r\n6. Spawn Daisy. Use E - Triggerseed on her and send her near the enemy dummy. Note again the lack of Fond of Life mark. Although Daisy&#039;s knockup seems to apply it just fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Poluact","date":"2017-11-09T04:15:20.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is just my speculations.\n\nI think the reason is how shields work in the game. When you put a shield on somebody - they own it from that point, not you. Have you ever noticed how when there is a Janna in the game everyone get a lot of \"self-mitigated damage\" on game results screen after the game? And there is no stat for how many shields somebody put on others in the game. I think this is because game does not track who initially casted a shield.\n\nSo I think this is what happens: you cast a shield on ally and then they claim it as their own. From this point this ally is \"owner\" of the shield, it's like them casted it on themselves. They don't have Font of Life rune - and this is why mark doesn't applied. I'm pretty sure if they had this rune mark would be applied.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-08T19:58:39.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump for visibility","replies":[]}]}
