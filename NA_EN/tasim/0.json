Earlier this morning I was playing a normal game with my college roommates, I was playing Quinn top against a Cho&#039;Gath, and lets say things didnt end up too well :(. In around 43 minutes of play I went  1/17/4 and was banned for int feeding. If you look up my match history you will notice I had a decent build as well as pretty high farm. I also contritbuted to our team by taking a tower and two inhibitors, keep in mind this is with the position I was in. If you look at my prior match history you can see that I am not a feeder, I dont promote feeding and Ive played pretty consistently through out. The fact Ive been punished for one bad game late at night kind of feels unjusitified, that being said what do you all think of my chances that I can have my 14 day ban overturned?\n\nhttp://www.lolstarz.com/summoner?name=Sexy+lulu&lo=na\n\nThe Link Is My Account\n\n\nP.S.

He had sold my items and bought boots, to which I had to resell in order to buy the items I ended with, as you can tell however my farm was substantial even provided with the fact my score was as it was. If I was truly attempting an int feed I would have kept those boots but alas I did not.

If you had a top laner feeding like crazy and selling items and buying all kinds boots and then selling those and buying less items every time... like wouldn't you think that person is ruining your match? I mean, only 5 kills you were a part of in a 43 minute game? You did practically nothing and came across as a someone just fucking around, not really trying to win. I understand why you were punished, and I'm a little conflicted given the circumstance, but I think you are just going to have to bite the bullet on this one and make sure you pee before a game starts. It's like when your parents always made you pee before a long car trip so they didn't have to stop along the way a bunch of times. It's just common sense. On top of that, you went 1/17/4 ...like wow.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-04-18T10:56:37.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, I just gave a reason why I think the system flagged you.\n\nI imagine that Riot is not going to like it very much that your excuse was that your roommate was playing.
