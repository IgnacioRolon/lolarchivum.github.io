Meaning concerns about ip farming (from the win of the day) would not be a problem.\r\n- It will also remove some unused accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T22:45:13.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We encourage people to only use one account for almost this exact reason.
