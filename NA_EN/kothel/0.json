Also, show it in terms of how they display attack speed in League to see how his damage compares to that of an ADC like Tristana. Or just show me a formula so I can get the numbers myself. Would appreciate it if you could help, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-31T00:46:00.730+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on which way he is moving and how fast.","replies":[{"poster":"Kothel","date":"2018-01-31T23:33:27.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well I was thinking about like standing still","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kothel","date":"2018-01-31T23:54:01.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tested it and found out that it is pretty much a 1.0 attack speed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dope Solo","date":"2018-01-31T01:12:49.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a really interesting question. I'm not sure how to solve it outright, but I think you'd have to calculate the rotational speed first, that is how much time it takes for the 2nd star to arrive at the Star 1 position. The distance between the two stars is a constant, probably measured in pixels. So, you'd have pixels/second. After you've got that, you could factor in move speed.","replies":[{"poster":"Kothel","date":"2018-01-31T23:35:23.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks for suggestion :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ka√¨ju","date":"2018-01-31T04:14:02.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you asking out of curiosity or wondering if he should be buffed?","replies":[{"poster":"Kothel","date":"2018-01-31T23:34:09.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Curiosity, I know he can be really good in the right hands with proper map awareness","replies":[]}]}]}
