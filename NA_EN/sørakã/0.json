The main factor for your perception of size is the screen size and the distance between you and the screen, resolution on the other hand is responsible for the maximum amount of detail which can be perceived looking at the screen at close distances. A good usier interface would keep nearly the same size on a screen of the same size no matter what the resolution is, or at least enable the user to adapt it's size to it. So 1080p and 4k should both have the same interface size. League is just utter shit when it comes to that, the minimap does not scale at all and become incredibly small at higher resolutions, as for the 3D parts of the game, they stay the same \"size\". So blame riot, not resolutions, thx.","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2017-04-16T17:43:50.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You completely misunderstand, and I bloody well know what resolution is.\n\nI'm on a 38\" 3440x1440 screen. The scaling is just fine - the screen itself almost completely fills my field of vision.\n\nTherefore: if I run the game at 1920x1080, it's running in a smaller window at the very center of my screen. Therefore, I don't have to glance as far away from the actual viewport to look at the map or a cooldown timer.","replies":[{"poster":"Nomeya","date":"2017-12-05T02:48:58.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Therefore: if I run the game at 1920x1080, it's running in a smaller window at the very center of my screen.

Enable it and they'll take up equally as large sizes, albeit one is slightly more blurry than the other.\n\nResolution alone have very little to do with being a hindrance or not in the way you describe. A player playing at 4K on a 27'' 4K monitor will be performing almost identical as if he was playing at 1080p on a 27'' 1080p monitor, which the user above you tried to explain.\n\nThe way that resolution might become a hindrance at most is if you're playing in borderless window mode where Windows controls the mouse, and you have mouse precision (aka mouse acceleration) disabled. This forces you to *physically* move the mouse further to move it from one corner to the other at 4K than if you were playing at 1080p. Fullscreen mode doesn't, or shouldn't at least, have this issue as the game controls the mouse and not Windows.","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2017-12-05T03:16:12.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you just necrobump an 8 month old thread?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2017-10-06T09:37:52.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even worse when your monitor is physically 13\" with at least a 2K resolution.\n\nPlaying fullscreen and lowering quality of the graphics feels barbaric for a \"modern\" game like this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Inanis","date":"2017-10-06T09:13:50.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a 4K screen, and since i got it i have stopped playing league and moved to HOTS.
