I've never posted here but I am a little upset but I don't know if this is a matter that I should submit to riot. \n\nAs you all know, ranked recently reset. Me and my friend's played, won 4/5 and got bronze I (It's okay it was hilarious we all thought we would be silver)\n\nFurther looking through \"Vi's Wardens\" In Bronze V there was a team named **\"Mike Brown Needed a GA\"** . Is it bad for me to find this really offensive? It does not directly apply to me but there is a large group of people it would upset, and as they always say we wanna keep the rift a safe place, and it so safe when this stuff is flying around. I would like to have some way of maybe banning their name? But I don't know if that would cause more problems, because lately everything that goes on in that spectrum is mostly opinion... so it may not be an appropriate thing to report. \n\nI would love some help! Thank you! {{champion:51}}","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-01-23T01:51:32.131+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey peceluvjillybear!\n\nThe best thing to do when encountering a name you think falls under the \"offensive\" category is to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!  One of our specialists can take a look and see if this name is unacceptable.\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cynicatt","date":"2015-01-24T06:38:19.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's funny how unregulated team names are, tbh.\nI saw a team named \"N^^^^^ D^^^\" last season, but with the \"I\"s replaced with \"1\"s.","replies":[]},{"poster":"S1rF33dsAl0t","date":"2015-01-23T19:18:57.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tasteless joke, but still kiiinda funny.","replies":[]}]}
