A large part of your skill IS playing appropriately around your team comp. and the map. This includes your team play, decision making, mechanics and everything in between. The point is that in a real solo queue, the only variable which is consistent in every game is you so the other players cancel each other out long-term and only your own performance remains as the relevant factor. Over a large sample of games, this is the best representation of skill and the least confounded. \n\nIf you add more pre-selected consistent variables to the game like 3 others that said player already knows, has plans developed with, may be on smurfs etc. (in other words, variables in your control which really can't be equalized or fully understood by the system), it adds far more variance in determining actual skill. Think of your skill as solving for x and the main factor that a ranked system is trying to derive in a simplified manner through game results. Each new consistent variable (up to a queue configuration of 5) makes solving for that x harder by adding more variables to factor in. It also greatly increases variance due to the potential pre-selected strategies, voice etc. This is even further amplified by the lack of a sufficient player pool to actually create balanced matchmaking even at Plat+ with 5 mans. IWDominate not long ago had a game where his team was -2000LP in ranking differences. LoL is a huge game but it needs to be even bigger to support DQ and something like DQ will inherently greatly increase the variance which means that you need to play way more games to reach your true skill level than if it was just a SQ system. This can work both ways - some can be much higher than their skill and some much lower, that's the nature of variance. If you had to play 200 games to get a pretty accurate representation of your skill, it's probably more than double in the new system.\n\nBTW: The high variance nature of it is again not even my main problem with it. I simply don't think it's even remotely logical to aggregate every queue configuration on the same ladder. If they care about competitive integrity that's clearly a braindead move which makes ladder results only more ambiguous. It's not that hard to have DQ and just show separate results for each queue configuration.","replies":[{"poster":"6KEMBE4ORBA","date":"2016-05-13T12:07:14.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are completely on point.\n\n_Although I think you're wasting your time explaining stuff like this to the \"average joes\"._ \n\nI know cause I already have done it numerous times and I'm sure the guy you responded to can't wrap his head around your reply.\n\nI recently had a \"conversation\" here with one particular individual that is so thickheaded that he denies outright any of the problems (you mentioned them) that DQ brings and after all in the end he basically said:_ \"it dosn't matter (cause DQ works in some way)\"_ \n\nYou can read the whole conversation here (it includes several good explanations of DQ's problems - sadly it was buried in the response tree)\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/IEoRyl3v-daily-reminder-that-we-want-solo-queue?comment=000700000000000100000000000000000000","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IWrath","date":"2016-05-12T13:05:36.280+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"Wouldn't the true indication of individual skill be beating 5 man premades by yourself?","replies":[{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2016-05-12T23:07:02.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If thats the case:\nBronze = Silver\nSilver = Gold\nGold = Plat\nPlat = Diamond\netc.\n\nBecause you are facing a harder challenge than your tier requires.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KarmasPolice","date":"2016-05-12T16:19:20.802+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Do you know the quote \"All the heroes I know are dead\"?\n\nWe are not heroes(sorry {{champion:78}} ), we just want fair games...if you want to be a hero go play solo in DQ","replies":[{"poster":"IWrath","date":"2016-05-12T17:31:57.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KarmasPolice,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pKbrxBg6,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-05-12T16:19:20.802+0000)\n>\n> Do you know the quote &quot;All the heroes I know are dead&quot;?\n> \n> We are not heroes(sorry {{champion:78}} ), we just want fair games...if you want to be a hero go play solo in DQ\n\nI do that quite often, I rarely go into a premade and I'm slowly climbing.","replies":[{"poster":"KarmasPolice","date":"2016-05-12T18:37:41.487+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that you do so, doesn't mean that we all should.

I might as well not bother, its not a true indication of individual progress and skill.\n\nAnd I would agree with you if League were a First-Person-Shooter or a solo-player game, but it isn't.  The irony in discussing \"individual skill and progress\" in a team based game is so obvious and overwhelming that it's hard to even put into descriptive terms.  \n\nIf you hate Dynamic Queue, that's fine, but I know the boards/old forums and I know how people would complain like mad if Solo Queue were to ever return.  \n\n\"There's no team work\"\n\"No one groups\" \n\"Why can't I climb?\"  \n\nWhen I read the complaints about Dynamic Queue the majority of the posts just say things like \"It's unfair to face a premade duo/trio/quad because they're better coordinated...\" Yeah, no kidding - that's what this game is supposed to be, a TEAM based game.  Riot has undergone a paradigm shift with regard to how they approach this game going forward.  It is clear that they are centered the focus on team play, grouping, friends, etc... And if your best argument against it is that it doesn't highlight your INDIVIDUAL skill well then you should prepare yourself for additional disappointment in the years to come.","replies":[]}]}
