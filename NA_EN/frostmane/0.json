If Yasuo is not banned, there is absolutely no need for you to point that out. You are basically asking for an argument.\n\nI think the thing people hate one trick ponies is because they focus so much on one champ, if they lose that champ, they are worthless.\n\nUsing AzureRaven as an example, I believe they can get to Diamond on Riven, one tricks can easily rank up to such, there is no dispute there. But if Riven is banned, it is probably safe to say that on other champs they are nowhere close to Diamond skill level. It isn't 100% but its pretty safe to say if a 1 trick doesn't get their champ, they are generally total crap on any other champ. I wouldn't be surprised if even a Diamond or even higher 1 tricks would be no different than a Bronze-Gold if their champ was banned. That is a fairly huge gap, to drop from Diamond skill level to about Silver all from 1 champ.\n\nThat is the reason why being diverse is generally better. Being Diamond level on a single champ isn't something to be proud of really, being Diamond level on just about every role on the other hand is something to be proud of. When you watch on Twitch and you see those people have a champ pool of about 10-20 champs they play all at Diamond+ level, that is something to be proud of.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Last Ballad","date":"2016-06-17T21:16:35.468+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my sister's ever true words \"people are dumb\"","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2016-06-17T21:54:06.126+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your sister is going places.
