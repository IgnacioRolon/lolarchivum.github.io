We have a really good ping system and if we need something said just have prewritten things like defend here or something. We also have a good feature with our ability&#039;s and ulti to show our timers. People are just way to toxic in this game and i don&#039;t enjoy this game at all with toxic attitudes. It makes me play worst and i just want to quit the game. So i propose remove chat feature.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-08-15T07:02:37.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can drag it off the screen if it bugs you.","replies":[{"poster":"Sinister Anubis","date":"2016-08-15T07:07:50.130+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i had no idea and i been here since season 1","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-08-15T20:45:02.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only know 'cause I accidentally did it once early on and freaked out about it.\nHad to google it to get it back.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-08-15T20:50:36.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Counter argument: There are a lot of situations where you genuinely need to *talk*, not just ping.\n\nWard locations, strategies, reminding teammates about certain items, etc. Maybe some of that fades away the higher you go, but chat is a feature used by beginners. It would be best to teach them not to buy Thornmail on Ashe *before* the end of the game, not after. You can also use it to encourage allies when they think things are hopeless.\n\nChat is a tool. Used correctly, it's immensely helpful. We shouldn't get rid of it just because a few people misuse it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-08-15T10:02:00.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat is more necessary for complex plans though.  For instance if you're pressuring bot inhib and you want to rotate to pressure mid and then top down after, it's much more difficult to communicate that in a way that won't be misinterpreted with pings alone than with chat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warmanreaper","date":"2016-08-15T07:05:00.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're adding voice comms soon...","replies":[{"poster":"Sinister Anubis","date":"2016-08-15T07:07:21.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"doubtful.
