When normally you click on a minion or character and a sword appears, in this bug the hand with the 1 finger pointing out stays at all time and has a thick white outline. The only way to fix the bug for the remainder of the game is to close both League and the Client and start it back up again. However, this is really annoying especially in ranked where I cannot do anything purely down to a bug! Any Help or steps I can do to stop the issue?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotAaronMike","date":"2018-05-25T18:28:12.572+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey ThePepsiBottle! It sounds like maybe the new \"Treat 'Target Champions Only' as a toggle\" option might be enabled for you. You can find it at the bottom of the _Game_ options menu under the _Gameplay_ group. This new option makes it so that the already existing \"Target Champions Only\" keybinding is treated as a toggle instead of a press-and-hold. By default, \"Target Champions Only\" is bound to the backtick/tilde key (`, ~) but can be rebound in the keybindings menu.\n\nHope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2018-05-25T23:13:07.188+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Something to pass up to the UI guys: There needs to be something on screen that you can see that tells you whether or not you have \"Target Champions Only\" toggled on or off.\n\nIt can be really confusing when you suddenly can't target minions because you had a typing mistake or you fatfingered the key.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotAaronMike","date":"2018-05-26T17:44:34.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yousosmart,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=LwliQjJq,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-05-25T23:13:07.188+0000)\n>\n> Something to pass up to the UI guys: There needs to be something on screen that you can see that tells you whether or not you have &quot;Target Champions Only&quot; toggled on or off.\n> \n> It can be really confusing when you suddenly can&#x27;t target minions because you had a typing mistake or you fatfingered the key.\n\nThere's a glow around the cursor now to indicate the TCO state.
