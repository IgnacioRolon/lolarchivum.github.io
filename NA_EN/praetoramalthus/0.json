There IS a Background Sound, yet it is a monotone melody, whereas his english (and all other) VO&acute;s have the Chorus in the Background, which kinda screws his german VO ALOT, at least for me. So an answer of a red would be nice, if this is intended OR  a bug and when it could be fixed, if it would be fixable at all.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-23T17:25:18.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Jhindamere! \n\nThanks for bringing this up.

Like, \"Kunst ist die Schmerzen wert\" ( german Version for \"Art is worth the pain\" and play the Chorus of that english Versions Chorus for it?","replies":[]}]}]}
