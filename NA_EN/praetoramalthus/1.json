Like the current one, demon-like with green-ish effects? or more in the underworld direction? I hope they keep him in the current thematic that he guards the gates to the afterlife and makes sure what dies stays there, basically opening up a lot of taunt for shadow isles champs. I hope for everything, new effects animations a big new vo not the current 3 Minute stuff. Anything you hope for? why not make a discussion out of this?","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-12-26T22:30:23.314+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's going to be lit fam ;)","replies":[{"poster":"PraetorAmalthus","date":"2016-12-26T22:35:27.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Reav3,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=jhNEAeEy,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-26T22:30:23.314+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s going to be lit fam ;)\n\nSounds like you are pretty far with him already O.O","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-12-26T22:40:57.708+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that team has been working on Galio since Yorick shipped.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-12-26T23:17:24.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From one gothic champion to another.
