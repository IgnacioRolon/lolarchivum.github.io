At all. Its happened about 3 times now and I keep getting time bans for 20 minutes and my internet connection is not the issue. After the initial game, I connect to other games fine but I have to wait 20 minutes to play now and its not my fault. Has someone had this problem before?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-30T19:29:41.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really strange that this is only happening for one game, but it does sound like a network issue failing to reach the game servers.  Even though your internet can connect to the game sometimes doesn't mean that it's not the cause of the problem.  I recommend going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide thoroughly to make sure your network is configured for a solid connection to the game.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
