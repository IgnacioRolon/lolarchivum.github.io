Basically you Q up, and you hit accept the first time, if someone doesn't accept, for the SECOND Q that pops the accept button is greyed out and you can't click it, resulting in you \"leaving\" the Q. Just wondering if this is being addressed and happening to multiple people.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-21T21:55:51.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like an unstable connection that's causing you to lose sync, so there's a delay in hitting accept.  Continuously missing queue or dodging can both result in lower priority queues for a match.  I suggest starting with our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot any possibilities with your network.

This is an issue we've seen a steady climb of reports of, so we've been looking into further.  So far, troubleshooting connection issues has been able to fix the issue for some players.  Otherwise, try the legacy client and let me know if the issue exists there.  \n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nLet me know!","replies":[{"poster":"saMuxTV","date":"2017-02-23T15:34:57.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will try using the Legacy client today, I noticed there was an update, maybe it fixed the issue?
