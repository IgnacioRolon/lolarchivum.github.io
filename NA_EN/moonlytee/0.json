However, due to player X intending on playing Irelia, they took it as though I was intentionally being mean and the convinced all of the enemy team, and the others of my &quot;team&quot; to &quot;allegedly report&quot; me.  I explained to them my reasoning for banning Irelia, and that I did not want to encounter Irelia in-game.  Whether enemy or ally.\r\n\r\nI should&#039;ve just ignored them, but I feel violated, in the sense that players believe that if a majority of them report me─ whether fact or fraud, that I will receive a ban based on majority vote. \r\n\r\nHowever; my assigned roll was &quot;Jungle&quot; as when I queued for the game, I selected; &quot;Jungle&quot; and &quot;Top&quot; sure enough, when I loaded into the champion select client, &quot;Jungle&quot; was clearly assigned to me.  I went through the process of banning a champion I felt uncomfortable possibly having to play against─ or god forbid, with.  \r\n\r\nThat&#039;s when the player whom was assigned top, decided to pick up smite and counter Jungle me, which put me in a very bad spot, harassed me throughout the duration of the game.  I understand yes, it&#039;s draft(normal) they can play what they want, I even assured them that was the case.  However, I did not want to even give the opportunity to the enemy team to choose Irelia, especially knowing nothing about her new kit and power-level.  I did the responsible thing. \r\n\r\nIf there are any support, veteran players (MVP status) that can discuss this with me, I am quite bothered. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2018-04-04T13:22:40.989+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thing is, most of the community view it as a really uncool thing to ban the champ they are intending to pick, fine if the enemy team did it but you as a player is not supposed to ban that champ regardless of reason as long as your team intends to pick it.\n\nIt's just not a cool thing to do and its one of the most common trolling methods to piss people off, even if you had a hundred mouths you could not explain it in a way that would let the general lol player agree with you i think x)\n\nAfter all, who wouldnt be pissed to have their champ banned?

Not only am i a veteran player but i am also a player that's been in your shoes right now! Mine came from ~when maokai rework happened, however. I understand how frustrating this can be and how little you can see yourself as being able to win towards the end of the game when you're almost four thousand gold behind and the \"top\" laner you had is currently full build and still taking camps! Just remember to keep cool inside AND outside of game as sometimes, which i'm most concerned about, people take their aggression out on others because of one loss after another. Unfortunately if you harassed them back, as the IFS (instant feedback system), would hit you with a restriction of some kind on your account. Good news! 9 reports = 1 report. Extra reports do nothing except cloud up the system and lets them off for one extra game before they get hit with their restriction. Make sure you continue to report people like that top laner you had in the game. They can't ask for reports without being hit with a punishment, harassment in this case, by ruining your in game experience. Hope it helps!
