Probably, because she lives there. But can she understand someone from Shurima, or Targon, or Ixtal, or even the Freljord?

Like how IRL French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Romanian derive from Latin, while conversely, Korean is considered a language isolate.\n\nOne thing that's kind of neat with IRL languages is something called minimal pairs, which can make learning certain languages trickier depending on which one you're starting with, like how \"lock\" and \"rock\" are easily recognized as different by someone who speaks English, they sound the same to someone who's native language lacks one of those consonant sounds, Japanese for example has no R sound so it's much harder to distinguish which one someone is saying, or going from English to Polish, trying to distinguish \"S\" sounds from \"Z\" sounds is something I'm finding very difficult as an English speaker.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2019-08-15T07:10:00.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man, i read that post SO carefully, looking for slightest (new) clue about Sona... i was disappointed...! and the journey continues! :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"nosafterburn","date":"2019-08-13T14:55:21.438+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"okay. \n1.
