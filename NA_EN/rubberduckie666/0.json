Seriously though, Resistance is such an ugly skin. It's just a cheap and underhanded move by Rito honestly. They saw how popular the other 2 choices were and went, \"Oh shit, we might actually have to design a good skin for this champion. Let's quickly make up some fake numbers.\"\n\nThematically it's just bleggh. Seriously man space mutha chuckin tentacles!!!! Giant slappy plants! How is that not cool??? A recolored tentacle is cooler than those two???\n\nEdit: Also found this little gem from the League subreddit for people doing a community poll. Guess what tho? Battlecast wasn't popular!
