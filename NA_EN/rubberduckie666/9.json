So to compensate the Vayne well go top to avoid the matchup entirely and outscale Caitlyn in the late game.\n\nThough this strat is now not used because Riot buffed top towers too be more tanky to avoid these boring passive LCS games.

It is his 1 OP skill and only works on Towers and not on Inhibs so I don't think it's worth nerfing without giving him a major buff elsewhere or else he's likely to not be picked hardly ever then.\nE is a nice slow but only if you get them to hit and too many champs have rolls, dashes, and charges that cancel them out, the ones QQing over it are the ones who don't have that.\nR is a nice ult, but has already had it's range reduced once before and it's not any more powerful than Lux's or EZ's long single line ult and yet it still got nerfed a few patches ago with how it only does max dmg if they are in the center so just moving 2 steps nullifies over half the dmg. If anything I'd call for a slightly large AOE and a 3 ring circle, Center being max dmg, middle for 2/3rd, and outer for 1/2 dmg. Since so many have dashes, like Yasuo, Jax, Zed, and Fiora who can exit it entirely as well as Flash, then maybe it's a nice idea to make it more of a good hit. Or lower the CD on it to give him more chances to hit since many of the other champs are getting where the CDs at 40% CDR on their ults are only about 25-35 seconds. \n\nI do like the idea of Armor/MR on towers and letting penetration work as you already DO have some of that on them already without the pen working.  And as far as him in bot lane being overbearing, it's only cause bot lane ADC/Support combos are use to fighting other ADC/Support combos, changing out for a mage/Support combo is giving them issues cause of his Q range, other mages are at a shorter range anyway usually or should be the more annoying ones that AREN'T getting mentioned that can CC and attack an ADC outside their range, like Ryze, Cass, or Syndra. However with his lack of healing and his already squishiness they shouldn't have a problem with him, it's just they are dealing with more AOE abilities and not knowing that they need to dodge until his mana is gone and then dive on him. His minion clearing shouldn't be any more than a Jinx clearing with Rockets or a Tris clearing with her E's? passive that explodes minions she kills with AA. His CD and mana consumption on his Q make it where if he uses it constantly to minion clear and push, he's opening himself to be oom when he gets up to tower and they can dive on him easily. \n\nI've said this is some other posts about Ziggs, I personally think he needs a bit of a buff in the self healing department as he's getting beat out by Ahri, Akali, and Ryze as well as others, in that area who have scaling healing/shields in their abilities in addition to what items can give them. Also many seem to have higher mana regen or lower spell costs as I've seen them throwing spells as often as I am on Ziggs and they are at nearly full when I'm below 50%. This forces me to build specific items to compensate for that that usually get me fussed at by my team for what i'm building, Hextech Gunblade especially as it's the best healing I can get, only other option is Rod Of Ages which only heals on spell USE for a max of 25 per spell. HGB will still give 5% of the aoe dmg, and 15% on the single target dmg. It works but requires a high gold cost when compared to how an ADC can grab a Vamp Scepter early and get the full 10% Life Steal to heal and focus on their dmg and crit items before building it into BoRK, BT, HGB, or Ravenous (if melee) to get the same or a bit more LS. With his lack of Hard CC and Self healing all he has is his ranged dmg and his W hexplode on towers to make him a champ people will pick, many are still preferring Ahri, Lux, or Syndra in mid most commonly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raxistaicho","date":"2017-01-01T22:40:10.533+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wouldn't putting MR on towers make it harder for mages to take them?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-01-01T16:02:35.702+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"As long as ziggs doesn't push all other bot lane options out of viability (which strikes me as very unlikely), riot is unlikely to do anything over it, as they like seeing creative champion uses.

One of the things that every other map position has is multiple roles. So if say dps mages are played bot over marksmen exclusively it will show either they are too strong or marksmen are too weak. As it stands no one can draw a consensus on if marksmen are strong or not because they have nothing to compare too. They are the only class that can play a duo lane and not be crippled and they are the only class that reliably siege a turret at range. So even if marksmen are weak you will have to use one. And if they are strong its hard to tell if its from team assistance or if they are just over tuned. Also bot just needs a bigger champ pool. Only playing marksmen is one thing but you can't even play most of them in any one meta. Top and Mid can play almost half of the cast without going down more than 3-4 tiers.","replies":[]}]}
