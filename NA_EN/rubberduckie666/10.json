Passive: Gangplank gains bonus attack damage and bonus movement speed.\r\nACTIVE:Gangplank fires into the air, disabling Raise Morale&#039;s passive bonuses but inspiring himself to gain additional bonus attack damage and bonus movement speed for 7 seconds, reduced to 50% for allied champions in range.\r\n\r\ni personally loved this ability simply for what it could help a team do and the fact it was basicly what made support gangplank work.\r\n\r\n2._**{{champion:82}} pre rework Q**_, mace of spades. ACTIVE: Mordekaiser&#039;s next basic attack gains range and is modified to deal magic damage, applying spell effects, which either bounces to up to 3 additional enemies or is increased by 65% if no other enemies are nearby.\r\n\r\ni think the idea of hitting a enemy so hard that even the people near them feel the pain is amazeing and you could say &quot;well duckie, the hydras do that for everyone&quot; but the thing is the hydras dont have nearly have the weight and impact something like that should have.\r\n\r\n3.**{{champion:37}}&#039;s pre update auras_** (i couldnt find the old descriptions for how the aura worked)\r\n\r\nbut i found that the old auras fit her better gameplay and theme wise than the current ones and as a result she has suffered.\r\n\r\n4.**_{{champion:40}}&#039;s old splash_** i dont mean to bash the artist but i liked the old splash much better, its warm colour palet gave a good impression and said &quot;hey im a good person, im going to protect and help you&quot; while the new ones gives her a cold, calculating look.\r\n**old** http://www.eclypsia.com/public/upload/cke/LoL%20-%20Splash/Portraits%20-%202013-07/JannaSquare.png\r\n**new/current** https://omgitsnexusnews.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/3db61-janna_square_0.png?w=474\r\n5.**_goofy/less serious things_** i love the new lore thats showing up, its fantastic and {{champion:33}}&#039;s lore is one of the most silly things to have been writen in leauge and thats a good thing.\r\na serious story is also a good thing to have but i want to have more goofy and funny character like (like pre-rework {{champion:41}} and{{champion:201}}  ) when you take game too seriously it can sorta ruin the mood so lets have some characters give us a big ol smile.\r\n\r\nBONUS THING \r\n6.**_GREEN WARDS and TRINKET UPGRADES_** i know people in low elo dint really ward much or upgrade their trinkets but outright taking them out of the game was not the way to deal with the issues and as a result more issues have shown up peticularly late game when you cant buy a pink ward without selling one of your items.\r\n\r\n(also i want solo que as much as the next guy but we know how riot is so the most we can do is protest by just not playing ranked)\r\n\r\nTLDR: i want pre-rework {{champion:41}} E, pre-rework {{champion:82}} Q, {{champion:37}}&#039;s old auras, {{champion:40}}&#039;s old spalsh, the game to be taken a tad less seriously (more goofy champions and such),\r\nand green wards and trinket upgrades","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Time Wizard","date":"2016-06-09T23:57:00.187+0000","up_votes":85,"down_votes":3,"body":"1.

This is what it used to do: Blocks 40 / 75 / 110 / 145 / 180 damage from all non-turret sources.\n\nSo, if his W rank said he blocked 40 damage, and your auto attack did 39 damage to him, he would completely absorb it -- and instead of being left with 1 more damage to block, like a shield would, it remained at the 40 damage threshold for the duration.

Even her original background was better than the generic \"resort to violence\" remake. When her story depicted her talking down a Noxian commander into releasing civilian captives, I imagined her using the \"Empty Fort Strategy\" like a wise and composed bad ass, without needing to pick up a fan to cut a bitch. Now, she's just been replaced by a young teenager who dissed her elders and shot someone in the head. Playstyle-wise, now she's more of a generic AP mage with shields.\n\n\n* **Clairvoyance:** I always used this spell regularly, to prevent ganks and secure kills. It was better than the blue trinket (then and now), and it was a spell that required insightful gameplay, rather than just spamming Flashes, Heals, and Ignites in those \"Oh shit!\" moments. Sadly, it seemed that Riot just wanted to make vision control even more of a bitch in Season 6 than in previous seasons, since they also removed green wards. Speaking of which...\n\n\n* **Green Wards:** When wards were limited to only 3 per map per player, only players who regularly warded were severed punished, while the selfish and reckless players who didn't even bother to ward hardly felt any impact to themselves. The introduction of vision trinkets was nice, but they were never intended to replace real wards, but to just supplement them. Now you get every lazy AD melee assassin player claiming to be \"warding the map\" even though the trinkets simply were not cutting it as the real deal. Now, with the removal of green wards, any gold advantage by teams is converted almost exclusively into building power items, rather than the green wards which would be of benefit for the whole team; it becomes less of a game of intel and strategy and more into an arms race.\n\n\n* **Pre-reworked Quinn: ** I used her as my main ADC champ before the rework. During that time, I could reliably do my job as the team's damage dealer. Sure, her Harrier passive wasn't as consistent as it is now, but then her Blinding Assault would actually blind! It was invaluable against snowballing autoattacking champs, and it was a better disengage ability than its reworked vision (nearsightedness would not stop a melee attacker from following and chasing your ass down). Tag Team was also a much more meaningful and useful ultimate than Behind the Lines. Wow, improved out-of-combat movement? Couldn't I have just taken Mobility boots? Hell, I might have even tried a Righteous Glory or Youmuu's if I'm that hard up on movement. With Tag Team, I could rush into team fights, blind my target, implement my AS buff, and finish off with Skystrike. I wouldn't be forced to compete with the team's assassins since I could act as a pseudo-assassin if need be. Now with this new reworked Quinn, God forbid I end up with a rogue support, otherwise I'll end up becoming irrelevent when that assassin decides to keep taking my kills.\n\n\n* **Stark's Fervor:** Yeah, this is an old item that I used to always get when playing Ashe back in the day... Now I admit, this was a pretty OP item then, and I'm surprised I didn't see it more often on any AD carries. It had a Unique Aura to the user and nearby allied champions that granted +20% attack speed, +30 health regeneration, and +20% life steal! Additionally, it also had an aura of armor reduction (-20) on nearby enemy champions. On top of that, the wearer also had an additional +20% AS on top of its aura's effects. And all this only cost 2145 gold! It has seen been changed to Zeke's Herald (a less awesome but much more balanced item), which in turn was removed from the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2016-06-09T19:45:47.481+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"season 2","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malfini","date":"2016-06-10T00:27:48.937+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Championship {{champion:92}} \n{{champion:114}} 's original ultimate\n{{champion:10}} 's original abilities\n{{champion:91}} 's silencing ability\nCottontail {{champion:17}}'s old splash art\n\nRiot... are you serious on replacing cottontail {{champion:17}} 's splash art?

Tanks, bruisers, supports. everyone.\n\n**5:** Sense of discovery, How there were random, but good scalings on certain champs along with random buffs given to abilities. How their role can change based on their build and play-style. Now everyone is in a black and white role and must stay or they will be shot dead with nerfs.\n\n\n**6:** Bonus. Revert back to 2014 balance state.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Lexer","date":"2016-06-10T14:57:09.518+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3361}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"OtakuBurrito","date":"2016-06-10T10:58:55.383+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old Karma\nOld Soraka\nOld Sona \nOld Janna\nSeason 2","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaygo41","date":"2016-06-10T06:45:12.147+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

The new Tracker's Knife is alright, but honestly it doesn't help you counterjungle that much. Not like Poacher's did.\n\nI don't like the new timers on blue and red for the same reason. If I take an enemy camp, I should be rewarded with information.\n\nI miss the version of Aegis of the Legion that had armor on it. As a support, it's pretty hard to itemize with what tools you have, and you need excellent slot efficiency in order to put up with two items that aren't slot efficient at all (SS and gold item). Having armor and MR on a single item helped with that a great deal, and now I find myself buying Zz'rot on supports.\n\nChampion announcer packs! We got one for GP during the Bilgewater Event. I want that to be something I can purchase in the store. I don't want to listen to the same announcer every game. What about Hecarim talking about the Rift as if it were one giant war, or Veigar exclaiming that the enemy has \"fallen right into your trap!\"\n\nAnd I also miss the lightning sword animation on Steel Legion Garen's ultimate (it was the reason I bought the skin, and then a few months later they gave him a VGU and now it's just a blue sword instead of a yellow one.
