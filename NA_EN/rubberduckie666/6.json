(his damage falls off the face of the earth if he cant do a rotation so max cdr is a must on any build).\r\nhis skills are also fairly telegraphed while his engage takes a LONG time to go from sylas to his target. \r\n\r\nrealistically sylas going a full ap build will be niche lane build or his only jungle build  as getting his full rotation off takes too long to get off. within that timeframe he could be bursted down before even killing one person if he even manages to get his e off without being killed before getting there.","replies":[{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2019-01-11T18:16:17.722+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"But like, do you really think the boards will ever chill?
