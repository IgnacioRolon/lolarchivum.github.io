Sadly the issue still persists, loading screen is dark, not showing the enemy team, and there are no borders etc. You are correct that alt tabing will indeed put everything right as rain when in game. Please let me know what I can do to help troubleshoot so we can resolve it together and hopefully help others in the process.\n{{champion:84}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-15T18:09:38.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info friends!
