I&#039;m not looking to justify mistakes that I&#039;ve made. However logically if a lot of it was due to the fact my account has thousands of games played and people would troll hard in ranked solely because they didn&#039;t get a role they wanted.  This new queue system now tremendously helps reduce that scenario.  \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been permabanned for about 4-5 months now and I would like the opportunity to have my account back since they actually made an important change that helps reduce the insane amount of trolling going on . It seems crazy to me that riot thinks I&#039;m not able to reform, I was not the type of person to join a match with malice in mind, I just had trouble controlling my emotions if I&#039;m being verbally abused AND trolled in the game. I was doing my best to improve and just ignore people but it didn&#039;t happen fast enough for riot.\r\n\r\nAt the very least is there a way for me to see the proportion of games I have played to total instances of bad behavior... I probably had 8k games played everything combined?","replies":[]}
