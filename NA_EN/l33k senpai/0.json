Well, about 2600 units a second, assuming Vi ults you from her max cast range and you start running away at the exact same moment. That '6' in there's a pretty important number by the way, turn that into a 5 instead and you'll only be running at 2500 units a second.

I remember back when Vi's devlog was released that \"1.25 seconds of guaranteed CC (from 800-1200 units away while also putting her right next to your carry, better hope they have Flash)\" was meant to be her niche, but why is that considered a healthy or worthwhile niche? Why does she have a 100% guaranteed long-range gap-closer with CC tied to it when she already has a method of getting to who she wants to punch via a cool wind-up haymaker that her opponents can actually respond to and strategize against, instead of something that can further reward her for getting up-close and personal (since her Q isn't really the best in melee since you want to get that full charge-up)?\n\nAlso, why is her defense mechanism a fairly high (at lower levels) cooldown shield instead of something weaker but more consistent, considering that her W makes her want to stick to fights for longer periods of time due to the constant armor break/attackspeed/bonus damage? I loved the hell out of her when she was first released, but over time all these things started to bug the hell of out of me and now she's pretty much unplayable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fantomex XIII","date":"2015-05-27T05:05:19.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BnJmpj6E,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-27T04:06:20.444+0000)\n>\n> So, this made me curious, so I did a quick bit of experimentation. \n> \n> First thing you need to know is that it is indeed possible to break Vi's ult by getting far enough away.

The 20 percent that it drops down to is JUST short.
