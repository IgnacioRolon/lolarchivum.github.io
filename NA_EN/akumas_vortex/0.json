That argument can \"make the person\" do that, \"make\" as in the cause, the cause being what has that responsibility for the result.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2018-07-31T14:10:53.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's just the thing though: Logically speaking it **is** the cause.
