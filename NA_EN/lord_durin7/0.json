Decided I'd do another, because the sooner I get my placements, the better.\nSo I get into Champion Select and am liking what I see. A lot of great bans, a seemingly cooperative and calm team, and the position I know and love the most. I'm the second-to-last pick of the game, and I get the champion my ADC wanted me to play, (I was support) {{champion:412}} Thresh. Now, I had {{summoner:3}} Exhaust since just last game I was playing {{champion:53}} Blitz. Now, though I take {{summoner:3}} Exhaust with Blitz, I take {{summoner:14}} Ignite with {{champion:412}} Thresh, so I went to switch my mastery. I did so, and the time had run out just then, as my ADC took a while to tell me who he wanted me to play. After I did, I got returned to the party assembly screen with a note in the corner saying I dodged the game.\n\nNow, how was I supposed to know that if I didn't lock in it counts as a dodge? It doesn't work like that in Normal, or any gamemode I had ever played.\nAfter that, of course, I felt frustrated, that's extremely annoying, and I get a five minute dodge timer to boot. So I went up on this website to see what Riot says about it. Come to find that not only did I dodge the queue and receive a penalty, but that game also counts as a loss on my Placements (Could only be Promos, not too sure).\n\nI don't recall ever being told that not locking in would result in a penalty, so that just frustrates me even more. I feel that if I had been told first I could say \"Oh shoot! I didn't lock in in time\" and shake it off or avoid it entirely. Five minutes isn't too long. I would be angry about the automatic loss, sure, but I was told, so it's entirely my fault.\n\nBut with it like this... It's just not something I can shake off. I'd like this to be added, and it doesn't seem like something hard to do, just add a pop-up before your first Ranked game that says \"Hey! You need to lock in your Champion in Champ Select, otherwise it counts as a dodge AND a loss in your promos.\" Put in whatever else you feel the player needs to know for Ranked too. Make it something educational on how you want people playing in Ranked.\n\nThanks for reading, I hope this gets added so other new players to Ranked don't share my fate.\n\nP.S.\nHopefully I didn't post this in the wrong section. I've never really understood these forums and their sorting. {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-08-04T04:32:34.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I don't recall ever being told that not locking in would result in a penalty, so that just frustrates me even more.\n\nWell, maybe you don't recall, but there IS a tooltip mentioning it the first time. With a little checkbox \"never show this tip again\", that you probably checked, but it does exist.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-04T00:23:07.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Essentailly, if someone doesn't lock in their champion it could force them into playing that champion for the match when they may not know them whatsoever. Also, if someone were actually AFK and it let them proceed into the match without locking it, bots might be much more rampant as people could just consistently queue up and never play a part in the lobby or match. Our [**Queue Dodging FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844) does mention that if you don't lock in it will be counted as a dodge.","replies":[]},{"poster":"toxicismymantra","date":"2017-08-03T04:34:38.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, that's how normal mode works too, blind and draft pick. If you don't lock in your champion you can't actually play the game. When Riot changed how draft mode worked they made it very clear that failing to lock in any step, be it bans or champ select, will result in a dodge. If you're new enough to league that you weren't around before the change, then just take it as a lesson for the future to make sure you lock things in. Typically you should change your masteries around after you lock your champ in anyways. Don't be too upset either, the league you actually get placed into doesn't take into account your win/loss rate as much as it does your mmr.\n\nMmr, or match-making-rating, is a hidden stat attached to your account that determines who you get matched up against. There are some sites like na.op.gg that allow you to generally gauge what your mmr is, but theres no way to know 100%. Anyways, winning a game will bring your mmr up, losing will bring it down, winning against an enemy team with a higher mmr than your team will give more gains than losing will, and vice versa. At the end of your placement matches, whatever your mmr is, it will most likely place you a few devisions below that. So if you are playing against mostly mid-low silver players by the end of your placements, you will be likely placed low silver or high bronze. Again, sites like na.op.gg have features that tell you the rank and mmr of the players in your games, so you can have a pretty good idea as to where you will be placed.\n\nHope this all makes sense. Really I'm just trying to say don't worry too much about a dodge counting as a loss, since placements aren't gonna be based on win/loss ratio. Glhf in the rest of your placements!","replies":[]}]}
