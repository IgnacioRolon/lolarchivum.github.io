Was last pick on my team, bans had gone through and my \"declared pick\" was chosen by the other team. I didn't change my pick as I wanted to see what the other team chose, but the other teams last pick just sits on 0s. I could access masteries and runes, but couldn't pick a champion as it was still showing the other team picking. After maybe 30/40 seconds of this I get kicked back to the lobby with a 6 minute timeout. Felt pretty miffed as there was nothing I could do. Anyone else have this issue with these conditions?\n\nCurrent patch, with no mods or anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-09T22:56:30.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your connection to the lobby was interrupted or timed out for some reason since the timer ticked all the way down and then just froze.
