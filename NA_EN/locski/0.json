I even called him out at 8 minutes for being toxic and ruining the match for everyone, saying how can anyone play well when their team is talking to them like this? What is going on with this report system or is it some sort of auto ban bot?","replies":[{"poster":"JustA kleo","date":"2020-02-11T23:26:57.207+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh boy so much wrong here...\n\n\"called him out\" theres alrdy the rulebreak of yours.\n\"defending my teammates\" yes daddy please protect me from this stranger i never met and never will meet again &lt;3 be my knight in a shiny armor &lt;3. just tell them to mute.\nyou clearly realized you got punished for this exact same behavior TWICE and now you wonder that you get punished again for doing something AGAIN that you know is a rulebreak? wat.\n\nand last but not least... send your chatlogs. im pretty sure they arent as innocent as you make it sound","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2020-02-12T02:20:10.328+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is an automated bot, but the system has the capabilities to review the game that you get reported in. \n\nI hope when you mean defending others you don't mean you are counter-flaming the toxic person. Counter attack is still an attack, so that is still considered toxic and will still get you punished. \n\nThere is also no need to ask for reports or counter reports. 1 report does the same thing as 9 reports. All a report does is to flag the system to review the game. The toxicity score returned from the review will be the same regardless of how many times a player was reported within the same game. It is also possible for the system to return a toxicity score of 0 if there was no toxicity found within the game. \n\nUnderstand that there really isn't a need to defend others. If people want to falsely report someone, let them report all they want. The system will throw the report away when it reviews the game and finds that the reported person has no toxicity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2020-02-11T23:42:39.063+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post logs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-02-12T03:56:16.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think you already understand the situation.
