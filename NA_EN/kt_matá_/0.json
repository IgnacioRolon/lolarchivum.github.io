Statement of your defined elo / proof for the skeptical people here, and statement of why you deem yourself worthy to be sole shotcaller. Many people find moments to challenge calls, as collectively an idea may sound better than yours. I write this not to challenge you or call you out, but to allow you to elaborate on why / true benefits you can offer to better the future team. It helps to understand the leader of a group, before finding out the indepth quirks that make yourself up. If you were a challenger level player who specializes in coaching game knowledge, and promoting individual skill, that informs us that your leadership / group management skills can band a group together. You are a diamond level player according to your icon highlight so that informs me specifically that you indeed have proven worthy to oversee the development of a group, but voice YOUR skill out there; let us know we can trust you. Also I do meet the requirements above, as of now I am Gold 5, but sadly I don't think i would last long as being 16 along with time zones I may not be able to fully commit to the team throughout weekdays; weekends yes. Missing multiple practices would probably be due to my timing, and assignments due. In the event I can still be accepted as a substitute player, and my schedule could fit in possibly as a substitute, or official (next year - open schedule) here is my information\n\nRank - Gold 5\nRole - Mid / Bot \nChamps - Ahri Jinx Janna Nami ( I don't know how many you require so I listed champs I sustain a 60% wr solo)\nWhy do you want to join - This ties into the third reason I am replying. I am an editor who edits League, and Cod, but predominantly league. I did figure you would want someone to handle editing of highlight / clips of team/members. Whilst I am still newer and learning to the editing field it would help to practice with a group. I do want to join the team as a member, but I know scheduling could prove to not work. \nWeekdays 3:30 to 8 are times I could commit on maximum if I have no major workload. \nWeekends for everyone here are all based on fate. \n\nIn the event I am still denied though i'd at least like to be to follow and see development of team. It seems like an interesting setup\nI have most chat services, only ones I can think I lack is teamspeak on this computer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Loony Russian ","date":"2016-10-31T19:37:32.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before Applying I would like more specificity on the expected practice days and times.
