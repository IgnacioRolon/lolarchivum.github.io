So i created a new account on euw to prove to the league community that i am no longer performing any negative behavior towards others, and achieving a level 5 honor on the new account. Therefore I just wanted to ask if there was any chance of me getting my account back on eune because I had a lot of purchases done there and would not like my account to go to dust.\n\nI am open to negotiate with anyone, \n\nIf you could please let me know what I can do regarding this case.\n\nAlthough if you see me commenting in an aggressive way please do not take me as that kind of person it is just the way i talk which is too serious.\n\nand thank you in advance.

Players who come back after a 14 day ban and do not reform, statistically have a very low (well less than 5%) chance of reforming.

Time starts to fly now, but not in months when you dont have a back up account or anything to do, which is enough room to learn your mistake, Although not everyone is always winning games, eventually you will lose no matter how many winning streaks you had, which is why the month suspensions will be a good time to reform someone.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-06-14T21:16:41.124+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be completely honest with you, I know multiple people who've been playing since before season 1 and have never even gotten a chat restriction.\n\nIt is **not** in human nature to make others feel like shit.
