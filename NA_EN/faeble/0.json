I always take the little tests/training-games for it online, and they are always around the same, sometimes spiking and beating my record. I can&#039;t pin-point click a minion by dragging the mouse across the screen and stopping right at the minion. I always go too far or too short of it and have to adjust to click it. I&#039;m not amazing. But I know how the game should be played at least in the Plat level, and my mechanics would be Gold-level I&#039;d say. \r\n\r\nBut now.... I don&#039;t feel like I can improve anymore. I feel like the improvement curve for the game has stopped and I always play the same game every game. I play the same I have played 300 games ago and nothing changed. The point of this is, I don&#039;t even know IF it&#039;s even POSSIBLE to get better anymore for me. It seems like no matter what different mindset I have, no matter what I focus on improving, I see no improvement. In fact, instead of climbing the ladder to reach Plat, I have plummeted down into silver and got demoted from Gold 3 to Silver 2 (almost 3 now) within a month or so. I know I&#039;m not diamond material. But is it even possible for EVERYONE to be able to learn this game to that level? I have played this game since end of season 3 and am a gold player. But someone else is Master. I just... I don&#039;t know. I&#039;m lost.","replies":[{"poster":"OneMustFall","date":"2016-09-14T00:05:16.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHgvbs2NtE","replies":[]},{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2016-09-13T23:52:29.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"focus on decision making and fast thinking to get out of bad situations","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-13T23:50:56.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mechanics and skill are really not the core of the game at low/mid ELO. Good decision-making, teamwork and choosing the right champion has a much bigger impact at a point where people still regularly make mistakes you can take advantage of. Are you already playing with a premade group and a roster of champions that can fill every required role and matchup?","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-14T00:11:34.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"of course there is , its called GET GUD !! \nlol fuk me if i know i mash buttons \n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
