Not good enough to take in ranked, not bad enough to drop entirely.\n\nYou've got good poke with Q and W, peel with W/E, and an ult that scales with enemy missing hp -- works no matter how little gold you have.","replies":[{"poster":"Sinlaire","date":"2016-06-26T05:16:06.233+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"My brother and i get bored and run a Draven Jinx bot lane every now and then for fun.\n\nworks really well because enemies dont know which adc to focus and no matter who gets jump we can peel and do damage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ALthaGreat","date":"2016-06-25T16:11:32.699+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"so this means that...jinx is a good support....until it's time to win the game.

This way the Jinx can preserve their KDA despite how well the team does.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cookimonster316","date":"2016-06-25T16:53:39.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it takes averages and Im guessing the average scores for support jinx are pretty low so it doesn't take much","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2016-06-26T00:07:00.768+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://media.giphy.com/media/wAt7yLLY0XdRe/giphy.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"warmcorntortilla","date":"2016-06-25T16:55:46.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"had a game in ranked with 4 ppl on my team getting an S and still no win... feelsbadman","replies":[]},{"poster":"WacingTheFind","date":"2016-06-25T10:13:45.766+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you get an S+*","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2016-06-25T16:31:12.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"done that 4 times.","replies":[{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2016-06-25T23:28:28.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watchout guys\n\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DK3UQwP7DKQ/Tw4pqZBilQI/AAAAAAAAAm0/tCgFmiUgDRs/s1600/neil-degrasse-tyson-badass-gif.gif\n\njk jk","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spôôked","date":"2016-06-26T07:08:31.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And then you get an A for carrying and doing the best on the winning team","replies":[{"poster":"Morthel","date":"2016-06-27T02:31:14.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And the one person that does get an S on your team is like 12/10/4.
