That's how it gets noticed :3\n\nI'm glad this wasn't already made a few years ago, solely because the art and design of the last year has gone up amazingly, don't you agree? There's been a lot of effort and it's because they've gotten new members, and the older members have gotten better. There's some pretty amazing fan art, but it's hard to find, but search it up, some of it is just ridiculous! On another note, the reason why I said I'm glad it wasn't made before is because, y'know, Molten Rammus skin isn't the prettiest creation, i'll say that now.\n\nBut seriously, It'd be a really amazing looking skin if they put a lot of effort into it, and I'm pretty sure that it would bought up by any anivia player, but maybe I'm wrong. After all, it'll be her first reverse skin, and those are almost always popular!\n\nBut yeah, 1350 RP skin or another legendary, but I'm kind of worried about suggesting it as a legendary, simply because there's already Blackfrost, but the thing is, Phoenix Anivia would have to be a high quality in-game skin and splash art, else they'd be dropping off 60% of the point of it in the trash. I'd really like to have her ultimate to have more of an actual solid feel with this skin, instead of her other skins where it's almost like a mesh, even if it isn't, maybe it could be a fire/ash storm from a volcano? There's a lot to think about, but maybe we could have some references in her jokes and such?\n\nThe neat thing with this is that it could be an ultimate skin, but it all depends on the amount of work that's decided to be put into it. Her abilities, especially her ultimate, could have more visual effects and solidity, so the ground could actually burn up or look more realistic compared to what her normal ultimate is, same with her other abilities, her Wall could become molten if we'd like it, or it could just be a burning fire across the ground, who knows? \n\nThere's a lot that could happen, suggest stuff, that's how things are made!\nAlso, with the possibility of the voice over, there could be additional special interactions between other members of the freljord and such.\n\nP.S. Thanks for the support so far, the thread is already pretty popular and it hasn't even been a day! Don't forget, I only put the details that I'd like in, so keep suggesting details in the comments, like what her voice should sound like, etc!\n","replies":[{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2015-01-11T05:05:29.925+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":31,"body":"Her skills do not match the theme of fire.
