We can kill two birds with one stone by changing the model of Blitzcranks hand during his hook, to improve the visuals and make it better represent the hitbox.\n\nSo instead of having a weird closed fist go next to champions, attach to them, then come back, the hand should be _open_ like on his splash art, like he is reaching out to grab you. Then once it catches someone it can change the model to be closed on the pull back.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/7nP6kJJ.png\n(sorry for bad photo job)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2017-12-06T21:50:33.863+0000","up_votes":234,"down_votes":6,"body":"Oh wow that looks really cool. :o","replies":[{"poster":"DianaIsMyWife","date":"2017-12-06T22:19:55.443+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot King Cobra,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UIzncmeN,comment-id=0016,timestamp=2017-12-06T21:50:33.863+0000)\n>\n> Oh wow that looks really cool. :o\n\nDo what the man Says Riot :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2017-12-06T21:55:19.622+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should take him top.

I can agree on the model, he really needs at least a VU. His kit isn't anti-fun. You play a minigame of \"can you dodge the hook this time?\" and if the answer is yes, then you go in **SINCE HE HAS NO INSTANT ESCAPES SO SLOWS INSTA KILL HIM.**\nThe hook doesn't need darius treatment, it already has a windup of blitz just standing there for a sec and an indicator of **THE HOOK ITSELF** \nHe has no mobility so it doesn't need a cooldown window, less you're talking about W, where he slows himself for a sec at the end of it. Ult doesn't need its free damage removed or there would be no need for static to be around his chest, removing the possibility of always knowing when he has ult.","replies":[{"poster":"ninjaroxas","date":"2017-12-06T12:13:38.745+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"Just dodge it\" until he lands one hook then you die","replies":[{"poster":"Faceroll Tactics","date":"2017-12-06T13:12:08.185+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"If his team is near you should die.
