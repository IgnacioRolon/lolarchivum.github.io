This means that if you click champs it takes a few seconds to load, and then clicking skins it takes a few seconds to load, and then clicking back to champs makes it load again. It should cache some information so you don&#039;t have to reload it every time you change tabs.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-09-03T00:46:14.982+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are absolutely right and we would like to improve that in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"CleverCactus","date":"2016-09-09T16:28:12.867+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
