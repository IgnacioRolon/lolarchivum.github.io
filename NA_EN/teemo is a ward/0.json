It's almost as if Yasuo's Windwall was blocking it. It only occurs if it is over the hitbox of Velkoz's W as the second rupture is happening. If done afterwards it works normally. Note: I was playing ARAM as Xerath when this occurred and am unsure if this is true on SR. I was able to reproduce the bug a couple of times to make sure I wasn't crazy or hitting a minion.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce: \r\n1. Log in\r\n2. Load up a match with Xerath and Velkoz on opposite teams\r\n3. After Velkoz uses his W. As Xerath cast your E before the second rupture occurs. Important to know the timing.\r\n\r\nSide Note:\r\nCan confirm this bug occurs with Brand's Q as well. I believe since they are of the same skillshot type it may be related. Not sure if all projectiles work that way with this bug or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-02-10T08:11:16.405+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This should be fixed for next patch, if not the one after. ;)","replies":[]}]}
