Do you mean player inflation? If so, how is that a bad thing?)\n\nSo let's look at what you mentioned.\n\nBalance Issues - There from the beginning and has gotten substantially less problematic. Do you really want to deal with old school Jax again? Or the absolutely ridiculous old-school Twich (wow he was so unbalanced back in season 1 it's a joke...)? From my experience, balancing has gotten WAY better than it has. With 100+ champions, and a plethora of items, balancing might not seem as easy as it looks, so try to understand and not make a ridiculous complaint. Riot is made of real people, and they aren't going to make perfect choices every time, but it's always much better than it is worse.\n\nServers - Actually I'm quite sure servers were worse back when they had very few to begin with and low server-load capacity. They are working on this issue right now, so don't complain and act like they are doing nothing.\n\nClient - Much better than it was before, way smoother pre-game U.I. and in-game it runs smooth too (aside from the occasional lag due to servers which is being worked on)\n\nAnything that's not Gameplay - What, like Runes? Runes were in here since Season 1, and they need an overhaul, but with all the huge number of demands you are putting on Riot, they have to take time to address everything, which they have been doing, so don't go complaining about things again have ridiculous expectations from Riot...\n\nThis game is far better than it was in Season 1, and almost every problem you mentioned was present and more than likely much worse back then than it is now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Heol","date":"2014-10-26T00:11:45.382+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I lost all 4 of my referrals to smurfs, every XXXXX one of them quit and I'm sick of it.\n> \n> You can't even keep your servers stable and you break champions with every patch, I don't know why anyone plays this game anymore.\n\nI run a learning community for players of all skill levels (I do free coaching), and lots of people who were in your friends shoes have found a wonderful home.

Honestly, I think people need to take a look at their own skill-level and play-style and see what They can do to personally help the team even more than they are doing (even if you are helping right now, could you help even more?)  You have to expect when you are coming into a team game, to try and put your best effort forward. You can't just try and get by with winning your lane, the game is much more than that.\nRemember the game isn't 1v5, and it isn't about who can play Master Yi and carry hardest, because when it comes down to it, you can't win a 5v5 game by yourself. A LARGE portion of the skill in this game is teamwork capability. Are you good at working with a team? Sure you might be a pro in-lane, but do you really make a difference to your team? Just because one of their team's players gets behind, that doesn't mean that the other 4 players on their team are tremendously good as well and could easily beat out the rest of your team. Survey your own contribution to your team and how much you can do, before you start complaining about bad teammates and other ridiculous things like that.\n\nOf course there are exceptions with Leavers and People who are *Intentionally* trying to feed and ruin the game. Just report those players, and move on.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rainlein","date":"2014-10-25T05:54:31.342+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smurf isn't everything though.

Sounds like your friends aren't competitive enough for this game.  Truly competitive players will look up the best ways to play so that they aren't playing blind, they will ask for help from their friends and try to improve until they're playing at an acceptable level.  Playing at a bronze level is **not** hard.  They simply didn't want to put in the effort.  Your referrals were empty attempts to appease you so they could say \"I tried it and didn't like it.\"\n\nI'm sorry you have friends that are afraid to tell you the truth.  When my friend asked me to play archaege I told him \"I dislike MMOs and don't want to try it.\"  I didn't waste my time *and* his on a game I knew I wouldn't enjoy.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2014-10-25T10:52:01.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because you had a good experience as a new player doesn't mean everybody else has.\n\nI leveled up 5 accounts on 5 different servers to level 30, and it was a terrible experience EVERY SINGLE TIME despite me being around Gold skill level (implying that means anything with all the elo boosting going around).\n\nThe first account i leveled up i actually quit after like 5 games(way back in Season 1) because i just feed every single game and was flamed for it. it's way worse now because the game is way more popular now.\n\nEvery single game is somebody getting 30+ kills and spamming on how bad you are.

That sucked. So much, in fact, that I stopped playing support and LoL altogether until S3 came around. Still a support main to this day, though.\n\nNow, the worst part about being new and dealing with learning all the ins and outs and itemization (had to figure out what the difference between ad and AP were by myself) was dealing with Smurfs. But not normal Smurfs. These Smurfs were the douchebags that insisted on playing hyper carries like Katarina and seeing how high they could get their kill count. Kind of hard to not feed when you don't  understand what's  killing you, and you're constantly chased down and tower dived\n\n. I've never quit a game in my entire stay with LoL, but when a kata is 45 kills up, it makes ya think: either give up, or figure out how to fight back. I learned. It was dreadful but I learned. And here I am. Not sure it was worth, tbh.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Marinaras Trench","date":"2014-11-19T23:00:13.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a new level 30 I can tell all of you who are complaining that this isn't that much of a problem. I laddered my way up to level 30 in about 3-4 months, and in that time I ran into very few smurfs. I don't see why this is a problem for a lot of you guys and if, lets say every 15-20 games you run into one, even if they are a diamond surf with teamwork you can still win. Just group and focus the other n00bies :) Get fed off of them and then cc the carry until they die. I agree this is a problem riot should fix, but it isn't as big of some of you are making it out to be. As someone who plays with level 10 friends a lot (on a smurf to make matchmaking fair, don't worry I play poorly on purpose lol) I can attest to the fact that there aren't that many smurfs out there, and the ones that do are usually very friendly!","replies":[]},{"poster":"meg4mushr00m","date":"2014-10-27T02:59:25.699+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smurfs are annoying, every ones in a while i get placed with lvl 7s that get pentas.
