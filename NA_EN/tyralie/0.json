He has to either CS with Q or hit champs with spells. Dodge his spells and don't let him free farm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dolce de leche","date":"2019-11-04T21:58:04.186+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao all infinite scaling champs give you the same kind of timer except maybe thresh. If you can’t end before like 45 minutes then yea you’re kinda screwed, but veigar and these other champs are total liabilities early. Veigar is so easy to bully for most mids. Conditional and delayed cc on one long cd ability, no mobility, no safety, and low range. You basically have to let veigar land his cage for him to do anything. He’s a pretty fair design. His scalings  also ain’t that hot due to his passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XzMln","date":"2019-11-05T03:46:18.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just had a game as Ryze vs Veigar where I built Mercury Treads, Abyssal mask and had seraphs and Rylais. I absolutely destroyed him in lane but come 30 minutes (which is way too early for Veigar to be that strong) he was able to one shot everyone on my team including me with just 2 his q ult. I think his ult, for the power it gains needs to be a skill shot and they need to remove or re-work his passive.","replies":[]}]}
