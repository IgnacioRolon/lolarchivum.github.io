Anyone know how to stop it?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. So recently one of my friend(in game nor irl) sent me a link describing a \"free rp website\". Without thinking, I had clicked on the link, and a very similar url to the official league of legends, and filled out the information. This is my mistake, I realize this, but this was just the beginning. From then, my account send a message to other people, without my influence, to other people who then did the same. The scary part of this is that my friend just lost his account... its gone. I was away for 20 minutes and when I logged on I was in a Lucian game that was almost done. This \"virus\" or whatever it is clearly spreads through the usage of the url from one person to an entire friends list, and then blocks the people who click on the link. This is some strange luck, does anyone have any similar experiences or know if rito has noticed this yet? #sendsupport {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-24T02:12:20.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello TheScratchMaster, \n\nThe best thing to do with this is bring it to a Riot Support specialist to see if they can help resolve this issue.
