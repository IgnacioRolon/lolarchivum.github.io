My client is bugged! :( When I'm in the loading screen AND the game itself, my client shows the top part of a normal windows tab and I can't scroll my screen down. I think I somehow did it when I was alt-tabbed and I re-entered the game by clicking the icon JUST as the game started. I can't play league now, so if someone could suggest someway of fixing this that'd be great! Email is: ---. (I know it's cringy). And I've tried everything, from restarting my computer (which is good btw) to completely uninstalling and re-installing the game. It is still bugged. So if someone could suggest something on my Email that I listed in this discussion, that'd be great! PLEASE HELP!!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-15T17:39:24.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean by bugged?  Are you using a 4K?  Sometimes the screen will look wonky if you tab out and in on a 4K.  Otherwise, I'll need more specifics to help.  I've also edited your post to remove personal information.
