For example, when Yi is ulting and dodges Fiora ult with (Q).

I diligently listened to his new VO (because it's so awesome and has a rather sad feeling to it) funny thing is I tend not to hear most of his dialogue mid game because all I focus on is the awesome aa sounds (and all those pretty animations are just as distracting as watching a flame dance).","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-31T17:36:49.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^-^ I'm personally a big fan of the Highlander particles.
