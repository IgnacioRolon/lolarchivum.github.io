That is very cheap and he abuses that. He gets his spike earlier than almost any top laner.\r\n\r\nHe bullies nearly any champion out of lane because he gets free magic pen and his Q just does about 25-40% of your health. This makes tanks pretty ineffective when he just gets pen + Void Staff and has 55% Magic Pen total. He also has access to the best item in the game (Hourglass) meaning he can nearly always beat melees. On top of this, you literally cannot risk pushing out the lane because he will ult you, steal stats, and win the fight. On top of this, you also cannot gank him post 6 because it will, at best, be a 1 for 1.\r\nEven MORE, he gets a HUGE shield, and also gets sustain off of it. \r\n\r\nTryndamere and Fiora CAN counter him...and Fiora is pretty eh into him. And Tryndamere only wins because you literally CANNOT die for 5 seconds. How is this a fair champion?\r\n\r\nThis champion is just insane. His damage outpout is ridiculous, he is super tanky, and he's not kitable. He gets free Pen, free sustain, a free shield, and fee 1 v 1 that also gives him free stats...how do you win?\r\n\r\nAnd Riot's changes do nothing. They are just a slap on the wrist that does not actually solve a single thing with this champion.\r\n\r\nAs soon as any other champion is good, Riot nerfs them to the ground. Look at Akali and Irelia. \r\n\r\nBut not Morde. \r\n\r\nAt least Akali and irelia take some effort.","replies":[]}
