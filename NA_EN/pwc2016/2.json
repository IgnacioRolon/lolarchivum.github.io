Have winning midlane Veigar. Have even botlane. Lose game because of inting support and jungle.\r\nGo 12/4/8 on Annie. Lose becasue top lane feeds enemy Katarina.\r\nGo 10/8/9 on Tryndamere (not amazing), but I was to the point where I was taking towers in 5 seconds. Mid. Support, and ADC refuse to 5 v 5, thinking they are splitpushers. WE HAVE MALPHITE MID SPLITPUSHING BOT LANE. Jinx, not taking ANY place in fights and BUILDING IE THIRD. BRAND FARMING JUNGLE WHILE I 1 V 1 ENEMY MORDEKAISER. \r\nNote: I did:\r\nThe most damage in the game\r\nTook 3 towers and an inhib on my own\r\nAnd my team was flaming me for us losing despite them literally not being able to stay safe in 4 v 4 under tower?????\r\n\r\nThis accounts for about 3 out of the past 6 games of the week, the only games I've played since Monday. I feel tired man. Like, wtf do I ahve to do to carry. \r\nAm I dogshit? Probably. \r\nBut it's so tiring to just tell you team \"don't fight here\" or \"just try to kill the minion waves\" while you splitpush and your team just tries to die as hard as they can. \r\nFeels like what I do doesn't matter in these games at all-the outcome would have been the same had I been in them or not. I need a break. This game just feels like utter bullshit.\r\n(P.S. Fuck Riot for not nerfing this abomination{{champion:82}})","replies":[]}
