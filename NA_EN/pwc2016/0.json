I think she's really fun and has a unique playstyle.\r\n\r\nBut her kit's power is not well balanced.\r\n\r\nMost of her power comes from hitting her spear. But it's buggy and has a terrible hitbox. It's not reliable in any way. \r\nMeanwhile, the rest of her abilities are pretty much useless without her hitting a spear. \r\n\r\nCan we just put more power into the rest of her kit and less in the spear?","replies":[{"poster":"Malfectious","date":"2020-01-04T18:47:54.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to see her get back into mid lane.

Her spear is about half as strong as it used to be, and instead of just spamming Q, she needs to follow up with the rest of her abilities to secure a kill. Targets also become hunted when they step on a trap. If you mean that you want Nid to have more power in the rest of her kit without needing to land a spear or a trap, I don't think that's likely to happen, as the latter are mostly skill-based conditions gating other damage with less counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"forresto","date":"2020-01-04T12:38:57.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think his problem with it is that her entire kit revolves around whether or not she hit her spear, which can definitely be unsatisfying if you miss a lot","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-04T17:35:41.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=forresto,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mTQHjnGA,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2020-01-04T12:38:57.361+0000)\n>\n> I think his problem with it is that her entire kit revolves around whether or not she hit her spear, which can definitely be unsatisfying if you miss a lot\n\nRight now, the counterplay to Nid's human form is dodging spears and avoiding traps, and the counterplay to her cougar form is taking advantage of a squishy mage's presence in melee range to fight her. But there isn't much counterplay to that burst of cougar damage itself, unless maybe you Flash or something. If she didn't have to land spears/traps, how would enemies be expected to avoid her damage? Her cougar spells would probably need to be less reliable.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"2gudaiya","date":"2020-01-03T21:13:38.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"massively skill gated champ, so somewhere on the rift someone has been 20/2/6'd by her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2020-01-03T20:57:46.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"lmfao.
