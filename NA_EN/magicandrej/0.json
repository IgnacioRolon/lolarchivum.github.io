But whenever I try to redeem them I just get \"There was a problem fulfilling your store items, please try again.\" I've uninstalled LoL and downloaded it again, still wont work. My emails verified and everything, just seems like too much hassle to go through getting everything for a ticket, anyone else getting the same issue of know how to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-22T03:05:28.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes those codes just refuse to work correctly.
