The fact that your punishment is up does not mean your account is in good enough standing to receive hextech rewards.\n\nGuys, can't you just call it a punishment instead of playing the semantics game. I went through it and got it taken care of and I'm back to receiving hextech rewards, and I definitely felt like it was a punishment.\n\nI mean, you kind of say it yourself. You don't get this \"reward\" because you're not being good enough. If i'm not being good, it sounds like I deserve a punishment, so calling it a punishment sounds pretty appropriate. And, all in all, what is considered a punishment or not is really, or at least should really, be in the eyes of the one being punished. The chat restriction was hardly a punishment at all, given that I don't like to talk much in game anyway. But getting an S rank in the majority of the games I was playing to get my hextech rewards back and not being able to receive anything sucked soooooo hard.\n\nWhat's the difference between saying \"you can't type more than 5 messages,\" \"you can't play this game for a week,\" and \"you can't have hextech rewards\" if it's all because of your bad behavior?\n\nJust call it a punishment. I find it to be a pretty effective one. Mainly because it's pretty much the only way to get rewarded for being good at the game. Guess it really depends on how good someone is at playing though. Telling someone who can't win or get S ranks they can't have what they already can't get doesn't help much, lol.","replies":[{"poster":"NoobSaibutt","date":"2017-02-05T19:49:44.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i totally agree. the same thing happened to me and i cant earn anything","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Incognonymous","date":"2016-07-18T21:21:31.038+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Wjgpp3xY,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2016-07-18T18:40:44.584+0000)\n>\n> Not receiving hextech loot is not a punishment.

The fact that your punishment is up does not mean your account is in good enough standing to receive hextech rewards.\n\nFalse. Eligibility is only gated by the criteria of not being punished. This is not the same as being sportsmanlike. Nor will being sportsmanlike actually earn you loot. It will earn ribbons, which do nothing. Another failed Riot implementation, which Hextech will prove itself to be in time as well.\n\nThe fact that he, while being punished, can go into the store and buy the very loot you claim he is denied from earning otherwise, is proof of the real motivations at play, if it doesn't outright explain the nebulous nature of the reform tier system. \n\nAs to restrictions being a punishment:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/#q=punishment\n\n>the infliction or imposition of a penalty as retribution for an offense.\n\nIt 100% is. This is a penalty imposed upon earning a reward, that, by the very definition, of the very first thing that pops up when you google \"punishment\", is a punishment. Please retire this embarrassing defense. In the past, the language surrounding the loss of end of season ranked rewards was always that of punishment for behavioral reasons. Far too late to change the language now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Griff760","date":"2016-07-19T00:16:21.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and what exactly puts your account back in \"good standing\"","replies":[{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2016-10-05T04:37:29.101+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its completely random.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xydem","date":"2016-07-19T04:10:49.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Griff760,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Wjgpp3xY,comment-id=00070003,timestamp=2016-07-19T00:16:21.173+0000)\n>\n> and what exactly puts your account back in &quot;good standing&quot;\n\nPretty much just playing and not getting reported. About 30 to 40 games to get hextech back. At least for me for 10 chat restriction. I did it in less than 3 days of constant ARAMs. Not sure if getting honored helps or if not talking at all hurts though. If you're not really toxic and you're reports were because someone got butthurt over an argument, it should be easy, now that you are armed with the knowledge that you have to treat the game like a kindergarten classroom.
