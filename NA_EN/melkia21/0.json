I don&#039;t know if its the order I&#039;m picking my spells, items, or just bad play.  I cant seem to kill anything w/o help and I have to B after almost every camp. I end up falling way behind and I&#039;m level 10 or so before I&#039;m of any use to people again. I usually throw spear, set trap, go cat and pounce, swipe, takedown. rinse and repeat as needed. but the first 3 or 4 levels wreck me so bad. I have jungles many other champs and have never felt this weak in the start of a game. I have tried starting with frog, blue, rock guy, nothing seems to matter.  Any help on what I am doing wrong would be appreciated.  Add me in game and we can do a couple games and Skype if that would be easier to show how its done.  Thank you","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-05-31T22:16:22.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watch Santorin JG NIdalee games on YT, really the best advice without having to type out step by step details of each clear. Can also watch any korean Nid JG replays, better but less bearable to watch as you only see the replay client","replies":[]}]}
