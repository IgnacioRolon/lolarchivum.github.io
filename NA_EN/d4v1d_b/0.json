However, they found that players who got more than a few punishments would never stop misbehaving and receiving punishments. As the goal of the punishment system is to eliminate rule-breaking and Riot has absolutely no interest in coddling toxic players, the system was changed to eliminate this long tail of irredeemable players. Compared to the hundreds or even thousands of typical players who are bothered over dozens or hundreds of matches ruined by a toxic player, that one player's ability to annoy people merits no sympathy or concern. The preferred outcome of punishing a misbehaving player is reform: according to Riot's figures, most players who get one punishment never get another. However, when a player refuses to stop breaking the rules after a few warnings (punishments), they are removed from the game with a permaban because Riot no longer believes them capable of reform.","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2019-11-26T01:38:39.339+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=rdKhzGHd,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-11-26T00:41:07.739+0000)\n>\n> Citation needed.\n\nAfter getting sweaty and angry they take a shower, and change their clothes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-11-26T00:13:53.509+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has tried this - twice actually. The first time, it has been confirmed that 95+% of players who were permitted to take part in this experiment **failed** - i.e. they kept being toxic after they got their main account back.\n\nSure, there is a *small* percent of permanently banned players who may be capable of reform. But unfortunately, based on data from League of Legends and other games, there is also a *large* percentage of players who will not reform - they refuse to accept their actions are wrong, they refuse to accept that they must follow the rules, they deflect and try to talk about \"let's not forget that a lot of people flame because of...\"\n\nNo. You flamed because you either lacked the self control to stop yourself, or because you legitimately thought it was okay to cause other people grief and force them to spend 20+ minutes in a match with someone that is rude and toxic. Either way, that is not an okay attitude to have - and the fact that you are still trying to blame \"trolls afks and inters\" shows that you are the exact type of person who is **not** reformed.\n\nI'll close with this - if someone is **actually** trolling, they *want* a response out of you. So in giving them that response, you are not only worsening the situation, but you're actually doing exactly what the troll wants. If they **are not** actually trolling, and they're just playing bad, making bad decisions, or whatever it may be, then you're making them feel like shit and tilting them - which isn't going to make them play better, it'll make them play worse.","replies":[{"poster":"D4V1D B","date":"2019-11-26T00:36:00.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm not blaming anyone for getting banned and it was a low level smurf of course that I'm the fake cheerleading child that we all pretend to be in order to get honored in my main account but it is a fact that if trollers inters and afks got punished as severely as flamers there wouldn't be as many flamers if you disagree you're either new to online games or simply have no idea how people work, and for the small percentage of people reforming they deserve a chance to get their account back","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-11-26T00:44:22.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">let's not forget that a lot of people flame because of trolls afks and inters\n\nDirect quote from your post. You are saying that it's not the people's fault they flame, but \"trolls afks and inters\". That is the meaning of the sentence you wrote. If you didn't intend to say that, then I encourage you to review your word choice and sentences carefully in the future.\n\nThe problem here is not \"trolls inters and afks\". **Those will always exist, and if you disagree, you're either new to the internet or simply have no idea how people work**. It's literally impossible to do away with them. Period. And flaming them **does no good whatsoever, and actually \"fuels their fire\" and makes them want to troll more**. Congrats - you played yourself.\n\nLastly, no, it is not worth letting 95 toxic players back in just to let 5 players back in who may reform. I'm sorry, but Riot cares more about removing those 95 toxic players for good than they do about you who could not listen to multiple warnings prior to the permanent ban, and only **now** decided to behave.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-11-26T00:11:24.535+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-11-26T00:20:33.260+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was the Lvl 20 challenge way back when and that failed.\n\nWe had a more recent unban experiment in NA like 2 years ago.

If you compare it to verbal cases, of course it would look that way. This is due to verbal being easier to catch. Meanwhile, trolling it flexible and not clear cut all the time.
