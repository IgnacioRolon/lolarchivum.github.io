I am not certain if it isn&#039;t applying all on-hit effects or if it&#039;s just affecting Alpha strike. It&#039;s fairly self-explanatory to replicate; simply play as Yi, and note that your q cooldown only reduces by 1 second when you double strike an enemy. The distinctive &quot;flash&quot; that occurs when an ability&#039;s CD is reduced doesn&#039;t occur twice, that&#039;s the easiest way to notice it. Anyone else seen this?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-07-12T06:18:42.878+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeab, this should be fixed for next patch.","replies":[{"poster":"DiZ1904","date":"2015-07-12T16:42:40.358+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My names not Yeab, but thanks anyway for the heads up!
