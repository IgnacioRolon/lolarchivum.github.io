(Good because of his low mobility) Also matches his lore as being a massive titan.\r\n\r\nW: Amazing ability, definitely makes him a unique champ and should say the same. (Matches lore because it&#039;s like soul stealing, idk it makes sense in a way.)\r\n\r\nE: Good early poke, but in the late game isn&#039;t very useful due to the low scaling on the ability . Perhaps give it better scaling on so that it is more prevalent in the late game. (Example Like 0.4 to 0.5)\r\n\r\nR: Keep Ghost part, but add a scaling factor of sorts. Much like Zed&#039;s AD stealing or like Ravenous hunter or something. Something that benefits the player, E.g. more Damage for number of souls harvested with the ability(sounds like Dark harvest but like a maximum of 5 stacks (or a percentage of targets Adaptive Damage)) considering that he is the harvester of souls. Relates him more to lore, makes him a more unique champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-12-03T11:49:55.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He would be broken with these changes balance-wise and probably bug-wise as well.

Outside of {{champion:131}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:11}} he is the ONLY champion with no escape or cc in his entire kit. Even {{champion:11}} can ult for no slows and move speed, {{champion:420}} has a partial slow on E, {{champion:86}} has cc reduction a silence and a speed boost. Given {{champion:131}} only has cc that pulls enemies toward her (so no escape unless an enemy minion is on your side) but she is a burst assassin. What does {{champion:82}} have? A slight move speed boost toward an allied unit with W. Which if no unit, or unit killed, is useless.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Voidling","date":"2018-11-30T22:59:46.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best role might honestly be Bot with {{champion:412}}, so you have an escape and cc.

I'd rather give him something awe inspiring as an ultimate, instead of just a dull DOT DOT DOT and a ghost if they die. Plus, the whole dragon ghost thing is utter bullshit.\n\nAlso, adding a knock up on his most powerful hit of his Q is gonna be busted. That just means he can beat your face in, CC you, and then murder you while you're incapacitated.\n\nI personally think his W needs to lose the \"friend cast\" mechanic, and his E needs to go, along with the R.

He enslaves them but doesn't get stronger the more people he eslaves, his army just grows (which makes him technically stronger but \nnot literally himself)","replies":[]}]}
