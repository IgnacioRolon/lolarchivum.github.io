I hope it doesn't sound too jarring, maybe nostalgic if anything.  I recommend reporting this over to the [client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards for testing.  In the meantime, a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends)may be necessary in case installation went poorly and ended up in corrupt files.  Thanks for testing!","replies":[]}]}
