I'm currently using my wife's Mac for daily computer use, and while she's on a work trip for the week, I thought I'd try to see how her Mac handles League. The game seems to run smoothly, however, I can't right click with my wireless mouse.\r\n\r\nI'm using a Logitech M325 wireless mouse.. Pretty standard as far as I know.. I've tried going to system preferences > mouse > and setting up a secondary click button, but it doesn't give me any options for it. All I have are track speed, scroll speed, double click speed, and the ability to change my primary mouse button from left to right..\r\n\r\nIn the game, I can left click and move the map around with the mouse, I just can't move with the mouse. The only way I can move with with the damn track pad... Help please.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-25T01:16:19.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this happen with any other mouse when hooked up to the mac? Because your input settings are saved to the server, I've seen certain circumstances where settings will get messed up when switching between a Mac and a PC.","replies":[]}]}
