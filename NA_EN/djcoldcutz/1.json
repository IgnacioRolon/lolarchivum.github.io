It offers more depth and strong cc, at the cost of being less reliable and straigth forward. I'm fine with it. (Also, slamming enemies into each other is fun).\n\nOn his ultimate, though, i am triggered. Zac's previous ultimate was funnier, stronger, more reliable, more thematically fitting. **It was not an unealthy ability in any way.** Why the hell would you replace it, Riot? New one its situational, conditional, unreliable... That's not what Zac needs.\n\nConcerning the general damage reduction, that was kind of the point of the whole update, and i'm the 1st to admit that Zac's damage was a bit overbearing.","replies":[{"poster":"RocketRelm","date":"2017-05-05T09:11:56.559+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the biggest issue is that Zac was kind of like Mundo, in the sense of him bringing not-as-much CC as other engage tanks, but he made up for it with raw damage.\n\nNow they took away his damage... and **literally** took away more CC than they added.\n(R lost 0.5 second cc, Q knocking into each other barely makes up for the lost E CC, losing the Q aoe slow int he process, and his new ult < old ult in terms of CC that means anything.)\n\nSo what they wound up dong is taking away CC, damage, tank, and giving him 'nothing'.\n\nThe worst part is that I don't think I'd even enjoy him anymore if his numbers somehow got buffed to viability. I liked Zac for being a meaty brawler, not a gimmick ult that does 0 damage.","replies":[{"poster":"GelsominoKiller","date":"2017-05-05T12:16:03.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're very right to define current Zac's ultimate as a gimmick. It has immense potential, but in the average use it is situational and unreliable. I don't like the change one bit.\n\nHowever, in my opinion you're understimating the cc his new q brings. It's a pretty hefty displacement for a standard ability.\n\nOn the damage side, he may be overnerfed now, but I still think that his combo was excessive for a tank.\n\n\nOn a side note, Mundo is a Juggernaut ;)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2017-05-03T22:21:06.275+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah his rework didn't really do a whole lot.

But the ability revolves around there being 2 enemies, i.e being another champ, minion, tower. If it is just a single target it has no uses other than a a small amount of damage. \n\nI think if they were to change it so that if you hit the same target twice, it will slow the target. This being a way to give the ability some utility.\n\nHis R I think needs more, it is a very small radius. After using it in ranked, it was very hard to get more than 2 people at a time. Making the area will give a better chance of getting more targets and keeping them within the area. \n\nChange it to 1.5 the size it is now at 1.25 seconds charge. \n\nThey will not revert him back to his old self, so the best we can hope for is that they rework his new abilities. \n\nI think his new Q is AMZBAWLS.  {{champion:154}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"badCompany","date":"2017-05-08T05:56:38.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i cant believe this.. riot, u destroy zac completely, his jumping and his stretching carried me more than 2 years. now i lost my great friend cuz i will play him no more.. what is he now, support??? \ni read somewhere Zac is champ with 50% win rate.. now will be 35. tnx a lot.\noh yea, and u (riot) said that zac will be now more stronger and i dont know what more. well, u made a mistake, u fcked it up. tnx again","replies":[]},{"poster":"broccoflauer","date":"2017-05-08T01:05:15.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zac rework is a JOKE.
