This is because once the download was interrupted, some of the files it was downloading could have been corrupted. In order to get a stable download, you'll need to download the game from start to finish. \n\nIf you won't be able to use your home wifi to download it again due to your data cap, you could always try using a local library or somewhere that has free wifi to try downloading it again.","replies":[{"poster":"Carry Machinee","date":"2017-03-21T02:30:17.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty but i live in a country that the highest internet speed is 16 mg per sec \nso the free internet places wont have that much speed for 4335 mg \nbut thanks anyway i will buy some more traffic for my wifi then","replies":[]}]}]}
