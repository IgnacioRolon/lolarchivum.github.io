To the point where I was shocked that it actually wasn&#039;t done this way in the first place! I mean, that&#039;s how it looks in spectator mode, no?\r\n\r\nThis format just makes a lot more sense imho. Having every piece of information in the same place simply does not make sense.\r\nImagine playing Street Fighter, and having both health bars, the timer, and super/ultra bars all crammed into the top right corner. That&#039;s what this new HUD feels like to me. It&#039;s supposed to be tactical, and readable, but it honestly just looks like a mess.\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t get me wrong, there are some obvious upgrades here as well. Anything I&#039;ve not mentioned, I believe is superior in the new HUD. The aesthetic is dramatically improved over the old HUD, and provided they do mirror it, the scoreboard is a massive upgrade as well. But I CANNOT get behind having all the information crammed into the bottom corner.\r\n\r\nI believe my modified image here takes the best from both, and makes it into a HUD that is both aesthetically pleasing, AND highly functional.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Catastroclysm","date":"2015-08-01T17:43:45.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I moved the items back to where they were, and put all the champion related info together. Mostly everything else is untouched.\n\nAnd do you even know what the word cluttered means? \nCuz this is kinda the opposite of that.\nThe current incarnation of the new HUD is cluttered.\n\nYou're basically looking at a tidy room with everything spaced out, and saying it's cluttered, then another that's completely empty, except for a giant mess piled to the ceiling in the corner, and saying that one is tidy, and 'streamlined'\n\nAnd yeah, except that you don't read items, they're pictures, and the order you see them in doesn't actually matter If someone put their dorans ring and boots in slots 5 and 6 on the old HUD, would that just completely ruin your understanding of their build?? Can you literally just not spectate people, because you're unable to 'read their items'? Because that's exactly how it's always been in spectator mode.\n\n The text would obviously be from left to right. The point is that the cs numbers are right next to each other, and after that the item placement is symmetrical. This makes for much easier comparisons of both.\n\nAlso, now that I look at it, I really don't like where I've suggested the stats go. They should be where the white box is. KDA should be between CS and items too in the tab menu Idk why I didn't have it that way. o:\nAnd I've since discovered that point 5 is already being done which is good, so forget about that.\n\nBtw, a major consideration point of this is that it's not 'just putting the old HUD back' like most people are asking for, and riot said they would not do. It's the new HUD with a few things moved around. While there may be difficulties having two different HUDs in the game, something like this shouldn't be at all difficult to implement.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-08-01T14:09:21.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol its the old hud with a new skin. thats all you did here. not to mention its waaaay to cluttered. riot streamlined the hud and i personally like what they did with it. second thing....the way you mirrored the scoreboard is just a bad idea. on the right side you would have to read the items from right to left...which is the opposite of how you actually read. reading from left to right is how youre taught to read, so having the scoreboard mirrored reverses that and makes it 10x's more confusing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Catastroclysm","date":"2015-08-01T12:51:06.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]}]}
