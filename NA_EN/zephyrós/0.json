There was a skin revealed that I have wanted for a long time and you can't buy it regularly. So I ran out to the sore and got a GC to buy it. When I came back home, logged on and opened up my store again, it was a completely DIFFERENT set of skins!!! None of which I wanted!!! I tried logging in and out, over and over again, but I keep getting the second set of skins....Also sometimes it won't even load. I'm really disappointed in this, and I'm just wondering if there is a way to get my original set back...the one I was gonna buy.....:(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-19T03:55:12.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh noes! We had a little hiccup with Your Shop when it first opened, and we had to perform a sort-of hard reset to get it up and running again. When that reset hit, it did refresh some peoples shops. I did get word earlier that we *might* be able to help out with getting the sale price of one of those previous skins, so hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so that we can take a look.\n\nKeep in mind, I'm not 100% sure if we'll be able to pull that data anymore, but it's worth a shot eh?","replies":[]}]}
