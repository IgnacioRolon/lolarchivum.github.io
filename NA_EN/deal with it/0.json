Though I don't post much, I do enjoy the game quite a bit. \r\n\r\nI took the quiz for the star guardian icon with my friend way back around October when it came out. I planned on using that icon exclusively (it's my favorite / looks the best). But I still haven't gotten it yet!\r\n\r\nI tried taking the quiz again today to see if it would show me some kind of \"already redeemed\" message, but it didn't show anything?\r\n\r\nSo I'm wondering, Riot, if you could please help me with this. I love the star guardian skins (I own them all) and the icon was supposed to complete the set. Could you please look into it and help me out here? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nMatt","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-01T19:10:31.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Mark of the Star Guardian icon was a limited event upon taking the quiz.  While the quiz is still active, unfortunately the icons are no longer being distributed.  Support is not currently offering these icons, but there's always a chance that limited icons can make a return somehow.  I don't have any details on that, but bookmark our [Sales](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales) page in case something comes up.  Sorry about that!","replies":[]}]}
