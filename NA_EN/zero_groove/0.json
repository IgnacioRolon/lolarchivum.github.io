I hit Launch, my mouse does the loady-circley thing, and nothing happens.\r\nI open the task manager, the processes are running but the application is not. I have repaired the launcher countless times, I have re-installed several, restarted my computer, and I cannot figure out the issue. I had thought I had found a solution at one point but it proved futile. (Solution was to remove all record of anything RIOT games related and re-install then, but even that did not work.) Please help, I am incredibly annoyed. This has been occurring for about two months now.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-18T05:51:50.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client is unable to establish a solid connection to our login servers, causing the sudden client disconnection that you're seeing.
