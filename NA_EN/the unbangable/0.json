You'll need to go to the extreme once your ban is up to make sure you're on your best behavior. My best suggestion would be to not, under any circumstance, use chat. If you have a hard time resisting, you can bind the chat to something far less convenient than the Enter key. I'd also suggest either moving the chat window almost completely off the screen so you can't see it, or else get in the habit of muting everybody in the game from the start. Do all your communication in game with pings.\n\nYou basically need to keep it up for 3 months without a punishment, at which point you'll drop down one punishment tier (so if you got a punishment after 4 months, you'd be back at a 14-day ban). It'll take 9 full months with no punishments to get your account back to normal standing.\n\nGood luck!","replies":[{"poster":"DeynaTaggerung","date":"2016-02-05T19:59:59.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I'm aware there isn't a way to rebind the chat to a key other than enter.

I was looking into it for someone a few months ago and I found out that it's actually not editable anymore. Or rather any changes you make are erased whenever you log in because Riot keeps their own copy on the server which can only be edited through the in-game menu.

It's hard not to defend yourself verbally, but when u think about how many kids play this game and how kids are, it's easier to remind yourself that they'd say the same shit to anyone and it's not personal, they're just d-bags (adults too ofc, but I like to imagine they are children cuz it's easier).\n\nSomething I've begun doing is just treating it like you're on the same team so u pretend u are friends. Had a shitty jinx adc and I was brand support and at one point the jungler said something like come on brand help me (I was oom) and jinx goes \"brand is a potato\". I wanted to tear this 0/4 tower diving pos jinx a new asshole but instead I just said \"what jinx? You're turning on me? I've been so nice\" ...it was kinda hard to do but I treat it like a joke. Like aww now I'm sad u don't wanna be friends. Anyways, the jinx ended like 4/11/7 and I was 10/7/17, so I was glad I just let the play speak for itself and was proud that I didn't snap on jinx. He apologized for the potato comment at the end and told me good job. Negative experience turned positive by just staying positive regardless how douchey the person is being.

Reports are just flags for further checking of a game, one flag is enough to get the game looked into, having more and more doesn't actually affect the severity of Riot's action.\n\nAside from that I recommend just going with the \"if you have nothing nice to say don't say anything at all\". It's seriously just not worth it to put in criticism or snide comments because it doesn't actually get you anywhere or change the person you're talking to, except to maybe piss them off. Mute early and often and say what you want to say out loud instead of into chat. You can say it, agree with yourself, and move on uninhibited.\n\nAnd as others have said, be extra careful because after you get a 14 day it's more or less your next toxic game == a permaban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkyBlade79","date":"2016-02-05T19:48:34.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen worse.\n\n\nMuch, much, much worse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unvictus","date":"2016-02-05T14:05:53.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just recently got a 10 day chat restriction and I will be perfectly honest and say that I am glad to have gotten it.

Dot get me wrong I wasn't that toxic of a player but I had one really bad day where nothing went right and I took it out on my teammates and all of my sample games came from that day. Like I said I'm already seeing the value of staying positive in the midst of frustration. For example I just played a game yesterday where I was being attacked by two of my teammates because I was currently 0/2. I could've chosen to argue back and play their game, but instead I simply muted them and proceeded to remain positive for the rest of the game typing things like \"gj team\" whenever we had a good fight. We ended.up winning the game too! This just goes to show how much of a difference your attitude makes!

Usually if I'm on tilt and had a bad game, I'll go play something else that relaxes me, take a walk and stretch my legs, or get something to eat and watch YouTube. Helps me avoid saying something I might regret and refreshes my mind for the next game. That and rarely use chat. The most I do is say a harmless joke in the beginning and then nothing but pings until the gg at the end. Maybe these techniques might help you out when you get back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FastAsHeck","date":"2016-02-05T10:29:36.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"/mute all\" is your friend","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gypsyleeboy","date":"2016-02-05T06:32:13.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It all seem'd normal flame and usual toxic that at one point we all say, until..\n\n> he Unbangable: this kha is like mentally ill or something, ignore him\n\n*cringe* I'd say that's ban worthy, hahah. try to understand peeps will definitely report you for stuff like this and it will get you banned. \ntry to also ignore ultra sensitive stuff like being \"mentally ill\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jacker1991","date":"2016-02-05T17:18:36.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is \"Toxic\"?

I would say that one game over 3 there is a player as toxic as you were. Although I report these players every time, I almost never see the message indicating that a summoner I reported got punished (I see it maybe once every month).\n\nI also think you just write too much. Although what you write is never exceedingly negative, the fact that you spam chat may help everybody to remember they will report you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malhammers","date":"2016-02-04T22:37:00.965+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Dude you talk waaaay too much in game...The volume of how much you talked in those games is more than I have probably ever talked in all my games combined.","replies":[{"poster":"SkyBlade79","date":"2016-02-05T19:50:45.487+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude, this is in a timespan of 20 - 45+ minutes. \n\nGood players, even the ones who aren't being toxic, communicate with their team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2016-02-05T04:56:52.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:17}}  Satan always wins.\n\nSpeaking out against him is foolish.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2016-02-05T02:39:46.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Its a shame that Riot and this games community has  convinced that those chat logs should be considered \"toxic\".
