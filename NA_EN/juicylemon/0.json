This just started happening to me after the \"Yorick update\" patch. I'll open client, click  Launch. It will stay grey 4-5 seconds. Then it seems like it is trying to go to the login screen, but simply disappears. Sometimes I will get the cannot connect to kernel popup.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-11T15:43:55.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That behavior is typical of a client dropping its connection to the login server before a solid link is established. I definitely recommend working through the connection guide I linked in my previous comment.\n\nLet me know if that worked for you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
