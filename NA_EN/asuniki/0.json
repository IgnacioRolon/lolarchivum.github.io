Currently, shes the least played, \"worst\" ADC compared to all the others. Why don't we get Riot to show her some love with a small buff? (or a large one). I have started getting into playing her and I think her late game damage could use a buff. She doesn't do as much damage late game compared to her other fellow ADCs, but her early game seems to be okay. I think Riot should do something to bring her back into the meta.\r\n\r\n Another topic: Poor Kalista only has THREE skins, (Championship Kalista, has a golden chroma too but looks shitty. Blood moon Kalista. SKT T1 Kalista.) So the thing about this is,  she has 3 skins, pretty standard for an unpopular champion, but only ONE skin is available for purchase. (Blood moon Kalista) THE OTHER TWO ARE LEGACY. So if you want a skin for Kalista, too bad, you've only got one choice. I think Riot should make a new skin for Kalista this year, maybe a Dark star Kalista skin would be interesting. Anyways, I just wanted to post this to shed some love on Kalista.","replies":[{"poster":"Jikker","date":"2019-11-15T15:51:28.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please do not necro old threads as doing so violates the [**Board Universal Rules**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/ITFIpNUE).

The biggest problem she has other than her high skill floor is that she needs a competent support. You could be the best kalista player in the world, and you'd still fall flat sometimes because you basically don't have an ult if your support is bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hiyares","date":"2019-04-20T05:17:01.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem with kalista is is shes good in soloque shes broken in pro play if shes balanced in pro shes unplayable in solo que.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-04-20T05:17:31.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Like several other champions, Kalista is intentionally trash for 99.9999% of the playerbase because if she wasn't she'd be 100% pick/ban in pro play and Riot doesn't want to interfere with that.","replies":[]}]}
