In the program, 95% of people who tried the challenge failed and actually made games quite miserable for a lot of newbie players--I still feel bad to this day that this happened.\"_\n\n_\"So who deserves a second chance? It's hard to say. I've seen 2 cases where Pendragon or I have given a player a second chance. The variables and conditions were very different, but I think you are missing one main point: permabanned players have up to 4-5 or more chances before they reach that point. Before that, they can reach out to me, Pendragon or Player Support and in many cases people like WookieCookie have responded with advice on how to avoid future punishment.\"_","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shukr4n","date":"2018-04-29T14:00:20.517+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"No","replies":[]},{"poster":"Diar","date":"2018-04-29T19:41:10.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, Riot Games does not allow lifting perm bans.
