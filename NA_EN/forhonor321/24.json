But I want to know something: what part(s) of his kit do you guys hate the most about him? Now obviously if you hate his whole kit in general I nor anyone else can blame you but if you had to choose one or a few select things that absolutely makes your blood boil when you face this guy what would it be?\r\n\r\nMe personally it comes down to these:\r\n\r\n* His E - no matter what, this will always be my most hated part of his kit. Simply put it: he basically has infinite dashes so long as he has something to dash through. And because of that I don&#039;t ever feel safe when laning against him. He can just dash right through my minions, you know the tiny creatures that are kinda your bulwark from the other 99% of melee champions out there, deal damage and then just dash through another one without little consequence. This is almost the reason I fear going mid lane cause when I do I usually play mages and with him as my opponent I usually get fucked over pretty hard.\r\n\r\n* Double Crit - Put it simply, I don&#039;t like this. You literally just have to build a fucking {{item:3046}}  and {{item:3031}} and then can build whatever damage items you want. It just doesn&#039;t seem that fair that one guy can just build two items for full crit, while everyone else needs like 6. I know the crit is reduced damage but considering that its pretty much every single AA and Q after the two items it just doesn&#039;t feel like that matters.\r\n\r\n* His Windwall - Just destroys all projects you throw at him. Even if the smallest particle of a Nami ult touches it, _**POOF GONE**_.","replies":[{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2017-01-01T06:32:55.012+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Windwall originating from Yasuo is bull shit. make it spawn in front of him","replies":[]},{"poster":"PunnedIt","date":"2017-01-01T05:30:44.628+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the biggest issue is how his mobility works with his survivability.  Let's talk high damage champions.  Nobody complains that Veigar is overpowered, even though Veigar can in theory do more damage than Yasuo.  Why is this?  Because Veigar is forced to interact with the opponent to get that damage.  If Veigar shoots his Q to hit an enemy and misses, he just wasted mana.  His squishiness and lack of mobility means that he can't just charge in, he has to either create an ideal situation or wait for one.  Yasuo, on the other hand, feels unfair because of the lack of interaction between him and the enemy.  True, playing Yasuo takes a lot of skill in the same way that beating Hard Mode in Guitar Hero takes skill, but that skill is between the champion and the player, not the player and his opponent.\n\nFor a squishy striker who plays a high-risk/high-reward playstyle, Yasuo rarely has to worry about getting hit by something.  He has a passive shield, a Wind Wall, and dashes-for-days.  If you do hit him, a little lifesteal (on all that damage) and he's good as new.  Furthermore because he requires no mana Yasuo isn't forced to play conservatively with his tornadoes or other abilities.  Yes, having energy means he can't just infinitely spam skills, but it also means that if he misses 10 skill shots (tornadoes) he can still do 10 more, most of the AP carry champions he'll go against mid will have to base after missing 10 skill shots because they'll be out of mana.  If Riot wanted Yasuo to be a champion who had so much survivability, he shouldn't have been given so much damage.  If Riot wanted Yasuo to do so much damage, while every champion needs some way to dodge (takes skill, right?) and outlast their opponent through clever play, they shouldn't have made Yasuo so untouchable with his abilities.  And that I think is why Yasuo feels so annoying to go against.\n\nIt's not that he does so much damage and kills you when he makes contact.  It's not knowing that some fourteen-year-old boy from Wisconsin is playing him without having to use the same amount of interaction skill that Anivia does.  It's that Yasuo can run in, smack you, and run out without feeling like you have any power to respond.  You could theoretically play a perfect game for someone of your skill level, but as long as the enemy player is skilled at Yasuo, that doesn't mean a thing.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2017-01-01T05:43:22.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Yes, having energy means he can&#x27;t just infinitely spam skills, but it also means that if he misses 10 skill shots (tornadoes) he can still do 10 more, most of the AP carry champions he&#x27;ll go against mid will have to base after missing 10 skill shots because they&#x27;ll be out of mana.\n\nThat's the worst part. he doesn't even have energy,. he is resourceless. all he waits for are CDs (lmao, what a joke considering the only thing in his kit with any kind of actual downtime is his windwall.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DunkinNoobs","date":"2017-01-01T08:51:15.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His super high agency and pressure in lane constantly forces his opponent to be on their toes and ready to outplay or fight to the death at any moment.

I would rather it started at the set distance so he can't block projectiles from all directions when it is first cast.\n\n2) The bigger reason is that he is snowbally and requires teamwork to shut down.  At my elo I can't be confident in my teamate's abilities to work together to shutdown a yasuo.  I would rather not risk the game on there being a skilled Yasuo and my team not having the best coordination or most experience against him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2017-01-01T06:23:29.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Manaless.\nHigh mobility.\nLow skill requirement.\nHyper scaling.\n\nBasically, faceroll easy and brokenly overpowered.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chief Mayonnaise","date":"2017-01-01T06:22:39.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sheer amount of safety his kit has.\n\n\n\nThe passive shield\n\nThe large amount of mobility. \n\nThe automatic safety net when ulting onto a turret\n\nThe windwall, arguably the most overpowered non-ultimate in the game.
