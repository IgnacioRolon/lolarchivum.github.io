And with that said, I think the best way to start the second discussion of the series is to do the complementary anti-series that is tied with the PROJECT series: Battlecast!\r\n\r\nNow Battlecast by far is one of my favorite series Riot has done. There&#039;s just something that really gets me excited about having these champs turn into machines of a dystopian world, helbent on removing all organic life (AND THIS ISN&#039;T TO BE CONFUSED WITH MECHA, THAT IS A DIFFERENT ROBOT THEME THAT I MAY GET TOO NEXT TIME!). \r\n\r\nLike before, the current editions to the series are {{champion:31}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:161}}  and Creator {{champion:112}} . Now the reason I bring up the current roster is to 1. remind everyone who is already in the series &amp; 2. give an understanding of what choices there are for champs to be added in. \r\n\r\nFrom the list, you can quickly tell that some of the candidates are Void Creatures but at the same time it&#039;s not strictly retained to Void creatures as we have Skarner, Xerath and even two humans (well...kinda humans since they&#039;re part machine). Nevertheless, this does allow some open space as to who could be added in the series.\r\n\r\nNow just to get it right out, there is the voting for the next {{champion:420}} skin (hurray!) as to what it should be next and Battlecast/battlecast-type skin is a concept but not fully guaranteed. I would be fine if she got all of those concepts done eventually, but as it stands it&#039;s up to the people and we just have to wait and hear.\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way, it now comes down to my ideas. For me, it&#039;s actually kinda hard since there aren&#039;t a lot of monster champs and some have gotten robot skins outside of Battlecast already, but some candidates I feel could work are {{champion:90}} {{champion:34}} (since there&#039;s that stealth bomber hidden concept a while ago or something) {{champion:120}} {{champion:141}} (Rhaast form in contrast to PROJECT Kayn form) {{champion:19}}  and possibly {{champion:53}} .\r\n\r\nAnyways that my list of ideas but what are yours? Who do you feel are clarified as candidates for Battlecast?","replies":[{"poster":"Skelenth","date":"2017-11-04T18:16:25.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me it goes after the shapes of their bodies.\n\nBattlecast: Monsters, hardly resembling a human.
