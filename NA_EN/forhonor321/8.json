End up losing.\r\n- Neeko - I get paired with a fucking Yasuo and because I'm still learning Neeko and don't play mid, he just snowballs and becomes unstoppable\r\n- Sona matches - mixed because either enemy player got fed or my teammates got fed. A few matches went like 7/23 and 9/23\r\n- Ivern - 14/7, early Surrender\r\n- Morgana - UTTER SHIT! 7/38, 8/23, 38/52 with the Lucian just fucking off and dying in side lanes cause he lost early, and my last match of **0/14** \r\n#0/14. HOW THE FUCK IS THAT FUN?!?!?\r\n\r\nWith the acceptation of one or two Sona matches and Urgot, all of these games have pretty much been stomps. People just blowing up left and right, early wins in lanes end up snowballing, nothing feels fair or fun. All these matches do is two things to me: make it feel boring when I'm winning, or stressed/pissed when I'm losing. Barely anyone plays tanks anymore and when they do, they're usually choosing ones that can deal damage or build damage. It's not like we have enough in the game as it is already!\r\n\r\nAnd it just doesn't end there. Everything about League just is out of wack when Riot tries to fix or add new things! Runes Reforged have been incredibly unhealthy for a while now, with some just being absolute staples to all champs while others are just forgotten and never used (does anyone even used Spellbook anymore?) Items added, like Spear of Shojin, have caused major issues balancing certain champs like Riven and Jax. Damage has just been going up and up and further up over the years. There's no view of it coming down or maybe giving better defensive items.\r\n\r\nNo, instead Riot needs to hop on the hype train and bring out a fucking autochess game mode like Dota is doing. Gotta keep up with trends instead of refining game modes like Nexus Blitz, a mode that I actually thought was enjoyable, or bring back Rotating Game modes. And even then Riot seems to be fucking that mode up too. They don't fix the items drops, certain combinations and champs are overpowered, it's got bugs galore, I... \r\n\r\nI just don't understand what Riot is trying to do anymore. Why are they OK with this skirmish, super high damage burst meta we're in right now? Why are they trying to put out a ranked mode already for their autochess when it's still about RNG? How do they think that's fine for determining skill?!?! I hate the direction that League has been going for quite some time now. I hate always feeling like I can't do something about the damage, about matches that just snowball in the enemies favor, going on losing streaks, getting more and more mobile champs with fewer and fewer counters to them.\r\n\r\nI don't know, I'm frustrated, I'm mostly just venting but I can't stand how the game is. It's not fun. I can't understand why Riot doesn't see that. And I kind of wish that this next preseason/season will try and fix that but let's be honest, it's not. It's more than likely going to get worse and people are still going to keep playing regardless. Fuck.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-07-18T19:00:06.887+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because it is fun.
