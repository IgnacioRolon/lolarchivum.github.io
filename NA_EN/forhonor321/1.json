Good vs. Evil. Light vs. Darkness. Toxic champ vs. toxic champ.\r\n\r\nBut more importantly (at least for me), I get to post and see what sides everyone takes. You prefer chaos? Order? Bunny Hop Girl? Annoying fly in the room that you can&#039;t quite kill because it&#039;s constantly moving around and when you do finally get it it just comes back and rinse n&#039; repeat samurai weeb?\r\n\r\nTo just get down to the main question: Which side are you prefering to take in this event and/or which skin do you like the most and why?\r\n\r\nFor me personally, as much as I hate him, I have to go with the Chaos side and Duskbringer Yasuo. (**THAT DOESN&#039;T MEAN I&#039;M GOING TO START MAINING HIM!** Not like I can pick him in any matches anyway with his ban rate). Few reasons why:\r\n\r\n1.  I play Chaos Space Marines/Daemons in Warhammer 40k: The faction to me is fun to play, looks badass, and the storyline of the chaos gods appeals to me. I love the design of the models, from the recent(ish) bloodthirster model and blood letters to the new plague marines coming out with the new 8th edition starter set to many others. It&#039;s just interesting to see how twisted, morphed, and mangled these being can become after thousands of years in what is essentially Warhammer&#039;s version of the Void in a sense. And with Chaos Yasuo I saw some qualities like that which I quickly fell in love with since it instantly reminded me of those models (mostly it&#039;s the horns).\r\n\r\n2.  I don&#039;t like Angel Riven&#039;s VO or appearance that much: It&#039;s not terrible appearance wise, hell I think it&#039;s a lot better than her base skin and animations (well duuuh it&#039;s a legen-shut up), but honestly it doesn&#039;t have that flair like duskbringer has. From that one teaser we got before the official art, I actually like the hair in that a lot better. For lack of a better definition, it was basically super saiyan hair, which I personally found to be a bit funny but at the same time and for the most part I actually liked the style of it. But when it came to in-game it wasn&#039;t there, the official splash was released and I just lost interest. As for the VO I just don&#039;t like it that much. I thought I would considering I really hate Riven&#039;s current VO but here while it&#039;s better and doesn&#039;t sound so depressed, I just don&#039;t like the fact that when she talks about order it sounds like she wants everyone to follow in this way and almost lose their identity for the sake of keeping things in order and no change whatsoever (which no change makes Tzeentch very unhappy about (_see above for what I mean_))\r\n\r\n3.

His lore shows him to be a troubled, drunken warrior who has no problem killing people at whim, while in game he can do so quite easily and has ridiculously low cooldowns with no resources.  \n\nRiven is strength and determination, someone who spoke out against Noxian practices of using chemical weapons from Zaun and wanted a more pure form of combat on the battlefield.  She made mistakes and wants to atone.  While some people have issues with her kit, she's still nowhere near the cancer Yasuo is (she actually has cooldowns above 1.3 seconds!) and she was one of the original members of the League champion roster.  \n\nThe only way to fix it is a new world order, and thus that era should be lead by Riven.
