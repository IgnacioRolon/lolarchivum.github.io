Visually I just couldn't like her without some of her later skins (plus that cycling of her 10 VO lines), I didn't really like her kit that much, and overall I expected some big changes from her when they announced that they were reworking the two sisters. Then in an update they said that they felt her kit was good and nothing should be changed, which worried me since I kind of wanted something to change with her, at least her W or passive if she's keeping her Q and her Ult. Something that suited more of a battle mage as that's how I always viewed her ult as.\r\n\r\nFast forward to merely days before their reworks hit and I just can't help but feel disappointed in the fact that Morg is just a VU. Not that I won't complain about it, fuck she really needed one, but the fact that nothing changed about her kit I don't know is an astonishing thing or if Riot was too lazy to really think of anything else that worked better (or focused more on Kayle gameplay wise Idk). Who knows, maybe I'll pick her up more and realise her kit really is just that good to keep but overall I still can't get over my feeling that something else could of been changed.","replies":[{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2019-03-04T19:45:19.763+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think the reason was that her kit is already very good and doesn’t need a rework.

That way instead of the useless movement speed boost, she would have an even stronger presence that fits her theme of choosing to be tied to the ground. \nA 0-100% slow over the current duration followed by a stun would be lovely for sure. \n\nAs for her passive... Heals are good. Especially for a mage like morgana who otherwise lacks sustain despite being much more vulnerable than her peers (that 450 attack range... her ult...). Id like a flat HP heal that scales with AP instead of 20% on large and above enemies though; Something like 10-27+0.2AP per tick of damage, halved on area of effect?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2019-03-04T19:46:00.562+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Honestly her kit is great, and the changes to her W and R are cool buff. \n\nShe is currently pretty good, and with the buffs prob gunna be a bit better.\n\nBut to stick to you're thread I was a lil disappointed that no passive change was done, but other than that it doesnt hurt anyone to update her model and just buff her kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Alzon","date":"2019-03-04T21:08:05.533+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"-5 Base movespeed on a catcher though.
