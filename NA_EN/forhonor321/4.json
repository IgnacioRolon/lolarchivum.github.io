And, to a degree, I do believe we've made some good progress the last time I posted one of these.\r\n\r\nThe list is as follows:\r\n\r\n{{champion:77}}  - 1325 days\r\n{{champion:72}} {{champion:101}}  - 1299 days\r\n{{champion:26}}  - 1285 days\r\n{{champion:35}} {{champion:82}}  - 1275 days\r\n{{champion:421}}  - 1240 days\r\n{{champion:266}} - 1212 days\r\n{{champion:20}}  - 1138 days\r\n{{champion:38}}  - 1128 days\r\n\r\nChamps within the 100 day limit:\r\n{{champion:57}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:223}}  - 959 days\r\n{{champion:14}}  - 946 days\r\n{{champion:56}}  - 925 days\r\n{{champion:102}} {{champion:203}}  - 904 days\r\n\r\n({{champion:127}}  would be on this list but her new skin is coming out soon)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow, this is merely for data and the view of time, as I always say. Champs that are very outdated and need updates, such as Mord, should generally be avoided for new skins until they are updated. However, there could be special cases to add skins to aged champs such as Fiddlesticks. Not saying that this is guaranteed to happen to those champs, but it's plausible. As well, champs that are currently being reworked or have been reworked now, such as Kayle &amp; Morgana or Aatrox, should be looked at for receiving new skins as they will be up to date in terms of rigging, models, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd, because there will always be that one person, I'm going to make this clear on my standpoint:** A VGU/champ rework does not mean the champ has received new skins!** It does not add any new skin to their roster, it only updates their pre-existing skins.  E.G. Aatrox was generally reworked to have a near identical look to his original form and most of his skins are pratically, if not, identical to what they were before. Are there any skins that are added to his roster that were not there before his rework? No. Urgot was updated and his Crabgot skin was changed to fit a different theme from B-movie monster film to Pacific Rim/Kaiju theme. Was the theme changed slightly? Yes. Did this actually change how many skins he had before his rework? NO! \r\n\r\nVGUs are generally going to change the aesthetic and look of the base champ and in turn that's going to affect how their other skins will look, it's basically a fucking redesign. That does not mean that you can say \"oh, these are just their new skins!\" Stop! It doesn't! It's a redesign to fit better with the new direction the champ has taken. Nothing new was added to their skin line that stands out from what they already had. I'm sick of people trying to say this so I'm putting my foot down and trying to make this clear as possible.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOK, rant out of the way, I'm happy that we've gotten some of the higher tier candidates off the list. BUT, at the same time, it's concerning on the number of champs that have made it into the 100 day limit. I really do hope that some of those champs can be considered for skins sometime 'cause I don't want the 1000 days list to start growing again.\r\n\r\nThoughts? Opinions? Discuss them down below. I need to start on some assignments before they're due in the next few weeks.","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2018-11-16T22:12:14.100+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like 959 days is incorrect for maokai because he got a skin pretty much 2 years ago","replies":[{"poster":"Forhonor321","date":"2018-11-16T22:43:28.742+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you're referring to his Victorious skin, I don't count those.

I heard rumors about that for both that skin and Dark Star Cho'Gath.\n\nRegarding the Victorious skins, I think that there should be a future event where they allow the previous Victorious skins to be bought for a very limited time (maybe for the 10th year anniversary, as a once-per-decade event). Like, imagine all the current Jarvan mains that can't complete their skin collection because they didn't happen to be around in Season 1. And me, as a Graves main, only started League late last year, so I have no chance of ever getting that glorious knight Graves skin. Perhaps it could be true for other limited skins too, like Rusty Blitzcrank as you mentioned, or other ones like King Rammus and PAX Twisted Fate.","replies":[{"poster":"Forhonor321","date":"2018-11-19T08:51:52.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt Prestige KDA Kai'Sa will come back as a gemstone. Cho'Gath wasn't really a limited skin, it was a skin made in partnership with the Make-A-Wish foundation and Bryan, the guy who wanted it. It was available for purchase with processed going to charity essentially. After this, they decided to make it a gemstone skin to still allow players access it.\n\nLimited implies that there's only a handful of that product that can be distributed or obtained through a certain time frame. After they're all gone or the timer runs out, then it can no longer be obtained. If what you say about the skin is true, then it isn't truly limited, but Riot has stated that it is.\n\nAs to the Victorious skins, I have to disagree on and Riot will also disagree. Victorious skins are a reward you get for climbing the ladder in league to a certain point. It's something you earn. If Riot was going to allow these skins to be purchasable, then those that got them from Season 1+ would feel ripped as climbing for these skins didn't matter if they could just purchase them in the future and would seriously degrade the value of these skins of just \"wait a certain time to buy them with no feeling of accomplishment\" rather than, \"I'm climbed at least to gold and get a reward for my progress.\"\n\nSimilarly, this goes for Rusty Blitz, King Rammus and PAX TF. Rammus you got as a beta tester, PAX you got for being at that special event and Rusty Blitz...was just a really bad skin that they decided to get rid of since it's basically the equivalent of a chroma back then. However, Riot has made some exceptions to this in a degree, mainly with slightly tweaked versions of those skins (E.G. Championship Riven 2016, Neo PAX Sivir). It's plausible (but not fully possible) for Riot to try this with these other skins while keeping the originals what they are, but seeing how they haven't done this for quite some time and that I can't see how they could do that with these skins, I doubt that can happen.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2018-11-16T23:30:33.952+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Forhonor321,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=T8MAhdBX,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-11-16T22:43:28.742+0000)\n>\n> If you&#x27;re referring to his Victorious skin, I don&#x27;t count those.

And thus make him a bit more of an animal whether he is more of a bat thing or bird man.\n\n{{champion:26}}  God clock Zilean is just a cool little idea I had in my name that I thought would be a funny spin on the set to add a support to it. Alternatively I would like Three pointer Zilean. A basketball skin to join Dunkmaster Darius. His ult sign could be water bottles, his bombs that are basketballs should make a swish sound when you land the stun, his speed boost should have the squicky sneaker sound, and ofcourse the giant clock on his back is a scoreboard!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frostfel","date":"2018-11-17T23:27:32.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sad to say but {{champion:82}} will not get a new skin until his VGU which could take anyway from 1 year (not on road-map) - forever, and I'm guessing thats mostly because Riot doesn't know how to re-make Morde.","replies":[{"poster":"EdgeLady","date":"2018-11-18T00:33:40.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Frostfel,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=T8MAhdBX,comment-id=0016,timestamp=2018-11-17T23:27:32.175+0000)\n>\n> Sad to say but {{champion:82}} will not get a new skin until his VGU which could take anyway from 1 year (not on road-map) - forever, and I&#x27;m guessing thats mostly because Riot doesn&#x27;t know how to re-make Morde.\n\nThe current roadmap only goes until about March (the likely time when the new Demacian champion will come out), so it's very possible that Mordekaiser could be the next thing after that.
