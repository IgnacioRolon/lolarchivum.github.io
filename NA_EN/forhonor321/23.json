{"poster":"Forhonor321","date":"2016-07-28T05:02:44.995+0000","title":"Does Shyvana need an Update?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"As someone who pretty much mains her and has the highest mastery with her over all others champions, I can say that she is by far my favorite champion to play. But with the recent patch it&#039;s just hasn&#039;t been the same. I mean ok her ult now charges faster at the first 2 ranks now, that&#039;s nice, but in the end it&#039;s just another band aid fix to her, like Liss and Xin, just to keep her a somewhat decent pick. On top of that I just feel like shes just been nerfed for a while and these small buffs just don&#039;t do anything. I mean lets look at her recent patch history for a moment: \n\n*  6.6 - Twin bite gets nerfed\n\n*  6.9 - Devourer gets removed (Big ouch) \n\n*  6.10 - They add a AP ratio to her W \n\n* This patch - slightly faster ult regen\n\nBasically what I see from this is just heavy nerfs to her and insignificant buffs. Riot didn&#039;t really do anything to her Q nerf after devourer got removed and so basically she got Sejuani&#039;d, but far worse since a core item for her got removed. On top of that, they then add the AP ratio to try and make up for the devour effect on {{item:3124}}  and convince people to buy it on her, but the item itself is far too expensive for her path and doesn&#039;t provide anything but slowly increasing AD and AP damage. And that&#039;s just the changes to her. Looking back on what she has it&#039;s not much:\n\nPros\n\n*  Tanky\n\n*  Good damage\n\n*  Fairly decent early dueling, counter jungling potential, and great clear speed\n\n*  Being a dragon (Fuck Yeah) \n\nCons\n\n* No CC whatsoever (not even a slow) (_correction, no CC pre-6 but even then its not that good_)\n\n*  Fairly clunky ult (that is also non-uninterruptible)\n\n*  Extremely weak early ganks\n\n*  Farm heavy and item dependent\n\nWhen you compare the two, its not hard to understand why most people pick other junglers over her. While she does have good pros, the cons when looked over closely outweigh them. She really doesn&#039;t have any CC. ~~I&#039;ve literally checked every single champion on the wiki and she&#039;s the only one that doesn&#039;t have any~~ (_Another correction, there are other champions that don't have CC like Kat and Yi and she does have CC on her ult, but let's be honest its not that good_). And that brings us to the next problems. Her early ganks are so bad without her ult. You basically have to hope that your teammate understands that they have to engage first on the opponent if shes ganking you pre-6. Even with that she doesn&#039;t have anything to keep them locked in your gank, except taking {{summoner:6}}  or {{summoner:3}}  instead of {{summoner:4}}  to keep up with them. If not you have to rely on farming for items later on in the gamelike {{item:3022}} {{item:3153}}. And the ult.....good god as much as I love this champ I somewhat hate this ability. It can be so easily countered by any sort of CC and the **dragging of your enemies** doesn&#039;t feel like it works half the time, like they go halfway for me (course that might just be me). And don&#039;t even get me started on her with Bloodrazor. It just feels like a joke to me. I actually have more comfort taking Cinderhulk over it.\n\nIn short, one of my most beloved champs just feels like crap right now. Granted, she still is pretty good but with everything I just pointed out its just got me in a depressing mood. I just feel like there needs to be a rework or something for her soon because it just makes me grit my teeth to see Riot just band aid champions like this, especially to my main. I even remember them taking about having her and Olaf part of some future juggernaut update they may do for them. If they have any intention to do any of this then here&#039;s a list of what I feel needs to happen:\n\n1.  **Keep burnout and the concept of dragon transformation** - The transformation is a no brainer but burnout I feel could be a questionable thing for people but I say keep it. It&#039;s a core essential to her kit and identity. ( I would also say keep twin bite, but I have mixed feelings about it at the moment.) \n\n2.  **Try adding some new abilities to her** - I&#039;ve never liked her E that much even though it provides % health damage on AA when you land it and the passive is ok but I feel like there could be some better abilities that they can come up with her. Maybe even have her turning into a dragon be a little more exciting then just flying in a straight line.\n\n3.  **Give her some CC** - This I feel has always been the issue when people play Shyvana. Give her at least some sort of slow. Seriously, why does every other fucking champion have some sort of slow or other CC but she&#039;s left in the gutter? \n\n4.  **Try allowing her to return to top** - As much as I love playing her in the jungle I always wanted to try her in top lane. But with the current state of top laners added along with her right now I just don&#039;t ever think its a good idea to do it, even for fun. I&#039;ve even heard that back in season 3 she was fairly decent so it&#039;d just be nice to see her make a return rather then completely become a jungle only champ.\n\n5. **If her ult remains the same, make it uninterruptible** - already discussed it above and this says it all. Next.\n\n6. ** Model update** - This is more personal preference but most of her current models besides her championship and new super galaxy and possibly ice drake just seem out of date, especially her base skin. It just looks like the old splash art she had before. Just having look a little more like the new art would just be nice. As well as having the other skins have a little touch up. I&#039;d even say maybe update her voice over, either someone new or even the same one, but one thing at a time. (_Side note: do you think we could also get some skins that show her original skin? Literally every other skin she has depicts her as a normal human, because fan service, but it&#039;d just be nice to see another skin showing off her original colors besides her base. Again this is just personal preference._)\n\nSo what do you guys think? Do you completely agree, disagree, neutral?

The only game I won was due to a 4v5 situation and the enemy team surrendered.\n\nPrior to these 6 games, I only had a 40% Win Rate on Shyvana. It was a respectable 50% back in the Devourer days, but I've certainly noticed the decline. There is pretty much no coming back if your team loses the early game in Shyvana's current state. While some might argue that's a risk you take with every farming jungler, Shyvana doesn't really have a purchasable item that makes her relevant or a meaningful level 6 power spike. \n\nI'm at the point where I think I will drop Shyvana once I hit Lvl 5 Mastery (even if I have to lose another ten games to get there). She doesn't have the tools in her kit to be the jungler most teams need. There are better tanks and there are better fighters. With Vi, Poppy, Sejuani and Irelia already at Lvl 5... I can't see myself ever using Shyvana over one of them.\n\nShyvana is the first jungler that I have considered kicking to top lane. With Bloodrazor feeling worthless on her and poor scalings that don't really encourage Warrior/Runic Echo builds, the reasonable thing to build has been Cinderhulk. This is almost a word for word description of Hecarim (and Irelia if you jungle with her). The last couple games I tried building her identical to Irelia (finish Tri-Force before Cinderhulk), but I didn't see any improvement. I simply cannot gank with this champion. Can't get to my targets and can't stick to them even if I luckily get on them. \n\nImprovement suggestions...\n\nAdd a slow to burnout. I don't ever want to buy Frozen Mallet just for a chance to keep up with my opponents. While Cinder/Mallet is a very good combination on any tank jungler, Shyvana has too weak of an early game in terms of ganks that it won't make a difference. If you farm for the combination, your team could very well lose the game by then (or it won't matter since the enemy will be able to stand and fight you anyways). Many of my other junglers (Poppy, Vi) that go this route will have a couple assists to speed up things. Shyvana's complete lack of a gap closer pre6 rarely yield anything but wasted time. I think if burnout had a slow, she might have a slight better chance of getting something out of an overextended lane.\n\nIn the meantime, I've been trying out Exhaust instead of Flash. No real improvement, but hasn't been detrimental either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2016-07-31T04:21:39.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was just looking at her champion.gg page and have a few thoughts.\n\n1.

Mostly I would love to see her E changed. She is a dragon, yet her breath weapon feels incredibly lacking and while I have little doubt the on hit effect is pretty decent it does not feel good to E someone and watch barely a blip on their health bar. \n\nOther than that I would love to make her feel more powerful in her \"dragon\" form (I use that term very loosely as no full blooded dragon in the Lol universe even remotely looks like that \"dragon\" form) and for reasons I just stated I would love to see her dragon form be brought more in line with the actual dragons in the game. Not Aurelion obviously, but she does not even have the same number of limbs as the dragons of the Summoners Rift what with her forelimbs pulling double duty as wings. Her ult says she transforms into a dragon not some damn more dragon than human hybrid.\n\nPersonal feeling rant over I feel she shoul feel more powerful in her dragon form, kind of like Nasus and Renekton popping ult makes people back the fuck off unless supremely confident. Shyvana's ult makes her better at dealing AoE damage and that is mostly all.","replies":[{"poster":"Gesterr","date":"2016-07-28T19:17:00.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except she literally is a human/dragon hybrid in every way with a human mother and dragon father.  Possibly a lore reason as to why her form is a bit unique such as keeping the number of limbs from her human-heritage.  A visual update along with changes to her ult to make it more than literally the same spells but AOE.  Honestly I'd be fine with her ult giving a chunk of bonus HP like Gnar's passive and the sand brother ults since she would like to build at least one damage item early, maybe two but that leaves her squishy for when she gets into a skirmish or teamfight, it'd allow her to build more like toplane Gnar or Renekton without being gimped for doing so if she doesn't snowball off of her first item purchase.","replies":[{"poster":"Lumen Sage","date":"2016-07-29T16:58:41.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Dragon's** Descent\n\nActive: Shyvana transforms into a **dragon** and dashes to the target location, Airborne carrying all enemies she runs through towards her destination and dealing them magic damage.\n\nHer ultimate ability states she transforms into a dragon, not half-dragon, not dragon hybrid, **dragon**. Dragon hybrid is what she is per default. Yet, as I have stated, design-wise her dragon form does not match up to any dragon design in the league. \n\nIt is  a pet peeve, no doubt about that, but it just bothers me so much since it makes the first dragon champion of the league not even look like a dragon...\n\nBonus health would to an extend be fine, I would not even mind trading in some AoE power for more tankiness.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"hRnrBbWoTr","date":"2016-07-28T07:09:18.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main Shyvana in the jungle with my full attackspeed and 2% crit.

I wrote a similar post because of the frustration. My kit rework idea would be to let q apply a slow when used on an enemy marked with flame breath.
