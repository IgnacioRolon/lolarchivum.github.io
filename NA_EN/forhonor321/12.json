Basically pay 1000 extra RP for the icon and get one free gemstone. Worthless to anyone who already has multiple gemstones and all the gem skins or doesn&#039;t want any gem skins.\r\n\r\n* Puppy Nasus Icon locked behind bundle for golden token for gold chroma if you want for 540. Easy outlet to gather one of those chromas and the icon for their combined prices (except if you just want the icon)\r\n\r\n* Puppy Nasus/Warwick Wards behind bundle exclusively for extra orbs and tokens. Granted, doing the math, it does save you money (640 ward, 750 (revel orb &amp; 4 tokens 250 x3), 290 for golden chroma token from before = 1680 for price of 1500) but still if you don&#039;t want the bundle, you shouldn&#039;t be forced to buy it if you just want the ward.\r\n\r\nAnd now lets get into something a bit more contriversal: the loading borders and new Lunar chromas:\r\n\r\n* Loading borders either are 64 tokens, so only one if you go through the missions and don&#039;t want to save for gold chroma, or **an extra 425 if you buy the base bundle, which they&#039;re only available in!**. WHY!?!?! Didn&#039;t we already have this issue in the last Star Guardian event about buying the loading borders and through bundles? Did Riot seriously not learn from that? We got all three loading borders from last PROJECT event, why not make it the same here?\r\n\r\n* Red chroma for skins exclusive through bundle + extra 425 for loading border as before if you want to grab all of that together. Why make one particular chroma only exclusive through a god damn bundle but only for a limited time? Why start implementing this rule of marketing now? What is this, SMITE?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd once again, you can only gain 96 total from all the mission in this, so you can only get one loading border or chroma from token technically for free. So it all comes down to:\r\n\r\n- Want rest of chromas, buy orbs + bundles to get them and either use regular tokens to upgrade to golden or get lucking in the orbs. \r\n- Want rest of loading borders, buy orbs and/or bundles to get them.\r\n\r\nWhile we&#039;re at it, let&#039;s look over the prices of these bundles and whatnot with the [calculator](http://rptousd.com/) of nearest pricing:\r\n\r\n- Puppy Ward bundles (1500 RP = $10.71, $21.42 for both)\r\n- Nasus Puppy Icon (540 RP = $4.15)\r\n- Warwick Puppy Icon (1250 RP = $9.06)\r\n- Legendary Loot Bundle (5500 RP = $38.19)\r\n- Base Lunar Bundles with Skin and Border (1775 RP = $12.68, $38.04 for all three)\r\n- Year of the Dog Bundle (4686 RP = $32.80)\r\n- Chroma bundles w/o loading border ( 2225 RP (Nasus &amp; WW) = $15.89, $31.78 for both, 2420 RP (Lux) = $17.29, $49.07 total)\r\n- Chroma bundles with loading border ( 2650 RP (Nasus &amp; WW) = $18.93, $37.85 for both,  2845 RP (Lux) = $19.91, $57.77 total)\r\n\r\nSo if we wanted to get the new Lux, Nasus and WW skins (which we will count as already having the champs) with borders (while saving tokens we gain from missions for one gold chroma) and also want all the other chromas, we would roughly need to buy 8145 RP, which as calculated is roughly around $57.77 dollars, or buy the year of the dog bundle at 4686 ($32.80) and then buy all the regular chromas, which would roughly be around 2830 RP or $19.81 for a grand total of $52.61 (might be a bit wrong in my math so don&#039;t come beating my head around saying I was wrong in prices). \r\n\r\n**But that&#039;s just if we&#039;re wanting the new skins, borders and chromas with them. **If we also want the icons, or wards, we need to drop another $34.63 worth of RP on top of the $52.61. And if you want the other gold chromas, well then I&#039;m going to wish you luck on that because the orbs will more than likely drop random amounts or random chances of gold tokens and who knows what the statistics of those are. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m severely disappointed in Riot. I am. I thought that they learned their lesson of having borders being bought rather than gaining them for free and keep them out of bundles only. I thought they learned this with the last PROJECT event. And worst off, with how the game is right now, being nearly un-enjoyable to play for many/most, them being greedy with this event is really put more of a dent of my respect for them even more now. I&#039;m almost ashamed to be hanging on to this game if they&#039;re going to try this while the game is at (arguably) the worst it&#039;s been now.\r\n\r\nAnd I really don&#039;t want to spend money to them to continue supporting this kind of marketing behavior, whether or not the game is in a terrible state.","replies":[{"poster":"muh Shroom","date":"2018-02-08T21:46:30.822+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":34,"body":"or you could just, I don't know, not buy literally everything that comes out?\nespecially if you say you don't want to support the game. it's fine, you don't need to the game is free. just don't buy every skin or border or useless icon or that extra gemstone.\nalso, what if the point of the borders so that you only pick one? it's the same deal with the golden chromas. having only one makes it more special, picking either your favorite champ, or just skin.\nyou're completely overreacting, and also acting like a baby.","replies":[{"poster":"Late For Tea","date":"2018-02-08T22:17:25.610+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=muh Shroom,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=f28o2BJ5,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-02-08T21:46:30.822+0000)\n>\n> or you could just, I don&#x27;t know, not buy literally everything that comes out?\n\nThere is always someone who brings this argument up, and they never realize how ridiculous it is. This isn't about wanting to own \"everything\". This is about wanting to own a particular something, but being forced into buying useless crap if you want to have said something. This is about just wanting the option to buy a specific item.\nI for example really just want the wards and the Puppy Warwick Icon. But I am not going to pay 2.5-5x the regular price just because a buttload of junk is included in the bundle. What does this have to do with feeling the need to own everything? I couldn't care less about the champion skins, champion icons, borders and all the other crap. I don't even want the free stuff. What I want is very simple.\n\nRiot certainly has the right to continue with these greedy business strategies, no one is going to stop them. But at the same time it is well within our rights to voice our opinion when we disagree with their decisions. There is really no reason to kiss Riot's behind and pretend like this kind of stuff is cool. \n\nIf you don't like people complaining about it, just don't visit such topics.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2018-02-09T14:39:10.765+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":20,"body":"And your argument is also pointless.\nA chocolate company offers you a box of chocolates (a product) that has a variety of flavors in it and you just want either 1 piece of chocolate from the said box or a specific variety of chocolates with your type of flavor.

The chocolate company chooses to sell it's flavors as a set, just in the same way that Riot chooses to sell its _ART_ in a set. Riot is manufacturing something (art, programming, digital content) and then choosing how to sell it. Art is not free, as a lot of people seem to forget, and maybe they wanted to have their content have a bit more exclusivity this year. And do remember, you are the consumer in this scenario, and they are the company. If you want a particular product (especially one that's limited edition) you need to buy in the way that it's available. You do not have the luxury nor do you have the jurisdiction to determine how Riot should be selling their products to their consumers. This scenario is no different than any other scenario over the years where people choose to buy crazy things just for one specific collector's item. Get over it, it's been how exclusive merchandise works for decades, and I see no reason why you're raking Riot over the coals for the exact same thing. \n\nDo remember, the content you're complaining about is purely aesthetic content, not relevant to playing the game.

Contrary to the backwards way retail may have people thinking, the customer is not always right. Or at the very least, the _loud_ customers aren't always right.\n\nYou may not like it, and a lot of people on the boards might not like it. That's what, 40 people tops? Riot has thousands of players, if not tens of thousands. They run statistics after their events and things to figure out what sells and what doesn't sell - that's how businesses operate. If they've learned that from the past 3 events that solo ward skins don't sell as well as ward skins in a bundle with other things, what does that tell them as a company? It tells them that they will make MORE money if they bundle ward skins, because their data is telling them that people are willing to spend more money on a bundle than they are to spend a little money on a single item. So even if you, or this very loud collective are screaming that \"RIOT IS GREEDY! RIOT DOESN'T SELL ME WHAT I WANT HOW I WANT IT!,\" their data might show a completely contrary story, and there will probably be people who might not want to buy a ward skin by itself as compared to buying it in a bundle (you'll have to spend at least $10 to buy a ward skin since it's over the $5 RP quantity, but the marketing caveat there is that you could probably be willing to spend that entire $10 on a bundle with the ward skin if it landed you extra stuff at a deal since you're having to spend $10 anyway). Your views as a consumer are just that - as _A_ consumer, and not as the buying population of League of Legends as a whole. They have the data they need to determine how their products will sell better, and sometimes it might not appeal to everyone, but will probably appeal to more people in general.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mast0r Beith","date":"2018-02-08T22:09:44.799+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":21,"body":"Dont forget that youre not forced to buy any of these since all of this is only cosmetic. \nRito somehow has to make money with League and skins are a player friendly way to do so, even if certain skins are behind a paywal. \nAnd not to forget you can do so much more without money then you could have done some years ago since there are now crates and stuff you can get champs, skins, emotes etc. from. \n\nGot my Pulsfire Ez that way, so i think its kind of unfair to blame rito for that \n\nBtw. first post here so, Hi :D","replies":[{"poster":"LightIsMyPath","date":"2018-02-09T02:55:54.309+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am not FORCED to buy cosmetic, I WANT to buy cosmetics.

There was a lot more complicated things you had to buy if you wanted other collectors items, or places you had to go, or kits and special bundles you had to buy (and that persists today - Comic Con exclusives and whatnot), so I don't particularly see the big deal here or why you're asking Riot to be flogged in the streets for something that is a norm in the collector's marketplace.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sihari","date":"2018-02-08T23:45:15.702+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thats exactly the problem that I had with the snowdown items.\nI really wanted the cute penguin- and poro-icon, but they had to be fused together with that super expensive gemstone that I really dont need.\nNow I cry a bit every time I see someone with one of them... \n(And RIOT should also cry a tiny bit, because they totaly missed out on the money I would have payed for these icons, if they hadnt tryed to trick me into buying more than I want to!) \n\nAnd now they try to do the same thing with the cute puppy icons?

This isn't abount \"don't spend money if you don't want it\" but rather \"you should accept whatever deal you're given.\" In addition, Riot has made much of these things exclusive and time-based. While the skins will come back, there's no telling if the chroma or the icons will come back. OP might be backed into a corner and forced to get something he'd want now, even if it's in a deal he doesn't want, because nobody knows if he can get it at a later date.\n\n>Point: \"Just don't buy everything you see.\"\n\nCounterpoint: Certain things come in certain bundles. This means that even if he just wants two icons he has to spend far more than he would just to get all of them. Same goes for the exclusive chromas: If he wants the red one, he has to buy the specific bundle. This is again not an argument about **wanting to get everything with a bundle** but rather **wanting to get a specific thing but having to buy the bundle.**\n\n>Point: \"Riot is a company and has to make sales.\"\n\nCounterpoint: They can do so in a more consumer-friendly way. While I think they're both scummy, there's a huge difference between Overwatch loot boxes and Battlefront 2's loot boxes which color peoples opinions on them. Plus, despite the mission system, OP has to sink money in. You can love League and even Riot but hitting a paywall is never fun.\n\n\nAll that said, I'm in somewhat agreement with OP. While I get that Riot wants to make/offer exclusive content with bundles, it's something Riot should let players customize to a degree. It would encourage more sales and you never feel like you're getting stuff you don't want, as you can tweak and purchase content in a way that fits your desires.

And that skins are what keep it going?\n\nSkins, wards, icons and all the other stuff have a base price that reflects their actual value (e.g. time it took to make). These prices are fine and we'd have no problem buying said content at the designated price.\n\nHowever the problem arises when this content is locked into bundles with useless junk that no-one would otherwise buy. It is an attempt to get people to spend more money than they actually would. It reflects pure greed, because it is no longer about \"keeping the game going\" but core capitalism: making more money than you know what to do with.\nThere was a recent article (I believe it was circulating on reddit) that showed LoL is the highest grossing F2P game worldwide. The present issue has absolutely nothing to do with keeping the game going, because the game is doing more than fine.\n\nBut sure, if you want to play this card. Yes the game is free, and its exactly that that screws over the paying players. The players that actually keep this game going. Because they will continously have to pay more if they want the same content.","replies":[{"poster":"Crimsonkapa","date":"2018-02-09T00:37:05.793+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":5,"body":"Accounting major here. First of all everyone brings this up on the boards as a counter argument and it's a total non-sequitur; just because League is the highest grossing F2P game in the world, you have NO IDEA about actual net profits/expenses/growth curves from that stat. None. Zip. Zero. They could be losing money because they want to pay their employees an above market wage, or ISP's could be shafting them driving up their overhead. Don't make assumptions about Riots finances that we can't know, especially when it really is a FREE game at heart and a company by definition exists to make money. That's life.\n\nYou make it sound like you would rather pay a subscription for Lol instead because somehow bundling cosmetics \"screws over\" the players. This, in my opinion, is nuts.","replies":[{"poster":"Late For Tea","date":"2018-02-09T08:59:06.739+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are right, I have absolutely no idea about Riot's expenditure, so all I do is making assumptions based on the information I have. Considering Riot would never release such information, it is the best I can do. But how is saying \"they need the money to keep the game going\" any different? It is also just an assumption.\nAnother assumption incoming: Digital Extreme also develops a F2P game called Warframe. Compared to LoL, ALL of their content can actually be obtained for free in a fairly reasonable way. On top of that they produce a buttload more content than Riot does, while likely making less money. And they are still doing fine. (No need to bring up the story about having to maximize profit because of shareholders, I've heard it all before).\n\nYou make think my opinion is nuts, but it certainly has some merit. Lets say that previously I could get the skins I wanted for $15 a month. But now that Riot can no longer support the game with all these F2P players, they are putting everything behind a paywall to make more money. Now I have to pay $30 a month to get the skins I wanted, because I'd have to buy useless junk as well. So yes, the paid players would be \"screwed over\" because of these F2P players.\nDo I actually want to suggest a subscription? No, I am fine with F2P players. All I just want is for Riot to get rid of these paywalls and let me buy the stuff I want. But everytime the F2P players (disclaimer: not specifically refering to you) grab their pitchforks and moan that we have no right to complain, while they themselves actually do very little to support the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Crimsonkapa","date":"2018-02-10T00:59:01.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're comparing apples to oranges, the playerbase size and company size difference between Riot and Digital Extreme is massive and shouldn't be compared if you're looking at expenses. And I actually play warframe so I can tell you that they do bundle stuff as well and it's probably what makes them the most money. \n\nSecond, its pure hyperbole to say \"everything\" is being put behind a paywall because it really isn't, a single chroma or a single icon is hardly everything Riot creates. Real paywalls are like how HOTS uses their bundle loot boxes as the ONLY way to get skins/announcers/banners. Heck, up till 2 years ago League had no where near this much content (icons, chromed, ward skins, even regular skins) being made on a regular basis, and it wasn't possible to get ANY for free, up until hextech chests.\n\n\nJust so you know I'm not you're average complaining F2P player, I'm a whale who's spent over $1000 on this game, I am very much a paying player. \n\nMy point is that you can say you personally don't like the \"paywalls\", but saying something like \"Riot is greedy\" or \"they make plenty of profit\" is pure fallacy that cannot be supported by any logical argument, we just don't know enough.
