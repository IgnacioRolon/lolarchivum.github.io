Not maybe, Idk, reducing the time it takes for her to get max stacks? A small delay when gaining stacks so she doesn&#039;t dash 3 times on your ass while you get stunned? Maybe increasing the stack max as another person suggested? Any other possibilities that you could of think up?\r\n\r\nWhy is it that when a champ seems problematic, Riot thinks they should remove what made that champ unique to begin with? Look back at Ornn, he had a unique thing for Unstoppable, which Riot then removed. Granted, yes they brought it back but at certain costs. And yet they&#039;re willing to have some champs keep things that really should never be allowed, like Akali as previously said with having a perma invisible stealth or camoflauge (whatever the fuck it is idkoc) and dive under towers with it. That is seen as more healthy than a champ who has a niche against shield comps and a unique ult mechanic?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m really questioning how Riot determines what unique aspects are worth keeping and what need to go.\r\n\r\nIdk, discuss.","replies":[{"poster":"Hayaishi2","date":"2019-01-15T16:09:07.111+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":12,"body":"Disarm and damage to shields don't make Irelia unique.

I'd hardly consider it worth emphasizing the Enchanter class for the tool, it didn't have to do with their dominance, else they'd have done a sweeping change to Enchanters (which they did) or introduce anti-shield item effects. You don't redesign one champion to have a frivolous counter against an entire class when they're having an uprising, and I hope to god that wasn't the rationale.\n\nSimply put, it was redesigned that way to make it look like her passive was being phased from one purpose to another. Problem is, it's not a visible source of her power anybody can detect by its nature. It's just bad design, and that's why it's going away.\n\nOn the other hand, her ultimate is a bit flimsy after this, but the disarm was never the way to go about it. Her non-ultimate kit has too much natural power, and it is honestly a shame they decided to pick from her ultimate. However, they essentially decided to do with her what they did with Fiora - Add somewhat minimal power and utility on top of a kit that can power its way through multiple enemies without an ultimate. Both champions are designed to optimally kill straggling solo champions with ease, and they do that by having their kill potential regardless of their ultimate being ready.\n\nShe needed to lose something. I am not really happy with it coming from the ultimate, though I'm guessing this is why they're doing it that way.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2019-01-17T04:58:45.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Warlord Rhinark,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eRmw9V4U,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-01-15T16:10:23.073+0000)\n>\n> Not with how they seem to be giving everyone a dash nowadays.\n\nthe way she does it is completely different from every other champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2019-01-17T07:00:08.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sandsexual,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eRmw9V4U,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2019-01-17T04:58:45.307+0000)\n>\n> the way she does it is completely different from every other champion.\n\nYasuo's E is pretty similar.","replies":[{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2019-01-17T12:58:39.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Warlord Rhinark,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eRmw9V4U,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2019-01-17T07:00:08.886+0000)\n>\n> Yasuo&#x27;s E is pretty similar.\n\nnot really, it's shorter range and it's not his main damage tool.

The shroud it's self is fine and certainly icnonic, but the 'true stealth' thing doesn't feel neccesary, and the paired with the rest of her low counterplay kit it can get very frustraiting to face.\nMaybe they should swap it with her ult, give her a dash+damage(maybe a quick dash in a line and then a delayed damage in that line) in her basekit and make the smokescreen a highish CD ult so disengageing and waiting it out actually means something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MorgManBasher","date":"2019-01-16T20:00:45.818+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can't understand just how overloaded irelia's kit is where she doesn't need all this extra fat, I don't know what to tell you.\n\nHonestly some things should be stripped from akali's kit as well.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2019-01-16T22:06:58.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Especially mechanics that aren't meaningful but bring a lot of power. \n\nI feel the disarming mechanic of Irelia's ult to be difficult to read with all the particles happening with her ult in the moment. I just don't think it adds much to her kit, thematically, but it's a lot of extraneous power. That's an easy decision to clip imo.\n\nI'm not sure what I think the analogous aspects of Akali's kit are. That may be why they are slower on her. Gotta remember that Riot's priorities aren't just about balance; thematic consistency is also a part of the design philosophy, and Akali's shroud is a huge part of her identity.

They are bullshit arguments, because its highly subjective.\nVague language like this allows them do to whatever changes they want to do, which giving an actual argument, but, have some of the players defend them.\nAnd its not just a riot problem, this problem is wide spread in games, politics, schools, etc.\nAs language keeps \"losing\" its power (as an example, on facebook, you can set your gender/sex to charmander if you want to RAWR hahahaha)\n\nVague language is often seductive.\nFor this is the reason it creates some sort of attraction towards itself, as, everyone can, what's the word, oh right, project, their own reality on it and have it mean what they want it to mean.\n\nExamples: for some, Diana is an assassin, a vengeful girl wanting to destroy that which caused her suffering. For others, she's a fighter, a bruiser that stays in fights and constantly attacks the enemy because she has anger issues (among other issues). For others she's just a bullshit unfair character that kills them or its useless. etc.\n\nBottom line is: \ninstead of giving real arguments. Riot will resort to \"argue\" about unique, identity and fantasy of playing xxx champion instead of giving you the reason they are doing that change. And they do that to well, lower the disagreement in the community with their own changes.\nIts a manipulation tactic as old as humanity itself. But still works ofc.\n\n\n\nPS: there's few such things as \"facts\". Generally because in order to interpret those \"Facts\" you need a framework of interpretation (Generally called context). Riot skips the \"context\" and just give you a vague \"fact\" resulting in their change ----> their change was entirely subjective and had nothing to do with the reason they gave.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eranell","date":"2019-01-16T05:15:14.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A very much overlooked aspect of Irelia's lane dominance in my oppinion is, that her Q also has a heal that procs from everything and benefits from life steal (mainly dorans blade, if you dont go for corruping potion from the beginning). As soon as you have trinity force your Q heals for more than it costs mana. \n\nDuellists/Bruisers shouldn't be able to stay in lane indefinitely just through their kit. Darius and Fiora at least have to hit the enemy champion to proc their heal. If you cant out-duel Irelia from 100-0 half way into the laning phase she heals faster than you can say f*ck.\n\nSame goes for Akali. There is no reason for her Q to have a heal especially since she uses energy as a resource. If you really want an assassin to have some heal do it in the way Riot did it with Talon and Kha'Zix. Moderate cooldown, makes you vulnerable to enemy poke, actually costs you ressources and doesn't scale with their prefered stat whatsoever but instead solely with champion level/ability rank.\n\nHaving Gunblade as rushed core item on Akali gives her an absurd amount of heals for an assassin, making poke against her almost meaningless. Not to mention that the heal on her Q scales with its PREMITIGATION damage. I really think Riot underestimates the power of heals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2019-01-16T00:26:38.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why was AD Malzahar removed as a playstyle completely for his rework?
