She fits in the theme well, the skin itself I think is pretty good, and the effects look nice. It's {{champion:23}}  &amp; {{champion:11}} that I take issue with. Both skins just don't really feel that inspiring, at least to me. \r\n\r\nYi without his mask looks like a damn troll doll. and even with the mask he still looks dumb. The effects feel average, but considering on how linear he is I can't really blame that too much (I mean, how much further can they go to really make his animations/VFXs look amazing without turning him into legendary or unrecognizable?). \r\n\r\nTryndamere on the other hand I'm just wondering why they chose him. I mean...it's **Tryndamere**. One of the oldest champs in the game who's animations, visuals and VO are heavily outdated (not to mention that he's picked up attention a few times on the boards in the month about being stupid to play against). I honestly would of figured they would keep him on the sidelines until they got around to updating him to give him something better. This is kind of a scenario of where he's getting a new skin despite his age and issues, like Fiddlesticks, but because of his age and issues, the new skin just doesn't look that great, like Udyr or Lee. I mean, all of his skins, except Sultan if I recall, have janky animations. I know the preview is short but I guarantee if you compare it with his other skins, it'll feel like the same quality as the rest due to how he is animated.\r\n\r\nIdk, those are just my quick thoughts. I do like the Katarina skin (even though I don't play her) but the other two just feel lackluster. I would of loved to see something else like (if they didn't already get skins this year) Blood Moon {{champion:107}} or {{champion:48}}. Hell you could of tried throwing in {{champion:238}} and see how he would look in the skinline if you really wanted. Maybe you guys like them, maybe you're with me. Again, just my thoughts on the subject.","replies":[{"poster":"Ermisota","date":"2020-02-04T21:04:53.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2020-02-04T21:10:42.284+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like, I know this is a troll and everything but I'm just curious how a post saying \"I dislike this piece of content and think it would be better suited to someone else\" equates to \"liberal rainbow offended trash.\"\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Quiet Dude","date":"2020-02-04T21:11:24.885+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't get sucked in by it, he's projecting.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rowanstar","date":"2020-02-05T00:18:37.422+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ermisota,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=bplp3kHs,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2020-02-04T21:04:53.584+0000)\n>\n> LOL, I cant believe this is an actual post, holy shit this community is liberal rainbow offended trash.
