I actually don&#039;t see them too often\r\n\r\nThen Mages: Malz was fairly OP then nerfed now is support and getting nerf again to almost being unplayable, Vlad was just insanely stupid and is either the OP of the game or left in the gutter, Ziggs can **arguably** be problematic with his new kit and his rise in bot lane (though to be fair it does make good diversity and is insanely fun) oh, and Syndra was just a pain since she became extremely easy after that (before her recent nerfs).\r\n\r\nAnd of course, the recent assassin update: Rengar is still Rengar except now from what I hear he can build semi tanky thanks to his new passive damage boost, Leblanc continues to delete people and has a ridiculous range on her tether break, Fizz is kinda screwed up thanks to how his ult works now, Kha&#039;Zix is just gross to play against, the list goes on.\r\n\r\nJust... who else feels like whenever Riot does a class rework, something, if not the entire rework, is going to get screwed up or in the long run is not going to work as they&#039;d hoped?

I don't think you people understand what it means to have a failed update/rework and what it means to bring those champions to a more balance-able state for future buffs/nerfs. The point of Reworks is to bring major kit changes to a champion, revolving around their core identity and improving it while the point of Updates is to fix/address issues their kits had by introducing more balance levers Riot can pull, in order to balance them properly. _**Being out of balance does not inherently mean Riot failed in executing an update/rework.**_\n\n\n\n\nLeBlanc and Rengar are assassins.\nI don't know what you expected from their updates.\nTo not be assassins anymore? Delaying their damage is the only thing you can do because the entire class specializes in killing targets fast (burst damage). And the damage delay can't be so long that you have the time to escape them every time. it needs to be enough so that you can react to them, if you're prepared. If you're not, they should be rewarded with a kill.\n[Rengar and LeBlanc already have a set of nerfs for 7.3 PBE cycle.](http://www.surrenderat20.net/p/73-pbe-cycle.html)","replies":[{"poster":"NodirjonSattarov","date":"2017-02-06T02:45:04.157+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"So they shouldn't have reverted Kog'Maw?","replies":[{"poster":"Limrick","date":"2017-02-06T02:57:47.102+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"No, they should have made him do 55% effectiveness on-hit with W active.

Champions Riot sold on thematics (\"We never had a half dragon! How about a xenomorph?\") rather than actual kits. Compare someone like Ivern and Illaoi to a Season 2 release like Varus or Sejuani. The comparison isn't there. S3 onward blow most old champs out of the water in terms of raw design. Argue as much as you want but new releases bring much more to the game in terms of complexity, originality and uniqueness.\n\nNow, Class reworks aren't about \"balancing\" champs. If you think it is, you're silly. The point of these reworks is to carve more unique niches for these champions out and to focus on what makes them good. \n\nSo let's take the marksmen rework because it had the most \"incubation\" time. \n\n1.) Marksmen find their ways into roles OUTSIDE of bot lane, giving more options and diversity versus \"Every marksman is a botlaner\". (Graves jungle, Quinn top, corki mid, etc.) Such things should be embraced rather than cited as problematic.\n\n2.) The dominating marksmen, at the present time, are Varus, Ashe and Jhin. Note the comparisons: Long range marksmen with utility. Compare to the old trinity of Corki/Ezreal/Graves. All three....had abilities that dealt a ton of damage. As the meta shifts, it will be LESS about \"who is the best marksmen\" and more about \"Which marksmen fit the meta best\"\n\n3.) Marksmen overall have more build paths (or at least they did) and more options, even if not every option is a #1 pick. The zeal items for example have all been picked once or twice. Build paths alter based on purpose (CDR ER vs. IE) and game time (Early game lethality vs. late game crit)\n\nThe thing people \"don't\" get is that these aren't about balancing old champs. This is about carving unique niches for them...and hell, look at the mages. Mid was the most diverse pick at worlds amid a less-than-optimal choice. Zyra/Malz being bot makes other picks work such as MF support. Even with the assassin changes more mid-laners are picked and see play.\n\nIn the short term yes, it will suck. In the long term?

Riot is also learning important lessons from the class updates that will make future ones better.\n\nOf the four roster updates, the only one that was outright not successful was the juggernauts. From this, Riot learned not to attempt roster-level reworks for champions who need larger scale work, like Morde and Skarner.\n\nThe Marksman update was great, aside from Kog. Every one of the major marksman reworks was incredibly successful at achieving the main goal - giving you unique reasons to pick them over other marksmen. So successful, in fact, that four of those reworked marksman are playable in roles that aren't the bot lane ADC role, showing that they do have strong strategic identities that persist outside of their lane.\n\nThe Mage update was not as clean as the Marksman update was, for one primary reason - they decided to increase the scope of the smaller scale reworks. This has had lasting repercussions, some positive (Ziggs bot!), some negative (Syndra's skillcap being completely removed!). Sadly, it takes the Assassin update before Riot realizes that the smaller reworks aren't really great ideas, but at least their blog post confirms that they have in fact learned that lesson now. Riot also learned another lesson from the Mage update - fewer big reworks, bigger reworks. A lot of the big mage updates suffered from not enough attention and focus. For the assassin update, Riot would switch from 6 big updates to 4 bigger updates.\n\nThe Assassin update has been, in my opinion, a success. All four of the major reworks are great. Yeah, three of them are busted as shit right now, but a champion being too strong or weak is not a reason to declare their rework a failure. The smaller reworks were less successful, but the only ones that are really \"bad\" are Akali and Fizz. These are the ones that really showed Riot that these smaller scale reworks aren't always a good idea.\n\nBecause of the lessons all the previous roster updates provide, all the roster updates in the future will be better.

Those amazing plays where I get a double or triple happen, but out of so many game, I feel like it's only happened for me 15 or 20 times. I love running at people like a crazed maniac and wrecking their shit, but I hate them throwing one CC spell or using practically anything to get out of having to deal with it","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-02-06T20:36:52.690+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're with your team, any action the enemy takes in regards to your passive means that you are doing your job with it. Honestly, once you get to mid/late game, your passive doesn't deal much damage unless you build full AD. \n\nIn teamfights, your passive is much more effective when it's forcing out the enemy CC or making them scatter to avoid you so they aren't focusing on your team. Your damage is nice, but you aren't there to deal damage.\n\nYou can also block skillshots for your team. Dying right before Jhin ults is super fun, since you can just run up to him and smack him in the face while he tries to ult through you - they never know what to do! Half the time, they don't notice until their third shot, and half they'll try to wait out your passive while you lifesteal on them for days. Only a few are smart enough to drop the ult, which is still a win for your team.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Prodlax","date":"2017-02-06T03:40:35.747+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"It feels like that class update reworks are mostly failures.
