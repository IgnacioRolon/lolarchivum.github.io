I messed up in my Excel file where I keep track of this stuff and Rek'Sai was somehow farther down on the list. Bear with the title as you can't change it when it's posted. Mistakes can happen.\n\nYeah it&#039;s another one of these posts. Haven&#039;t done one in a while so why not post something a little different outside of the whole PAX and Klein hate going on right now (I&#039;m still with the community though that we shouldn&#039;t let this just blow over like Riot wants and I&#039;ve recently shared my thoughts, but hey got to try something to keep whatever love I have left for this game alive before it flatlines finally).\n\nList is as follows:\n\n* {{champion:74}}  1512 days\n* {{champion:32}} {{champion:77}} 1251 days\n* {{champion:72}} {{champion:101}} 1225 days\n* {{champion:9}} 1222 days\n* {{champion:26}} 1211 days\n* {{champion:35}} {{champion:82}} 1201 days\n* {{champion:421}}  1166 days\n* {{champion:266}} 1138 days\n* {{champion:20}} 1064 days\n* {{champion:54}} 1061 days\n* {{champion:38}} 1054 days\n\n({{champion:39}} would be listed but her skin is releasing sometime this week most likely so I left her off)\n\n100 Day threshold (champs within 100 days of going 1000 days over)\n\n* {{champion:37}} 937 days\n* {{champion:7}}  907 days\n\nAnd to reiterate on these posts: this is just for the sake of data and view of time. Champs that are in need of reworks (Fidd &amp; Mord) are more than likely to be held off from skins until reworked. Champs that are in the works for new skins will also be held off but should be considered for them in the future after they hit.\n\n---\n\nIn closing: list is fortunately shorter and we should expect Heim and Amumu in the coming patches. As well, Urgot finally got his skin and the list is ever so slowly getting shorter. Whoo I guess. Normally I&#039;d be ecstatic that it&#039;s finally here but considering the situation of PAX and Klein with the community in the last few days, it&#039;s just getting me down.","replies":[{"poster":"KestrelGirl","date":"2018-09-04T03:24:52.331+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heimerdinger coming up this year.

So just gotta wait till he gets one now. \n\n{{champion:20}} just literally had his update, so he's back on list for getting a skin sometime.\n\n{{champion:82}} is one that's been said to be a high priority on the VGU list and they'd be surprised if he didn't get his VGU in 2019. So it's almost certain that he'll be there and thus won't see any skins till after that.\n\n{{champion:35}} is another I'd say they are probably holding off on since his last skin was only a 750 and he's getting pretty outdated to the point that there's only so much they can do without having to just give him a Legendary or Ultimate by now.\n\nAs for the rest... they may or may not have something in the works.
