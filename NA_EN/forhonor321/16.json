He looks and feels a lot better now.\n\nYes, there have been some reworks that have gotten a lot of negative criticism or just haven't worked like they're suppose to now, such as {{champion:84}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:10}}  but at the same time we get reworks that for the most part a fairly well done at keeping/expanding themes and just refreshing champions, like{{champion:78}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:20}}\n\nAnd I'm going to be honest: I never really liked Pantheon as he still is right now. He just feels so monotone, one trick like and only does one good, annoying thing during the game until he just becomes way too outscaled. He chucks spears that you can't avoid in any way nonstop or until he's out of mana, his E just wasn't that interesting, and his ult I only felt was good as a free teleport than a damaging demigod from the heavens. Not to mention that his current look just is outdated and stereotyped as this cartoon spartan.\n\nBUT, as I said, he looks and feels a lot better now. He still has that feel of a spartan but has a unique feel to him with the designs of his weapons and scars he bears. His gameplay looks enhanced now with what I can presume to be more powerful spears but actually dodge-able now, near identical W but I think also gives some AS from what I could see, E now let's you move and presumably take less damage from the front and his Ult feels more impactful and interesting.\n\nI don't know if everyone else feels similar, I've actually seen some ridiculous comments on how his classic look is ruined and some are NOW quitting the game because of that, but I for one am looking forward to this rework and might still play League a bit longer because of it (or keep playing until Riot just completely screws it somehow).","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2019-07-29T20:18:10.459+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait until everyone's screaming for nerfs in a month because of how overloaded they're gunna make him. \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2019-07-29T20:30:34.199+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WoonStruck,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qAz9pEeU,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-07-29T20:18:10.459+0000)\n>\n> Wait until everyone's screaming for nerfs in a month because of how overloaded they're gunna make him.\n\nBut we already see what he looks like, and its not 50 dashes.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2019-07-29T20:31:15.379+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Seeing what he looks like doesn't include numbers, passives, and other things.","replies":[{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2019-07-29T20:38:28.937+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WoonStruck,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qAz9pEeU,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-07-29T20:31:15.379+0000)\n>\n> Seeing what he looks like doesn't include numbers, passives, and other things.\n\nCant wait for his baker passive!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mzicio","date":"2019-07-29T20:40:32.587+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It all depends on how that E shield works right now.

If anything I just consider her getting a Visual Update and a buff on her ult.\n\n{{champion:84}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:3}} So? Champions are tweaked all the time. Also there's nothing wrong with a champ being strong uness were talking needlessly strong. What's wrong is that riot doesn't buff most champs to be able to compete with them and diversify the meta.\n\n{{champion:39}} Again, why is that bad? The concept was very well executed and what remained was balancing, which is needed for most new champs reworks, that's just the nature of this kind of endeavor. Now the needless parts of her kit have been cut off. She doesn't reduce magic damage anymore, she doesn't disarm and she doesn't have shield shred.\n\n{{champion:50}} He still can't stand noticeably strong in the meta though. {{champion:10}} Simple, the implementation of her visuals was not in tune with her thematic. She wasn't faceless anymore and she even sheds her armor, It's a cool idea in its own right but not on the same track as old Kayle. And yes, her current abysmal early game makes her pretty bad against teams that can play the game right. \n\n{{champion:81}} Yes, I know, that's why I state his rework barely counts as a GU since his W change left his gamepay unchanged. That's why I put him in the same tier as Morg, who remained unchanged in gameplay apart from her Ult giving her movespeed. However they both got more emphasized in their lore.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PopcornBunni","date":"2019-07-31T06:39:33.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Evelynn was not supposed to be an AP assassin in the first place, and even her new lines allude to \"tearing her victims apart\" despite having not a single AD ratio in her kit.","replies":[{"poster":"NelsieLisnen","date":"2019-07-31T09:17:50.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PopcornBunni,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qAz9pEeU,comment-id=000a0002,timestamp=2019-07-31T06:39:33.700+0000)\n>\n> Evelynn was not supposed to be an AP assassin in the first place, and even her new lines allude to \"tearing her victims apart\" despite having not a single AD ratio in her kit.\n\nI stated that the Evelynn VGU captured the feel of what her fantasy made her out to be . Maybe I'm basing this on a different lore version than you, but in the lore prior to her rework it reads that she is a demon donning the facade of a voluptuous chick that lures in men to their oblivion. It even states that all of her victims last briefly. And that's basically what she does now, she prowls unseen, casts a charm on you, and then stabs and dices you to death. Also, why do you have to be AD to \"tear someone apart\"? I'm pretty sure that a barrage of magical spikes would be as painful, if more, than a barrage of, uuuuuh, the opposite of magical spikes I guess.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2019-07-30T16:47:32.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pantheon's rework is the best now.\n\n I still hope the changes enhanced his late game tho.\n\n- Wonders if his E deals MAX HP damage \n\n- Wonders if his E can multi stack Conqueror\n\nHo ho imagine being able to shred tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2019-07-30T22:43:15.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm 99% sure it can.

They recommended Conqueror as his recommended keystone, so it probably does stack E on every spear shot. Also tje base damage is based on 100% of yourntotal AD while empowered E deals bonus damage and has almost 100 AD scaling. \nOn top pf that, he does scale to late game despite his ultimate having AP scaling only(his passive enhancing his Q W E abilities primarilly).\nThis rework was a sucess in adressing ALL of his problems, primarily being his late game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hi im 12","date":"2019-07-30T09:29:09.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"people pretending like poppy isn't absolute cancer because she hasn't been viable for over a year lmao","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheBrothersGrymm","date":"2019-07-30T14:52:30.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"he will be so busted when he drops, they always do this, reworks are always busted, no dash but hella damage, he will get nerfed, just the way it goes, i mean riot is terrible, when they reworked warwick he had a bug where his q would do double damage, guess how long the bug was active for? 8 months after rework they finally found it o.o so yea reworks are just blahh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ionian Vulpix","date":"2019-07-30T12:00:38.965+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's going to be like Galio.
