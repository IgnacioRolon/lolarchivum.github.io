Yes obviously she can be an ADC but she also can build some AP and even has a pretty decent jungle clear from what I can tell:\n\n\n\nsrc=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/K8cxqfuo9z0&quot;\n\nThis is just getting into my head of what exactly she could be capable of. Can she possibly be played as a marksman top lane, a marksman mid like Lucain for a while or maybe even a caster, what exactly can she be capable of?","replies":[{"poster":"RenownedWheat42","date":"2018-02-22T03:53:10.213+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think, so far, it looks like she can be played in more than just the bot lane, which is awesome. Riot said they want to try and diversify what champs can do and if the new champ fits into more than one role, it's a damn good way of following that.\n\nShe seems like she's got multiple viable roles depending on how you want to play first and foremost. If you want to build her more standard attack speed/crit and focus an E primary Q secondary build, you can. If you want to go higher on damage at first then focus attack damage and Q. W doesn't seem like a very viable priority but easy to get as a secondary and is great for long-range engage/assassination opportunities.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lintu Puck","date":"2018-02-22T04:26:21.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"her purpose, as stated by the roadmap, was to be a marksmen like Vayne.\nmeaning, a Marksmen that can and wants to get into the fight instead of sitting back behind their team.","replies":[{"poster":"Forhonor321","date":"2018-02-22T04:57:32.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I know that, but that doesn't mean a marksman is limited to being in bot lane.

So far I think her \"core\" items are rageblade + cutlass upgrade, after that you can basically build anything. Her passive feels like the ap scaling is ridiculous to the point where I only want attack speed, ap, and enough ad to get q upgraded.\n\nFor example a build with rageblade, gunblade, hurricane, AS boots, death's dance, and wits end was like 26% missing health damage from her passive. Literally w r gunblade q auto auto is enough to instakill squishies while you also have high consistent damage. Oh and it solos baron in like 15 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Forhonor321","date":"2018-02-22T04:56:04.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"26% health you say?

Also should note I actually had some gathering storm ap (only 20 minute proc) so that build is 24% if you don't take gathering storm. \n\nThe more I play her the more I just want straight ap items after rageblade and bork/gunblade, it is really weird to try to figure out what is best on her (though I am almost certain crit is awful).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Truly Prideful","date":"2018-02-22T04:45:43.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She looks like a jungler to me.

From here you fill in the gaps for your next evolve depending on what you need.\n\nGeneral rule of thumb will likely look like this Q evolve vs champs that like to invade, W evolve if everyone is tower hugging for some tower harass, E evolve for some early invade aggression / gank potential.\n\nStill testing out the runes on pbe however its looking like precision primary + sorc/inspiration so far.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-02-22T05:55:34.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sup all the way, just stack shields all with the ult{{item:3114}}{{item:3190}}  , both your team and their will freak out since they have no idea what you gonna do with that big fat juicy shield but prob ban 99% anyway unless they horribly feed like release broken ornn.","replies":[]}]}
