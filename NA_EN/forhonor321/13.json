But looking back at a post and my response to it, it&#039;s brought up an important question: why is Tryndamere not on the list for a rework, and if he is why isn&#039;t he higher up?\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t get me wrong, the other champs I mentioned do need reworks but Tryndamere I feel should be up their with them since he&#039;s in a pretty crap state for who knows how long now. Let&#039;s briefly look over his kit: his passive grants free crit, Q heals him and gives bonus AD per missing health (but who really cares about that or notices), W is very situation based for the slow and otherwise useless if you don&#039;t land it greatly (but does reduce AD of targets), E is his only damaging ability and also his annoying dash away to safty/ free kill card, and ult makes you unkillable for # of seconds AND can be used during CC because if not you&#039;d probably be the absolute worst champ in the game.\r\n\r\nHe can&#039;t really do anything in team fights so all he&#039;s left to do is just hang around in split-push city and just do that for the whole game. He&#039;s basically a non-stop split push bot with nothing really else to do. To best describe him, he&#039;s like that one annoying fly in your room that continually keeps bugging you. If you ignore him, it&#039;ll just get worse. But if you try to kill him, he just runs away from you around the whole place and you can&#039;t kill him. And when you do manage to kill him, somehow, he just pops up again and the cycle repeats! \r\n\r\nOn top of that how he plays just isn&#039;t satisfying. He&#039;s a barbarian king, wielding a giant ass sword, one-handed, reading to take on anyone threatening his people or challenge him. Yet gameplay wise, he plays cowardly with just attacking towers and running away when the first sign of danger shows up. At this point, I just view him as a one trick or just a pick to be an annoyance to the enemy team while the rest of your team gets shit done. I feel he is in desperate need of a rework. And I mean a rework, not some class update that he&#039;s chosen to be a candidate in.","replies":[{"poster":"Its All Skillzz","date":"2017-03-02T05:15:40.618+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is extremely toxic and prob the most cancer champion when ahead in the game. he can tower dive soon as he hits lvl 6 on pretty much any squishy. if he gets shit on in lane then he just split pushes keeps knocking down your towers while unkillable. the only counter to his broken ass is exhaust but soon that wont remove his attack speed so he will just keep on right click your towers then spin off when one is nearly dead or his ult is about to expire.","replies":[{"poster":"ZΞRØ","date":"2017-03-10T16:13:35.030+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Knowing he is really squishy, remove his ult and he'll be unplayable unless he is made into a tank and still he needs a passive change since he gets his peak damage when he is at low health and without his actual ult there is no point to play him anymore.\n\nThe only people who are going insane because of his ult are in low elo, because in higher elo he is easily counterable, i think actually he is the champion that has the most counters in game but people dont just realise this.\n\nevery match up isn't anymore about, i hope i dont get countered but more like, i hope there is still a champion that doesn't counter me that much ... lol\n\nno more invincibility ? fine , but that will have to make huge changes\n\n-More HP/tanky like\n\n-no more passive depending on his health %\n\n-solve the fact that makes him easily peeled (like his mocking shout wold give him 2 sec of mobility immune problems)\n\n-more viable at 100% health, less rng dependant.\n\nand only with this, removing his actual unlt would be acceptable.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Its All Skillzz,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QEYH5vMe,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-03-02T05:15:40.618+0000)\n>\n> He is extremely toxic and prob the most cancer champion when ahead in the game. he can tower dive soon as he hits lvl 6 on pretty much any squishy. if he gets shit on in lane then he just split pushes keeps knocking down your towers while unkillable. the only counter to his broken ass is exhaust but soon that wont remove his attack speed so he will just keep on right click your towers then spin off when one is nearly dead or his ult is about to expire.\n\nany champion when ahead are a pain for the whole game, take nasus, he carries the game alone when fed and ignored, poppy, rammus, riven and a lot more. what u forget to mention are chamions that are toxic from level 1, like teemo, heimer, kennen harrassements are their speciality.\n\nTrynda ? if he loses his lane, he pretty much useless the whole game because he wont have enough damage for an effective split push, minions get stronger by time it's easily noticable when ur behind everyone, a come back is extremely hard and needs the game to be able to get late for him to be viable again. split pushing? easily countrable, just dont go as 5 to 1 lane like tards and u'll be fine. Ninja Tabi + Thornmail -> you've already won your matchup against trynda.\n\njust check his pick/ban rate and u'll notice that's abnormally low. why ? i dont think i need to reply to the obvious.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bultz","date":"2017-03-02T04:15:28.498+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":11,"body":"He's named after a rioter and founder of the game, they won't ever nerf or change his broken ass.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2017-03-02T19:05:44.682+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bultz,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QEYH5vMe,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-02T04:15:28.498+0000)\n>\n> He&#x27;s named after a rioter and founder of the game, they won&#x27;t ever nerf or change his broken ass.\n\n{{champion:13}} \n\n???","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2017-03-02T21:26:36.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lol aatrox has been shit for 3 years?

It's the pet champion of the league CEO! I bet there is this silent rule in Riot HQ concerning tryndameryl where no one dares to even suggest a rework lol Unless you don't mind getting fired or something... :P But salt aside,  the most broken thing is the R. It lasts waaaay too long. Kayle also has something similar and it only lasts two seconds and its enough some times to make a difference. 5 seconds on tryndamere is *just* perfect to kill 2 champions and get out scott free. The second thing would be his spinning slash: When you crit it reduces the CD, that shouldn't happen. Taking away the CD reduction when you crit will force you to actually think about using it, and if you miss it you get punished. But... then again... If i'm the CEO of a gaming companny and i have a champion named after me, that shit better be a God.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SSShutTheDuckUp","date":"2017-03-02T08:28:28.257+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have made a thread about it and Meddler replied, that according to him Trynda can use a full VGU in the future.
