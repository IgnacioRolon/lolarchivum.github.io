I've been trying to make some edits to this post of mine that a posted roughly a week ago now. However when I try to do so a small white box pops up whenever I hit save and says \n\n> boards.na.leagueoflegends.com says: Couldn't update the content!\n\nI've tried almost every method I can think of to clear this up: clearing my browser cache, login out and back into my board account, waiting to see if this was just a time based thing. Hell I've even tried restarting my computer to see if that worked, as well as switching over to my laptop to make the changes thinking it was my main computer but the same thing still happens. So now I'm convinced that it has something to do with my account but I don't know what it is. And honestly I'm completely dumbfounded because this wasn't happening a week ago and it's already been a few days since this began. I really want to know how to fix this!","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Fail","date":"2016-10-18T03:16:09.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We got his post to go through, I've seen this happen a few times over the last month so Imma go ahead and post what we did here, in case anyone in the future has this issue and stumbles on this topic.\n\nFor some reason or another, The league of legends forums have issues with certain characters, so if you're getting a generic \"Couldn't update the content!\" message, quickly go through your post (especially if it's a character concept or has gdoc links in it) and check for percentage marks. Percentage marks and possibly some other rarer symbols like them can make the forums refuse your posts from going through, and also can cause issues with posting links. In the case of the gdoc link, the person having the issue was forced to generate new links until they got one without the offending symbols. Quite annoying!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-14T04:18:00.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I pushed a button from our end that may have helped with this.

I don't know if it's something in my post or what. And it's only, as far as I can tell in concepts and creations.\n\nAs to what I was trying to edit I was just trying to make small number changes and switch out one word in my concept, as well as add in a few more things in trivia. But at this point I just don't know what's wrong. As of right now I'm somewhat convinced it's either something in my post, something with Concepts and Creations or something to do with my college's internet.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-16T23:28:32.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you try again on some other network?
