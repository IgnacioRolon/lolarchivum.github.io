I mean, this was suppose to be the very unique thing about her shroud as opposed to the other two stealth options in the game and Riot was putting a lot of emphasis on it. \r\n\r\nBut let me be also clear: I'M NOT UPSET THAT IT'S GOING! If anything, it was the most annoying thing about. Having her tower dive you while your tower just stood there and did nothing as she melded back into her safety cloud blanket (when it was still a thing) was DUMB! Having her not be revealed in anyway through this shroud is DUMB! It's just what makes her frustrating to play against.\r\n\r\nAnd this now has to make me raise the question: is the Akali rework now just a complete flop? I mean, Akali has been nerfed how many times since the rework? They're now streamlining her W to make it more fair to play against with True Sight, but even if it's now less annoying (again not saying I'm upset with this change), doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of the reworks intent?","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2019-07-02T06:18:59.716+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Forhonor321,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fhL67rxc,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-07-02T03:33:41.080+0000)\n>\n> And this now has to make me raise the question: is the Akali rework now just a complete flop?

I think this is a sign that riot's running out of things to nerf on her.  I think that CT tried his best to keep her gameplay as close to the original as possible, but she really wasn't a champ that could be safely modernized; she had to either keep her old problematic form as it was or needed something completely new.  \n\nI say riot should have her go back to Shen, apologize for leaving, bring back to the old ponytail, and give her a new kit.","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2019-07-02T06:28:52.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think she will be fine after those changes","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2019-07-02T06:35:24.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One can hope.
