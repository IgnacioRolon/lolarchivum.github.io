(think there was a post about doing 73% health damage with these buffs)\r\n\r\n{{champion:113}} - before her mini rework was OK. Afterwards was doing insane damage, got nerfed, continued to get nerfed due to her power in pro play then fell out (still got nerfed). Now losing some CC in favor of more damage to most of her abilities.\r\n\r\n{{champion:154}} - basically has fallen out of most play from my experience after a while.\r\n\r\n{{champion:111}} - changed his damage from sustain in W to burst in E from what I recall and now is just...where is he?\r\n\r\nI know there are more tanks that other people can give examples of and there&#039;s more details that I&#039;m not going over for the ones I listed, but this is just the pattern I&#039;m constantly seeing with tanks. They constantly feel like these champs, almost specifically the Vanguards, need to be dealing damage rather than providing good combat CC. Why though?\r\n\r\nWhy does Ornn need to be dealing crap amounts of brittle damage? Why does Sej, after the failure of her rework, need to lose CC in order to get more damage? Wasn&#039;t that the main complaint about her rework?\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know, it just feels like Riot doesn&#039;t know how to handle these kind of champs and they just try to shift them over to more damage dealer roles while still labeling them as &quot;tanks&quot; when they can almost deal as much damage as a fighter or assassin can (maybe not as fast as them, but just as much).\r\n\r\nDiscuss, talk, do whatever on this subject. I&#039;m just going to be in the corner and start thinking about all the ways season 9 will somehow go south, because League just feels that way nowadays to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2018-11-13T15:48:12.619+0000","up_votes":77,"down_votes":0,"body":"they seem to be morphing into semi mobile bruisers and the old semi mobile bruisers are transforming into assasins","replies":[{"poster":"SpeIlthief","date":"2018-11-13T19:14:42.287+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Death by Glamour,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uFVhAnww,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-11-13T15:48:12.619+0000)\n>\n> they seem to be morphing into semi mobile bruisers and the old semi mobile bruisers are transforming into assasins\n\n∆ My thoughts as well ∆","replies":[{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-11-13T20:09:08.980+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm scared for what assassins will become","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2018-11-14T03:27:41.715+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Introducing a new class - The Reapers\"\n\n\"We at Riot decided an assassin is someone who is capable of quickly getting behind enemy lines, and with good outplaying, can get out with a kill in his (or her) pocket. Depending on their escape route. Despite this, there have been complaints about some champions not being able to put these general rules for an assassin in use so we're amping up the damage and the escape potential of every single assassin under such criteria. Now you may wonder \"But Riot, what will happen to all the strong assassins?\" Well, you propably read it from the title.\n\nThose will become true harbingers of doom. Death's very emissaries. They will be squishy but have tons of mobility and near-one-shot potential with 1 or 2 abilities, at the cost of zero utility and crowd control.\n\nRegardless, they can basically 1v5 if played correctly. And with it, we are proud to announce the newest Reaper and our newest champion - Zenji: The Lost Dragon\n\nZenji's backstory is that he is the long lost brother of Zed who never knew him, being adopted by the Kinky order. He fought through poverty and the cruelty of Ionian slums for years until he found Zed, distant and mad with power after a lifetime of nobility and comfort from parents he never knew. Now, he seeks to right the injustice not in the world, but in his heart and bring Zed down to his level, which they both were born out of.\n\nZenji's skillset is that he can cross walls with a dash that refreshes upon contacting with any wall and does 20% max hp true damage. He can also become Obscured and mark targets with Eye of Zenji (a new vision type that cannot be hidden from. Not even you, Akali.) and he has a 3 hit passive, that when you hit a target with 3 Q-s, they die. No questions asked. His passive is +5 armor.\n\nHe is also ranged and melee, dealing more damage at melee range being a Reaper (wouldn't want to make him too op heh) and his ultimate is that he marks up to 3 targets, and deals 30% max hp physical damage for each of the amount of targets marked (up to 90%).\n\nOh and he has 500 special interactions which nobody will ever hear because they're quiet as hell and most people won't remember to use them in specific situations or won't know about them at all.\"\n\n*Cue League of Legends logo*","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2018-11-14T14:22:17.885+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinky order.\nFounded by Tryndamere with his undying furry.","replies":[{"poster":"RIP Tahm Kench","date":"2018-11-14T15:05:52.154+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As with all members of the clan, Fiora never goes anywhere without her raper.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2018-11-14T00:07:34.707+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Enchanter supports","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Aionius","date":"2018-11-13T14:59:14.220+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":3,"body":"It's the reason I said Season 5 is the most balanced between Seasons 5-8.

Well, you can't entirely blame Riot for that. If you didn't know, champion balance involves about as much math as it does practical gameplay experience. When factors are added, that means factors have to be taken away. As health increases, defense decreases. As defense decreases, damage increases. As damage increases, modifiers decrease. Then there's an entirely different set of adjustments required if a champion has CC, and then it depends on which CC the champions has, and then it depends on which CC the champion has access to regarding items, and then it depends on which items a champion typically builds, and then it depends on what those items apply when used.\n\nIt's easy to think that all Riot has to do is increase a number and bam problem solved. New problem: That's not the way balance works. Every factor of a champion has to be considered when balancing them. Not just that, but they have to consider the state of the meta as well as at which point in a game certain adjustments apply most significantly. Not only that, but they ALSO have to consider how their playerbase reacts and responds to changes AS WELL AS gameplay feel at certain points in a game.\n\nI think Riot indeed knows what they're doing, just not how they want to go about doing it. If they're buffing Tank damage, it's probably because people have been complaining about how Tanks die too easily against something or other. The simplest solution would be to give Tanks increased damage against those somethings or others.\n\nIt's a painful process, balancing champions.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NoIWontBuySkins","date":"2018-11-13T19:06:49.447+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but they cannot balance period","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2018-11-13T23:13:45.795+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anymore?

Old Shen was Stonewalling the lane by just perfect farming under tower with his Q, all the while he could teleport to bot, then back top without you getting an advantage. \n\nIt’s literally a zero interaction lane. Ornn’s interactivity revolves around his abilities being avoidable and locking. He can’t move in his W so it allows players to better reposition. And given the long cooldown on it (17 seconds rank 1) this gives people an opportune time to punish him after.  \n\nAs for fun, a lot of people don’t find Darius fun to lane against due to his bully nature. A lot of people don’t find Jax fun because of his stun combo. It’s generally not about fun, but about how you can play around it. That’s why tank designs like Sion or Poppy are generally good because they provide windows for opponents to abuse and skills that reward proper play on the player of the champion. \n\nAnd sadly, as much as you disagree with the idea of tanks top lane, Riot has been consistent in trying to balance some tanks in top.  And they’re going to keep trying.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SobeDragon","date":"2018-11-13T20:04:12.751+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey remember all those posts like 3-4 years ago warning about power creep and as they add more champions and rework they are going to have to put more power into older champions?  And how as they do this they will add more and more bad designs like a champion who is permenently untargetable in shroud as long as they don't cast anything like Akali  Or can put up a wall every 15 seconds that negates everything thrown at it like Yasuo. Why wouldn't it only negate the first item thrown at it?  Then you could put more into his damage, maybe reduce the amount of dashes or make it so the dashes have a way longer cooldowns for  Yasuo who can multi stack dashes on multiple people and still two shot people. How can you balance a game when there are toxic design choices in your champions is a better question in my opinion. You can't tell me a champion with AA resets, Multiple dashes, huge stun range that can hit an entire team, an ult that disables enemy champions and reduces damage taken and has a w that greatly reduces damage taken.\n\nYou want a prime example of Riots Balance?  Anivia.  They removed her \"toxic lane domination\" by removing her E/R combo in lane.  It was her primary way of trading in lane.  Now you gotta land multiple spells to even trade properly. Meanwhile champions like Zed can move in and out and even 100 to 0 her easily if she misses her spells, but if she lands hers, it doesn't kill him.  \n\nBalance can be awful with these games because one champion can literally break the meta and completely flip the balance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Strawberrycocoa","date":"2018-11-13T22:37:24.932+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with tanks is that their job is shutting Big Plays down, and Riot has shown a very biased stance over the last few years against anything that isn't flashy Big Plays.

(think there was a post about doing 73% health damage with these buffs)\n> \n> {{champion:113}} - before her mini rework was OK. Afterwards was doing insane damage, got nerfed, continued to get nerfed due to her power in pro play then fell out (still got nerfed). Now losing some CC in favor of more damage to most of her abilities.\n> \n> {{champion:154}} - basically has fallen out of most play from my experience after a while.\n> \n> {{champion:111}} - changed his damage from sustain in W to burst in E from what I recall and now is just...where is he?\n> \n> I know there are more tanks that other people can give examples of and there&amp;#039;s more details that I&amp;#039;m not going over for the ones I listed, but this is just the pattern I&amp;#039;m constantly seeing with tanks. They constantly feel like these champs, almost specifically the Vanguards, need to be dealing damage rather than providing good combat CC. Why though?\n> \n> Why does Ornn need to be dealing crap amounts of brittle damage? Why does Sej, after the failure of her rework, need to lose CC in order to get more damage? Wasn&amp;#039;t that the main complaint about her rework?\n> \n> I don&amp;#039;t know, it just feels like Riot doesn&amp;#039;t know how to handle these kind of champs and they just try to shift them over to more damage dealer roles while still labeling them as &amp;quot;tanks&amp;quot; when they can almost deal as much damage as a fighter or assassin can (maybe not as fast as them, but just as much).\n> \n> Discuss, talk, do whatever on this subject. I&amp;#039;m just going to be in the corner and start thinking about all the ways season 9 will somehow go south, because League just feels that way nowadays to me.\n\nThe problem with tank identity is as simple as it was for supports.\n\n1. People want to feel like they are having an impact and most folks are too dumb to realize a tank going 0/7/34 with a ton of lockdown and peel for their carries was the driving force of the win. Supports wanted to feel the same.\n\n2. Riot is too dumb to grant people vision of these things so JUST LIKE THEY DID WITH SUPPORTS, they are just giving them more damage, Presto!","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2018-11-13T21:43:18.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wholeheartedly agree and have a gp+ post that should be up by the end of the week addressing tanks as a class, and how to fix them.\n\nThe biggest issues outside of the champs themselves imo are runes, pro play and itemization","replies":[{"poster":"Iota Theta","date":"2018-11-13T23:01:04.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KrakenKnight,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uFVhAnww,comment-id=0015,timestamp=2018-11-13T21:43:18.406+0000)\n>\n> I wholeheartedly agree and have a gp+ post that should be up by the end of the week addressing tanks as a class, and how to fix them.\n> \n> The biggest issues outside of the champs themselves imo are runes, pro play and itemization\n\nAmusing, I recently had another tank related one approved, although mainly trying to stir discussion around Riot’s reasons for their balance choices and less around how to balance.
