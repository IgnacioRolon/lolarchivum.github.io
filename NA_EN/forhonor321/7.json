I mean, it does look a bit more like armor now. But as it stands, Kayle still has the purple spandex pants and over the last few days of looking at it, it is getting on my nerves a bit. That's just not how I view Kayle, it's very odd for her to have that.\r\n\r\nI don't know if Riot may/will be willing to continue adding changes to the model, like adding her tabard back or make an option to toggle her helmet in final form (have a plume made of fire for it for more classic feel), because at this point it's most likely Riot won't do much besides gameplay balancing her next week, but I kind of hope they do. I might now play her now but, like many people, we have an idea on what a champs iconic look should be and Kayle, while slightly closer now, I think needs just a bit more work.\r\n\r\nAlso, I believe there needs to be adjustments to the splash art to better suit the breastplate.","replies":[{"poster":"Camille Ferrøs","date":"2019-02-23T00:48:14.787+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"The picture posted there is wrong or Riot are officially trolling.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2019-02-23T09:35:12.103+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"As was feared.\n\nThey will refuse to do anything below the waist.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glaricion","date":"2019-02-23T06:10:20.871+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The chest is so weirdly form fitting, especially w/ the V shape.  \n\nIt looks as though someone drew a triangle on a piece of paper and then folded it up.\n\nIt works for cloth or leather armour, but plate?\n\nHopefully we get a [breastplate w/ a raised protrusion](https://image.boom-app.wiki/wiki/59fab0ea3d1bee03b541dcd4/card/w/012.jpg?w=960) and the tabard(?) posted in [this](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/EvRgW1W8-i-made-a-kayle-edit-that-likely-constitutes-the-least-amount-of-work-necessary-to-fix-her-armor) thread.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-23T00:55:26.487+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had to toggle back and forth between the [old](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-trpaAA2THVo/XG4WAUgOvjI/AAAAAAABPKM/MNbmRa-PUq0A3sF6Ta34U1AHf_dwIjxtwCLcBGAs/s1600/kayleturn.png) and [new](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GbGz6qymz_s/XHBnnQfIwAI/AAAAAAABPXg/boQe-D3asXQ01I-5fjVdHIlwdcM3MHx7gCLcBGAs/s1600/kayleturn.png) versions a dozen times before I finally spotted the difference: the breastplate no longer has gaps that extend to her armpits.

I suppose that's another improvement, however minor. The large unarmored spot over her center of mass still kinda stands out to me, though.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Baval","date":"2019-02-22T23:55:31.913+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"well it is a Demacian style, Lux has the same kind of armor.
