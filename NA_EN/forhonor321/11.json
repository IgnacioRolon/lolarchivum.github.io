Go to the boards and nearly 99% of posts you see are just on how bad the game is, from certain champs being stupidly overloaded/busted, damage and mobility consistently being raised/added in while resistances mean nothing, and everyone is either salty, miserable, or too blind to see the issues and try to defend the game right now. I'm sick of loading into games that usually are going to end up as me being stomped or my team and I stomping. I'm tired of not having the confidence of playing something fun and almost consistently losing and instead having to play something that is meta and/or overpowered. I'm annoyed that we can't have more lore &amp; character stories more frequently, since that's really one of the only things keeping me around right now. Fuck, I'm tired of having an entire friends list being nearly completely offline except for the one or two people who are and yet we never play together.\r\n\r\nBut after not playing for roughly a week, I believe, I have never felt more relieved. I'm finally being able to start playing newer games that I've bought but never had the time for, finishing games that I've been sitting on for quite some time now. Finally getting back into my hobby of Warhammer and knocking out assembling and painting minis, getting a bit more focused on college work and future job employments. Hell, I might actually start getting into the habit of a work out routine soon just to find more stuff to do. I actually feel so much happier that I don't have to que up into some hell-fest for the next 20-25 minutes and instead work on/play the things that I love to do.\r\n\r\nI might stay on the boards for a while and wait a bit during preseason to see things out, but unless Riot actually starts to make the game better and address the issues players are having with the game, I honestly wouldn't mind uninstalling and just moving on. If League really is going to keep going like this and become something that just makes me miserable, why should I waste time, money and energy on it anymore?","replies":[]}
