No I&#039;m sorry if you take this as a QQ post, but I need to let off some steam somehow! Every time I see this guy on the other I die i bit inside because I know I have to face with his bullshit and possibly get stomped. Really the thing that makes me so pissed off about him is that he&#039;s clarified as a fighter tank. Tank. **TAAAANNNKK**! How the fuck is this champion, pretty much going full AD half the time I play against him and just deleting people and entire teams, a secondary tank?!?! Seriously this guy is not a tank, he&#039;s a god damn assassin. What other fighter tanks do you know of that have invisibility/stealth or whatever the fuck it is nowadays? I know there are other champions that I should hate like {{champion:157}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:67}}  (I do hate these champions) but Wukong is just one of those champions that just consistently gets under my skin but seems like he doesn&#039;t for anyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2017-02-07T16:50:47.844+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"wukong is actually dogshit lmfao.

Wukong on the other hand, outside of the first knockup on his ult, has almost no other CC and can just benefit from defense stats just by getting into team fights while not really building any armor or health items. \n\nAs well, how many fighter tanks do you know that have an stealth decoy bullshit or a gap closer?
