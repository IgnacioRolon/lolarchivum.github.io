But here&#039;s a question: why is it being built from Warden&#039;s Mail? You know, the item that lowers the attack speed of people who hit those with it. Why is this part of it&#039;s build path though when it&#039;s an item that&#039;s pretty much suppose to punish those who are heavily reliant on AA for damage (ADC&#039;s, Yi, Tryn, etc.) Isn&#039;t that a bit counter productive for the purpose of the item to slow down attacks if the whole point is to let them attack and die off of you?","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-07-10T22:11:11.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"all i wanted was to have blademail from dota \n\nnow we've got a busted-ass item for 900 gold","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phhase","date":"2017-07-11T01:20:05.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand why they ever started to change it from:\n\n+a buttton of armor\n+ return 30% of AA damage as magic damage\n\nIt's effective, and still needs HP to back it up. None of these convoluted armor scalings and piddly damage charts. Although I will say that the Grevious Wounds is a good idea.

I'm just going to get Bramble Vest and that's it.  Thornmail went from 25% armor + 15% damage taken reflected back as true damage to 10% armor + flat 25 Damage returned\n\nSo when an ADC late game attacks you for 1000 damage thorn mail used to deal back 125 + around 40 to 90 Damage from armor from each attack!\n\nBut now when an ADC late game attacks you for 500 damage thorn mail deal back 25 + 20 to 30 Damage from armor from each attack!     LOL .. its 100% completely useless in every way..  Sun fire Cape now deals more damage then thorn mail. haha\n\nBramble Vest is good and can be sold for something better when you get to your 6th item.\n\nRIP thorn mail.. i will never buy it ever again lol - Rammus main!\n\nliandry's torment is the NEW thornmail on rammus ..  NO JOKE .. it proc's every time someone auto attacks you with your Defensive Ball Curl (W) on\n\n2% of the target's current health per second for 3 seconds. This bonus damage is doubled to 4% of the target's current health per second for 3 seconds. ( using Rammus's ult (R) as it now slows up to 90% MS for 6 seconds lol )\n\nSo their health just melts away. when you have this! .. bramble vest. and sun fire cape! :)\n\nAdd on something like wits end that removed MR or some AD items and you have one very powerful AP tank.","replies":[]}]}]}
