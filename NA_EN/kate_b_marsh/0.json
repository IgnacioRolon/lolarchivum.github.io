GOD it's almost like nails on a chalkboard.\n\nthey must have have hired a new sound designer because this person clearly has poor taste that doesn't identify with the rest of the world.\n\ni had no issues with the old sounds and became rather fond of them.   this is a fine example of taking what you have that is good and smashing it.\n\ni don't even really care much for the new HUD graphics. but i can get use to those.  \n\ni wish this patch never happened... i honestly can't think of anything good that came from this patch that i've noticed.\n\ni even dont aggree with they removing Zekkes Harald.  I actually use to buy that sometimes.. but the new replacement i have no use for at all and will never buy that for any hero.   they just overly complicated it\n\ni think the riot people need to take a break and stop working on this game because they are trying too hard that they are failing and falling flat on their faces","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KingsRight","date":"2015-07-22T17:48:12.091+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"i hate all new sounds in this update, including announcer.\n\nEVERYTHING, sound-related, litterally sucks in this patch","replies":[]}]}
