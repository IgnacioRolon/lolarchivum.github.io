Near 25% pick rate with 51.5% win rate. This is especially strong for an adc due to the fact that 2 adcs are in nearly every single game, meaning pr and wr are in relation to other adcs.\n\nShes not necessarily mega broken, but she can use a tone down, especially after preseason. Fleet footwork or PtA (for even more dmg) along with the damage trees in general allow vayne to excel at murdering squishies just as if not even harder than tanks. Her burst potential with her ultimate active can get a little silly.\n\nHonestly, they should remove the ult AD gain entirely and give her 1 or 2 % more damage on her w to put her back to an on hit build, which although aggravating to face, is probably a lot healthier than her current build and playstyle which revolves around crit two/three shots with the true dmg being icing on the cake that matters only against the heaviest of tanks.\n\nPS\n\nIf youre looking for the scarra quote, its from an old patch notes review of his from when riot reverted a tumble ad ratio buff in season 6.\n\nEDIT\n\nHere is a more detailed explanation of why scarra said what he said, and why I reiterate his wisdom now.\n\n\"While in an ideal world, every champ would be meta, the reality is that champs like vayne fill a niche role that they exceed very well in. If they are meta, that means they fill their niche role and also excel outside of it, and that usually means they're overpowered.\n\nWhen I and scarra say that vayne should never be meta, what is actually being said is that vayne is a niche character that should only be picked by either one tricks or into situations where she can fulfill her niche very well.\n\nIf you think it's idiotic, then you must also think that rammus should excel into a 4-5 man AP team, and darius should excel against a poke heavy team.

Either of these champions seeing win rates over 50% should be big trouble,  as they're played too often to be only picked when they should be. So they should lose more because they're picked in a lot of situations where they shouldn't be. You can't main/one-trick Yasuo or vayne without suffering the consequence of not bringing things to your team comp that other players could bring. \n\nAhri being left meta for 3+ seasons wasn't riot's balancing mistake - it was correct as she wasn't OP - just a generalist (her over nerfs in response to community outcry were a mistake,  but you can't really blame them for that).

I agree with your jungler point, but as a statistic major AND a support main I might have to correct you on your support logic.\n\nWhat you're claiming WOULD be true... if all of the supports had the same pick rate. Also I don't know what site you're using, but that's not the same 10 champions I see at the top of pick rate.\n\nI'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say that you might've proven your point on your own, but didn't post your evidence in your comment. On the site you're using, could you add up the pick rates of the 4 tanks, and compare it to the sum of the pick rates of the 6 enchanters? On my site, the top 4 tanks are 20% more likely to be played than the top 6 enchanters. (but the percentages on this site don't add up to 100% so I'm not confident in that analysis.)\n\nAlso, according to my site, 11 of the top 13 highest win rate supports are tanks. As much as I want to say that Lulu is THE actual meta, the truth is, engage tanks are the support meta. This doesn't factor into play rate; it just means that tanks work better than enchanters at the moment, which is why I wouldn't be surprised if tanks WERE picked more often.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2018-01-02T12:53:07.041+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think -3ad at level 18 will fix that!","replies":[]}]}
