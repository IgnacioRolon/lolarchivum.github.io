If you lose that 4 AD,  overall, he would only lose 14 damage from his kit and his farm would be more annoying but this would only slightly influence his gameplay pattern by cutting down some of his gold income\n\nin the grand scheme of things, Aatrox for instance starts with 510 hp\n\n14 damage out of 510 not counting armor is about a 3% increase in what he needs to kill a target and fairly negligible\n\nif you throw auto attacks into it, if you somehow engaged in an encounter long enough for 10 strikes, it would reduce his damage count by one BF sword while still doing 560 to 1410 (assuming they took it from total as well) damage before armor in those attacks\n\nif we take the base armor for him at 33, it's roughly 75% damage taken, or 421 damage from autos compared to 451\n\nthis is an extremely long extended trade and makes a negligible impact at the weakest point in the game\n\nif you somehow got into this skirmish at level 1 and managed to hit all of your Q in sweet spots, the damage comes to about 578 or so or enough to \"kill\" the target, and that's not counting his passive damage or the runes\n\nit's a difference, but a small one that ultimately does not change the result\n\nchanges to base AD only affect the champion's farming phase, which can be good if you know where to interrupt it, but otherwise, not much changes","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2018-07-15T10:33:16.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're neglecting a few things there. First, your post armor math ignores that Conqueror effectively negates some of that armor, any AD it gives is effectively slightly more than it seems vs champions because if it's online so is the true damage conversion.\n\nSecond, your math is off. His total kit amplifies bonus AD by 530%. 4 x 530% = 21.2. And that completely ignores his R adding .8 due to that 4 (4 x 20% = .8) which then gets turned into 4.24 by the rest of his kit (.8 x 530% = 4.24). Even if by his total kit you meant him just having Q at level 1 it still comes to 18 damage, not 14. A typical trade or fight has 1-4 auto attacks, for another 4-16 damage. At level 6 we're talking a total ~40 pre mit damage in a duel to the death, easily enough to decide who lives and who dies, especially in a 2v2. That's not even an extra auto attack's worth of damage, but it's still a lot more than I've survived many a fight by.\n\nThird, it affecting farming eventually affects champion vs champion combat. Every minion missed is potentially more damage lost due to less items later or a delayed back to farm more. Also wave clear speed matters, especially early on, and this definitely affects that.\n\nNo one is saying this is a huge nerf, far from it. But it does matter more than it appears to in the eyes of many. And you shouldn't just say it, \"does not change the result\" and that, \"changes to base AD only affect the champion's farming phase\" because those are empirically false. But does conqueror need a huge nerf? I don't think so. I think it needs to be deleted completely, but not for being OP.\n\nP.S.

It may or may not be a bit overtuned, but the rune's purpose is to give bruisers a better chance against tanks in lane, while still remaining relevant late-game. The best way to do that is true damage conversion.\n\nThe AD is the *least* healthy part. Period. 35 AD for hitting minions for 4 seconds is not healthy.\n\nNerf the AD down to 6-20, and that's a much better step in the right direction.
