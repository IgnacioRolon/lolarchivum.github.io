Gasoline is composed of hydrocarbons with chain lengths of 4 or 12. \n\nWhile diesel focuses on 75% saturated hydrocarbons and 25% aromatic compounds. There *is* some overlap in contents between gasoline and diesel, but mostly they are different. The range of carbons in compounds that compose diesel are 10 to 15 long carbon chains. \n\nAll in all they focus on different chemical properties and are almost entirely chemically different. It's not a matter of concentration, especially considering it's not *really* like you can have less concentrated petroleum. Petroleum is already a mixture of tons of chemicals that dissolve eachother in different ways, and both the solvent and the solute are necessary components of petrolâ€” adding more solvent doesn't make it just less concentrated, it makes it significantly different.

Gnar has 3 instances of %max hp damage, and in his mega gnar form, he has asinine AD ratios. This champ is just all around retarded so gl on fixing his lane phase riot (as they promised).\n\nThink about Zed's passive.\n\nIt's kind of scary, scaling upto.. 10% ( I think?) of max health at most. That's around 200 extra damage late game. Early game it's 6%, which against most non tanks / non bruiser is sub 60 damage for a long time.\n\nNow imagine Zed's passive was a scaling number. Let's say it starts at 50 extra damage. Not unreasonable, but almost doubling the burst it provides against squishy targets. Let's say that it scales at the same rate, hitting the 200 mark when his ideal targets are still 500-700 hp off of the 2k mark where he usually earns that. This would cause a marginal drop in Zed's effectiveness against tanks, but be a gigantic buff to his threat against squishies. I doubt anyone wants that.\n\nRiot has discussed % health damage before.\n\nBasically, you give % health when you want a champion / ability to have non-neglible damage throughout the entire game; but you also don't want \"non neglible damage\" to be bursty / capable of blowing up squishies. It performs the results, and also gives the champion a little more target flexibility; making it so they're not totally worthless against certain things.\n\nCho is a little bit of an oddity, but he's really all about the Q. It's easy to dodge but, if it hits you, you probably lost the trade. But most bruisers can laugh him into the grave pretty easily if they avoid it, at least before late game.","replies":[{"poster":"6thSagePath","date":"2018-02-03T18:27:50.915+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay but that wasnt the point being made. zeds damage is % of the champion under the mark (which is fine) meanwhile. there are tanks like voli and cho who do damage base of their health. so they can go tanky, be hard as fuck to kill and then serious amounts of damage. its another issue with tanks doing large arounts of true damage. cho and garen coming straight to mind.","replies":[{"poster":"MorganFreemanBot","date":"2018-02-03T20:02:27.860+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=6thSagePath,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7YZEFbf0,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2018-02-03T18:27:50.915+0000)\n>\n> okay but that wasnt the point being made. zeds damage is % of the champion under the mark (which is fine) meanwhile. there are tanks like voli and cho who do damage base of their health. so they can go tanky, be hard as fuck to kill and then serious amounts of damage. its another issue with tanks doing large arounts of true damage. cho and garen coming straight to mind.\n\nEDIT: I do not know why part of this is bolded. :(\n\nSo, a couple of things.\n\n#1: You didn't understand my point. I'm talking about Zed's passive, while you're countering me with some prattle about his R.\n\n#2: You asked about % health damage and why tanks would have it; so I answered you. % health is to give a champion an appreciable amount of damage for the duration of the game, while also ensuring that damage will never reach the levels of \"I hit you with this, you immediately lose all your health\". It makes them a damage threat without making them bursty.\n\n#3: Cho is a late game mage-tank carry. He's weird, but one of the good things about league is champion diversity. Yes, he can nuke you for a huge amount with his R, but he has to get into melee range of you to do that.. And given his late game hit box, and his limited gap closing potential, it's not that hard to keep him away from you.\n\nSo, let's look at both sides of this. Shen has % health damage on a fairly short cooldown, while Cho has straight up burst on a much longer cooldown.\n\nBoth of these are fine. Shen is a long-haul bruiser, who will whack chunks out of your health bar of a period, and punish you for staying near him.. And he also won't have too hard a time getting near you. Cho, on the other hand, will have a rough time closing the gap. When he does one single person will have a VERY bad day, after which he's a lot less dangerous.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hong Kong Annie","date":"2018-02-03T18:30:52.985+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tanks should do damage though.

Tanks have been given %hp damage because they lane against other tanks. It's stupid, yes, but that's the reason.\n\n\" Gnar has 3 instances of %max hp damage\" -- He only has 2. One of which scales off of _his_ HP.  \n\nNow for my input on the situation:\n\nI think the design philosophy that everyone has to do damage is stupid. The community clamored for it, so Riot gave it to them.. But why in the hell should someone who, by design, lives longer than a squishier character, do significant damage? They should disrupt the enemy carries by some other means. \n\nWhen Leona was released, Riot explained that she wouldn't do much damage, but would fill her tank role by having semi-spammable disruption abilities. For a long time Nautilus was a top pick not because of his damage, but because he has an ungodly amount of CC. Before Mao's rework, he was popular because of his CC. Obviously there are other reasons; Mao and Naut both had/have great wave clear for sidelane pushing, and Mao could reduce damage taken by his team. But tanks should fit those design patterns more.. Disrupt, not kill.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2018-02-04T00:16:06.488+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that \"disrupt not kill\" works fine if you're primarily a support tank.
