When playing her, the Hunted was yellow again. Would it be nice to change the color back to Red because the Chinese New Year uses the Red to make the devil fear and make it go away. This way, in the game, the skin should still include the Red Hunted for the synbolism. When I came across this, I felt bad because the Yellow doesn't really go with the skin and doesn't really make sense.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n {{champion:76}} \r\n                  \r\n                  {{item:3050}}                 {{item:3060}}\r\n\r\n {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"ColorfulRainbows","date":"2015-02-14T02:17:32.687+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you KateyKhaos for considering my post and replying.

Is there still any chance that the skin will have passive changed to red again... everytime I play nidalee I don't want to use the skin because it just feels totally incorrect with the color as yellow :'( I watched a youtuber play and saw the red so I bought the skin because i really liked the bulging bright red. Also, Dragonslayer Braum got his red back, so nidalee should be the same... :'(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stamporion","date":"2015-02-14T19:57:36.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was going to buy this skin, but it doesn't change the passive, so headhunter is better.","replies":[]}]}
