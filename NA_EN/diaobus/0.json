After updating, I found I can buy the skin in the store again. So, the first thing I did is buy it to see whether doing this would reduce my RP, and it turned out that my RP was deducted. The second thing I did, of course, is refund the purchase. Then, I found the skin, again appears in the store. I customized a game to see whether I can use the skin in a game. It turned out that I can select it, but at the last second before I entered the game, the selection was cancelled, and I entered the game with another skin I have.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-30T02:19:30.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nWere you able to use the skin at any point?
