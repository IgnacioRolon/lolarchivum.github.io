It just kind of kept on saying \"trying to reconnect\" So I left thinking it was my internet connection. I found out it won't let me get back onto the server do to said maintenance..?

If you're playing when the servers go down for maintenance, everyone will disconnect from the match and the match will cease to exist. It shouldn't even show up in your match history because of this. I hope this helped!","replies":[{"poster":"Killerjays","date":"2017-01-13T01:24:55.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I was wondering why it didn't show up. That makes sense.
