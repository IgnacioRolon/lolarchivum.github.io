After LVL30 you lose half of those rewards, because you gain the same amount of IP but no XP. What if after LVL30 the XP you would have gotten is added to the IP you gain? It might mean some people get to buy runes/rune pages faster possibly allowing them to play more roles rather than 2 at any given time. It might not be the best argument for the cause but I still think it would be a good idea to add the XP to the IP.What do you think? Pros/Cons? For/Against?\n\nDiscuss\n\n(edit) I explained this is a reply to a comment but I think it's a good enough point to put upfront: \"What I think would be nice, is for players that just got to LVL30, who might have the 2 rune pages filled out and some champs, to experiment more by getting new champs/runes/rune pages faster now that they have some idea about the game and what they want out of it.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Ignis0","date":"2015-09-16T13:53:06.983+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":1,"body":"The IP gain system is this game is way too slow we need this.","replies":[{"poster":"JohnJonesy","date":"2015-09-17T00:19:04.741+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ah, but Rito wants us to spend RP, so they make it annoyingly slow so that we must either play tons, creating a dedicated player, or spend money on the game.

You need all of those to do it properly and this endeavour will most likely take you past LVL30 when the boost I propose might be useful. Also as a new player before LVL20 you can do just as well with the free rotation that week trying to see what champions you like and in what role, that is why I say you can do without spending IP until 20 especially since you cannot buy tier 3 runes in advance before 20.","replies":[{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-09-16T21:12:22.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Semmaka,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PEU58HEz,comment-id=000300000000000100000000,timestamp=2015-09-16T20:56:22.836+0000)\n>\n> You can get 2 full pages and two champions for two different roles before 30. \n\nConsidering level 30 requires about 300 games,that's pretty much nothing,I mean two champions,come on(let's face it,the fun ones are generally not the 450 ip ones,so it really is about 2 champions+2 rune pages).\n\n>The question after is do you put the IP in new runes, a new page or a new champion for a new role.
