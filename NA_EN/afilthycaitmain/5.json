Her corrupt neutral point of view is borderline neutral evil in some cases.\n\nI honestly feel that she's more chaotic neutral.\n\nThe idea of \"stay in motion\" and go for what you want does not fuel evil specifically because those who wish to do good but are scared would take action under her beliefs.  The problem is that her idea is more anarchic as it says to govern yourself and do as you believe you should.  She promotes neither good nor evil.  She only says that you should take care of yourself and your personal interests.  This is pretty much what chaotic neutral characters do.  They look out for numero uno. If they do bad, it's not cuase they're evil, but because it may have been the only thing they could do to help themselves.  If they do good, it is pretty much spur of the moment or circumstantial.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-05-24T20:14:37.729+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Had this conversation a few times.

She tests you in the hopes that you regain your spirit and motion, not in the hopes that you die (though she does accept that some will die).  She went to Bilgewater and worked to protect it from the Black Mists.  She hasn't done anything really evil that I can recall from the lore, the only thing that is close was her testing GP when she thought he would fail.\n\nOn another note, I get why you think she might be lawful but disagree about her being lawful.  The thing is, what about her is lawful?  She follows some kind of code, but the code can be summarized as \"do what you want and get others to do the same.\"  Not exactly a detailed or restrictive code.  While I am not sure if I would say she is really chaotic, I don't see her as lawful.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-05-25T04:51:22.117+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool, always fun to revisit this one.\n\nI definitely see the evil.  She goes and tests people by her religion, in a test that can kill them.  She does not ask if they want to take the test.  These people do not come to her wishing to take the test.  In fact Gangplank is begging her not to do it.  \n\nShe does it anyway, fulling thinking that she's going to kill Gangplank.  Which, honestly, I don't have a problem with since Gangplank is a piece of shit mass murdering sociopath.  But the implication is, that doesn't matter.  He could have been the sweetest guy who ever lived, but if he wasn't \"in motion\" she still would have tested him and potentially killed him.\n\nThat's horrifying. That is straight up religious extremism of the weirdest and worst sort.  Imagine that, people coming up to you, saying you have to follow the tenets of their religion and then forcing you to take a test that you could die from without your permission.  Because that's what she's doing.  She just has some bullshit excuse about how it's your duty to be in motion.  She's basically the villain from the Saw movies, but instead of making the torture external, it's internal and motivated by her incredibly screwed up religion.\n\nAnd we may try to justify that horrifying shit by saying that \"she's just trying for motion, so people can reach their full potential.\"  But let's look at that.  Motion isn't inherently good.  Neither is people's potential.  We see that first hand, since basically what Gangplank gets out of his little test was that he should go and become an even bigger dickbag, who kills more, and destroys more, just so he can grab power and become the best pirate ever, potentially getting a whole bunch of people killed in the process.  And Illaoi knows this, and is totally ok with it.  That is basically giving Jeffery Dahmer a pep talk, saying \"Yeah, you raped and murdered 17 guys?  Why stop there?  Go big!  Go rape and murder another 100!  More than that!  You get the gold medal for best serial killer if you kill another 121!  Shoot for the stars, buddy!\"\n\nThat's why she's blatantly evil.  \n\nRemember, if we're going by the old D&D alignment system.  Neutral means you still prefer good, you just don't go out of your way to do anything about it.  Evil is where you literally don't care about the destruction you're unleashing, about the murders you're committing.  And make no mistake, she is committing murder by forcing people to undergo her test.  And she clearly doesn't care about the people she just unleashed a newly motivated Gangplank on.  Hell, her main motivation for fighting against the monster of the Black Mist is because she has a hangup about the undead.\n\nNow as to Lawful.  Lawful and Chaotic in D&D alignment is funny.  Because it's almost (but not entirely) meaningless.  There are really two things that aren't actually at all related that make up the Lawful/Chaotic alignment.  One is following the laws of the country you're in.  The other is following personal oaths.  But the thing is, everyone follows their personal ideology, it just matters where you're arguing from.  And if you define lawful as following the actual laws, that means a Lawful Good character who enters a Lawful Evil country, with rules like \"it's totally cool to kill slaves\" would suddenly stop being lawful if they try to mess with those rules.  Which is entirely against the other concept of standing up for your moral codes.  These contradictions make the Lawful/Chaotic axis pretty annoying to define, since it mostly involves what each people think are more important.\n\nFor example, take the most cited Chaotic Good character ever, Robin Hood.  He steals, that's chaotic.  And he gives to the poor, that's good.  He's chaotic good!  But he isn't.  If you read the old legends, Robin is attacking the unlawful government under King John, and disrupting illegal tax collectors.  That's following the old governments, pretty lawfully.  Hell, he is even gathering the money for the freeing of his true ruler, King Richard the Lionhard.  And of all the characters in the old legends, he's the only one who is almost unfailingly loyal about it.  Even Friar Tuck had his moments of fallacy.  But not Robin.  Certainly this makes him the most Lawful character in the stories.  And almost every character can be defined like that.  \n\nWhich brings me back to Illaoi.  We see her following her personal creed even if she doesn't want to, even when it could kill a lover.  That is straight lawful conduct right there.  She has her code, and she sticks to it, no matter the cost to her and those she's close to.  That's directly taken from the second aspect of lawfulness.  \n\nAnd I, definitely see personal codes as the more important aspect of Lawful.  Because I'm an old school gamer, and I have read the rules of places like The Drow Kingdoms, where the law is to be a chaotic murdering lunatic.  And that leads to other weird nonsense questions such as \"if the law says to be chaotic, then by definition everyone chaotic just became lawful.\"  Which thoroughly breaks with the simplicity of what the alignment system was originally meant to convey.\n\nAnyway, if you made it through all that.  That's my take.  Illaoi.  A Lawful Evil character, who preaches a True Neutral religion.  Fun stuff, interesting character.  Still evil, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2017-05-26T01:55:50.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to come back to this when I can give a response your comment deserves, but I don't really have the time to do put that much thought into this right now.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Valaran Nara","date":"2017-05-25T03:04:17.078+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Warlord Dienekes,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=BMB2Alpb,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2017-05-24T20:14:37.729+0000)\n>\n> Had this conversation a few times.

At which point, Lawful Neutral since she isn't out to kill or destroy others.\n\nAfter all, Punisher is \"Chaotic Good\" but he guy goes on a murdering spree of villains.\nIf they weren't villains, he'd be considered evil.\n\nI just don't think Illaoi is evil because if she was Lawful evil (obeying the laws of her religion strictly), then she would be trying to take advantage of others and using said rules as a way to do so.\n\nOf course the D&D guide lines for the spectrum isn't the best compass for morality to begin with.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-05-25T04:58:51.407+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not necessarily.  I just posted an altogether far more wordy than it should be explanation of my opinion to Baron of Bread, which covers most of this.  So, I'm going to skip all that and just focus on what it means to be Lawful Evil, in that she has to try and take advantage of others.\n\nI don't think so.  Now, taking advantage of others or abusing her power is definitely the usual way Lawful Evil is represented, because it fits so perfectly.  But Illaoi is an almost unique character.  She is not trying to take advantage of anything, but she still is performing evil acts and promoting evil acts.  \n\nHer test is basically murder.  She takes people who don't want to take the test, against their will, and if they fail, they die.  That's murder.  Pretty weird murder, but still murder.  Which is on the tip top of the \"things that are evil\" list.  She also has no problems setting lose a mass murderer to go kill more people.  In fact, she sends them on their way with a new sense of importance with their mass murdering.  That's accessory, for one, and I would argue still really evil.  Which she let's happen because it's her god's will, apparently.\n\nNow, personally, I'd argue against the Punisher being on the Good side of the alignment pool.  Definitely when he was originally introduced murdering jaywalkers.  But he at least is attempting to improve the world in a small way.  He is targeting villains to create a better world. \n\nIllaoi isn't even doing that.  She's targeting anyone, and totally willing to kill the innocent and the guilty.  Because she doesn't care about that.","replies":[{"poster":"AFilthyCaitMain","date":"2017-05-25T05:34:51.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But her god and religion is all about motion.
