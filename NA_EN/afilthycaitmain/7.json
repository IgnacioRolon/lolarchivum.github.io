A good Zed is impossible to gank, never has trouble with cooldowns or resource management, and can freeze or shove wave pretty easily. When I play someone like Annie, sure I basically just win the game by default, but anyone else and he just Q farms and evades any gank with his shadows. Then he roams or takes a turret in half a second. He's one of those champions that is either extremely oppressive or useless depending on who you use, and I think that's one of the worst things that can happen to balancing.

Also the mid should follow up that Talon if possible when he roams. And the support should do a good enough job to screw that Talon combo up.(You may say that support has no time to react but he certainly does when the mid follows Talon up and also pings before that Talon is missing). The same way you can just bring out many other assassins and why they are stupid. Ekko? If you can't see him and he casts his W, it's actually a bit hard to doge it i he predicted well and you are low mobility. Sure you see him coming but if anything goes wrong just R to safety and get healed. Zed? Wait enemies to use skillshot and only use your shadows after that to dodge the cc. Afterwards with ult do some sick stuff. Seriously you can go on and on with assassins. Some are superior at roaming, some not, but each of them has some kind of weakness atleast. For Talon it is what it used to be. If he goes in he must get that carry down because a normal teamcomp makes it no way out once he engages. Then again, I'm just a silverscrub last season G5 so I'm not experienced at this game and I might be wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2017-03-24T09:57:21.913+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":5,"body":"My point here is that the squishy can't do _anything_.
