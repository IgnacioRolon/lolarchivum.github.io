Dare I say this is a the best theme this year? Maybe one of the best in league? When you hear this and had to compare it blindly with a champ, Irelia would probably one of the most picked. It gives vibes of Mulan, a powerful warrior woman. It has chinese influences (which is what ionia is based heavily off of, ancient/old Chinese culture.) The only champion I think the track could sometimes be mistaken for is Karma (which is another strong ionian woman who has found new meaning to war.)\r\n\r\nOverall just an amazing track that I think will stay iconic to Irelia for years to come.\r\n\r\nAlso gives me Kingdom Hearts vibes,  just me tho.","replies":[{"poster":"Muten Shensei","date":"2018-03-18T04:59:18.673+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah..
