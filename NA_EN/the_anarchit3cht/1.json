I just updated my client (5:55pm PST) and the Join Game button is gone in teambuilder. Since its the mode I primarily play it's pretty much killed the game for me.

This is probably why the 'Play' button disappeared >.< \n\nThe patch should have been successfully deployed, and you should be able to play TeamBuilder normally now!  :D\n\nReply back if your still unable to get into the queue!","replies":[{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2015-01-17T23:13:52.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For what it's worth, it works fine now.  2 days later... but yeah.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cloee","date":"2015-01-15T23:33:49.865+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":2,"body":"Same happening to me I restarted my computer and everything","replies":[]}]}
