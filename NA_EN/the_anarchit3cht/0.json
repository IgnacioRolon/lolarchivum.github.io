Effectively making the skin cost the 1400 ip or what have you.","replies":[{"poster":"DontHassleDaHoff","date":"2015-03-12T20:52:05.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jumping in here.  New skins typically don't go on sale close to their release date.  Aside from 1350's and 3250's which get an short window of a discount.  The New Champion + New Skin bundle that are available essentially apply the discount to the champion.  So if you unlock the champion with IP, the skin would be the regular price.","replies":[{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2015-03-13T02:52:01.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I assumed as much. It still seems like the champion should subtract from the price whether at a discounted rate or not. As in the bundle should then cost the 975 and not the like 1462 or whatever it actually is. Just an oddity I suppose, nothing big. I purchased the skin itself anyway. ","replies":[]}]}]}
