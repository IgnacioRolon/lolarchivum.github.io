Every time I'd try to launch my client (even as admin) all I get is this:\r\n\r\nhttp://prnt.sc/e9805d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe client still uses memory heavily so it seems like it's actually working on something but there is no progress bar or anything. You can see the buttons and news even though it's dimmed but can't interact with any. I've tried numerous things but with no positive outcome. The game ran normally before I uninstalled it. I'd appreciate some help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-16T00:47:09.497+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems to be an issue with the Client trying to serve you a notification, but not being able to. We should be able to resolve this by taking the following steps. \n\n>- Go to your League of Legends install folder. Default is (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends) go to \\RADS\\system\n- Locate the **user.cfg file** and open with notepad\n- Change leagueClientOptIn = yes to **leagueClientOptIn = no**\n- Save the changes and close it out\n- Go to \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\" and delete LeagueClient.exe\n- Launch League from the **lol.launcher.admin.exe** file as admin \n\nLet me know if this worked in resolving your issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Svimeznaju","date":"2017-02-16T12:32:45.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot for the quick reply. This fixed it.\n\nI wanted to try this solution earlier too but what threw me off is that the \"user.cfg\" file was completely blank when opening via notepad, still gave it a shot this time and voila!","replies":[]}]}]}
