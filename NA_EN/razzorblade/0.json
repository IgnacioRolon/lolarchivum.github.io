Like you really think it's unfair.\n\nEdit: I guess I'll give my two cents. The rules are pretty clear. Perhaps you were ignorant of them. But the ban is fair and just because you broke said rules. How could it be any other way? Just start letting people break rules? Or you want like a council of judges to determine who deserves to be told to kill themselves and who doesn't? Sorry dude.
