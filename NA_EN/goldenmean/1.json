We'll see though, but even as good as Pepinero is he's the only one making stuff happen.  If they can't find a way to activate Werlyb/Adryh they'll be in Challenger against MYM...  If they can't find some mid/late shot calling they just sort of walk around in circles face checking bushes until the game is over.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yandere Carry","date":"2015-03-29T06:42:14.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"....what","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-03-30T14:43:22.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of the fks, and I don't understand.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
