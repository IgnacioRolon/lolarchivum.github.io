Alternatively, I think you get paid too much for short losses. Currently I still need a lot of IP and I find myself in situations where it's 20-minutes into a game and my team might have like a 40% chance or even 20% chance of winning the game. My team wants to continue the game, but when they do, my IP per hour drops below the 150/hr from the quick loss.\r\n\r\nIf we made longer game duration wins pay out more IP, then the risk of losing your IP/hr (when you have a set number of hours per day / per human lifetime that you can play) would be more balanced by the reward when you did win.\r\n\r\nI think the person that designed this at riot is paying the minimum IP to keep people in the game, as I suppose they should, but damn this sucks. It would be better to get together with a group of friends and play 20-minute losses unless you were crushing (70%+ likely to win).","replies":[{"poster":"Laviosah","date":"2015-01-09T14:25:36.661+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no job or personal life right now do to personal reasons and play litterally 10-12 hours a day, and still dont get nearly enough ip to even consider getting 6300 or even 4800 champs with ip, let alone runes. I feel it needs a medium sized increase in order to keep people with actually lives able to still buy and use champions and give them more incentive to play the game. Half the fun is trying out new things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serevas","date":"2015-01-09T17:59:28.376+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be completely honest I think the system is in place in this form to try and encourage you to pick up more RP and buy more champions with RP saving your IP for runes as they're only able to be bought with IP, and not cheaply for that matter either. 820 IP for a simple hybrid pen mark that's like 6 wins in order to buy a single rune when you need 9 of them for a proper page. The win of the day helps, but in all honesty that's still really steep. Not to mention half the meta picks in the game for champions are all 6300 champions.\n\nI don't blame riot, people have to make money, but still.","replies":[{"poster":"WolfBV","date":"2015-01-10T18:44:22.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I recommend T1 runes over T3 runes if you want some cheap stats.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SelflessTeammate","date":"2015-01-09T18:20:35.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well...Maybe. I mean, When it comes down to it, the difference between a tier 2 and 3 rune isn't really that fantastic, stacked or not. If you've got one player with tier 2 runes and they're just better, and another with tier 3 runes who plays even the slightest bit worse, the difference is irrelevant.\n\nRunes provide only the smallest difference compared to just how well you know your stuff. Masteries, which happen to be free and fully and infinitely refundable, are far more important.\n\nI would never recommend to anyone to purchase more than one champion with RP, if any. It's just not worth it unless you've really got your eye on one in particular. If you stick with the game long enough, you'll have more IP than you'll really know what to do with.\n\nMaybe new players don't know that and intrinsically believe that the expensive ones are better without knowing ahead of time that they really aren't at their level. At a starter level with little to no knowledge of how this hopelessly complex game works, it doesn't matter whom you pick. At all.\n\nAll I'm saying is that you can put off Runes all you want. Tier 2's are cheap and frankly, when it comes down to rune power versus knowledge of the game, almost as good as Tier 3's anyway. By the time you want to move up in Ranked, you'll have way more than enough IP for all the Tier 3's to decide upon. Until then, it's just up to how well you're learning the game, not how good your runes are.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2015-01-09T18:31:41.014+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hi, I own every single champion, 20 rune pages, and more runes than can be put onto said rune pages.\n\nOnly champion I've bought with RP was Taric, with the free \"Christmas\" RP back in...

It is only a problem when you have many interests and need IP at faster pace.\n\nI don't think Riot will ever do anything about it, as said, the IP rate right now is reasonable for most players, Riot mostly target those with higher demand but less patience. If you are one of those but lack money, I can see how it sucks but nothing we can do about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SelflessTeammate","date":"2015-01-09T16:10:04.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is just going by a feeling, but it seems ARAM grants a little more over a longer period of time, significant enough that I can get 6300 relatively quickly.\n\nRanked also just feels faster, even if the numbers don't seem to say it is. Not sure about that one, unless the numbers it states aren't right. Even in Ranked losses, you seem to just have a bigger total on that upper-right bar in the client.

There's no denying that Riot is a business first. However if one does insist on doing everything with ip then they will be needing a lot of time. But can I just point out that there is no reason to own all the champs.\n\nThere are those champs who a person will never want to play and therefore have no reason to buy him. Also if you're seeking to try out a champ freeweek is a much more logical choice to test someone instead of buying them blind. Also regardless of what our skill level is there are some champs we just don't do well with.\n\nThe only counter argument that I can foresee is for the purpose of trading in ranked and draft. Granted it is useful to trade champs in select in order to avoid first picking a vital choice. But between four other people there is great chance that between the five there will be a way to make a trade work out.\n\nIf you disagree with this I welcome the opportunity to discuss it with anyone. That said please keep in mind that I would intend to keep said discussion civil.","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-01-10T03:52:44.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should give bonus IP for consecutive wins, sort of like a win streak reward.
