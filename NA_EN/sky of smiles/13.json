CC like a Boss. Save allies like a Boss.\r\n\r\nThe one time I finally got Mid, Team was so ahead 4v5, if that Darius didn&#039;t do the old &quot;1v5 the enemy team nonstop while claiming to do so so that team can pressure when team was at base&quot; where you never group, we would have won too easily. Other two times I&#039;ve lost with Galio, I was still able to stall the game as Galio Support and we had a Master Yi purposefully throw the game as well back when Brand Support was a thing.\r\n\r\nNow you can argue my build doesn&#039;t allow for much damage, but that is my playstyle with him or almost any champion. I prefer helping others grow and don&#039;t mind being KS even when I play ADC.\r\n\r\nRemember guys. Over 8k gold lead for over 10minutes. That&#039;s how hard your team mates have to throw when you&#039;re playing Galio - the Guardian Pedo Stalker Sentinel of Damacia.","replies":[]}
