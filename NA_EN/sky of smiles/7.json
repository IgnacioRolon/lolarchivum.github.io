Never had a dragon girl, never burned down villages, none of that. Pretty sure something is wrong with me, but I&#039;m kind of done caring, and ready to give up.\r\n\r\nI was just wondering if the girl I&#039;m looking for even exists.\r\n\r\n* She&#039;d be super Au&#039;Ra, someone who actively plays video games and enjoys anime and all that, and would enjoy going to dungeons with me.\r\n* She&#039;d be an Astrologian and won&#039;t hold back on CDs, always there for insta queues when I need her, and unwilling to take drops I want.\r\n* She&#039;d have a lot of mind, and would enjoy learning about the rotations that interest her just for the sake of clearing raids.\r\n* She&#039;d be a bit braver than me, and would push me to FINISH THE FUCKING GAME and come out of my shell.\r\n* She&#039;d enjoy just babysitting me as we walk around the city checking out restaurants.\r\n* And she wouldn&#039;t be into drugs, smoking or alcohol abuse.\r\n\r\nSo, do dragon girls like that even exist? Sounds a bit too much like a fairytale or an anime to me. Though if I&#039;m looking for imaginary things, that might explain part of why I have no luck.\r\n\r\nAnd how do shy, introverted casual Tanks usually go about finding dragon girls? I&#039;ve been using party finder and the FFXIV forum for years, but no one ever messaged me. Anything in game usually ends up with me being used and then dumped.\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/IOPEQge","replies":[]}
