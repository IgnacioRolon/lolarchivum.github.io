Remember back in 2012, Valve was already making over 10x what Riot Games was generating. \r\n\r\nWhat causes gamers to criticize a game developer more so than say big oil? Is it because of a sense of empowerment thinking that they&#039;re special and that their opinions matter towards them because we interact with them more? We Americans, we know if we don&#039;t complain, nothings gonna get done. Companies accept that which is why you see Customer Service departments in say Staples for example since they manufacture quite a bit of their own stuff (at extremely competitive prices) on top of being a distributor of brand name office supply equipment. They always want to improve. However, every year, it seems like the complaints and requests of LoL gamers become more and more... demanding? absurd? just straight stupid? Nerf this, buff that (fk this, fk that).\r\n\r\nAs a gamer, I love challenges in games. If I wanted something simple and straight forward, I&#039;d play freecell. The hardest part about this game, is interacting and coordinate with people. In fact, trying to improve in LoL hurts my real life communication skills. I&#039;ve worked on it before and practical methods you&#039;d learn from books have not been successful (you&#039;d perform better talking down on your allies than you would talking to them with respect that they may or may not deserve). So I&#039;m not very good at understanding the average gamer who likes CoD because I&#039;m more of an RTS fan - I&#039;ve had more fun as a kid playing this old version of Flight Simulator back in 2000 that my cousin got for me from his friend than I did playing basketball or Mortal Kombat. What I want to know is, what compels people to complain to game developers before properly researching into things? I mean, many of the complaints requesting nerfs on champions seem to come from people who haven&#039;t bothered spending 2mins on lol wiki looking up a champion&#039;s skill set and strategizing methods to tackle them in a given match up with a solid base foundation. Yet, they still do it without any sufficiently logic behind their demand.","replies":[]}
