It started a few days ago out of no where and as far as I know nothing new has happen. I have reinstalled LoL, restarted the Router and nothing seems to be working.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. I can't play any champion with skill shots right now as Ezreal's Q is taking about 2 seconds to cast from input.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-20T22:45:00.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're experiencing high packet buffering.
