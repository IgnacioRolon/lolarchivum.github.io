He flamed way more than that and intentionally fed, which is not knit-picking offenses. You should be permanently banned for feeding and flaming at all, but I agree that it was a weird time to \"indefinitely\" ban him. I could see them banning him just because his channel was growing so fast and they wanted to put a stop to the glorification of being toxic, but either way just because you used to troll and flame a ton doesn't mean you're allowed to troll and flame even a little. And if anything he is under a larger microscope for being so well known and already on their perma ban list.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyaldan","date":"2016-05-01T03:42:28.942+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally i think anyone who intentionally feeds deserves some kind of punishment, myself included.

You can't judge him relative to his old self, you only can judge him relative to the rules riot set in their term and conds. And he said he would turn it around and reform then he intentionally fed... If he was reformed he would not int, troll, or afk EVER. Like millions of players do everyday. Consequences exist.\n\nImagine you stole an iphone from walmart so they ban you. You change locations and go back to a walmart and steal a t.v. and get banned again. You get banned 20 times, and the 21st time they catch you stealing a candy bar, they will not give a shit that you were doing better, or that you claim you were reformed, or that it's just a candy bar compared to the iphones you used to steal, you're now life banned from walmart at any location. You should not have stolen the candy bar period. \n\nHonestly what's wrong with you? It's fine to like the guy, he's not everyone's cup of tea for obvious reasons, but you can't just try to create an alternate reality and ignore the fact that he thought he could keep getting away with breaking the rules and got punished for doing something he shouldn't have done? Hell he could've kept the subs, cash, channel, all of it if would've been fine if he would just flame everyone on camera not in chat, or not intentionally fed when he doesn't get his way. Grown ups don't get to act like this in the real world, save for when you people take your shitty lives out on restaurant staff, so accept that the only reason you still want him playing is because you think he's funny. \n\nYou know who else thinks afking and trolling are funny? The people that afk and troll in your games, the people you hate and I'm sure flame and report.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DogshÃ­tPlayer","date":"2016-05-02T06:04:15.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jungle Brungus,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=qtKiup49,comment-id=00010002,timestamp=2016-04-30T20:50:25.687+0000)\n>\n> I actually (shamefully) watched him a bit near the end and I will say after having watched his old stuff too,\n> \n> He used to be 10 times worse.
