This guy was a really extreme case though. He kept getting mad at our teammates for feeding (except me by some miracle idk), even though he wasn't doing so well himself. He threatened to afk multiple times, then actually did for about 3 minutes and came right back only to start flaming again. Even when I looked into his match history after the fact he had two leaves on record (which is probably why he came back into our game, probably got some message that he'd left too many games recently).
