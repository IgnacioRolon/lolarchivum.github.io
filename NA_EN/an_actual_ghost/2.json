If the AD has a Last Whisper, then they just blow it away. If a minion is present, and the debuff is applied, or your tank is fearlessly tanking for a minion also, then Mages can realistically blast towers down, but it's more complicated. Focus the minions with wave clear and this won't ever happen.\n\nIf your team just isn't there, then that's different and their fault.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-02-07T22:49:55.539+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"You act like those aren't the same/similar numbers before...whenever you're making a comparison from.
