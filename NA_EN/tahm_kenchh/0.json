We put together teams from all walks of life in multiple different video games and give them a chance to do more than just get out of ELO hell. We give them a chance to go pro.\r\n\r\n**Sounds great. But who can join?**\r\nAnybody can join! As long as you&#039;re serious and active, there are no rank requirements. We have many teams teams per rank per region that you can join, and if your rank or role is already filled, you can be a substitute until it is open again.\r\n\r\n**Substitute? But that sounds boring.**\r\nNot to worry. Substitutes are in high demand in Castle and it wouldn&#039;t be long before you get your own team to play with. Teams are assigned a rank when they are formed. If they exceed that rank, they are made an &quot;official team&quot; and then whatever rank they were assigned now becomes an empty team. Which means if Team A starts as a lower ranked team, and gets to a higher rank, then Team A isn&#039;t the &quot;lower rank team&quot; anymore, allowing a new team below them to be formed. This process replicates exponentially.\r\n\r\n**Okay, so how does this help me go pro?**\r\nWhen you are a part of a team that hits a high enough rank, you will sign a contract stating you will continue to be a part of your team for 6 months. And if you leave the team in those 6 months, you won&#039;t join any other professional teams until the 6 months is over. This allows for your exclusivity. As well as the owner of Castle being a sponsor, there are private investors sitting in the discord right now! All they are looking for are people who look good enough to sponsor.\r\n\r\n**What if I am not free every day?**\r\n Castle requires you play one game every two days, so work with your team to decide a schedule!\r\n\r\n**What if somebody on the team sucks at the game?**\r\n Not to worry. Every monday the team will take part in a vote that will allow them to kick a member from the team if need be. (This being said, Team Captains can kick people from the team at any time. The vote is to ensure the Team Captain doesn&#039;t keep people in the team just because he likes them.)\r\n\r\n**Sounds great. Where do I sign up?**\r\nVisit http://www.castlegaming.org/, and fill out the application to join. Once you&rsquo;re finished, there will be a discord invite link at the bottom of the page. Note that your application may not be reviewed as it is sent in, so allow for a maximum of three days time before posting in #role-assignment. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"Blessings","date":"2018-03-31T07:37:00.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fix website","replies":[]},{"poster":"KidControl","date":"2018-03-30T09:32:26.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your website does not work","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrTeath","date":"2018-03-30T07:54:04.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Esports needs to die.
