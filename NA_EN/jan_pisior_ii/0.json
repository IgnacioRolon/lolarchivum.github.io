Before I even start, I want to tell you that I am very familiar with informatics and electronics, so therefore I tried lots of things before I thought about asking for your time. So the situation is like this: I had to upgrade my BIOS driver (from the official acer site, firstly defining my laptop model on their site), dunno which was the previous version, but it upgraded itself to 1.32. Now when I am playing league, or even just logging in/selecting a champion the game freezes, strange colours start to appear, like a rainbow of pixels on my client, then my laptop freezes entirely, often ending in BSoD. Now, my laptop specifications:\n\nLaptop Model: Acer Aspire E5-571G-52VR\nOS: Win10\nGraphics: Intel HD Graphics + nVidia GeForce 840M\nRAM: 16GB\nI guess my processor is irrelevant\n\nNow, the steps I made: \n- Uninstalled (with DDU) and installed again the nVidia graphics driver (there is even one, which came out today, tested it already)\n- Reinstalled LoL many times\n- Reinstalled Windows (keeping the files) + checked for both not updated and updated nVidia grahpics driver + checked for both old and new LoL installation\n- Reinstalled Windows (removing all the files) and again checked for both possible ways for driver/lol\n- I did return to default BIOS settings (v1.32 stayed the same)\n- Did dozens of restarts, plug-out/ins\n\nI guess I explained my situation. So guys, did you have issues like this? If so or not, do you know a way, to make this work?\n\nThanks in advance, Jan Pisior II","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-15T17:46:44.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that you've done a lot of troubleshooting, and my first impression is that there might be a driver or hardware problem.
