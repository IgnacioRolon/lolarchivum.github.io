From the orchrestral soundtracks that make me feel like I&#039;m going on a thrilling adventure or the fast, tense, songs that make me feel like a battle is about to happen and to the upbeat rock like songs such as &quot;Get Jinxed.&#039; I have a large library of some of the songs just to listen to on the go or even while doing homework. I have to give kudos to such a wonderful music team at Riot. What are your favorite tracks that they have produced? \r\n\r\nSome of mine in no particular order: \r\nBilgewater Theme\r\nHowling Abyss Theme\r\nCrystal Scar Theme\r\nEkko Login\r\nJinx Login\r\nKindred Login\r\nWorld Collide \r\nArcade 2015 Login\r\nSeason 5 login","replies":[{"poster":"Riot TreblMuffin","date":"2016-01-07T07:46:51.784+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Bilgewater/Gangplank music may forever be my favorite piece.

It feels like the track is this weird Irish party in the back of a dimly lit fishing cottage in Bilgewater.
