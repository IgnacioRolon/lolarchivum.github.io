Only that she doesn't have the luxury of being able to do it from a safe 825 distance that Orianna's Q allows. The slow also lasts 1 second less and the knock-in effect is a bit weaker.\r\n\r\nDiana doesn't have an AoE MS boost for her team.\r\n\r\nDiana's shield is restricted primarily on herself and doesn't provide armor/MR.

(5-4 respectively if passives are included)\r\n\r\nAt level 18, Diana's passive equals to 83+0.27/AP on each hit. Orianna's passive equals to 70+0.18/AP when stacked. Diana's passive is the **ONLY** thing that slightly goes ahead due to being AoE and having a small AS boost. (close to irrelevant due to Diana having bad base AS, because somehow you enjoy giving a champion a specific power and then taking it away from base stats, like what you similarly did to Lissandra with her passive and base mana regen.)\r\n\r\nEven then, let's not forget that Orianna has the benefit of being ranged over Diana being melee, so her passive is arguably better in the end, if relative safety of applying it is taken into account. It also has immediate impact from the first hit, which is always bonus points.\r\n\r\nAnd after all of these, you have nerfed Diana a total of **5 times**, whereas at the same time you have continuously promoted Orianna as a marvel of character design, despite Diana having *MUCH* more expoitable weaknesses, like having to commit to a teamfight or die, being melee, etc.\r\n\r\nThis is pure favoritism and hypocrisy.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-08-16T22:59:23.335+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":10,"body":"Just as food for thought, devil's advocate, and whatever:\n\nReliability is actually a really big part of that. Orianna Q-R'ing you versus Diana R-E'ing are very different, and Diana's is much more reliable. I can Valkyrie away from Ori's combo. I have to Flash away from Diana's. Additionally, the cooldown on that combo is significantly better for Diana as well.\n\nTo address random other points you put in:\n\nThe number of times a champion has been nerfed is irrelevant. The history really doesn't matter. If Caitlyn got nerfed by 8 AD one patch, versus being nerfed by 1 AD eight patches in a row, the end result is the same.

We're not trying to say, \"Yo guys, Diana is THE attack speed champion!\" We're not saying, \"Lissandra is THE manaless mana champion.\"\n\nRather, we're saying, \"Hey, Diana should feel like she attacks pretty fast all the time. Her passive should always feel useful.\" So rather than say, \"Okay, you start pretty fast, and then go SUPERSPEED\" we flattened it instead and say, \"You start as literally the fastest-attacking champion in the game, and get a little bit faster in the end, pretty close to everyone else too.\" Now you could make the argument that Diana *should* be a more AS-focused champion, but taking out base stats and placing an equivalent in an ability is not about cheekily nerfing and buffing a champion, it's about crafting a specialized experience.\n\nAs another, really clean example, Miss Fortune has incredibly low base movement speed, but the highest out-of-combat movement speed in the game. There's a real sense of power in Strut.\n\nIn the end what it comes down to is that reliability is a really powerful stat. In the past Diana was basically one-shotting people with no recourse. How do you outplay RWEQ from Diana? It literally can't miss, and she casts it from out of range of anyone's basic attack. My understanding of our eventual direction for Diana is to make her more about the Passive/W. Make her the tankier moon-knight, less of an assassin. It was her being a \"I one-shot you assassin + great team fight engager + really good bruiser\" that just seemed to give her no real weakness. I believe we will be shifting her to maybe 1.5 of those.\n\nBest answer I can really give you. I'm not a designer.

That's **not** more reliable than \"place ball\" -> profit.\n\n>  I have to Flash away from Diana's.\n\nThe ball can't be stunned, slowed, peeled off or anything else, so once again, your argument falls flat. No, you don't need to flash, you only need to stun or slow her and walk away, then kill her because she is melee and peeling make her useless. Whereas for Orianna, it's no big deal, she will just reposition her ball again in less than 3 seconds.\n\n> Additionally, the cooldown on that combo is significantly better for Diana as well.\n\nNo, she doesn't, because the combo is not something Diana can do freely without consequences, like Orianna does when she repositions her ball. Diana either goes in and everything goes well or she goes in and dies. You either do it correctly and at the right time or you get punished for it. Orianna is not punished for it, because even if she blows her R for nothing, the safety of her range means that nothing was lost and she will casually go back to farming her lane in order to get that 300 cs and be able to insta-gib 3 people with a couple spells.\n\nCalling Diana more reliable when Diana has more ways to be stopped available for the other team is an overstatement at best, if not slightly of a joke. \n\n> The number of times a champion has been nerfed is irrelevant.

Not everyone can have everything they want.\n\nBut in no way can you justify the nerfs after that point, where you also destroyed bruiser Diana, with sunfire cape/abyssal scep..\n\nYou could say you don't want her to be an assassin,fine. But if afterwards you guys come out and say that you don't want her to be a bruiser either, something is wrong with you.\n\nOh, and something else:\n\n> Base stats vs. passives, siphoning power, etc.: It's a gameplay thing. We're not trying to say, \"Yo guys, Diana is THE attack speed champion!\" We're not saying, \"Lissandra is THE manaless mana champion.\"\n\nWhy not? Didn't you guys say that you want your champions to have defined strengths and weaknesses? Wasn't that the reason given behind avoiding nerfing Lee Sin for so long?\n\n> How do you outplay RWEQ from Diana?** It literally can't miss**, **and she casts it from out of range of anyone's basic attack.**\n\nNot sure if serious ...I'll just leave this here then in case you are though. {{champion:134}}\n\nIn short, you said reliability is a big asset. But saying that Diana is more reliable is kind of a hollow argument, because she isn't when you take into account how easy it is to stop her and peel her off. You're only taking 1v1s into consideration and not actual teamplay, which is supposed to be the core of the game.\n\nEdit: Don't take parts of the post personally, I know you ain't directly responsible for balancing, it's just being part of the company, you know how it goes. ","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-08-17T00:14:24.191+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":11,"body":"Your replies tell me you don't want to have a discussion about Diana. You're hell-bent on saying, \"No, Diana's shit and Orianna's broken.\" You're cherry-picking individual weaknesses and strengths and ignoring counter-examples. I tell you the cooldown on Diana R-E is lower than Orianna's Q-R (which is factually true) and you immediately reply with \"no it isn't.\" That's not helpful to anyone.\n\nSo I'm going to stop talking about Diana's merits, but I'll talk about your other design questions.\n\nAs far as direction on champions goes: It's something we improve on over time. Some champions have too many roles. Some don't have one. Kassadin, for example, is the epitome of mobility. The rework, and all the subsequent nerfs/buffs, have only helped him move around really quickly and swiftly. He pays a price for that, for sure (High mana costs, among the lowest base damages in the game). I don't think we'll ever go back and say, \"You know what, forget Riftwalk. Kassadin is something else. He's an immobile tank now!\"\n\nFor Diana, we're pretty confident her theme works really well as in-your-face moon knight. We may learn more later, but one thing I think we do very well right now is dedicate ourselves to identifying a specific reason this champion is cool and push on it.\n\nAs for defined strengths and weaknesses, let me elaborate:\n\nLissandra's passive and base stats say, \"Defined strength: If you show temperance with your spellcasts and land your skillshots, you literally cannot run out of mana. Weakness: However, if you spam haphazardly, constantly looking for poke and missing you will run out of mana very rapidly and it won't come back.\" And this is differentiation as well from someone like Ziggs, who doesn't have these types of rules. We see it work, too. We've seen Lissandra rush Deathfire Grasp or Zhonya's Hourglass, while Ziggs always starts Chalice or Tear.\n\nDiana's passive pattern isn't specifically \"Create a defined kiss/curse.\" Not every ability or change is, \"This is the epitome of Clarity, the shining example\" or \"This is the epitome of showcasing massive strengths and weaknesses.\" Sometimes it's just \"Gameplay.\" There's lots of things to consider with any given design. In this case, Diana's passive is Gameplay choice:\n\nDiana has relevant auto-attacks. Extremely relevant ones, since the passive damage is quite high. She doesn't need to be the \"I am the fastest auto-attacker\" champion. I don't think that will ever be her role. We have champions like Master Yi and Tristana who fit that role better, IMO. Diana's more methodical. So I don't think she needs really high AS per level. She doesn't need a crazy high Base AS either. She has a ton of level 1 bonus AS because she is designed to have relevant autos all game, regardless of whether or not you itemize for them. That's the strength. That's the gameplay. Not \"I am the auto-attack queen.\"\n\nAnd you can dodge Syndra Q-E.","replies":[{"poster":"Baned by Snu Snu","date":"2014-08-17T00:29:49.426+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":18,"body":"> And you can dodge Syndra Q-E.\n\nThen you can dodge Diana's Q which is the requirement for her to follow up with anything else.

We've seen Lissandra rush Deathfire Grasp or Zhonya's Hourglass, \n\nIf you think that Lissandra was forced to rush DFG because she didn't have mana problems, then you are right, I don't think we have much to discuss here and I'm starting to seriously doubt whether the team responsible behind these thought processes deserves their pay check.\n\nI'm sure Lissandra was rushing DFG because she has a mana related passive and not because she was given dirt tier base damages and ratios and had to somehow make up for it.\n\nI also find it offensive including Ziggs and Lissandra in the same paragraph, as if they are anything close to each other in balance.\n\n> I tell you the cooldown on Diana R-E is lower than Orianna's Q-R (which is factually true) and you immediately reply with \"no it isn't.\" That's not helpful to anyone.\n\nThat's not what I said and I'd rather you didn't resort to fallacies once again. I'll repeat it so that it's clear to you:\n\nDiana can't spam Q-R-E either, because she doesn't have the luxury of doing it until she gets it right. If she does it at the wrong time, she is dead. Orianna doesn't have any severe consequences other than a cooldown, on a game where CDR is available as a stat and on a champion who can wave clear and stall as good as Orianna.\n\nYou saying that Diana has R-E available more often assumes that Diana is able to it without consequences, something that is not true.\n\nOnce again, I didn't say that Orianna doesn't do it less often, I said that Orianna has no grave consequences for doing it wrong, something that impacts the amount of reliability on actually doing it.\n\nSo please, refrain from fallacies. You call me hell bent on proving that Diana is shit. Meanwhile, you guys aren't hell bent into keeping her completely useless just because the community victimized her, completely disregarding her as a champion.\n\nYes, she is useless compared to Orianna and yes they do have similar functions. But the community thinks that she is toxic and that Orianna is the tears of Jesus objectified to a champion and you guys are just playing along with it.\n\nOnly your balancing team can prove me wrong, but they don't seem to want to.

You're very dead-set on balance, and comparing who's better than whom. Like, you literally refused to talk about the design pattern of Liassandra's passive because you're caught up on her damage being less than Ziggs, and saying we can't have a discussion because of that. Of course Diana is a worse Orianna than Orianna is: One of these is Orianna an the other isn't.\n\nI'm more interested in contrasting differences in approach and capabilities. Arguably Diana puts herself at greater risk to achieve her objectives. She's also much more durable in kit and item build. She has more base damages to access. These are all unique advantages and disadvantages. And that's the right way to go about it. I would never want there to be a \"worse Orianna\" in the game. I'd rather there be a Diana.\n\nUltimately, balancing a game is really difficult. Because while a champion like Orianna may be overpowered, you can still at least play around her: She dies if you catch her. She's squishy. She can miss her shots and you can dodge them. If she's overpowered, at least there's recourse. Unfortunately the same isn't true for Diana. If she's OP, you just die. You can't dodge. You just fall over if she's in range. The same thing happened with LeBlanc multiple times. Same thing happened with Support Annie. Even if they're not the literally best champions in their role, there's just so darned little counterplay available that if they're OP *at all* you just sort of have a horrible experience.\n\nThis is why we want to push Diana's role more toward fighter (last I checked). She'll probably still dash at you, put up a sweet moon shield, and all that jazz, but she's more about the long fight. It's easier to get away from someone like Shyvana and Dr. Mundo than it is Akali, where if she's ahead you just... die.

She's one of my favorite champs and is really fun to play, but she's also the least-used champ in my roster -because she sucks. (I understand that's really generic, but give me a moment.)\n\nIt seems most of your arguments revolve around laning phase gameplay. This, I will agree with. Taking Diana toplane, I dominate almost every matchup. I have a much harder time midlane due to the varied kits and range of AP casters, but she's effective there as well in many matchups. Even those who gripe about Diana's state in the game can't argue her laning phase is still solid if you're good with her. The issue comes in the other 2/3 of the game. The laning phase is a small portion of the overall game -while important, it is small, and if your champ can't handle well beyond that point, it *will* hurt the team.\n\nThis stems from her identity crisis. As you said, she was good at too many things. The problem is, in her current state, she doesn't do *anything* well beyond the laning phase. She excels in laning phase as an assassin. Because of that, people typically build her for AP burst. The problem with that is her insane mana usage. While Q, R, W, Q, R and some autoattacks kill most champs, you'll run out of mana before you can pick off the next champ. This is usually the result of going into a fight without having full mana, but often times you won't. And wasting gold on mana regen lessens her burst which she needs to stay somewhat relevant. Compared to an Akali or Katarina who don't have those issues, rather, excel in those departments, who *would* pick Diana unless you're just chillin' with a champ you haven't played in awhile? Diana can't consistently maintain the output of other assassins. That is not to say I haven't done well with her, but I there is a noticeable difference and I always feel handicapped with Di as she cannot reliably do what you expect from an assassin. She can't sustain. And going for burst, her defense is too low to fight for prolonged periods. She gets burst instantly even if you build Zhonya's and Rylai's. It's not exactly hard to wait out the invincibility and 400 health and 50 armor isn't anything really by midgame.\n\nSo then there's the idea of building her as a fighter. Waiting for a third-hit spellblade -no matter the AS, is always going to lose to better fighter-type such as Yasuo who has 100% crit and a death sentence for an ult, or Riven, who can shred even tanks like butter (with a shield,) or Fiora, who can repel all of Di's attacks and finish her off with an untargetable ult (probably wouldn't need it,) or Jax, who can dodge her autoattacks and dish out consistent damage with status effects, or Kayle, who can ult and take it while hammering away with her sword strokes of doom, etc. Also, half of them don't require mana and their abilities scale off their AD so auttoattacks on first hit are effective. Diana's aren't, she requires the third hit of AP if her abilities are to do *anything*.\n\nNo one comparing champs for effectiveness would pick her as a fighter. Her R is best for assassination, and without high AP which will be hampered by the defense, you'll have to build so she can survive duels and teamfights. She'd have to chase runaways down. R and E use would drain her mana too quickly to stay in the teamfight for long. Then there's also the fact that chasing is more often than not, the dumbest thing you can do in a game. It leaves you far too open to get ganked, or you run beyond the reach of your teammates in a teamfight. It's almost never a good idea -and to maintain damage output on par with other fighters who can dish it out much faster with less itemization, you'd have to chase, or be smart and assist all game never having a meaningful impact in teamfights until you R at the end. Even other assassins, though squishy, can do insane amounts of damage in the thick of a teamfight. Diana can't on that scale, nor can she keep up with other fighters *reliably*. She's unreliable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brorelia","date":"2014-08-17T03:51:45.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Orianna has been a high priority pick in both season 2 and 3 worlds and has not been nerfed in any meaningful way so yes we are in a way saying orianna is broken in a premade team setting.\n\nEven with the base AD nerf she is still a safe early game champ while being a nightmare late game champ because of both her damage and CC without having to be in real danger to use it.

I am not an avid Orianna player, but from an outside perspective** I can't really name a glaring weakness** that she has.  \n\n{{champion:131}} , as has been mentioned in a lot of other posts, seems to lack a solid healthy identity.  A lot of her damage is almost guaranteed if she is able to ult to you, her dash is much faster than an Orianna ball (I don't have exact numbers on Diana's ult projectile speed but it seems faster), and her burst scales better with AP.  Meanwhile, she is melee, she does not gain defensive stats (WHICH ORIANNA DOES!?), and her combo is interruptible (Thresh could flay her mid Ult and theoretically nullify almost all of her damage).  Because Diana's initiation is interruptible and requires her to go all in, it means she is not a reliable initiator for teamfights or picks, and since she has no reliable escapes (she requires a target in her escape direction) unlike Lee Sin who also has an escape that can be used on wards, she lacks a strong tank presence because once her ult is nullified she can almost be ignored or easily kited.    Most currently viable initiators have either a relatively safe ranged pick potential (Elise, Morg, Orianna, Syndra,  Lee Sin, Ryze, Mundo?, Rengar?) , or unstoppable/highly reliable initiation with decent beef  (Vi, Maokai, Alistar, Evelynn) .\n\nAs a tank {{champion:131}}  is **unreliable** and lacks the inherent beef (No passive defensive stats other than her decent base stats)  given to most tank-like champions, in addition, her shield at max rank costs *100 mana* (Which is a lot because she has borderline Sion levels of mana);  and without putting herself in danger, only blocks 100 + .3 AP (200 + .6 when able to proc the second half).   It's hard to compare her shield to others since she is the only melee tank/assassin where the shield itself does damage, unlike Nautilus and Sion where the shield must be maintained to do damage, Diana's damage comes with the act of activating the shield.  But generally, this move is used as an attack spell rather than a defense spell, because when comparable defensive shields are nearly free (Rumble, Shen, Lee Sin, Riven) or scale with health in some form (Vi, Malphite, Nautilus), hers seems to be a mismatch of ideas, causing a mediocre spell with only one viable use case: to attempt to kill someone with it.  With such a high cost and low shielding without going in, Diana is forced to engage to gain a reasonable shield or simply forgo wasting the large amounts of mana and take harass.  As a melee champion I feel this severely handicaps her abilities in lane and limits her decision making.  I understand this may be the type of character Riot was originally designing Diana as (Hyper all in), but in terms of balance I feel it doesn't work as well as it could. \n\n\nMaybe Diana's shield could start with the max shield, and if the bubbles pop give her an Armor/MR bonus?  Possibly lowering the base damage on it and tweaking the scaling while lowering the mana cost to make it more usable in lane.  \n\nAs an Assassin, Diana's damage is uncounterable without a displacement, meaning if she is ahead, you will die, similar to fizz, akali, or talon, but fizz, akali and talon have an escape for trades and losing situations in lane.  I really don't have much else to say on Assassins because to be honest, melee assassins are unreliable in nature.\n\nI'm no pro on either of these champs, I'm just sorta rambling for fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Baned by Snu Snu","date":"2014-08-17T10:29:48.627+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for the time you invested for that, it's really accurate in a lot of things and I agree.\n\nMeanwhile, despite Diana having all those inherent weaknesses a person can exploit, she is called toxic, whereas Orianna a perfect design.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fisk","date":"2014-08-16T05:00:44.319+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Diana's burst is easier to land if you are alone.
