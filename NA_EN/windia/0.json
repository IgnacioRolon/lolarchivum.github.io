I&#039;d prefer the Pre-side off set but as I was playing a game I felt like I was on the fixed off set. When I changed between both of them it only stayed on the fixed offset so when you change it to the pre-side off set, it won&#039;t change at all.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-03T23:48:02.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sakuzo - \n\nWe're aware of this issue and are working to resolve it ASAP.","replies":[{"poster":"Mandaari","date":"2016-02-04T05:42:07.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Katey I know you're just keeping tabs for this issue but is this something we can expect to be hotfixed or do we need to wait until the next patch?","replies":[{"poster":"1KaJ","date":"2016-02-04T06:31:30.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was wondering the same thing... this NEEDS to be hotfixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Robwill","date":"2016-02-04T13:23:19.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guy's she's already confirmed it wont be fixed during patch 6.2.
