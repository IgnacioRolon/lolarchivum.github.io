With that being said, I've gone ahead and looked up a popular thread, and sent it to the team who's responsible for the balance changes. \n\nWinter break happened shortly after that PBE update went out on December 15th, which meant a lot of us were out of the office either traveling, taking some time to visit family, or celebrating the holidays! That meant a lot less of us were checking the boards. \n\nIn addition, many PBE changes aren't totally explained since things on the PBE aren't always 100% definite. Tentative content does hit PBE, since it's a good environment to see if changes are good, and will be a positive change to the overall game. Should these changes make it to the live environment, they'll likely be explained in the patch notes.\n\nI'm not trying to make excuses, just trying to shed light on the Sona example specifically. And again, I've gone ahead and passed on one of the threads to the proper team. :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-06T23:53:01.471+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lyanna Stark,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=BEiVjdpy,comment-id=0012000000000001,timestamp=2015-01-06T22:22:33.544+0000)\n>\n> Why is this necessary?

(at the time of this writing) That means 15 more people disliked him coming to the boards to not really answer something than were glad he was there.\n\nSona being nerfed wasn't the only point of that post. Metaworldpeace10 was trying to figure out why champ A gets a nerf, while champ B won't even be commented on. Why does Leona (who has 3x times the game played) and Janna (who has 50% more games played) have a higher win rate in the past month but Sona is the one touched?\n\nI love Riot, and I don't want to sound toxic. But when the player base asks for communication they don't mean just swing by and say \"hi\". I don't know how many posts I have seen using Red Tracker where it seems the Rioter totally missed the point of the post in the first place.
