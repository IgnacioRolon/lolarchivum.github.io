Veig's q lacks both. It is unsatisfying to land (due to no utility), it has mediocre dmg (till he gets endgame), and in a chaotic fight, it's nigh impossible to see who you hit and it's sfx are also lacking as well.\n\nAlso, another thing: saying veig's q needed to be a skill shot cuz it does 'teh dmgz' is like saying annie's q needs to be a skill shot.

I think that's a fair trade considering how much AP you can build with it. Before the E nerf, I'd always build Tear (which works well with his farming pattern and passive) and build into Seraph's Embrace for 100+ AP and a decent shield. IT was a great farming item and gave him considerable AP later. Stack a Zhonya's on that and he can get into some teamfights. I recall a game I took him top and farmed up.
