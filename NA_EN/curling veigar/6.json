The skill is weaker, period. It is not better zone control than before, and stopping dashes won't matter when they can dash out or just walk out before it even activates. Moreover stopping dashes is something it should have *always* done.

You do the heavy lifting in the early game so that your team can close the deal instead of waiting out till the late game and do your hard carrying then. A great example of a lane bully that was extremely popular in the past was renekton.\n\nThe reason lane bullies can be bad for game health is IF they *do* have a strong late game, that is when they become over bearing and a game health problem. Falling off in dmg late game is a cost they take for having such a successful laning phase. And I feel that due to the lack of lane bullies assassins are having a heyday with it. (that, and zed's laning phase is way too safe/easy)\n\n> Reliable single target burst damage is not good for the game. I know Veigar players liked that. Doesn't matter. Can't support that fantasy in a competitive game.\n\nI strongly disagree. I fully believe a single-target burst play style can not only be healthy for league, but that the distinct lack of such champs is actually hurting league in the long run.\n\nHaving a champ dedicated to deleting one target causes players to actually think out what they are doing rather than blindly jumping into a fight and hoping they land their stuff before jumping out again. It also adds to the importance of positioning both before and during team fights by forcing players to realize that their dashes and flashes won't always save them from being stupidly out of place.\n\nI find the distinct *lack* of inevitability causes players to forget about planning and the importance of each choice they make over the course of the game can have a lasting impact on how the rest of the game plays out.\n\nVeigar in particular did this well. If you let him farm in lane without mercilessly crushing him, he *will* turn the tables on you. Veigar's theme is about certain demise and unrelenting revenge. And that translated well with his reliable kit. He created a \"death zone\" around him that all but the tankiest of champs should be scared silly to approach.\n\nThat being said, Veigar was far from being a \"broken\" champ. I've had numerous games where I was so fed, I had more gold than I knew what to do with, but despite it all, I could not win the game simply because after 40-50 min into the game, there are just *too many* enemies that need to be killed. And I can only kill so many of them within a certain time period. It didn't matter if I could do 3k burst dmg to a single target if they all had more than 2.5k hp and 100 MR. It's even worse when they all buy both a banshee's and a GA which completely negates my usefulness until my team can burn through their special defenses.\n\nThere are numerous ways to over come single target burst champs, and I believe that over the years, riot has slowly been taking away the need to use these methods in favor of reactive plays and such.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-03-07T22:13:01.181+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You want the game to be about planning, thoughtful action, and strategic counterplay.

The problem is that his play pattern is too reliable for League to accommodate.

That is the biggest problem with the ever growing rift in the player base atm.\n\nOlder players, such as myself, came to love league for many reasons, and it pains us to see league drift away from core gameplay styles that we grew to love about it. But at the same time, not all the change has been bad.\n\nThe problem here, is that league is swinging from one extreme to the other. We are losing one form of rich gameplay in exchange for another.\n\nWhen I first started league, it was great. Was it perfect? Heck no! I've stuck with league for 5 years now and love it. Is it perfect? Heck no! The difference is 5 years ago, league was as you said \"about strategic counterplay and thoughtful action.\" Now it has shifted to twitch plays and reactive mechanics. Neither of these are inherently bad. But the community is currently splitting apart and taking sides over which they want league to be.\n\nSee the issue?\n\nWhat I'm trying to say, however, is that either one is only part of what league is. League isn't JUST reactive \"LCS BIG PLAYS\" nor is it JUST \"thoughtful action and strategic counterplay.\" It's **both**.\n\nAnd the sooner riot and the community realizes this, the sooner league can become a richer, fuller game for it. Simply picking sides will not make league a richer, fuller game, it will merely cause the community to self destruct and possibly cause a mass exodus to a competitor. None of which is, nor should, be a desirable outcome.\n\nI fully believe that merging the two styles into one cohesive game is possible, it will take a lot of effort, yes, but it is not impossible.","replies":[{"poster":"Bardia the Bard","date":"2015-03-09T18:39:44.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with everything you said, and upvoting it wasn't enough.

Most poke/sustained damage mages are gone now. Ziggs and Xerath are pretty much the only ones left. I get people like seeing the flashy plays, but Xerath is not flashy. He is the opposite. And they like him where he is. He can also burst people from 3/4 health with good skill shots.\nTldr; Veigar needed something done to his E. But the delay was a lazy answer.

Everything else in his combo is avoidable -- difficult to avoid, but avoidable.  Then you have items, summoners, and champion abilities to work with, even if you fail to dodge the Q.\n\nZed has tons of counterplay.  What he doesn't have is any hard counters.  There's no champion you can go \"ok, I picked X, so now Zed will lose lane for sure\".  You have to outplay him to win.  However, the flip side of this is that you can beat Zed with dang near anything in mid.\n\n> Stun delay down to .25 seconds.

Obviously the stun duration would have to go down though. \n\nCertainly the timing can be adjusted. They seem to have gone overboard on the delay part -- 0.25 seconds cast, 0.5 seconds particle.  I think we should try instant cast E, with the 0.5 seconds particle delay.\n\nI do worry that the skill is going to push league of mobility even harder.\n\n> The other would be to buff his W, remove the stun from E, but Make it instant again.

This new thing with the walls blocking dashes is great.  Why didn't that show up as part of the initial package?  Did we really need to delete Veigar for a patch?  Could we not have waited until a reasonably complete set of changes was ready?\n\nMany people have mistaken my tone for being cool with what happened to Veigar.
