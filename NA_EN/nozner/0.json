Select a champ you have a skin for.\r\n2. Select any other skin then the default.\r\n3. The other person selects a champ you do not have a skin for but hopefully the champ selected has the same number of skins as the one you have (if not you&#039;ll just get a broken skin name when loading in an be on the default skin for the other champ)\r\n4. Do the trade as normal make sure to not change the skin selection for the champ you have received.\r\n\r\nThe outcome will be that your new champ will select the skin which is in the same index as the one you traded away regardless if you own it.\r\n\r\n- Nozner","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-20T00:41:09.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Nozner -\n\nThanks for the awesome bug report!
