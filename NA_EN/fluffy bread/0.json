(This also has happend to me when in custom games, Idk why...) Kinda afraid of getting Leaverbuster, so I stopped playing. I sent a Support Ticket, but I have yet to get a respone from Riot. Again, I've tried using the Hextech Repair Tool, it STILL didn't work after reinstalling League. My Ping is NEVER high unless my game is kinda delayed. This happend a game RIGHT AFTER winning a game of Xayah, once I started playing her again with my friends, this stuff began happening. All help will be appreciated, thanks in advance. <3","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-06T01:54:48.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmmm so the way you mention it, it kinda sounds like this is only happening when you play as Xayah maybe?
