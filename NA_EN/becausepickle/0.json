What I mean by that is that someone somehow probably guessed my password or something along the lines of that, and now owns my account. I haven't played league for quite some time now, and the only reason I learned of this was because my friend who still plays informed me that my account was active. This happened about five months ago, and as soon as I learned of this I contacted Riot with a ticket attempting to get my account back. They asked me for some information, which I was then not able to provide because I could not remember a majority of it, and thus I could not get my account back. This was a little frustrating, as I had just lost my account to a game I have spent 1300+ hour and hundreds of dollars on, even if I do not play it that much anymore, but I decided I didn't want to spend the time at the moment recollecting all of that information to get my account back.\r\nFast forward to now, and a bunch of my old league friends are starting to play league again. I decided it was time to get back my account once and for all, and decided to contact Riot.\r\nNow, this whole ordeal has become quite frustrating and disheartening, as I believe I may never get my account back. Period.\r\nI have been emailing back and forth with a Riot representative for a month now, and I have sent around 7 emails, each time attempting to provide more information to help regain access to my account.\r\nI have provided the last four digits of a credit card used on the account, the email address linked to the PayPal used on the account, the address of where the account was created, the address used for all of the purchases made on the account, pictures of old emails (I even have a personal email from Riot employee Pip, where I asked if I could get a refund for some rune pages that had just gone on sale after I bought them, and he very kindly gave me two more rune pages for free. These emails even include exact dates and times which could only be unique to my account), other old emails where I confirmed my email address so I could get that sweet, sweet IP boost. I also have a unique PayPal transaction ID associated with a purchased made on this account. I also have a bunch of non-relevant evidence that shows its my account, one of the biggest (and I believe to be the most convincing that this is my account) is the fact that the perpetrator of my account USES D FOR FLASH instead of F! Just by checking any of my games from 2012-2015, you would see I have always sworn by using the F key for flash (F is for flash, duh!)\r\nBut even after all of that information provided, I have not gained access to my account. Instead, I received multiple emails telling me that the information isn't enough to verify my ownership.\r\nWhat's frustrating me is the lack of communication (which I understand to some degree since there are probably millions of other complaints they have to deal with, and they do not have the time to write back to each summoner). But by only receiving automated responses, I have been basically shooting in the dark.\r\nAs I mentioned, I have not played in quite some time, and so a lot of this information I have been providing might not correspond correctly with my account, and a lot of it has been texting my friends, asking them if they can remember what was the first 6300 IP champion I bought.\r\nBasically, why I made this post, is because I don't know what to do. I have essentially rounded up all the possible information I could get (beside old credit card numbers, which I am calling my bank today to get), and still can not provide enough to prove it is my account. That, or my information genuinely does not match my account, which in that case means I am uber fucked, and say goodbye to my account forever.\r\nIf anyone has any advice for me on what I should do, or any similar experiences, please share.\r\n\r\nAlso, sorry for the long post, and I still love you riot :D\r\n\r\nJust remembered to add this in, I also have the log-in information for the PBE account I owned that was associated with my account. \r\n\r\nI'm also not sure whether I should add my summoner name here or not, and I'm hesitant to straight up upload the pictures of emails I have, but I would be happy to do so for a Riot employee.\r\n\r\nLast side note, the account i'm logged into right now obviously is not the one I am talking about, but it is rather my smurf account that I tried to level up a long time ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-29T20:49:19.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Account recovery cases are escalated to our account team- who are people- if there is insufficient information to return the account.  It does sound like you've provided a lot of information, but we'll only return an account if we know it's the owner without a shadow of a doubt.  I'd be happy to look into this to see what I can find, but I'm guessing the account you're posting from is not the same as the one you're trying to recover.  Toss me a ticket number or summoner ID, and I'll see what's up.  Keep in mind this is a public venue, so it's unlikely that I'll be be able to provide too much insight due to account privacy reasons.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"BecausePickle","date":"2016-09-29T23:05:44.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for the response! I totally understand that the people on the support team are, well, people, and I'm sorry if I came off as sounding angry or bratty. \n\nThe summoner name that I have been discussing is -snip-, the account username is -snip-. My support ticket number is #23238896.\n\nThe biggest issue I am having is I'm not sure if I'm just providing completely wrong information to the account, so if you could let me know that the information I have been providing it just flat out wrong I will totally understand and be very grateful. \n\nThank you so much for helping out!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-29T23:24:17.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for following up with me!
