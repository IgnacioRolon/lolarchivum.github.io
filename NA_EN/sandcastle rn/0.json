The point was to fix all these problems when really it didnt fix anything. People still troll and take roles, ban champs that you want to play and there&#039;s still trash talk in champ select. It even made these problems worse and on top of that queue times in d4 are the same as those in challenger. Including champ select, it usually takes me 15-30 minutes to get into a game that now only last as long as the queue itself. People dodge all the time and the champ select just was a change that was unnecesary. If something isnt broken dont fix it, and thats what riot did with this one.","replies":[{"poster":"Ýones","date":"2016-01-18T19:20:20.316+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks cooler.

I just hate the fact that you HAVE to lock in. I also don't like that you can't see your champions when you aren't picking. I think if they fix those two things it would be better. They should also make a special alert noise when its your turn to ban. Similar to the alert noise you got when it was your turn to pick in the normal draft phase.  {{champion:122}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-01-18T19:25:16.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're working out the kinks, and a lot of the problems are user-side, so they best they can do is try to alleviate those. Also, they're considering further options in case champ select trolling continues to be a big issue, so don't stress.\n\nAnd hey, once people get used to the new system, it'll get faster.\n\nThink positive, broseph. Or not. Think negatively if you want. You're probably something approximating an adult, so it's up to you whether or not you want to bring yourself down.","replies":[]}]}
