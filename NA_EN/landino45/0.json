I have to delete my L.O.L client, and reinstall a new one, because if i was to open the \"old\" app it would bounce up and down on my dock and say \"application not responding.\" This is extremely frustrating and I'd like to know if I can do anything to fix it, I enjoy the game a ton and I hope to find a fix ASAP. \r\n\r\nMy mac is not old, got it 2015 and its operating system is 10.11.6, everything should be update to date or extremely close to it.\r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"BerylCrab","date":"2017-08-03T05:10:00.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Save yourself time, money and frustration by simply getting a PC.
