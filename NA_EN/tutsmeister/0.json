Don't worry too much about the \"speeds\" listed, as the first 33% can take some time since it's not entirely just downloading files, the patcher is actually scanning your directory for missing or corrupted files before attempting to pull them from the servers. If you aren't seeing an error, I recommend just letting the patching process run for a while without being interrupted.\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know.","replies":[]}]}
