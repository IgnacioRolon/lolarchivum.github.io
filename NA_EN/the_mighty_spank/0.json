(Yes I'm New)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can&#039;t find a cut and dry answer about the safest path for Jarvan in J4.\r\n\r\nEven with a leash I&#039;m almost dead if not a hit or two from death by the time I finish off blue buff (with or without Gromp&#039;s poison aura). I have the runes and masteries down (I think?) but I can&#039;t help but think I&#039;m missing some sort of crucial detail. Even when I get a smite on Krug for Heavy Hands I&#039;m struggling.\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong here? Lay it on me. Also build pointers arw welcome.\r\n\r\nIf anyone would like to add me for sake of teaching me the ropes be my guest.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-11-24T19:13:10.365+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually do Krugs (Smite)  - Raptor - Scuttle - Red (Smite) Then wolves - Gromp (Smite) - Blue\n\nI would highly recommend doing scuttle though, it doesn't fight back and it procs your jungle item, meaning you can get a sizable amount of health back from just one scuttle. \n\nJust learn the general routes of the opposing jungler, they are usually pretty telegraph. For example, if you're up against a Rengar, you know he'll be starting his Red most likely since he gains absolutely nothing starting blue side his jungle, meaning taking the scuttle on the other side is almost always safe. \n\nIf you get to the other side and scuttle is still there, that means they moved to the other side of their jungle with no intentions of taking the scuttle, meaning its usually safe, but always be wary. \n\nMind telling me your masteries and runes? Those have a big impact as well.\n\nSomeone was telling me how Shaco couldn't full clear for shit, but I found out that if you ran the right masteries, you could full clear with him losing almost no health.  Just an example of what I'm talking about. Those make a huge difference.","replies":[{"poster":"The Mighty Spank","date":"2015-11-24T19:41:26.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much!

More importantly, would it work best with J4 and the skill level you have? J4 might be difficult to figure most optimal set up though, he can go either offensive or defensive with his set up.","replies":[{"poster":"The Mighty Spank","date":"2015-11-24T20:08:46.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm trying to play Jarvan aggressively but always edging on my teammates to help them make the successful jump.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MegaManYYZ","date":"2015-11-24T18:39:32.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that sounds about right in the new jungle. i would suggest starting strong side for a better leash, if you insist on starting blue bluff side even if it's the weak side, go for scuttle right after blue and you should be able to take wolves after with remaining health.\n\nrecall and get hunters potion. also you should start machete if you don't already.","replies":[{"poster":"The Mighty Spank","date":"2015-11-24T19:00:43.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually start with:\n\nE (Flag?)
