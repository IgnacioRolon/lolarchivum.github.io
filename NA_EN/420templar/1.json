There's two general questions being asked here.\n\n1. Why can't I flash during Lee's ult cast time to outplay him and change the direction of Lee's ult.\n2. Given that the above is true, why can Lee flash during his ult's cast time to change the direction of the spell after he started casting it.\n\nTo discuss number 1 I'm going to talk about something that we removed a long time ago: Flash popping projectiles. For those of you who don't know what that means, it use to be the case that if you flashed while a **targeted** projectile was in the air flying towards you, that projectile would be destroyed.  This wasn't all that bad when it destroyed a stray basic attack, but got really problematic when you consider that it could also kill a number of targeted spells (like old Taric and Sion stuns).  \n\nWhat this created was a situation where the person who had flash up had 100% agency over a character who relied on a targeted projectile to be effective.  There was no way to outplay someone who had flash with old Taric stun.  You would just click on them and hope it hit (which it never would if they had flash up). Not all counterplay is good, and we felt that flash's interaction with targeted projectiles was especially poor, so we removed it. Compare this interaction to something like flashing vs. a skill shot.  Sure you can pretty easily outplay a Blitz hook by dodging it with a flash BUT BLITZ COULD ALSO OUTPLAY THE FLASH by anticipating where you would end up and aiming there instead.  \"Madlife\"  Much better play and counterplay for both sides.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Lee Sin R? Allowing you to flash to \"outplay\" his TARGETED SPELL after he's already cast it creates the same situation where the agency is 100% in the hands of the guy with flash up.  Either you're bad and you flash in a bad direction and still get kicked to a bad place (the \"flash wasted\" problem I mentioned earlier) or you're good and Lee sin never gets to kick you where he expects.\n\nThe short of it is that when it comes to targeted spells in League (especially ultimates), most of them should \"just work.\" The nature of them being targeted creates a certain expectation that they will work as expected because on the casting end, there's not much the caster can do to ensure anything otherwise (because they're targeted).  Does this create certain \"no counterplay\" situations?  Yes.  No matter what you do, an ADC's autoattacks are going to hit you for X DPS in the late game and Lissandra's R is going to stun you if you get withing Y range of her.  It's important then that the counterplay to those champions exists on the kit level.  I get you guys are frustrated with Lee being strong right now.  I am too given how much I see him in my games, but I question if making his ult (the marquee ability on his kit) unreliable in its trajectory is the way to address the guy, **especially** when compared to all the other things on his kit that may be out of line.  We did this to Skarner a few years ago and it made the champ feel AWFUL, especially at higher levels of play (I'm very glad we changed it back).\n\nAs for question 2, why can he flash during his ult's cast time?  I'm honestly not sure if that's good to allow. DISCLAIMER I AM NO LONGER ON LIVE TEAM AND DO NOT MAKE CHANGES.  Seems like \"locking\" the direction of the spell for both parties once it has started to be cast would be appropriate.  For these kind of things it honestly comes down to the needs of the individual design.  As an example, I made it so Mega Gnar can't flash while ulting to ensure that the knockback direction is locked in on spell cast, whereas I allowed Vi to flash while she is ulting to knock asides extra people on the way to her main target (or reach the main target faster).  I **personally **feel that Lee would make more sense working similar to Mega Gnar, but can also see why it is the way it is currently (flashing during spell casts is \"default\" league functionality).  This could be a way to nerf him, but again would ask if it's the BEST way to nerf him compared to other areas where he may also be overbearing.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2017-01-13T00:14:16.874+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot jinxylord,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3sXkJzjQ,comment-id=000f00010005,timestamp=2017-01-12T23:29:56.719+0000)\n>\n> What this created was a situation where the person who had flash up had 100% agency over a character who relied on a targeted projectile to be effective.\n\nSounds like Yasuo. I legitimately don't understand why Yasuo has the ability to neutralize all projectile-using enemies for a full 3.75 seconds with a single normal ability. That's more versatile, longer in duration, and shorter in cooldown than a Kayle ult on top of all the other stuff Yasuo does.","replies":[{"poster":"Reposer","date":"2017-01-13T07:26:34.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"That's assuming that, in those 3.75 seconds, the enemy team uses up all their necessary projectiles for a fight on a wall, especially considering that unless the timing is terrible for them, they'd have to waste those abilities while the wall is active, meaning it was all their fault.\n\nOn top of that, unless Yasuo is directly in the enemy team (almost always a terrible idea unless his team has made a proper engage for him, or he's ridiculously fed) the walls more often are defensive, and don't have much impact on engages, unless the enemies decide not to bait the wall first, or flank, or wait to counter-engage instead, or have some form of non-skillshot reliant engage, which is extremely plentiful.\n\nAnd if Yasuo just places an extremely well-timed windwall that blocks off the Sejuani ult at the time of arrival, well props to him, and lowering the time wouldn't affect it.\n\nNot to mention that the wall is stationary, and a line, so going around or through it is also possible. And oh yeah, it has an 18 second CD which means, as long as you didn't throw everything you need into the wall, as earlier said, you should still be able to attempt a re-engage within an ample amount of time.\n\nNot saying there aren't problems, such as the wall working from all directions on his person for a split second on cast, and the time isn't a terrible thing to shorten, but it's not just an end-all-be-all invincibility spell that makes his team an impenetrable fortress.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2017-01-13T07:37:54.454+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Reposer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3sXkJzjQ,comment-id=000f0001000500020000,timestamp=2017-01-13T07:26:34.229+0000)\n>\n> That&#x27;s assuming that, in those 3.75 seconds, the enemy team uses up all their necessary projectiles for a fight on a wall\n\nOh I didn't know people can't also save their abilities until after Kayle ult wears off.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2017-01-13T00:19:06.163+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> or you're good and Lee sin never gets to kick you where he expects.\n\n> I question if making his ult (the marquee ability on his kit) unreliable in its trajectory is the way to address the guy\n\nThis is already the case with QSS + flash combo. \n\nI'll also point out another interaction which already makes it unreliable in its trajectory which happened to me recently. I was playing Naut and i threw out my hook. While my hook was in transit lee ulted me which would have kicked me into his team. What wound up happening was my hook finished and drug me to the terrain i was aiming for, and then the lee ult went through in the direction away from his team. It seems that Naut hook is allowed to redirect the lee ult. \n\nI would add that when you're getting kicked by lee sin you never get to know where you'll end up because of his flash interaction so there is currently a mixed set of expectations there. If he uses his kick now he will kick you to safety, but if he uses flash then he will kick you into his team and you have no agency over which it will be. \n\n> The short of it is that when it comes to targeted spells in League (especially ultimates), most of them should \"just work.\" \n\nThere are lots of targeted spells that don't \"just work\" in the game already. Veigar ult is point and click but can be negated by a well times zhonyas or windwall. Vi ult is point and click but can be negated by any untargetability like Yi alpha strike, Zed ult, and now (i suspect) Camille ult. That's not to say those are bad interactions just that the thought that lee ult has to work 100% of the time because its targeted goes against precedents set by other champions with point and click ults which are similarly regarded as reliable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-01-12T23:45:40.835+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":">We did this to Skarner a few years ago and it made the champ feel AWFUL, especially at higher levels of play (I'm very glad we changed it back).\n\nGoing to be honest, Lee is a champ who needs some times where he just feels awful.

They have messed with his kit and fixed so many bugs since then and even then thats more of because flash and ult were pressed at the same time leaving him with his ult queue'd up as he lands causing the kick to play later than the sound clip.","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-01-12T02:00:27.886+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is an example from the World Championships for 2016 (with commentators even mentioning it):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oV4inJSW2Y\n\nThis is an intended feature which has been kept in the game for years and still exists.
