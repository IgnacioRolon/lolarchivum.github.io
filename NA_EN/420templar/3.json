Nowhere in his lore does he sustain himself off of the lives of his foes, and nowhere does he heal allies by killing enemies. A more fitting change would be some sort of team wide damage steroid, not a sustain mechanism that actually conflicts with his real identity.","replies":[{"poster":"Messaiga","date":"2015-06-12T20:00:26.338+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"It fits his lore somewhat, but not well.  An ideal Ultimate for Aatrox would be one that gives him usefulness in the form of a team-wide buff, and a self buff (I personally like his AA range increase).  Still, Aatrox needs a rework that makes his sustain weaker in lane (but of similar strength OR stronger late-game).  He's a champion that by definition is \"broken\" because of his W, and then the rest of his kit is relatively uninspired.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-06-13T00:37:56.338+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can't say I disagree.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheLastBaron88","date":"2015-06-12T06:46:38.029+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"I really like this idea. Currently Aatrox seems to exist to bully lane phase, and then more or less falls off when teamfights roll around due to the nature of melee autoattacking champions. His current Ultimate always felt like a last minute tack-on to me; giving him the ability to boost his team's teamfight capability sounds much more useful, and in keeping with his lore/theme. Essentially, he IS the lifesteal guy. That's really all he does that's really unique and characterizing, which I imagine contributes to his low play rate. \n\nI think it is very telling that in a pure 1v1, Tryndamere almost always crushes this guy. Being able to put damage on someone while being unkillable is just always going to be better than being invulnerable but useless while reviving. Why would you ever play Aatrox over Tryndamere in his current state?\n\nPlus I do really miss old AD Sion, we really should have SOMETHING to help remind us of the glory days. That ultimate was a thing of beauty.","replies":[{"poster":"Sorgklaan","date":"2015-06-12T07:15:27.676+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's a sticky suicide lead. His goal is to divebomb into the enemy team, ult, and try to take down a target with his massive lategame healing and attack speed. The enemy blows all their shit on him because they kinda have to, while your team engages. Then his passive pops and he gets a second go.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastBaron88","date":"2015-06-12T07:25:43.422+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right, basically that in a nutshell. Which is great if his team is ahead, or he is outrageously fed enough to blow up 1 or 2 people before he goes down. But in nearly any other situation, I don't feel like that playstyle is very satisfying. I almost feel bad when I play against an Aatrox when the rest of my team is doing well. It doesn't matter if he stomped our top laner, he's just gonna go in, get peeled and kited, and then die. Twice. He just doesn't have anything else to offer his team, nothing to do except jump in and suicide, hopefully landing a pick with the knockup in the process.\n\nIf his ult were changed to buff attack speed and heal allies for a percentage of the damage enemies take, but only while he is alive and nearby, it would help to make him a bit more \"team-oriented\", I think would be the correct term. For balance purposes, I guess the duration couldn't be terribly long. As it stands, his whole kit revolves around what he can do himself, which stops being terribly useful after lane phase.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rockdalian","date":"2015-06-12T03:27:19.373+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"First time I've seen this.

All he had was a single target stun; Aatrox has a ranged AOE knock-up, as well as a ranged slow to keep up with enemies.

Then comes talon. Sions rework was pure genius. Old sion was kinda fun in a way but theres just no comparing. Old sion was yet another generic AA meatball who took a quarter of a brain cell to operate. \n\nAatrox should be more elegant and skill based as his lore describes. Allowing the player to determine the outcome of a fight with reaction times and out-plays. His \"inspire allies\" part has always been a bit of a misinterpretation to the player base as far as im concerned. I don't think it was meant to describe literal buffs for allies. It was the way his kit was designed to pounce in mid-fight when his team is potentially losing  to completely turn the tides. \n\nAatrox should inspire your team to continue fighting just from the very fact that he's there at the right time. Again, this doesn't have to mean literal buffs to the team. His arrival should mean a shift in the team fight. The problem with sions old r is it was too damn strong lol. Sion got reworked but people just want aatrox now to turn into old sion and i HIGHLY doubt riot is going to re-use an old kit skill to fit a newer champion after discontinuing it.\n\nSions old ult was bland and insanely strong for the lack of skill required to use it. \n\nRiot will eventually take a closer look at aatrox (in the distant future T_T) and hopefully break away from his mishmash of roles and the most prominent of those roles is the one we don't really need more of, the AD attack speed fighter (zZzZzZzZ). Why bother playing a new champion if he's going to feel just like those 20 other generic aa fighters? Not saying some attack speed isnt healthy; Vi is a good example. But if you want to play old sion or some rockem sockem champion there are sooooo many available. \n\n{{champion:114}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:106}} \n\nIts also a personal distaste I have for these types especially since there are so many. Aatrox just barely feels like a more interesting variation. I feel we need more fun / interesting kit designs which feel as though you have more control like {{champion:92}}. Shes the only REAL bruiser swordsman in this game. Oh and {{champion:86}} who is awesome but I just feel like his kit lacks skill-cap depth. Ekko is awesome but he's clearly a mage assassin with no actualy swordplay aside from his auto's :P \n\nAatrox was so close. I mean it felt like they were on the right track and at one point they just said \"Fekit. Throw some attack speed in there and send him out.\"\n\nTL;DR I don't think recycling an old ult that was purposely phased out should be some copy paste fix for Aatrox.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daxterr","date":"2015-06-12T19:43:58.276+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"too op","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-06-12T19:26:32.227+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've always thought this, but it's ultimately a big ball of stats that can get ugly real quick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2015-06-12T16:56:32.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I miss old Sion so much.\n\nLate game have 4k HP while critting for 1000 damage and healing for over 100% of your damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RainbowIcee","date":"2015-06-12T22:41:59.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wasn't that ulti too OP so they gave him a new one?","replies":[{"poster":"Tis a nice day","date":"2015-06-13T18:44:43.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OPness is only a matter of numbers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"THEJJSLAY","date":"2015-06-12T23:36:26.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=420Templar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JTaksL1Y,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-06-12T01:39:48.688+0000)\n>\n> I mean, in his lore Aatrox did inspire the army he was fighting for and they became more powerful.
