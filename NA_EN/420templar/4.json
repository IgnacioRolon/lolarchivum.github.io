Luden's is badly designed to be an assassin item. There's no conditions on its damage proc, so mages can abuse it, its actually better on mages because they can spam to use it more often, and its stats are good for mages (high AP, movement speed)\n\nI've said it a million times now, so I'm not sure why you haven't picked up on it, but I don't think AP Assassin items should be items that just add to raw burst without conditions, because then you get Mages picking them up thinking \"oh boy, more damage!\"\n\nDFG and Ludens aren't the kind of items I'm talking about. They don't reinforce roaming patterns, they just spit damage. If there were items AP items similar to Edge of Night or new Youmuus, they wouldn't add more to raw damage output than the big daddy AP items like Rabbs and Ludens, they'd be items picked up for roaming utility.","replies":[{"poster":"Gregor Gysi","date":"2016-11-05T20:03:16.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Anonagon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pt4JVv4q,comment-id=000200000000000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-05T19:37:04.729+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;ve already gone over this.

Its movement speed is included in that. Out of combat movement speed is a better stat for assassin items than raw movement speed.\nThe fact that Lich Bane played into natural assassin patterns is what I intended to praise, not the inclusion of extra burst. Luden's Echo is a badly designed item for assassins because its damage proc plays into the patterns of mages better than it does assassins.\n\nRaw movement speed doesn't promote roaming and assassination patterns.
