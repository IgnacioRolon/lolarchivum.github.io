Infact, I was rudely bashed by this Anivia the entire game, which i only saw half of because i muted him (Wait, thats what muting is for right? RIGHT? Lmao). I want the person who issued my ban answering this forum, and also explain in all honesty if their Anivia was issued a more severe ban that was fair to his actions. (Oh yeah thats right, fair system right?) Yeah im prepared to have this account banned permanently to have a PROPER topic NOTED!!! Bring the heat please riot because im all ears. Expect a full on response FROM ME regarding all the facts being noted, including any of my downfalls i have brought onto chat log (defending myself from chat salt which you still allow) Wait.. So were allowed to get our own bans now? LOL@LeagueOfLegends\r\n\r\nWould you save the victim or ban him/her through immature negligence riot? because so far thats what i see, so continue reading. (and dont hop to comment before finishing, the way you \"boys\" hop to a penalty)\r\n\r\n So yes, league community is very toxic. Even i have grown with this community for years, Only made ONE new account after my first was banned THANK YOU VERY MUCH :) because i hear others go through atleast 5 or more. Learning how to handle a \"sticky\" situation. May that be, surviving a rough match (WHICH HAPPENS TO EVEN THE BEST PLAYERS, EVERYONE IS CAPABLE OF DYING THROUGH FAIR MATCHES IN EACH LANE and i fully respect every opponent my team is up against because this game would be nothing without other players to have fun against!...), or  other players teaming against me via argument, OR attempt to have team reports against me, which 9/10 are invalid (NOT ALL THE TIME AT ALL). I have recently noticed that MUTING a player does not help with this scenario (DESPITE THE OPTION OF EVEN HAVING THE ABILITY TO MUTE, WHICH SHOULD BE CONSIDERED POSITIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE FOR THE TEAM FOCUSING ON THE WIN). \r\nSure, players don't agree with each other every game we all know this, and we express that through chat log (IT ISN'T ALWAYS PRETTY, BUT!... WE DEFINE OUR PERSPECTIVE THROUGH CHAT > SINCE ITS ALL THAT IS AVAILABLE!!! &lt; AND HANDLE IT WITH MUTING IF NECESSARY AND CARRYING ON WITH THE GAME, LIKE THEY PLACED IT IN THERE, got banned for using the mute option basically). Though i do not like the offense i gain from it, from others, muting the player is the final option to sorting a difference during the game. It should be considered the final (mature or not) approach to solving the issue. \r\nDue to improper verdicts from \"those who finalize reports\", Im getting a 15 day ban on my new account? Please Attach everything ive EVER said on this account please. I really dont mind or care (yes i dont care what you attach boys, your report system is flawed and corrupt through salty and unprofessional riot staff who handles it. yes. YOU bud :) ), and explain to me where i went wrong (ill follow up with fair responses, as i have too been the one to be in the wrong as has any other decent fellow trying to collaborate with other opposing teamates, enjoy the game and earn a win), recently had an arguement during a match (where i had most farm/build compared to my teamates, which proof i stayed on my game and played constructively), and received a penalty. Even after applying the mute to the Anivia who was, excuse my language, but on my \"nuts\" the entire game. As a jungle are you required to go to a failing lane and give the team a triple kill? So they can even feed, and im still required to go against enemies who are clearly fed and can NOW outplay me thanks to someone dying too much)\r\n^ yes answer that question specifically because everyone would like to know how you solve a game where players losing their lane causes good players to lose. So if that is a YES, explain how you plan to solve games that have people dying too much in it? is that a possibility? Basically your game's TOXICITY comes from lack of communication (Voice chat) which can still  solved with muting players, both voice/text.\r\n\r\n i Received a 15 day ban for expressing how i felt towards a players defining of me as the one in the wrong, for focusing on my role in an attempt to save mid/late game. This is my final account. But in all honesty, will not be showing up anymore most likely since your staff doesnt know how to do their job. my first account, was banned because i muted someone the entire game. Now my second account is banned for issuing a mute. i NEVER mute unless its absolutely needed, whether a team is arguing or not, they will always be a teamate. Capable of actually playing this game to a large potential, focusing dragons/baron as such and when possible, bring synergy to our RANDOM team who can only communication through risky mid game chatting, how the HELL do you expect that to work. That said if i am receiving this suspension (or potentially full ban, since you all wont soak this criticism up maturely for a better cause, and just brush off another decent player's fair perspective), how does the system work if you DONT LET IT.\r\n\r\nThank you, if this issue matters ill receive the comments. if not. im out of this game. dueces.\r\nGive full responses please, no salt, and keep it professional. you all been dropping patches like crazy, games still broken, this is only to better the report system. infact, there should be live moderators joining games to handle situations, if you guys wont allow voice chat.\r\n\r\n-Mr.Nutz","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-01T22:29:06.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might have muted them, sure.

Because I have NEVER seen one. my first ban was a 14 day and I had no prior problems before the ban was issued. Not only was my ban an immediate 14 day the reason I was even banned was a few remarks i made that were either taken out of context by the reviewer or not even reviewed in its entirety to begin with.","replies":[]}]}]}
