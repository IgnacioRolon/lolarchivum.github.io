For months, I was sad, but I was always able to get my mind off of it with League. Of course, masking it never completely took away the pain and sadness would return that night; or if not that night, the next night, or the next week. I think I could legitimately say that I was depressed for the better part of half a year. \n\nThe realization that it's time for both of you to move on is both difficult to accept, yet necessary for beginning to feel better. Personally, it took me a little over six months to no longer long for the past. Sure, we had good times, but we all have to move forward; my friends, new and old, helped me reach this point and while I can't say I've never been happier, I can say that I'm doing a hell of a lot better than I was last year.  \n\nIf you'd like someone to talk to, I'm always on [**Discord**](http://wrenchmen.org/invite) (unless I'm sleeping or in class) and sometimes on the client. It gets better, and I hope that you feel better soon. \n\nWishing you all the best,\nWuks","replies":[{"poster":"StevieSenpai","date":"2016-01-30T02:13:35.323+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow thank you so much for your kind words Wuks, if I feel I need to talk to someone I'll be sure to hit you up on Discord. I just can't handle giving my time to someone then having them throw that time away like it was nothing. My dad chose booze over me, I lost a lot of friends after I was diagonised with Sciatica because I had to drop out of school, then my ex of 2 and a half years left me, I was only in this relationship for 3 months and a half and what hits me the most is last night we were all smiles and enjoying each others company then this morning she says she wants to break up, without giving me time to talk things out she unfriends me on social media sites and starts to ignore me. I'm a big softy when it comes to love and I really have to stop giving it to people that don't deserve it :( \n\nSorry if my comment seems cheezy or lame, but its the truth.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-30T03:19:37.871+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh.
