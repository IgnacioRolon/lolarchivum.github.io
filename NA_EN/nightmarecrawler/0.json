For about 5 minuets and it won't let me tab out at all to end the program. After this absurd time frame it then starts loading in at a pace so inconsistent, I find it baffling (and a bit upsetting as I'm obviously being punished for this with Low Priority Queue). This computer hasn't had many major issues with it before and it only seems to happen during some patches. Apparently this is one of them. I wend into the RADS file and found the .txt from my recent game and will post it should it be needed. After a quick look over it (despite most of it being tech stuff I can't even begin to hope to comprehend) seems to be a enormous amount of assets that just show up with errors. I got the Hextech Repair tool and I ran one test and I'm running a second one with repatch active to see if that solves anything. I'll provide both .zip folders should those be desired to look at as a before/after sort of thing so I can avoid this in the future. If someone could get back to me on this as soon as possible that'd be fantastic.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-03T16:38:45.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're getting a black screen after champion select, which is usually caused by a connection problem failing to download assets.

So after fiddling about getting the entire program closed using my task manager, I then restarted the game and used the new client to see what'd happen. It tires to reconnect me and it stops dead at 100% and the pinwheel in the bottom stops spinning. I'd figured the client had crashed AGAIN (Turns out it had done the \"connection timed out\" error window that never properly tabs me to it when it shows up) and the game was over instead of booting me out immediately. It did not add to my leaverbuster punishment that was ongoing (Oddly as every other time in recent times this has happened, it has), and that's about it. \n\nI may just be screwing this up on my own but I've not been doing anything differently and have in fact been closing extra background programs as of late!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-04T16:52:14.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update!

Will give an update on how that loading goes!\n\nOne major lag spike at about 4:45 but other than that the game only paused for five seconds before loading me in. \n\nThough for clarification it wasn't the 'black screen' it was the champion loading windows and the background with no indications of any champions or usernames and such, as well as a frozen loading wheel in the bottom. Odd enough but this time things went well. Should things persist I'll make another post here. \n\nIn the meantime I'll try and tank through the last few Low-pri games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DVA545","date":"2017-02-03T09:30:51.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup been happening to me too","replies":[]}]}
