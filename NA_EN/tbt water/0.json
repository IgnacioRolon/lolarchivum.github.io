Hosting the PBE files and the main League of Legends files in the same directory has been reported to cause problems.\n- Double click on \"lol.launcher.exe\" or \"lol.launcher.admin.exe\" to run the launcher and start patching.\n\nWhen you installed the PBE client, did you install it in a different directory than your live (NA) client?\n\nYou're correct that your NA account isn't compatible with PBE and visa versa.

It was my fault (sorry to bother you by the way) I hosted them in the same directory.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-23T16:28:30.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries, it's not the first time I've seen it happen.
