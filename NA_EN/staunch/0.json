No one else commented on this but when I asked about it, Ezreal said it was similar for him as well. \r\n\r\n1. Join game on Summoner&#039;s Rift (normal)\r\n2. Summoner playing as Pulse-Fire Ezreal chats in-game\r\n3. Chat is seen as &quot;SummonerName (): Message here&quot;\r\n\r\nI do not know if this is for the Ultimate Skin alone or for all Ezreals, but it happened in my past game. This was both in Team Chat and All Chat.","replies":[{"poster":"Juggernaut628","date":"2015-04-23T04:48:48.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"() is the best champion in the game, especially better than (Champion:1) and (Champion:47)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThorHammerz","date":"2015-04-22T07:29:34.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"void LeagueOfLegends::SummonerName()\n{\n// Get the joke?\n}\n\n:)","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-22T06:16:47.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Mithratinn!\n\nThanks for the report! \n\nThis is a known issue and we're currently working on a fix.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2015-04-22T02:27:01.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha ive noticed this before as well","replies":[]}]}
