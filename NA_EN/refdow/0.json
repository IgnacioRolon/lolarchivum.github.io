Garen and co can get in range to auto you quicker than you can (if you're also melee, but have the standard range) and if you turn to end the trade, they can get in another auto on you a lot easier than you can to them should they turn.\n\nIt is the sort of change that can turn neutral matchups into favourable ones very easily, I wouldn't call it a slight buff honestly.\n\n(p.s.
