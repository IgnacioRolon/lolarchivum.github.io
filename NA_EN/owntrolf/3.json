He'd need some massive buffs to make up for this, and it doesn't really remove his issues.  He'd still be resistant to regular harass in lane and he'd likely have access to an even larger and/or longer lasting windwall during teamfights.\n\nI think the best change would be to make wind-wall on a shorter cooldown with a much shorter duration.  If he needs buffs to compensate, I'd put them mostly towards his base health at higher levels (I don't think this would affect his early quite so much).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hèntaî ","date":"2017-10-16T02:42:21.412+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"Y'all still on yasuo?

Yes it can stop some very important moves, but it really comes down to counter play and skill which people seem to forget Yasuo takes. For instance as and ADC if a Yasuo comes up to you and he windwalls, you can simply run away, and it makes the Wall useless. If Yasuo were to Windwall and ult or other skillshot, a good amount of the time it was him predicting it and using it appropriately when he thinks it is the best. That also takes into account for the other player, they need to think about when a Yas may W and try to time your skill shot or what ever it may be around the idea that he has wall.
