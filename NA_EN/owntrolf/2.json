(and I mean 2-3 in a comp) Stacking that many randuins would make you too vulnerable to Magic damage, (aside from not giving you a diverse set of abilities.)\n\nAlso, the Crit reduction isn't great enough to really be efficiently stacked. (Riot would have noticed otherwise.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"360D3GR3SS","date":"2015-11-02T05:01:45.739+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apparently the crit damage reduction is not a unique passive so they do in fact stack.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Illâoi Evê Siôn","date":"2015-11-02T14:53:08.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huh ...
