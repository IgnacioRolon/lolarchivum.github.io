Until this last patch or two, it used to show regularly on my loading screens.  Didn't screen image it as it was a regular thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-19T07:31:53.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sorry, but you're mistaken.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide#h2q3\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/4ad6c039908f2f9534b240446dc076fe.png\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/0f282ef238d8be819b25b94a77c89b3b.png\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/c2a0f11d2a86548bed62d0017ad2e197.png\n\nI took the liberty of screenshotting imaqtpie and goodguygarry recordings from Nov. 20th so there's no mistake, and one I happened to have in my own recording.","replies":[{"poster":"Kinjishi","date":"2016-01-20T03:16:14.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't care about your recordings.
