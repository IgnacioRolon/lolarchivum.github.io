Be is people can fill out those afk spaces or what not. The issue being is that people have been sick of it ever since the start of league. And Riot has gone on record maaaaany many times stating that they care about the blights of their players (which we all have learned where just sweet words and nothing more) and have yet to come up with a solution to it after seven years or so. In short there is no way in hell riot couldn't have noticed the flood of these complaints over its existence. Meaning riot knows it bothers everyone a great deal. They just don't care about the players enough to change it.","replies":[]}]}]}
