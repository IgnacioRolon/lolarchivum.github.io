If I re-enter I can see this again for a quarter-second again before my screen goes completely black. \r\n\r\nSo my game is being loaded, but for some reason I can't see it or participate. If anybody knows the solution or cause to this, I would be eternally grateful!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-23T21:47:46.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having a hard time making a connection to our game servers. When this happens it can cause the loading screen to look black, since it can't grab the info it's supposed to display from our servers.
