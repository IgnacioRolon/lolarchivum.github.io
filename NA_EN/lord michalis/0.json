Your best bet may be to perform a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) to fix it up.  Let me know if you continue to have issues, though, I suggest testing it in a custom game to prevent penalties.

It'll still start the game and play okay from what I can see, but always a bug splat when I hit launch.

I'm curious if your PC settings my be blocking game files from being scanned and resulting in that bugsplat because it can't load.  In this case, try the steps in our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide instead.  This will make sure the game has access to load.

The other things are fine as well.  I can tell you this just started happening after the recent patch and was totally fine before it.  Also is the splash screen supposed to be Diana or Warwick?  For some reason I'm back to Warwick when it was Diana.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-25T22:45:26.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really strange, but thanks for trying.
