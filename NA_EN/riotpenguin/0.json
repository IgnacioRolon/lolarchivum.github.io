(Something akin to a fire mage's dragons breath in WoW, on each side)\n\nHis W could turn into a ring of fire.\n\nHis new Maelfic Visions could immolate its targets.\n\nHis ult would look like a flamethrower or something similar, perhaps like the flamethrower in Mythbuster's \"Fire vs. Ice\" episode.\n\nI think the dragon voidlings would make the skin though. At the various stages of voidling frenzy, the dragonlings could mature and get bigger. (I.E. when first summoned, the dragonling begins as a whelp, and eventually turns into a full fledged dragon after 14 seconds.)\n\n_____\n\n\nUnrelated to Malzahar, (or possibly related to, please blow my mind) I would love to see you draw some Warhammer 40k themed skins for any champions that you feel could be done justice in that style. {{champion:268}} Azir already resembles a Necron Lord, and could summon Necron soldiers and his passive tower could be a Monolith. Tyranid void creatures. {{champion:42}} Corki could be in a land speeder. Dreadnought Rumble{{champion:68}} . Imperial Guard Engineer Heimerdinger {{champion:74}} with various heavy weapons and artillery as his turrets.
