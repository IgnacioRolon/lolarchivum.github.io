Itematisation that diverse them from their class is extreemly underwhelming. Every season they manage to get some diversity in itematisation only to move it back to one viable build as soon the season progresses. Their just is no background set in place to prevents that zero diversity from happening. We need itematisation the make supports able to play some of the functionality their secondary role has. I want to start to look for the reason why we would pick a certain class over another:\r\n\r\n* **Mage:** Provide utility\r\n * {{champion:40}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:26}}\r\n * {{champion:43}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:143}} \r\n* **Tank:** Need of a frontline\r\n * {{champion:223}} {{champion:201}}\r\n   *  {{champion:48}} \r\n * {{champion:12}} {{champion:89}}\r\n   *  {{champion:53}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:78}}\r\n* **Fighter:** Need to pick off a target\r\n * {{champion:44}} {{champion:412}}\r\n * {{champion:48}}\r\n   * {{champion:53}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:78}}\r\n\r\nOriginally the support as a role was created out off the mage class namely utility supports. We still see this same itematisation today with {{item:3190}}, {{item:3110}} and {{item:3222}}. They still form the foundation of the support role and that&#039;s what&#039;s wrong with this picture and part of the reason why the role isn&#039;t that poppular. In the toplane you can go a {{item:3068}} {{item:3065}} on a tank, {{item:3027}} scaling build on a mage, {{item:3078}} on fighters. We will always end up with the same itematisation in the support role.\r\n\r\nThis needs to change, I want to say don&#039;t worry guys I will build item X so I can help on the frontline. When in another game I want to build item Y to help my team on the siege run. We already have a little of that in place but the core still remain pretty poor.\r\n\r\nWe need something to highlight their strength inside their itematisation. As a mage I&#039;m squishy so I want sometimes to compensate for this. As a tank I want to be able to play the frontline without getting blown up in the first second. While as a fighter I want to be able to pick off target with itematsation that supports this. I want to be an offtank that has some risks when I don&#039;t engage correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscuss","replies":[{"poster":"Dr W","date":"2016-04-19T12:34:49.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They need to fix the level disadvantage supports inherently get.
