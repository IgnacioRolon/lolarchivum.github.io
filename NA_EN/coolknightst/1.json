To everybody asking why add armor when there are armor items aplenty, I think I understand why armor could be good on this.  \n\nBasically, health increases your overall survival throughout a fight but it **doesn't** actually reduce the damage you take.  With armor you would actually take less damage from jungle camps, allowing you to do what a tank does in the jungle (clears slower, but safer).\n\nAlso note that there is an extreme lack of Armor + CDR items (and adding some armor to this item would definitely assist in that itemization).","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheI3igDaddy","date":"2015-01-17T22:46:25.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think it's quite hilarious how many of the comments are trying to say\n\n'We want the original Spirit of the Ancient Golem back!' \n\nNot saying you all are in the wrong, but I think you need to come out and say it at least lol.","replies":[{"poster":"CoolKnightST","date":"2015-01-18T13:02:23.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheI3igDaddy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=u0YZUUU1,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2015-01-17T22:46:25.032+0000)\n>\n> i think it's quite hilarious how many of the comments are trying to say\n> \n> 'We want the original Spirit of the Ancient Golem back!' \n> \n> Not saying you all are in the wrong, but I think you need to come out and say it at least lol.\n\nThat what worries me. The opinions are divided and it feels whe drifting off to a solution. This where the stats from the original Spirit of the Ancient Golem. The point where tanks where on their strongest:\n\n> **V1.0.0.152:** +500 health, +30 armor, +14 health regen per 5 seconds, +7 mana regen per 5 seconds\n\nSound familiar? Than look closely what they did in patch V3.5. The moment tank jungle start to become underwhelming again: \n\n> **V3.5:** +500 health, +10% Cooldown Reduction, +14 health regen per 5 seconds, +7 mana regen per 5 seconds\n\nThan they tried a different way:\n\n> **V4.11:** +200 health, +20 armor, +10% Cooldown Reduction, 25% Bonus Health, Passive: Sapping Barbs, Active: Hunter's Ward\n\nHow the community likes it on not. The moment their was armor in the item. The item felt less underwhelming.\n\n----\n\nThat's why I think riot really should test \n\n> +400 health, 30 armor, +10% cooldown reduction\n\nIn the PBE","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeusVult","date":"2015-01-17T01:47:31.879+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, the juggernaut enchantment isnt a bad buy\n\nits just a worse choice than the other 3, especially as a first buy to help you clear the jungle.\n\nI usually hold off on it and get a sunfire first.\n\nIf juggernaut had less stats, and had something to help you clear instead, then it would seem a much better buy.  I personally would like to either see the return of quill coat's passive, or for juggernaut to have a mini-sunfire passive.
