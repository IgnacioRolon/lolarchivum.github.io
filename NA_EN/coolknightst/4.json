For some of them it will probally take years before they get updated since currently these skins only get adjusted when a champion get&#039;s a VU update or the cause visual problems ingame.\r\n\r\nSo I was thinking, what if riot makes an ingame client poll every 1-3 months where you have the option to vote between 3-5 outdated skins for 1-100 RP. Depending on the total votes the skin with the most votes gets an update. The skin get updated depending on the budget that was recieved from all RP  votes. T&#039;is allows them to update their skins that crosses the limitations when the skin was orginally released. T&#039;is can be combined with a chroma set.\r\n\r\nPlayers that did the poll should get a reward like a free chroma when they already owned the skin or a large discount on the skin.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"NightmareAmazoX","date":"2016-08-28T13:10:08.608+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pulsefire Ezreal and Magnficient Twisted Fate should be the first skins to get an update.","replies":[{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2016-08-28T15:17:19.766+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"AND gentleman chogath.

That way, you're spending minimal essence for the maximum chance at getting a higher value permanent.\nThere's around 90 skins that are that cheap, 90 skins in the 750 tier, and around 180 in 975 tier.

They'd need to establish special group of artists, designers and a director to take care of it which is a thing of periodical salary rather than one-time payment. There's no reason they should get more money that needed to pay the salary AND If they don't raise enough money, they can't pay them. They'd need to raise X amount of money every session to pay the workers for the session. Also, If you pay via RP, they technically already have the money so they would be able to establish the new team long ago without you telling them \"These money go for this thing not that Sona skin\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"hi im minty","date":"2016-08-28T18:53:27.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bittersweet {{champion:117}} is the ugliest skin in League.
