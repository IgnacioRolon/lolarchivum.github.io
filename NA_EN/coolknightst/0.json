What about include them by a command in the search function from the champion icon like: \"<champname>\" will also reveal the ability/passive icons. Or when searching only the ability icons something like \"ability:<abilityname>\" Additionaly further advanced option can be included like \"<champname>:skin\", \"<champname>:ability, \"skin:<skiname>\", etc...\n*","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2014-11-24T21:03:12.424+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool, I think underline may have its uses for emphasis and may be something we consider.
