It makes kiting very difficult and I think it has to do with the auto attack cancel change they implemented in the 6.20 update. A fix (and maybe some buffs wink wink) would be very much appreciated :). but as of now I don&#039;t think I&#039;m playing any Kalista until this is fixed","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-10-11T04:20:00.802+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's an issue with the auto attack changes that went out in the last patch. Kalista's not the only champ affected, she is the most frequently impacted one by a large margin though. We'll be disabling those auto attack changes shortly, then reintroducing them in a later patch once we've got the bug fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2016-10-11T06:28:06.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this also related to Riven's resets being much easier to do? What are you going to do about that?\n\nHave Riven's resets become part of the champ (like the Alistar combo), or is there a future where Riven can't reset her animations?","replies":[]}]}]}
