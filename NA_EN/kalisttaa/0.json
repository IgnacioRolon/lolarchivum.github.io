I was waiting for the Krugs to spawn bot lane so I could leash my jungler and I got bored so I started taunting, joking, laughing and I couldnt help but notice that when Kalista does one of these actions while using blood moon it causes her mask to turn dark and I don&#039;t remember it being like that before. It almost seems as if her model has a dark face and the white mask sinks into her face while using these actions. If someone could fix this it would make me very happy. Thank you ^~^","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-29T21:10:15.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Kalisttaa,\n\nThanks for the report. This definitely isn't intended.
