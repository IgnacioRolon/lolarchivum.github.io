Don't act like some entitled bitch. The jungle belongs to the jungler, not you. Consider any blues you get as a gift and be grateful for it.\n2. Learn to play without blue buff. I don't think I should be explaining to you that you shouldn't spam your shit like a r%%%%% and if you do make sure you land your spells.\n3. If you want the buff, take it yourself. The jungler is not your bitch. You're a big boy, you can kill that big blue golem all by yourself if you want the buff that badly. If the jungler also leashes and donates it to you, consider that a favor and a gift as well.\n\n\nEdit: \nwhy are people still telling me \"but i take blue cuz durr\"\n\nyeah i don't give a shit what you use it for or who needs it. Did none of you read the first fucking line? that debate is not the topic of this thread. the topic of this thread is that if you don't get blue for some reason ***REGARDLESS OF WHO WHAT WHERE HOW WHY IDGAF*** don't be a ***BITCH ***about it.\n\n\nEdit: Patch 420. Looks like rito agrees with me. Checkmate self entitled midlaner babies. http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-420-notes#patch-blue-sentinel-red-brambleback-camp-rewards","replies":[]}
