The client was working just fine for a while, then a few days ago it began to \"freeze\" I could still click on anything like profile, shop... but it would not do anything or it would not load correctly. Even when I'm trying to exit and press yes it stays in the client, que freezes and won't let me get out or cancel it, msgs won't send, patching would stop progressing, etc. I have no idea why this is happening or how to prevent it. It also gives me a lot of trouble to open after I get out of it (usually have to terminate the process to do it).","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-11T22:51:33.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like this might be happening if your network somehow lost it's connection to our servers completely, so then the client isn't able to process anything due to it not being able to get any information from us. Let's take a minute to double-check your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for anything weird there.
