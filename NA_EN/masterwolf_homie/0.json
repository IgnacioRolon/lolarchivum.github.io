I logged in and I see I have the Inactivity Notification for decay in ranked. I don't quite understand considering ranked season is over. I played one game of Flex just now to see if that was the problem but I'm still getting the notification. Can someone help?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-19T19:24:26.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's just leftovers from the previous season, but rest assured that there's no decay enabled.  Per the [Preseason FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/231832207-Preseason-FAQ), inactivity and decay is disabled until the next season starts.  Hope that helps bring some ease!","replies":[{"poster":"Masterwolf homie","date":"2016-11-19T19:26:28.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.
