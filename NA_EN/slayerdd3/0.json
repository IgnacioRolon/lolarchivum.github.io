It's pretty typical for banks to hold that money in pending for a day or so, so be sure to check the state of that transaction to see if it's \"pending\" or fully charged. You're always welcome to reach out to our billing team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) as well if that money was definitely taken out of your account.","replies":[{"poster":"Aerith Lilly","date":"2017-08-21T22:54:35.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this happen as well too. As luck would have it, its for a 5 dollar purchase and not the 50 dollar purchase I made moments before. I'm going to assume that the Initial loadout client is based on a web wrapper?   As feedback, suggestion,  I think when the user initiates a purchase flow, it should generate an auth token for that purchase, store it awaiting for receipt and lock out any additional purchase until receipt. Then the remote server can process the payment or send back a failure. If sever times out , the local client would then not keep rebilling. tokens would expire locally after some time so that if the server goes down and cannot respond with recept then it would invalidate that lock later so they can try again.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-22T00:02:48.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y'know, this may not actually be such a terrible idea.
