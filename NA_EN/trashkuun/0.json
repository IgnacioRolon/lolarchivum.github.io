I can easily use the internet freely, but when it comes to getting into the game is consistently crashes on me. I tried to see if it was connecting to the other Summoners was my problem, but when I tried to entire into a custom match with only myself, no bots, no other summoners, just me, it still crashed and said I had \"Connection issues\". I have had no lag problems until just yesterday. I was hoping resting my League client would be fine thinking it might just be something wrong with the servers since no one else seemed to be having a problem, but over time I have noticed many League Summoners have been DCing often in my matches before hand and coming to the conclusion that there must be something wrong with the League servers themselves. Many a times I had Summoners crying out and begging not to be reported because they could not reconnect because of the same issue I am having now.\n\n**EDIT:** I have troubleshooted the way League has set up, even tried turning my computer itself off and on again, disconnecting my internet and reconnecting, turning ON and OFF my firewall, but nothing has been helping. I am not the only one with this problem. I have filed a ticket, but I want more awareness on the situation because I am not the only one.","replies":[{"poster":"MarshmallowBob","date":"2016-02-24T19:08:52.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just in case others are having the same issue -- we've fixed this problem by using the Repair button in the client.\n\nHere's the instructions on how to get to it:\n\nNext time you start up League, instead of clicking \"LAUNCH\", click the question mark in the top right and choose \"Repair\". Depending on how many files are corrupt, it may take a while to finish. Once it's done, try launching and starting a custom game to verify you are no longer crashing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MarshmallowBob","date":"2016-02-23T21:38:44.816+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just found your ticket and I'll make sure to give you a hand there.
