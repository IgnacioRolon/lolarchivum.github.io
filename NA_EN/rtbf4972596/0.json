I'm but a humble player from New Zealand on the OCE server. I sent a ticket in to Riot Support who suggested and I quote \r\n****************************************************************************************************************\r\n\"Hello,\r\n\r\nYour suggestion is a good point of view and I recommend you post this to the Boards as we cannot pass feedback directly to the devs. The team is always looking at the Boards to get a feel for things players think could be improved.\r\n\r\nYou can find the Boards here:\r\n\r\nNA Boards: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous\r\n\r\nThanks again for sharing your idea. We are always trying to improve and your idea or suggestion matters.\"\r\n****************************************************************************************************************\r\nMy question was about Victorious Skins and my ticket said this,\r\n****************************************************************************************************************\r\n \"As we know each year around October the Victorious Champion is named and we get the skin for it if we've earned Gold + ranks. Just wanting to know, has it ever been thought to put all Victorious skins as an option and let the player decide for themselves?\r\n\r\nFor example, I only really started playing League end of Season 5 when Victorious Sivir was released, she was my first main and will always be my favourite ADC but am so gutted I'll never get her Victorious skin. So what I mean is, at the end of the season, has it been thought maybe put up each Victorious skin and let the player choose what they want? \r\n(so maybe have them all and let someone choose Sivir or Elise etc).\r\n\r\nIt feels like it would be more rewarding to be able to choose which champion we would like a Victorious skin with. I am grateful for getting a free Maokai skin, but I never play him unless it's aram and I have no rerolls (so last year I would've picked Sivir or Morgana over Maokai, if this makes sense).\r\n\r\nI've got over 200,000 points in Sivir as you can see with the screenshot and I would so so so love to have her Victorious Skin (I actually do and sent a screenshot in lol).\r\n\r\nBut has it been thought to let players choose their Victorious skin or will it be something Riot would consider in the future?\r\n****************************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nAnyways, what do you guys think? Like at the end of the season if you've earned Gold - Challenger, Riot should have every Victorious Skin available and you choose to have J4 or Morgana etc? Or the new Victorious Champion, if you'd like of course. I know plenty of Janna and Elise mains who didn't play League in those respective seasons. \r\n\r\nIf someone already has Victorious Morgana, they can get a special border around their skin (think project maybe) showing they were around in season 4 and got the skin at the time?\r\n\r\nRIOTERS IF YOU'RE READING THIS PLEASE REPLY WITH YOUR THOUGHTS TOO :D","replies":[{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2017-09-13T05:39:36.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would trade my Victorious Maokai skin for Victorious Morgana at the drop of a hat.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf4972596","date":"2017-09-13T12:54:21.860+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dr Delusional,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=ee88EyEi,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2017-09-13T05:39:36.750+0000)\n>\n> I would trade my Victorious Maokai skin for Victorious Morgana at the drop of a hat.\n\nSame, I desperately want Morg and Siv ):","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ethan Allen","date":"2017-09-13T00:11:48.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good Idea!

Personally, I think just allowing other people have your idea would just diminish the accomplishment of those who struggled to reach Gold for those skins. \n\nAlthough technically you're still reaching the same requirement as those before, ranked population and meta has changed drastically over the years. \nA player in Bronze season 1 and 2 was probably about equal to Gold now since there were a vast amount of players who were unranked just due to their elo being too low. With such a small amount of players even having a rank tier it made getting a Victorious skin a massive accomplishment. Meanwhile now with all the ranked safety nets such as free wins for failing promos, people placing as high as Platinum fresh out of placements, and not dropping a tier for a few games after you promote, it's simply not as impressive now as it was back then. A player in Season 8 for example choosing to get Victorious J4 would not be the same at all as a player who worked for that 7 years before him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rtbf4972596","date":"2017-09-13T04:05:59.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"makkii","date":"2017-09-13T05:34:13.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JukeMaster420,realm=OCE,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=ee88EyEi,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2017-09-13T04:05:59.258+0000)\n>\n> Tbh Makkii just seem like the douche to tell you he&#x27;s got food but won&#x27;t share it with you in class or something. Only wants to have it for themselves and is like &quot;haha you can&#x27;t have this get rekt ggez noob&quot;. People have earned Victorious Skins, that&#x27;s my point. Why shouldn&#x27;t we be able to choose which one? I agree with Tormentula in saying it adds value because it adds a unique feature to the skin(s). I have Neo Pax {{champion:15}} and if they re-released it again (Riot said they&#x27;d never do it but just as an example) and they added on a watermark or border to the skin (like the did with normal Pax {{champion:15}} ), I would love it as it adds something to the skin, a little feature showing I had it originally. If they added something to Victorious {{champion:57}}  it shows that I was there in season 6 when I originally earned the skin.\n\nYou shouldn't be able to pick which one because each skin symbolizes a different season.\n\nDon't sit here and try to straw man my intentions.\n\nSomething you need to understand, is that at the very least, if it wasn't explicitly said, it was implicitly promised following the conclusion of season 2 and the release of a different victorious skin, instead of jarvan again, that these skins were exclusive, changing that would be an outright betrayal to older players who earned them, and riots already in hot water with them over things like this.\n\nalso it makes no sense to claim that adding a border to these skins for loading screens than changing them from exclusive to inclusive, would add value, it subtracts value, because yeah you have a border sure, but now everybody has the same exact skin you do.\n\nsupply and demand, learn it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Uwhtazn","date":"2017-09-13T01:41:08.927+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hopefully, for those that actually play rank flex and got gold or higher on both solo queue and flex queue, can get 2 victorious skins, with the second skin being the players choice.

The cash shop, not so much as the skins should still be considered \"rewards\" (like the option is available only for a particular rank+) but that's not what any of us are asking for. We're stating we've earned this skins in every way besides the date. As long as there's a clear indication that \"this account got it legit\" (ignoring a purchased account) then I see absolutely no degrading of value for the skins then there already is, if anything a border would add more value to the skin then it has now. \n\nI believe the difference between what you described is that you're *paying* for the content. You're paying extra with the expectancy that its limited, and if it becomes available later on, then it feels like you were cheated out of something. In the Victorious Skin case, you're not paying for anything, you simply just played 10 ranked game placements and waited to see who it is (in my case) only to know its not who you want. They're meant to be limited rewards you earn, none of them were really earned unless your first climb to gold was a learning curve as its uphill from there. \n\nI certainly didn't earn this season's, 10 game, boom free skin somebody in silver will cry when they see later.

No work or money involved, basically just be there. Additionally they have no future additions as a \"skinline\" to set a standard (lets say riot released a new skin for free every year for playing like UFO corki, then at that point players like corki mains would be upset why we're getting champion x over UFO corki). The requirement was to be there, made very clear. \n\nVictorious Skins were more as rewards for getting gold, and that was it. Difference being we just change the Victorious champ every year and didn't return the previous ones yet. So every year it feels like a slap to the face given you're forced to get a skin for something you may not enjoy when a skin for something you do enjoy already exist. The requirement was get to gold, which many have, but we're still not getting what we wanted.\n\nBasically, as you say some players worked hard for a skin for their champion, but others who joined later miss that opportunity entirely, they don't get to work at all even though some would be motivated enough to get to challenger for them.
