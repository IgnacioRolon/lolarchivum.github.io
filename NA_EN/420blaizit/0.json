I already opened up a ticket with\nRiot and still haven't heard back from them. One clue to this is that I started having this problem after the new champion Kled joined the gang.\n\nLet me know what I can do to fix this.\n\nThanks,\n\n-E","replies":[{"poster":"0MerchantofDeath","date":"2016-08-19T01:17:25.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATE!!!!! AND FIX \n\nSo I found out what is wrong with the game and why it keeps crashing. It has to do with the resolution that your computer is running. The screen resolution does not match up with the resolution of the game configurations.  I will tell you how to fix that.\n\n1.\tGo to your Riot games folder. \n2.\tOpen the Config folder\n3.\tOpen game.cfg file with notepad. \n4.\tUnder [GENERAL] change the \nHeight=\nWidth= \nTo the resolution of your monitor or screen.  Mine was set to 900 and 1440, and I am using a 1024 and 1280 monitor. \n5.\tStart the game.

Uninstall your league from Control panel. \n2. download CCleaner https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download. Install CCleaner.\n3. Run CCleaner and Click Registry on the Left where the gray is in the CCleaner program. \n4. Hit scan\n5. After it scans, hit Fix all. And then a little window will come up. select Fix all. \n6. restart your computer. \n7. Download the LOL installer\n8. start the installer.\n9. The installer will finish, but there may be another window that comes up saying to install .Net Framework 3.5. You need to install this. \n10. After it install the .NET framework restart the computer. \n11. After booting, run LOL client. It should start patching. \n12. After patching is complete, it should run the game. Try a custom game. It worked for me.\nALSO, when the game is patching, go the to settings and UNCHECK Allow peer ro peer, this will boost you download speed. Hopefully this works. \nI am running window 10 64 bit.
