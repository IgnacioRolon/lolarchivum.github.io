I have a member in my club who's account will randomly post a spam link to a Champ Riven skin. I've talked with him to stop. He says its not him and he cant do anything about it. I recommended he talk with riot to resolve the issue.   He responded \" listen, i cant do anything about it neither can they, we tried. I didnt do anything.\"    Is there an issue that Riot cant help players with account hacks? or is he just BSing me? I like the player and would love to keep him in the club, but we have new player member and i don't want to get them hacked.   Let me know thanks community!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-20T17:52:47.668+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your club member may not have their account secured.
