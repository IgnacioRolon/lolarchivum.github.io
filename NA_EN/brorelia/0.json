That said there is sooo much more to ping and riots silly ping meter is very crude and most likely  left crude on purpose to cover up their poor network performance. what really matters is your over all data transmission or packets...you can drop packets, have small spikes etc that will create some really wonky stuff.\n\nyou have to understand the engine has to decide between what your client says and all the other players. I have had some really wild stuff visually occur on my screen when my inet was acting up.  \n\nAnyrate you can argue her q is a little large it also moves incredibly slow for a skill shot in league of gap closers so while her Q might be BS to a true skillful champ like MF who actually has to position and dodge to avoid it, for a champ like vayne it is a joke you ever eat a morg Q when you can just tumble away from every skill shot in the game, like many champs in this now incredibly imbalanced and horribly design game (really the champ kits they ruined their own game).","replies":[{"poster":"Ellphi","date":"2015-01-12T19:10:12.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne's Q hitbox is just as poorly labeled as Morgana's Q hitbox\n\nIt's as if when Vayne tumbles, her hitbox doesn't move as quickly as her animation or something, so oftentimes Morgana can snare Vayne by hitting where Vayne was before her tumble started\n\nHonestly I don't understand why Riot refuses to put in unit circles, or at least have them as an option we can toggle.
