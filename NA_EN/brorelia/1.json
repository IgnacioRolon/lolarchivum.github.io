This would limit his passive for wave clearing while still keeping the assassin part of him in tact. It would also allow some readable counterplay since he would want to wait for his passive to be up. Also this passive is auto reset on champion kill or assist just to make him not dead in the water if he kills an enemy champ in a team fight.\n\nAnother thing that could help at least early game is making his Razor Shuriken do reduced damage the more targets it goes through instead of the first target taking 100% then the rest taking 60%. Say make the damage reduced by 25% multiplicatively for each enemy unit it goes through \nIf it did 100% of the damage to the first target then reduced to 75% for the second, 56.3% for the third 42.2% for the forth and 31.6% for the fifth etc. it would be harder for zed to press Q and E to clear waves. It isn't even a 100% nerf since if he uses it to hit one minion and hit an enemy champion behind that minion it will be doing more damage then it currently does to the second target.  It would also make zed have to think about how he wants to use Razor Shuriken, for wave clear or for harassment.","replies":[{"poster":"Zahz","date":"2015-01-18T23:30:26.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Remove his energy and make him mana user.","replies":[{"poster":"Brorelia","date":"2015-01-18T23:37:01.602+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SCNightwolf,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3TpAEM2F,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-18T23:30:26.836+0000)\n>\n> Remove his energy and make him mana user.\n\nThey are not going to do that so I am trying to suggest realistic changes that could be done without completely destroying the play style.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Downrun","date":"2015-01-18T23:45:31.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SCNightwolf,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3TpAEM2F,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-18T23:30:26.836+0000)\n>\n> Remove his energy and make him mana user.\n\nthis would be a substantial buff to zed's late game. i'm not sure if anyone would want that.","replies":[{"poster":"D1rtFarmer","date":"2015-01-19T00:11:57.838+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i sooo doubt it... he would actually have to return during the laning phase","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"D1rtFarmer","date":"2015-01-19T00:12:50.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"take his aoe from his q.","replies":[{"poster":"Brorelia","date":"2015-01-19T00:19:58.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=D1rtFarmer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3TpAEM2F,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-19T00:12:50.891+0000)\n>\n> take his aoe from his q.\n\nThe concept of a balance change should not be destroying the champion to the point of being useless but to make them have defined strengths and weaknesses and trade offs for doing things one way or another.\n\nCurrently Zed is too good of a jack of all trades and his main identity should be an assassin but currently is also wave clear and split pushing without much any effort.\n\nThis is not going to remove this wave clear completely late game should he build for it but should make players have to make more decision on what they want to be focusing on doing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fried Noob","date":"2015-01-19T03:56:03.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could always make his Q similar to Lux's binding.
