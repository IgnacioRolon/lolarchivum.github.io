It's in reality taken 3 years for them to work from the ground up and now their lore department is working at like 600% the speed it used to all that time ago because the framework and direction is basically set.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gravesinger","date":"2018-12-07T14:25:11.010+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"This would seem to imply that the entire map does not belong to Kled.\n\n**_Heathen._**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kurorade","date":"2018-12-07T14:23:24.475+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why the hell does he live in Trevale with Riven.","replies":[{"poster":"CauseSCIENCE","date":"2018-12-09T09:51:19.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kurorade,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=0kqbFgKd,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-12-07T14:23:24.475+0000)\n>\n> Why the hell does he live in Trevale with Riven.\n\nHe was born in Trevale i think, or something like that.
