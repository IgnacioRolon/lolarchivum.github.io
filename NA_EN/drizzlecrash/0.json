The thing about the tv is that the resolution is pretty bad. All settings(tv and computer) didn't fully fit and look well. It's been a week since I've played so it could just be a new bug, but the actual issue is that when I start a game it goes black screen, flickers, has no signal, closes, then brings up a DirectX error something about my drivers needing updates(yes they are updated). I need my League fix, anyone have an idea?       {{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-22T18:57:02.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like the tv might be a 4K or exceeding 1920x1080 which isn't currently supported.
