It buys you time to get heals and etc, but it's not like armor. You don't \"lose\" that damage, it still happened/is going to happen.\n\nDamage reduction as most know it as, is actually preventing damage from happening from an amount that has been inflicted. This doesn't \"prevent\" as much as mitigates it for a short time. This should be known as a Damage Mitigation item instead. \n\nIt's useful, but it really isn't damage reduction as most people see it, it's not confusion as much as incorrect terminology being applied to the item in question in the first place and people fighting over the definition while everyone understands the benefits and cons of such an item. \n\nI'd much rather have a 30% damage reduction item, as would most; I'd say. Which is why there's arguments happening. \n\nAgain I'm not saying there's no benefit to that 30% being taken and then reapplied as per your example, but 'initial reduction' shouldn't really be classified as \"Damage reduction\" because it's not actually changing the value. It's like a loan of health, you have to pay it back; it has no interest which makes it the best loan.

You're not reducing anything like I said you're MITIGATING it. Reduction would imply it gets rid of it completely. You're not lessening the damage, you're lessening the blow AT THE TIME which is entirely different. Which is why it's not damage reduction like armor.\n\nIf armor gives you 30% damage reduction from a 100 auto, that means only 70 damage hits. Which means you reduced 30 damage.\n\nIn the case of death's dance the value is STORED and then re-utilized as true damage later in a True damage DoT (1/3rd) 33.3%~ of the damage done/sec over 3 seconds. That is not reduction that's mitigation.\n\n\" Stores 30% of all physical and magic damage received, and is taken as damage over time true damage instead, dealing one-third of the stored damage every second.\" - Quoted from the Wiki.\n\nThat means it ALL comes back eventually, regardless of how you want to twist it. Healing the damage doesn't make it go away, because that health could have gone towards that 70% you lost in your example if it had been armor that blocked 30%, but in this case the healing has to heal 100% of the amount, just not all at once which is not reduction in the end, but mitigation. \n\nSo if a user with death's dance had 100(1000) damage done to them, they take the 70(700), and then immediately applied is the additional 30(300) broken up into 3 seconds. meaning you get 10(100) damage almost immediately after and then 20(200) additional damage broken up over the next two seconds. The damage is STILL going to happen, you just don't take as much initially which is why it's different than reduction. It's not coded like reduction at all it's a stored value, that's reapplied.","replies":[{"poster":"Yets4240","date":"2018-07-08T21:50:39.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Read what I actually said, and actually look at the specific example I had given before and that I am referencing here initially instead of talking completely past it because, well, I don't even know why.
