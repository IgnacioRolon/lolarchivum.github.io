Why do I get a 14 day ban automatically for calling people trash? I don't get like a 1 day or a 3 day? Also its pretty stupid how Riot bans toxic people but not the people that leave games and cause their team to lose? Like at least the toxic people are still trying, Its pretty dumb.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-22T04:03:28.251+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"We do take player harassment pretty seriously here at Riot, as well as keeping track of those who constantly abandon their teammates in games. With enough leaves or AFKS, those people will end up with penalties as well. \n\nI won't be able to help with lowering that suspension, but take this time to consider what was said, and why it could have been upsetting to someone on the receiving end. Teamwork makes the dream work, and bringing your other team members down would only help spell defeat for your team.","replies":[{"poster":"SGP Temptation","date":"2017-06-13T18:19:14.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"May I just say, I do not believe that the punishment system is sufficient. If there really is a \"Zero tolerance\" for toxicity, then why is it that many can go one game at a time being toxic? Also, many are punished on their first offense where as others can go for many games before even seeing a warning. I know this because I have been in each situation. I also understand that there is a \"ladder\" punishment system, and as you continue toxicity, you move up the ladder (I also understand that you can skip levels depending on the severity). However, when your game chat is read, I feel that both guilty parties should be punished. If someone really does look into and decide a verdict for these cases individually, they SHOULD take into account EVERYTHING and EVERYONE in the game. For example, you cannot report a support for taking all the cs and kills, even if it costs your team the game because you do not have an adc. However, if each case is not thoroughly read and rather skimmed for the toxic players chat, then why should some people be able to get away with it for so long? Cumulatively, all players of league of legends are old enough to understand that words are just words and it is in game activity which truly matters. I am just curious to know because I really hate and do not understand Riot's crack down on in game chat but not in game activity. As in why should chat related violations result in anything besides chat related punishments. It gives me a sense of the whole \"yeah there might not be a really good reason for it but just because I said so, you have to listen and were Riot so we can do whatever we want and small individuals like you don't matter.\" I am not trying to fire shots, I genuinely would please like some clarification if that is okay...","replies":[]},{"poster":"LianPlayz","date":"2017-05-22T04:08:42.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're free to help, I really need some assistance @Broporo","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-22T04:26:23.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see your post, check for my response in a sec ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"LianPlayz","date":"2017-05-22T04:34:07.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry about that.
