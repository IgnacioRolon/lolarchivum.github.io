It is numbered 1-12 so instead of pressing 4 on the keyboard for warding, i press it with my thumb on the mouse. I think it would be best that in case I don't have my mouse or I'm on someone else's computer, I should learn how to ward and use item actives using only the keyboard. \r\n\r\nI have my left hand in the WASD position, which is apparently not a popular position in league of legends. Most people use QWER or just QWE. Should I switch my positioning? Because I only need my right thumb to press buttons, I only needed to reach for the R button. But In this position, reaching for the number keys is quite uncomfortable. Which position do you guys recommend and should I practice in custom games first or bot games or normals?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-20T16:17:18.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ultimately, it's all up to what is most comfortable for you, and there is no wrong way.  My bindings are all over the place due to previous experiences in MMOs, and some folks might find my setup to be insane.  It works for me though and feels natural, so that's really all that matters.  Feel free to explore and find your sweet setup!","replies":[]}]}
