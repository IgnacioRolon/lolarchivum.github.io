If a client repair is how you said it was fixing it or it doesn't work, you may need to do a clean reinstall; download the [Hextech Repair Tool on this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs), select the 'Uninstall' and 'Clean Reinstall' options and run it. This will take longer than a repair, but is completely thorough and may fix your issue.\n\nFor further assistance with crashes, please refer to the [Bug Splat & Game Crashes guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes).","replies":[{"poster":"LoLAbridged","date":"2016-08-04T21:33:39.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still having the problem only made it through 1 game this time","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-08-04T21:50:21.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What troubleshooting steps did you take?","replies":[{"poster":"LoLAbridged","date":"2016-08-04T21:53:35.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Installed the Repair tool, did the clean reinstall.

Crashing is a very loose term, so it's hard to say what the issue was without more exact details about what you're actually seeing.  Catching up here, it looks like you might have solved the corrupt data issue, and experiencing another lingering issue at this point.  If the loading screen isn't appearing or if you just see a black screen then your network might be having trouble establishing a connection to our game server.  \n\nGo over the steps in [our connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to get this fixed up.  I highly recommend testing it out in custom games to avoid further lower priority queues.
