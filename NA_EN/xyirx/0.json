It feels more like counting 6/8, with the counting emphasis on every third beat 'ONE two three FOUR five six', you know, something that would normally be conducted in two strokes; but it keeps going and on the fourth set, it's cut one short 'ONE two three FOUR five six SEVEN eight nine TEN eleven ONE two three FOUR etc.'\n\nNaturally, The Boy Who Shattered Time's theme would be in a really unusual TIME signature. But whatever time signature it is...IT'S DAMN AWESOME. Kudos to Riot and ChemicalSeb.","replies":[{"poster":"spookybadger","date":"2015-07-01T02:33:05.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you and Chemicalseb are both right technically. A combo of one measure of 6/4 and one measure of 5/4 is basically the same thing as one measure of 11/8. When I counted it out, I grouped it into 6 and 5 as well, and grouping measures like this is much easier for the musician to sight read, and therefor easier to read in general. I would write it in 6/8 and 5/8. Also during the \"bridge,\" we'll call it, it moves into groupings of 6/8 5/8 6/8 6/8, which would be hard to do if you had measures of 11/8.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sheath","date":"2015-05-28T19:06:53.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"spookybadger","date":"2015-07-01T02:36:31.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How did you get 4/6 4/5? 6 and 5 are not note values. Did you mean 6/4 and 5/4?\n\nAlso, I disagree with your opinion of the song. The melody of the song cleverly disguises the counting of the song and makes the measures flow together very well. I think it is the most impressive theme music I've heard come from Riot.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
