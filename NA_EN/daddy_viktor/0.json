Its cool if you don't I was just wondering because it would make a lot of sense in her situation if there were dragons like the D&amp;D dragons with the shapeshifting capabilites as to how she is a half dragon ya know?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2019-07-21T11:10:29.350+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, neither character's powers have been explored to any extensive depth (ah shit, that was a Pyke pun). With their abilities been represented more clearly in-game than it has been within written stories so far. Like Zed isnt even the leading focus in any of the stories featured on his page, besides the Bio and his yet-to-be released comic. So it's incredibly difficult not to limit one's own theories to their in-game capabilities vs what may or may not be their capabilities in-universe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Falrein","date":"2019-07-21T08:05:05.456+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, Scathelocke might pop and say it's  a \"my dad vs your dad\" situation but...\n\nIt depends I guess. The thing with Pyke is that he keeps coming back when he dies. However, Zed's shadow magic is a form of Spirit Magic, and as Pyke is a spectre, it may have effects on that resurrection.\n\nIt's all theoretical anyway, there's a low chance of the two of them meeting, as well as not many info on both of them.\n\nAlthough I'm inclined to say there are people who would be better than Zed at slaying Spirits or any Spirital entities (which undead are a part of) tbh - Shen and Syndra come to mind, as one is specialized in that and the other has spirit/soul bamboozling powers. It really depends on what Zed's magic is capable of in the end, as Zed is arguably more trained than Pyke in term of combat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HotarÂµ","date":"2019-07-21T07:45:03.826+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure Pyke would win just because he could keep coming back. \n\n>\"Death keeps spitting me right back out.\" \n\n>\"I'm already dead, more death ain't gonna hurt.\"\n\n It's suggested from his lore and voice lines that Pyke is supernatural and unkillable (atleast by regular means) so he could just keep coming back to wear Zed down and kill him since he is just a human. Oddly enough I think _lorewise_ Shen would have a better chance at killing him since Shen has more experience killing spirits and revenants.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2019-07-21T08:23:41.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As other people already pointed out, Pyke is undead. Considering that, i doubt that Zed can kill him even if the ninja has more training and skills.

I'm just gonna keep this as an isolated encounter.\n\nI would say Zed. it's safe to assume shadow magic, being a type of spirit magic, can damage the undead and other spiritual beings. so really, I think Zed would win. he has much more skill and experience, while Pyke was just an exceptional  monster killer who now uses his powers for revenge\n\nnow, it would still be a tough fight considering Pyke's fighting style, but he would just be stomped in my opinion","replies":[]},{"poster":"Koori Oni","date":"2019-07-25T15:24:18.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I don't think being 'unkillable' counts in this sence, it isn't a Jason sort of deal, where he takes fatal damage and keeps on going, I'd assume he dissipates or the like, and I doubt he comes back frequently enough to wear Zed down.\n\nThere is also the fact Zed is a ninja, so you'd have to assume he has heightened senses outside of powers given by his magic as well as being alert for any other enemies. So Pyke, making any noise, smelling of sea water, anything would give him away.\n\nAnd as stated, Zed is likely more skilled in combat, thus in the long game Pyke might win, when Zed is old and decrepit. At least that would be my take on it. Best scenario for Pyke is the fight draws attention to Zed where as his enemies can get an upper hand on Zed.\n\nAlso, yes it is in game, but Zed is one of the only, if only, champion that never truly dies, he shadows out, maybe dying, or maybe escaping. Feel it's worth noting.","replies":[]}]}
