I was punished in September of 2017 for toxicity. I have played probably 90-100 normal matches since my honor dropped, and as of today with no further punishments I stand at 0/3 checkpoints at honor level 0. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t have enough time to dedicate to this game to play another 200 games before the season ends. It wasn&#039;t enough that I lost seasonal rewards, so I have to completely miss out on the honor system rewards for the NEXT season as well? I stepped back from the game, and changed my behavior. But because I don&#039;t have time to play 300+ games, I have to completely sit out on the honor rewards until S9?\r\n\r\nI just think it&#039;s a bit extreme to hand out punishments, take away ranked rewards, drop honor level to 0, take away ALL honor rewards, and then tell someone to go play 200 games to get back to normal. I was so excited when they announced that honor would reset, and it was soulcrushing to see that I wasn&#039;t even eligible to reset AND that I&#039;ve essentially made NO progress to returning to the standard honor level. I don&#039;t have time to set aside to play 200 more games just to get back to standard honor. This should have reset everyone back to 2, as long as they weren&#039;t punished during preseason.","replies":[{"poster":"deathgod5","date":"2018-01-16T12:00:17.173+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=nAuOABgc,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-12-18T19:16:10.031+0000)\n>\n> I looked at your account, and you have a lot of unsportsmanlike games that just weren't severe enough to warrant a penalty.

Just because it took that player 209 matches, does NOT mean that it will take every player 200 matches.  The greatest determining factor in how long it takes a player to progress through the honor system is whether or not they are continually displaying dishonorable (aka toxic) behavior.  If someone is being toxic enough to warrant a report, but not enough to earn a punishment by the IFS, then they won't move up the honor system.  Riot Tantram has addressed this a few times in posts to various players recently.  Basically, if you've been stuck at Honor level 0 for a while, then you should probably take another look at your chat.  Ask yourself this.... are you still being a bit harsh with teammates, passive aggressive, snapping at them, flaming back?  If you are, try just muting people at the beginning of the game.  Type out a periodic \"nice one!\" or \"gj\" to your team, or thank them for ganks/roams/follow up, and then go back to not typing anything.  At the end of the match, type \"gg\" and then move on to the next match.
