He has a quote \"_The Freljord forges men out of... whatever children are. Dirt, goblins_.\" Based off his tone, it could be a metaphor to maybe the idea of \"goblins\" a fantasy term in their world for a make believe fairy tale creature, or he is actually referring to real goblins. Only other evidence i have is in the Demolisher Nunu splash art, there is clearly goblins being thrown about, figured this art isn't canon or anything but the fact they are there makes me wonder. \r\n\r\nCould Ornn, or the concept of goblins, be referring to what could've been yordles? \r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-janna}} \r\nI just wanna know for my League based DnD campaign!\r\nI already made up \"Feral Yordes\" to fill in that goblin/kobold void.","replies":[{"poster":"Kled Man Walking","date":"2020-02-20T03:27:39.718+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"During Kled's development he was noted as \"almost a goblin\" (or something to that effect), so it's very likely that \"goblin\" is just a term for yordles, particularly feral ones.

But Originally Edmundo and I intended Kled to be runeterra's version of a goblin.    I had a weird little story, and Mundo had a sweet drawing of a goblin like creature with a crown and another one that was very fuzzy and similar to Kled (but riding a beetle) -- Both images were super inspiring.   I believe we had also just sort of assumed a \"goblin\" was just how humans described and saw an evil yordle though.   (Much like the lore use of Spirit vs Demon in language use.)    \nBut our producer (PO)  pushed us to make Kled more normal Yordle looking, and reluctantly we did.","replies":[{"poster":"Yordle Gunner","date":"2020-02-23T11:14:48.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you don't mind me asking.

I like Goblins but Goblins are not Yordles. If that inspired Kled, great, fantastic. I think Kled is a fantastic representation of a more modern Male Yordle. And what we see in Legends of Runeterra also looks good. But I'm worried about the physical nature of them.
