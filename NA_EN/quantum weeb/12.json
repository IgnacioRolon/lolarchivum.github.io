Our pros tend to highly value reliability which is in direct conflict with Gnar's unreliable transformation.  If he becomes a staple it likely means he's way more reliable than we intended.\n\n[Source](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/A8YYtOo8-gnar-qa-gameplay-completed?comment=00000002)","replies":[]}
