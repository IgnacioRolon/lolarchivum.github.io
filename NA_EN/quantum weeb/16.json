The lore was excellent, progressed often and players could vote on what happened.\n\nThe map wasn&#039;t just a copy of the standard MOBA map either;\n\nhttp://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dawngate.gamepedia.com/thumb/4/43/Map.png/599px-Map.png?version=431e310b4d85f698ffd0c5f51dfa2213\n\nParasite is like Baron, except it evolves through 3 stages at certain times. The higher the stage, the tougher it is to beat but you get a greater reward for beating it.\n\nThere was an interesting rune/mastery system called perks. The nice thing was you started with a 5 loadout limit and a perk page already set up, so you weren&#039;t at an inherent disadvantage.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, you could also choose one of 4 \"roles.\" Gladiators got bonuses from farming, Tacticians got bonuses for playing as a support, Hunters got bonuses for jungling and Predators got bonuse from killing players.\n\nSome DotA 2 players are carrying on the legacy with Spiritgate, a mod that turns DotA 2 into a Dawngate clone.\n\nDawngate would&#039;ve been an awesome competitor in the MOBA scene. Whether or not you played it, you would&#039;ve benefited from its existence.\n\n**Tldr:** Dawngate was awesome because it had a bunch of unique ideas. If it ever got out of beta, it would have forced companies like Riot and Valve to make their games better in order to compete, maybe even implementing ideas similar to Dawngate. Screw EA for shutting it down, that game had a ton of potential.","replies":[]}
