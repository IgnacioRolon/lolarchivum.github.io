I tried multiple custom games with Fnatic, Grim Reaper, and Pentakill Karthus and got the same results. Using his joke, taunt, dance, or laugh does not trigger it either, but still has the sound effects such as his book turning pages or the energy from his staff. Thanks for reading and hopefully this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-30T20:22:34.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nThanks for the awesome halo testing around his skins. ^-^ We're aware of the issue and are working on a fix.","replies":[]}]}
