How many times during World&#039;s did we see teams pick Poppy into losing match-ups, end up down 40+ cs, and yet as soon as she builds Sunfire she becomes impossible to deal with regardless of how rough her laning phase was.\r\n\r\nYou can&#039;t gank her. She can knock the entire team away, charge off, speed herself up, and slow you on top of being generally difficult to kill in the first place. You can&#039;t starve her because all she needs is one item and one good W, E, or R to shift an entire fight. Even the go-to anti &quot;wall of stats&quot; champion Trundle can&#039;t do anything to Poppy. She stuns him against his own pillar and runs away while having more presence in 5v5. He can&#039;t even touch her 1v1 with Subjugate up.\r\n\r\nShe&#039;s incredibly tanky and brings lots of crowd control along with respectable damage. She&#039;s really good at disrupting, really good at making picks, really good at disengaging, and really good at teamfighting. So how exactly is Poppy meant to be kept down? What other tanks can compete with her? The only one I can think of that comes close to bringing her level of disruption and mobility is tank Ekko.","replies":[{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2016-10-30T16:17:31.994+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":3,"body":"It is strange how building full tank on a champion reduces your ability to kill them.

Poppy has an ability that boost movespeed, so this passive is not needed. The second part of the passive deals increased damage to a single target.

Watching her build 100% defensively and still deal notable damage is frustrating, especially given even Trundle had to build a Ravenous Hydra. This fact became especially noticeable during Worlds, where her worse matchup involved playing against Trundle of all champions and she basically had to go full damage sponge. Even then, if she caught a carry then they were dead, and she had zero bonus AD ratios to accomplish it (QER damage require bonus AD). Even with the argument \"BUT THEY HAD NO RESISTANCES\", Poppy did not have Bonus AD of any kind to bolster her damage. \n\nIf Riot made it to where she only needed to buy a small amount of AD (Titanic Hydra, Cleaver, Triforce) to make up the difference, I'd be okay with it. But her itemization is way too easy for the damage she does, which warps her intended strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThat doesn't even mention how she can just ding a target into the air with her ultimate, not even needing to wind it up, with almost no time for her opponent to react. Poppy's ultimate is powerful and the whole point of the wind-up is to broadcast that she is about to cast it.
