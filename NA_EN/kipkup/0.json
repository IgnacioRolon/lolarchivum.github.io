I was playing just fine yesterday but today I join a ranked lobby as my first game of the day and I cant connect. Last time I had to do a FULL repair and i lost 20LP. \nI have been playing just fine for months now since it happened the first time. It just keeps prompting me to \"RECONNECT\" but never does. \nI. AM. PISSED! \nAnd once again I'm going to lose 20LP for something I cannot control and that I had NO idea it was going to happen. \nHow can i prevent this from happening again?\n\n\n//I never leave my games, or dodge either. \n\nedit;; I did a full restore (AGAIN) and it is allowing me to join games. Am I really going to have to do a full restore after every damn patch?","replies":[{"poster":"Kipkup","date":"2017-04-30T19:15:29.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I will if it happens again I will paste the Log. \nthank you for your help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-06T21:35:57.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like the specific issue might be with your connection failing to reach the game server, so a reinstall wouldn't really resolve this.
