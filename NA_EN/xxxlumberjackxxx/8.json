Pretty much every melee has this in the form of a shield, resistance boost, % damage reduction, immunity, or something else. Yasuo is actually bizarre in that his only effects specific abilities, rather than damage in general. For a melee, Yasuo has very little control over his own defenses. This is where the tug of war comes from.\n\nYasuo's wind wall also has a 26 second cooldown at level one and he's never going to max it first. That's 22 seconds of down time.\n\nTo put that in perspective, most forms of ranged crowd control have 10-14 second cooldowns depending on rank.. So it's pretty easy to use the first one to bait the wall, then just engage when it's back up.\n\nI literally don't even play Yasuo; I hate playing squishy divers. More than that he's one of the hardest MU's for one of my favorite champions, Twisted Fate. Despite that I can recognize the strength of his design and have an idea how to play around him. So while I don't always win my lanes against him I do always enjoy them, and always that my deaths in said lane are due to my own errors / the Yasuo players straight up outplaying me.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThe \"Press W to remove interaction\" is fine because of the cooldown, and the fact that you can navigate around it. Yasuo's W does not remove interaction in the way that point-and-click hard CC does, or point and click poke. Simply walking away is an easy and viable option. Live to fight another day, or 10 seconds later when your abilities are back up and he's without his primary defensive method.\n","replies":[{"poster":"ZapMyHeart","date":"2018-03-04T23:06:39.987+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MorganFreemanBot,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cOawGWPb,comment-id=000000020000000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-04T22:56:17.995+0000)\n>\n> Windwall is Yasuo&#x27;s only controllable defensive measure.\n> \n> Melee having the ability to press a button and heavily negate damage is..

It's pretty minor in comparison and usually is in a form of some skillshot or has range restriction.\n\nDespite it being partially uncontrollable, Yasuo does have a shield on top of this (that makes support shields weep in despair), making him harder to take out (pressing R instantly gives him a shield). \n\nKeep in mind, regardless of his higher skill cooldown, any semi-decent Yasuo is going to hold it off until they need to press W. Same as ranged crowd control. Once you blow it out, it's out. They are usually skillshots as well, taking at least a little skill to land it. Whereas Yasuo's is spam W to use. Just because ranged CC has less CD doesn't mean you get to reuse it twice in one battle majority of the time, considering most fights are done and over <10 seconds.  Therefore, his \"high cooldown\" is pretty negligible for how powerful it is. \n\nPersonally, I don't have an issue fighting against Yasuo (I play Annie and wreck his face all day). However, Yasuo players should admit that their champion has a toxic skill that needs to be addressed, rather than whine about how martyred they are. Considering that he was created by Certaintly, they need to strip a few aspects of kit to make it more in line with the other champions' kit. Fix the W issue and then add power into the rest of his kit to make him feel better to play against as well as play.

But design ideaology wise, he&#x27;s the best Riot has by leaps and bounds.\n\nIf you are talking about melee champions, don't bring in ranged CC's cooldown into the subject matter. Frankly, this is a balance of a champion against 100+. You cannot simply say, \"He's melee, so let's only compare him to melee when we want to do balance stuff\". Sorry, but that's not going to work. Or else there wouldn't be so many complaints about ADC vs melee. \n\nIt's not healthy to have something that is uncounterable in itself when you have that tug of war. His W counters all projectiles without any given thought. Shields can be broken. Skillshots can be dodged (or outright facetanked). What exactly counters his W outside baiting it out (not going to happen) or pray your champion's kit doesn't have a projectile (good luck in casual/Blind)? \n\n------\nCertainlyT, that you? He's probably one of the worst designers Rito has. Every time he comes up with something by himself, it's usually things that are unbalanceable and unfun to play against. Have him collaborate with others and he does well. By himself, he's a nut. \n\nDesign perspective is one thing, however, real time play is what dictates how well this perspective is implemented. Ideas are just that. Ideas. But when it comes into fruition and turns out to be a nightmare, then you can't exactly say it was healthy to begin with. There has to be a line drawn between ideal and reality and unfortunately, this designer has shown us that he is unable to scale back. If you have to strip back \"extra effects\", then it wasn't healthy to begin with. There's no use arguing about it because it shouldn't have been brought to the table to begin with. And by that same breath, because you have to strip back these things, he is not the best designer. \n\nA designer needs to know how to not only look at the champion kit to create something unique, but at the same time, allow it to flourish and fall with the rest of the champion pool. His designs removes those \"falls\" with failsafes in the kit, allowing them only flourish. And that is where the problem is. Other champions don't have these failsafes as well, which makes them fall under those who do more easily. \n\nThe designer is bad for League because of his design philosphy. He is better off working for DotA because it is there where his designs will shine and not be complained about.","replies":[{"poster":"CaliCoastReplay","date":"2018-03-05T01:04:09.863+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me, it isn't Yasuo's Wind Wall that kills interactivity.

And those that do, have weaker values than Yasuo's. And also cost resource (mana). Yasuo has it for free. Why even complain? Especially when R instantly gives it back.\n\n\nStill more than what squishies get. Again, cooldown is negligible when fights end less than 10 seconds, especially when the cooldown isn't that high anyways. Try a minute+ and then get back to me. \n\nAlso, A. Sol.\n\nPeople don't arbitrarily let Yasuo get close. Yasuo's E turns your own minions against you. As well, as additional means in his kit to do so. And there is nothing you can do to stop it. Unless you sit in your base. Especially with his long range (900 units), highly spammy 3rd Q -> R (even longer range) that instantly teleports him to you as well. Add in the free shield refresh and makes any armor you bought pretty much nil, please tell me more how we let him get too close.","replies":[{"poster":"Elitezealot2797","date":"2018-03-07T12:55:18.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"okay but literally the whole point they're trying to make is once he W's BACK OFF. wait it out. then try again when his stuff is on cd and yours isn't.
