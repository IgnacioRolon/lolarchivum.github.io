I don't mean with a support.  I mean with something absurd like support {{champion:161}} , {{champion:101}}, AP {{champion:117}}   or even {{champion:99}} .  Ali can't do anything if he's out of headbutt range other than spam his heal, so you need to do more damage than he can fix.  Get a nuker and some mana pots and poke him and his adc out of lane again and again and again.  Just ward and watch your positioning so you don't get caught by the enemy jungler.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-07-03T23:17:52.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As ADC.

Between E and targons they will always have more hp, unless teh adc just isn't trading.\nThresh isn't really ranged, if he goes in for AA harass hell get harassed back and ali will heal it. \nLeona braum? Ali counters at least one of them super hard, and his adc will poke you and every trade theyll win due to crazy sustain that you can't beat.","replies":[]}]}]}
