Summoner's rift, they give you a random champion and then once you get into the game the shop only has a few items and you have to build only those items lol. I'd play a game mode like that, would be more fun then most of the modes on the rotating game mode and it would also force people to play different champions/builds so the game won't have the same champions in every game like every other mode.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-11-19T23:01:59.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a custom game type where people go to the site and it selects for them a random champion they own, random summoner spells, and a random item build which much be built in that order.
