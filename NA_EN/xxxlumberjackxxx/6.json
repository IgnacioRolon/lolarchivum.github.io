Your adc wants you to have 'lane presence' yet still wants a full rotation of spells from you when they get caught out or start a fight they shouldn't. And they NEVER look at your mana before making a decision.\n\nOr you're the adc and your support creates no presence with his positioning OR spells and you're left using spells too often to fend off the enemy team. Also last hitting with just autos is harder to get good at on the east coast. :(\n\nThe issue with most of the champions you listed is that until/unless you buy a sapphire crystal their mana pool is miniscule. 400g shouldn't nearly double your mana pool ever, let alone at lvl 5 and % base mana regen obviously does little to nothing early on. Sadly there's no flat regen support item, hence we're stuck taking mana regen runes.\n\nA few specifics: Thresh OOMs from throwing hooks decently often. Cho OOMs period, even after catalyst it's incredibly easy. Alistar I agree with the person below about his heal, don't spam that for you or your adc. Yeah I need to stop trying to harass with Q as Kayle. Sion only gets by mana wise because he almost always starts flask.

We're not talking Soraka's Wish, or Nidalee's ~~bullshit~~ heal, or anything else like that, because those are single-target heals.\n\nAlistar's heal is ludicrous because it heals _every single ally nearby you_ for the same amount, and can be spammed as long as enemies are dying near him. This makes it invaluable for minion pushes; you can get a whole cannon wave up to a turret at full health with Alistar, making the turret drop very quickly. It's also fantastic during the mid-late game because you can keep your allies constantly healed as you fight for objectives. \n\nIf you level E first on Ali, you're not playing him right.

When they can kill you with 40% of their mana pool in 3 seconds and you can't kill them with 130% of your mana pool (thanks to say a crystalline flask) over 15 seconds something seems a bit off. It's even worse when you try to do something like lane vs Gnar. You have to use mana to farm from a distance or else you just die for nothing. If you use it REALLY well you can delay your death for a while but still die and not even pressure the Gnar. Most likely you just back early and lose cs and xp and he gets even harder to deal with. Meanwhile Gnar is spamming his boomerang every 11 seconds at lvl 1 alone and gets REWARDED for it. By champion lvl 5 it's a 8.25 second cd and just keeps dropping until it's 4 seconds at lvl 16. And no, it's not that hard to catch the boomerang.","replies":[{"poster":"ElJanitorFrank","date":"2015-06-11T03:34:59.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me restate; WHILE SOME OF THOSE CHAMPIONS CLEARLY HAVE SERIOUS ISSUES many of the champions he listed are easy to manage mana on.\n\nThe only reason you would go oom on them is if you spam them constantly.\n\nAnd that's the point of having mana in the first place, stopping champions from spamming contantly.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2015-06-11T20:39:43.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me restate: I never said they all have serious mana issues. I said I OOMed on them without spamming spells. Returning (or not) to base often is a HUGE factor in mana, especially early on.\n\nI think everyone agrees that if my spell has a 10 second cd and I cast it every 10 seconds I'm spamming it. But what if my spell has a 10 second cd and I cast it every 30 seconds? How fast should a champion OOM on average by casting their costliest ability 1/3 as often as possible? And obviously the answer is very different at lvls 1-3 than it is at lvls 10-13. It depends on builds, on which champion, ect. Personally I don't consider casting 1.5 spells a minion wave on average to be spamming in most cases (except maybe the first 2-3 waves, depends on champion a lot). The problem is some champions can cast 3 a wave no problem, others can barely cast 1. And the impact of those spells isn't so different that that ends up still being fair most of the time.\n\n\"And that's the point of having mana in the first place, stopping champions from spamming contantly.\"\n\nIf that's true then why can some champions spam oppressive spells constantly while others can barely cast stuff that rarely even hits the opponent? Sometimes the answer is simply poor balancing. But often times it's other stuff, like that some champions are late game champions and have to suffer sucking early on to scale into the late game really well.\n\nThe problem with late game champions is that for a huge amount of players you can't realistically play for the late game right now. Games are shorter than they were last season (which I like) and you can't rely on your team mates to not feed the enemy. At most ranks below Diamond (and often even at Diamond and above) games are just decided way too early these days to have champions that take a long time to get going. Some champions (like new Ryze) suck really early on but stop sucking fast enough that they work out. Others though take so long to get going that even amongst pros no one is able to make them work often enough for it to be worth picking them.\n\ntl;dr % base mana regen very strongly pushes mana issue champions into being late game champions. Games are currently not long enough for most of those to ever shine though. Things aren't horribly unplayable for the most part but they're still pretty unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"ElJanitorFrank","date":"2015-06-11T22:02:46.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You aren't getting my point.\n\nI'm saying the vast majority of the champions listed don't even have this issue in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2015-06-12T02:42:58.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Let me restate: I never said they all have serious mana issues.

I merely stated \"Here's a list of champions I've personally run OOM on in the last two months alone while NOT just spamming spells.\" There are many cases where it's reasonable to run out of mana on champions who don't need any change from Riot in regards to their mana without 'spamming.' I see it in LCS games, I see it in my own Silver games, I see it non ranked games. Some of the champions I listed DO need a change in my opinion, but my first post in this thread wasn't about that.\n\nThe point is that Riot DOES use mana gating which is in contrast to the original post of this entire thread which states \"Which is probably why riot doesn't use it anymore...\" while referring to mana gating.
