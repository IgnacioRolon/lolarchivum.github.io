(I know everyone says that...)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hey guys! I was a douchebag one game and it resulted in me getting banned for 14 days!\r\n\r\nI agree I was being really childish and toxic this game, I normally never write these kind of things - which is why I find this ban to be a bit unfair.\r\nI have played this game for 5 years with probably over 5000 games of league of legends if not more.\r\n\r\nWhen you play as many league games as I have you are going to have a lot of bad games, where you are doing terrible or when you are getting flamed by your whole team. These kind of things will get you frustrated (unless you are a perfect kid raised by Mr.Rogers across the street). This frustration must get out in some way, it is not healthy to keep your anger inside of yourself. I never flame anyone unless I get provoked by them. If I get flamed by someone trying to provoke me I usually mute them but this game I thought his/her complaints were a little too much. I will explain the scenario:\r\n\r\nI was playing mid lane, my jungler was getting invaded so I go to help my jungler survive and get his/her red buff. This defense of his jungle takes quite some time, I would say 3-4 minutes. After we are finished in the jungle I notice how my enemy laner got back to mid lane before me. No one is talking in chat and we just start laning like nothing happened. Once their enemy mid laner hits lvl 6 she kills me.\r\n\r\nThis is where the flame starts. My jungler says something like &quot;anivia takes my mid and is 40cs behind and dies 1v1 reported noob&quot;. Me helping my jungler in the jungle for 4 minutes resulted in me being behind in farm and experience. This is when I strike. I will copy paste my chat log from this point on:\r\n\r\n**(I die here)**\r\nMy jungler (Evelynn): anivia takes my mid and is 40cs behind and dies 1v1 reported noob\r\nMe: no summs mid\r\nMe: come again eve?\r\nMe: who the fuck do you think you are to come insult me after I helped you for 4 minutes in the jungle\r\n**(I wrote the sentence above because I felt really backstabbed when she started flaming me when I had helped her in the jungle for 4 minutes which had resulted in me losing my lane)**\r\n\r\nSivir: shut up anivia.\r\nMe: shut the fuck up sivir **&lt;- (Instead of Sivir telling Evelynn to shut up she tells me to shut up when Evelynn was the only one flaming at this point in the game)**\r\nMe: i am not going to let someone flame me\r\nMe: stfu sivir\r\nMe: go blow your duo off **&lt;- (Very childish by me, but I got really frustrated that she was telling me to shut up instead of Evelynn which made me believe they were duo)**\r\nMe: i helped you at your red\r\nMe: retard &lt;- **(Childish)**\r\nMe: 2 kills there\r\nMe: but eve is sad\r\nMe: :P\r\n**&lt;Sivir writes something here, don&#039;t really remember what but it is flame)**\r\nMe: sivir dont write to me plz\r\n\r\n\r\n**&lt;They complain about me playing badly when I haven&#039;t written anything for a long time&gt;**\r\nMe: ofc i dont\r\nMe: im tilt as fuck\r\nMe: because of this eve\r\n**&lt;They flame me&gt;**\r\nMe: stfu\r\nMe: if you help your jungler for 4 minutes then you die 1v1 to the enemy mid laner\r\nMe: and your jungler complains that u are 40 cs behind and died 1v1\r\nMe: THEN when u try to argue back the bot lane says: stfu anivia, stop typing\r\nMe: it would make u pretty angry, wouldnt it?\r\nMe: huh?\r\nMe: you dont complain over eve\r\nMe: you just complain over me\r\n\r\n**&lt;They start complaining over me when I have been quiet for a long time&gt;**\r\n**&lt;They tell me what to do by spamming pings&gt;**\r\nMe: can u be quiet?\r\nMe: just let me play myself\r\nMe: stop backseat gaming me\r\nMe: 28:52\r\nMe: can you stfu?\r\n\r\n**&lt;All chat&gt;\r\nMe: report bot lane and jungle please\r\nMe: I help jungle for 4 minutes\r\nMe: and he flames me when i am behind in cs and die 1v1 to ahri\r\nMe: and then bot lane flames me\r\nMe: when i tell eve to stfu\r\nEnemies: Who is flaming in bot lane?\r\nMe: both\r\n&lt;/All chat&gt;**\r\n\r\nMe: u getting rylai rumble?\r\nRumble: Yes\r\nMe: oh\r\nMe: u are\r\nMe: good\r\nRumble tells the flamers to stop flaming and I tell him that I have muted them by now! **(I guess I didn&#039;t mute them in time though..)**\r\nMe: muted them now\r\nMe: 2852\r\nMe: drag\r\nMe: fuck\r\nMe: fuck\r\nMe: lmao, why did ahri run **(This was the enemy ahri and I wrote this in my team chat)**\r\nMe: gj\r\nMe: gj\r\nMe: 50s baron\r\nMe: 10s baron\r\nMe: get homguard\r\nMe: get crab\r\nMe: at drag\r\nMe: 48:27 drag\r\n**&lt;All chat&gt;\r\nMe: gg wp\r\nMe: please report bot lane and eve\r\nMe: for flaming\r\nMe: zz\r\n&lt;/All chat&gt;**\r\nMe: rly wp guys\r\n\r\n**We won the game.**\r\n\r\nI understand a lot of you are going to say: _&quot;You totally deserved this ban!&quot;_\r\nBut if you had seen the game from my perspective you would probably not have said this.\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to say with this long rant thread is that this ban system doesn&#039;t take in mind what actually happened in this game, and certainly doesn&#039;t take in mind my sportsmanlike behavior in my other 99,99% of my 5000+ games. I understand that this game I was being very childish and very rude. But the thing is that they provoked me into this behavior. I never wrote anything bad to them without them provoking me. I would love to get the whole chat log from Riot as I only got my part of the chatlog for some reason? I really hope the Riot employee who banned me didn&#039;t only read my messages but also my teammate&#039;s messages. Because when I get a 14 day ban for being toxic in one game out of 5000+ games I feel like I am being wrongfully banned.\r\n\r\n(I know Riot can do whatever they want to with my account, they can ban me for no reason because I accepted their terms and agreement) But as a customer and player who has loved this game for 5 years I feel like I could have gotten some more information on this ban. I feel like I have been banned just because of this game, I feel like they didn&#039;t really understand why I got this angry.\r\n\r\nIn order to successfully get rid of the toxicity in this game we need to strike the source of the toxicity. I am not the source of league toxicity, I am just a guy who got super provoked one game and tried to get his anger out at the guys provoking me.\r\n\r\nI hope no one thinks I am angry at them,I am not angry at anyone I just think the current system behind these 14 day bans is pretty bad and I would also want more clarity on my ban.\r\n\r\nWas it only because of this game?\r\nDid the rioter who banned me read through my allies chat as well?\r\nDid the rioter look at my other games to determine if I was just having a bad day/game?\r\n\r\nThank you for reading through my rant. Please do not comment if you have not read through the whole thing. I will try to bring more clarity to things that I have missed in the post in the comments below. Feel free to ask anything.\r\n\r\nLove\r\nTrizze","replies":[]}
