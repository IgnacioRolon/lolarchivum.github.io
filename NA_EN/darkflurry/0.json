I play League and suddenly when I start another match after champion select the server won't connect and therefore it won't load the game and I get punished by the leave buster. I played today a few games and the server worked properly, and so as I tried to play another ranked game and it failed to launch.  I tried to relaunch to reconnect to keep myself from getting banned and I get banned anyway due to the server no connecting me. My connection is working properly, and so is my computer. The help and support are full of incompetent robots. So I'm doomed to getting banned. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Fallen2Rise","date":"2017-08-10T21:12:04.511+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do know you're supposed to fill out a ticket for this kind of thing right?\nI hope you know they can tell when you are lying!\nlastly it isn't their fault if  you  are playing with bad internet or play off of wifi.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-10T21:58:34.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're having issues getting connected to the game once you're in champion select, it sounds like your network has some problems when it's trying to get a solid link with our game servers.
