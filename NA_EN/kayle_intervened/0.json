[Straw Poll link]","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","embed":{"description":null,"url":"http://strawpoll.me/4432146","image":null},"up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"So I'm picking up a kitten from a shelter later this week. His current name is Kovu, definitely not a bad name but I'm not committing until I can decide on a name. I've spent a little while compiling names, mostly folk/mythology heroes which is where I typically go to for names.\r\n\r\nSome details about the kitten: It's a male. It's a domestic shorthair (aka mutt). It's got a white stomach+legs paws and gray with a little bit of a tabby pattern on it's back and top of it's head.\r\n\r\nI will be bookmarking this thread and bumping, please share and get as many votes around as possible. Any upvotes on names suggested in replies will be counted as votes in the strawpoll but I may or may not go with THE most upvoted name but it will probably come down to the three highest since most of the names are on equal footing for me. I absolutely will pick a name not on this list if I really like it, if it's a name with history behind it, let me know, that gets bonus points.","replies":[]}
