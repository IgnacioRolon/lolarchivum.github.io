To my surprise I lost 10lp for dodging a normal earlier.  I agree that the time punishment should increase for dodging 2 games within a 10hr period but normal dodge then a ranked dodge should trigger a -3lp loss not a 10.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T23:48:25.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lp gains and losses aren't fixed, so it makes sense that they would vary slightly. I can't say for sure, but it would kind of make sense to me for consecutive dodges to start taking more and more LP. \n\nYou should hit up our game team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to get their opinion on how exactly those LP adjustments are calculated.","replies":[]}]}
