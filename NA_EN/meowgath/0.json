Well, while I was playing my first game after 8.7, I felt something was off. \r\n\r\nA friend and I did some investigation on this and found out that none of the aura items have their auras increased according to his size. As a result, his auto-attack range at max size (which is 200) is still further than the aura radius (which is about 175). Even with Lulu&#039;s ult the aura radius still remains the same.\r\n\r\nMaybe this change has intentionally not been implemented yet, so maybe a Rioter can clarify this for me?\r\nThank you in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2018-04-12T04:00:21.517+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":0,"body":"That seems quite odd.

In fact, even Lulu's ult aura goes down the drain if Cho uses an Elixir or Iron.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Silverjust","date":"2018-04-11T20:55:28.807+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"wtf","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Blue Rajah","date":"2018-04-12T02:30:57.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should post this in report a bug","replies":[]}]}
