Sometimes drops to 80 but thats still high. Before it was 41-44 max. Nothing has changed in router settings i literally just switched PCs. I installed Windows 10 and my fps were capped at 60 so i turned off dvr in xbox app like someone suggested and it worked. Could it be something similar to fix high ping?","replies":[{"poster":"Noob Saibot 11","date":"2017-05-14T06:14:02.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I added lol to the firewall excepitons which wasnt done automatically somehow and now i dont know if that was the problem but ping is constantly 41-44.

You may need to readjust your network settings for your new rig, but also make sure that you have the most up to date version of Windows.  Once that's out of the way, you'll want to run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune things up.  Test it in a custom game first to be sure, though!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noob Saibot 11","date":"2017-05-13T20:00:29.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I changed something about how updates work, disabled location and something else i dont remember.
