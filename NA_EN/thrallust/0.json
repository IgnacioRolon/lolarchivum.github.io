Everything up to entering Summoner's Rift works/sounds fine. Once I enter the map the sound becomes distorted (like buzzing) and my computer will eventually crash and require a restart. Updating all drivers and a fresh reinstall of Lol haven't helped. \nEvery other game I play works fine.\nHelp please\n\nEdit- It looks like I fixed the problem using the instructions here  http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/2x7Qphng-game-crash\nI had initially just removed the xbox app which did nothing. It seemed to fix the problem once I disabled the game bar thing in the registry. How annoying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"daxtorXx","date":"2016-09-16T01:23:48.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have an similar problem.
