Does anyone know the formal way to contact the people we're interested in? Do pro players have managers who deal with these things?

A lot of them will have a PR contact's name(be it manager, owner, or otherwise) who you can contact for details. They might also have a 'contact us' page with more details.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Privately","date":"2015-02-24T00:21:24.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a great response to OP's question. \nThere is also info@riotgames.com :)\n\nMileage may vary by each request, so no guarantees!","replies":[{"poster":"NM6JVPXR1L","date":"2015-02-24T04:09:26.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot S,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=9jw38QLP,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-02-24T00:21:24.765+0000)\n>\n> This is a great response to OP's question. \n> There is also info@riotgames.com :)\n> \n> Mileage may vary by each request, so no guarantees!\n\nhave you seen riot evil viz around? i have not seen him since sept!! could you ask around for me? he was web specialist. pleaassseeeeeee???","replies":[]}]}]}]}
