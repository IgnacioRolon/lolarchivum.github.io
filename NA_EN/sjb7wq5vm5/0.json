Not what I thought it was.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings League of Legends Staff!\r\n\r\nI recently created a new account and put some RP points on it and I bought about 240 tokens and eventually got the Border and Icon for Nightbringer Yasuo, and I didn't realize that the border ONLY worked on Nightbringer Yasuo, I thought it was just a border available to you if you had that and it would be seen on every champion, not just Yasuo with that specific skin.\r\n\r\nSo, I want to kindly ask the League of Legends Staff if I could get a refund on it, I have 3 available refunds on my account and I would like to use one of them to refund this to make it fairer than just asking for a simple refund.\r\n\r\nUnless I'm mistaken and it's just bugging out, and I can't see the border (I'm still not 100% sure about it), I would like a refund.\r\n\r\nKindly, \r\nOne of your loyal players.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-16T03:24:06.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to say there's a pretty good chance that we could make that happen, especially since you do still have your refund tokens.
