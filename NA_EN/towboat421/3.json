Her visual design is very striking though and the jokes regarding he looking like a hodgepodge of skins hold some merit, with her design both not doing enough to catch the viewers eye and too much with choice of colors on her specifically regarding her white hair and green attire it just clashes a lot and a small edit some one made to change to blackish brown made her look a lot more feasible.\n\nEdit: I would like to remind everyone regarding {{champion:145}}, the critisism regarding her wasnt about her having her tiddies out it was regarding the fact that she walked out the void with a skin tight body suit like shes ready for a day at the beach without a scar on her immaculate makeup and hair.

I think they just chalk it up to natural beauty and she's not scarred because she has full armor, including a helmet. The suit has been on her for years, almost her whole life in there. She's corrupted though. Listen closely when she uses E to speed up and turn invisible, she's panting because she's channeling whatever void corruption she has. She's in a similar situation as Kassadin, it's only prolonged. Most of it is mental though. \n\nShe's supposed to look normal to show how good of a hunter she is to get out of there just fine.

If only she didn't have a horrifying color story.\n\nI think people are overstating how \"bad\" or \"generic\" Kayle's redesign is. She IS wearing armor, but they lightened the armor up to indicate that she's not that tanky, which is sensible. The biggest sin of this decision was that in-game the armor reads more like a body suit, but that doesn't mean she's NOT wearing armor. Even beyond that, she kept the basic elements of her old design (armored, helmeted angel smiting her foes with a fiery sword) and I like the added effect of her design evolution throughout an individual game. I like the added wings as she becomes stronger. I liked old Kayle design, but I think new Kayle is good, too. \n\nI love Yuumi's VO, I just think Yuumi in general is a design that doesn't appeal to everyone. Like most designs in this game. With Yuumi in particular, you either like her design, or you think its generic. You can argue that she's \"just a cat\" all you like, but you can do that for a lot of characters. {{champion:34}} \"She's just a bird\" {{champion:1}} \"She's just a little girl with powers\" {{champion:10}} \"She's just an armored angel\" (old OR new). Some people are going to love those designs, and others are going to think they are generic. The fact is, I've never seen a cat that uses a book as part of its power set, and Yuumi's lore even helped expand a bit of Runeterra's lore as a whole. So I think overall she was a fine addition.\n\nSame could be said for Sylas. Its easy enough to boil down his design to \"shirtless dude with chains\" but the chains themselves are the stars here, as they are the main part of his kit and the main part of his lore. He's a Demacian that no longer wants to associate with the establishment, so he appropriately only has the Demacian-like chains, and nothing else. He isn't heavily armored, he isn't going to be wearing any Demacian colors or symbols other than the ones he is stuck with (the chains). I can't explain the shirtlessness though. He also has this really cruel laugh and really cruel smile to match, something that contributes to his now cruel personality. His design is fine.\n\nYou forgot to mention Mordekaiser, whose new design drew inspiration from Gothic architecture and is a great update to the old Morde look. I think he's definitely a good design.\n\nSo, imo we have disappointing {{champion:145}} fine {{champion:350}} {{champion:517}} {{champion:10}} and really good {{champion:82}} {{champion:518}} {{champion:555}} .

Its a good thing visual design is not the only thing going for a Champion, since I think Jhin, Taliyah and Ivern all get their core appeal more from their personality or gameplay, while having a design that's well suited for that personality or gameplay.
