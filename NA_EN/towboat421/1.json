It appears to be up to date but as the 1920X1080 resolution has some problems both in the client and in game, the minimap in game has extremely small icons and the client itself seems to be in a lower resolution than normal, I have tried running without the DSi  but it does not resolve the issue. Any idea whats wrong response would be nice it is difficult to know whats wrong with my laptop at the moment when playing this particular game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T18:59:34.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Display issues can be caused by a number of different factors, but problematic graphics are the most likely cause here.

For the in game the map has terribly small icons and makes it near impossible to read also everything is scaled oddly. All my drivers are up to date but I can't understand why the game refuses to scale correctly. everything is set to 1920*1080.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-27T15:29:08.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha, thanks for giving me that additional context.
