{"poster":"The Iceborn","date":"2018-12-19T15:59:52.233+0000","title":"Ashe: Warmother Comic Nr. 1 Feedback and Character Discussion (spoiler alert)","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"####**_~~Intro~~_**\nSo I was one of those who preodered the comic on Comicology and this will be my honest feedback to everyone involved! This issue contained extra material for everyone who payed and got the premium edition from either comicology or marvel.\n#**_~~Discussion~~_**\n\n##Ashe\nAshe is not yet a true Iceborn!\nShe must first wield a True Ice weapon first,which she tried and failed due to the unimaginable cold radiating from these Weapons..She must also prove herself in battle to be finally named Iceborn..\nHer character is seemingly confused not fully grown to fill her mothers ruthless footsteps, she must learn and experience in order to truly become a Warmother.. Something tells me that she will never be the character that her Mother is, nevertheless she will undoubtedly have to toughen up for that role so she can finally lead her weak Tribe back to greatness! Lastly Ashe had 2 siblings but they both died as Babys and only Ashe lived.\n- Her character is very well shown, as she is not quite the Iceborn yet but truly struggles to become one as soon as possible (next comic?)\n\n##Grena (Ashes Mother)\nGrena is quite a tough cookie to say the least, she has her eye set on Avarosas Myth and her Throne (where her Bow probably lies).. She is very merciless as she did fight her own Sister for the leadership position, or rather to strengthen it! Grena won,meaning she can further pursue her agenda of finding Avarosas Throne. She also wants to ensure her agenda even if it means by lying about their Ancestry? (Remember Swains quote : ,,She claimed it was the Frost Queen's grave. They believed her.\")\n- I liked her character, she is as tough as the Freljord itself\n\n##Helnr (Grenas Sister)\nWe dont find out much about her, what we know is that she is the leader of the Hearthbound BUT she is an Iceborn which is very odd because you would think that a Warmblood (non Iceborn/Human) would lead the Hearthbound.. She wields a sword of Truce Ice and thats how we know she is not a Warmblood. We also know that Helnr is not liking Grenas obsession with Avarosas Myth and she probably doesnt like that Grena is spreading her own version of truth and thats why she challenged Grena to a duel\n- Her story was short but it gave us enough insight to know that even in one tribe there is dispute\n\n##Maalcrom\nIs the Tribes Frost Priest, meaning he can heal and strengthen others.\nMaalcrom mentioned an Iceborn prayer to Ashe, he said it was a prayer from Lissandra (no doubt it is lol). In their essence, they act as Lissandras spies (I would imagine only a few know Lissandras true form and he probably doesnt due to his age). We know that only high ranking Frostguard allies know Lissandra for the Ice Witch she is. Interestingly enough  I wouldve imagined older man that are experienced witht the craft to be frost priests but maybe he is still learning?\n- Fascinating story, very intriguing character who is yet to show his full potential I feel like\n\n##Yrael\nIs Ashes mothers husband, one out of five.. He is most likely Ashes dad but nobody can truly tell.\nAppears to be somewhat brainwashed by Grenas Avarosa-obsession aswell as being tied to what she says as the Leader.. So man have no say in the Freljord it appears, especially when we look at the Winters Claw and the Frostguard, women lead.\n- Shallow character, not much to say about him\n\n##Lissandra\nShe is truly a fascinating individual..\nAs Odin said, we learned about her in a very indirect way but we learned enough for now! Lissandra has her spies planted in plain sight, disguised as nothing but good Priests who are there only to serve her..  We now know how she pushed her Agenda of the Religion and belief in the Three Sisters, it is the Draklorn  who do it (high ranking priests). The Draklorn push her will onto villagers and tribes people across Freljord.. They are brutal and will execute Lissandras will at all cost.. My Question is, are they the evil minions form Vaynes story? Probably.. We learn that the Three sisters are praised as Goddesses. The Tribes dont know Lissandras true from and they all still do believe the Frostguard and their Leader Lissandra to be peaceful Servants,so all of them honor Lissandra. Remember Lissandra the ice witch took the form of the Frostguards leader. Odin,if youre reading this, I would LOVE to her the Iceborn prayer because Ashe only talks about the first and the last line..\n- Im LOVING the way Liss was portrayed in the very background and it is incredibly striking\n\n#####**_~~Final Thoughts~~_**\nThis is the first comic the next one will continue Ashe story with the title DRAKLORN!\nThe only negative I have is that I wished there would be more Extra material for the paid Version, I wanted more something was still missing. I was very excited about this the writing was perfectly executed and we found out everything we needed to for the first comic. The Art is very nice so big thank you to Nina Vakueva on doing the story justice!! Odin Shafer wrote this and I it was all I imagined it would be, great attention to detail,precise expansion on our knowledge and great implementation of Detail (how an Iceborn becomes, True Ice danger, further explaination of other Tribes and their skills and so much more!)","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-12-19T17:42:08.681+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}]\n> Odin,if youre reading this, I would LOVE to her the Iceborn prayer because Ashe only talks about the first and the last line..\n> - Im LOVING the way Liss was portrayed in the very background and it is incredibly striking\n\n\"The Ice is not Pain.

However I think this is opportunity space that should absolutely be explored deeper, as is I've only really seen Freljord men buying into the culuture and its framing.  Where are the Ronin in this context?  Where are the Freljord men who do see themselves as greater and abandon the preconceived notions of their culture?  They may be looked down upon, but the fact a loner could survive in the Freljord with an attitude that rejects the homogeneous culture would in itself be a symbol of resilience.  Could be good space for a champion or some other character of importance.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-12-20T02:54:21.848+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:79}}","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2018-12-20T13:31:17.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mind -> blown","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-12-20T15:37:04.643+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Eh, I don’t buy it.  While a fearless warrior eager to die fighting might be the ideal Freljordian man, like the chivalrous knight, that ideal may be quite distant from reality.  \n\nFirst, the instinct self-preservation is so strong that armies have historically struggled to persuade troops to fight in close combat, especially such melee as encounters in the Freljord.  Their work-arounds have generally involved effectively appealing to that instinct, usually by punishing desertion in the face of the enemy with the very death that any soldier might seek to avoid by fleeing a battle.\n\nSecond, while the ideal Freljordian man might be a fearsome fighter, one who did consider tactics and strategy would be even more fearsome.  He might have to pretend otherwise to avoid dishonor, but ultimately, he would win against a suicidally ‘brave’ opponent by outsmarting him.  Simple tactics like feints, flanks, ambushes, and false retreats would be enough.\n\nUnless everyone else were completely unwilling to hear his ideas, they would quietly set questions of code aside to win any important-enough battle.  A man with social standing to protect might name a lower-ranking tactician to issue his plans, but their ultimate origin would be known.

Looking at characters like Braum and Olaf, being \"manly\" is about jumping into danger, being brave in the face of almost certain death, never hesitating out of fear, charging into battle without concern for your own safety, and ultimately protecting your family at all costs.   \n> \n> That's hard truth to live with and a hard path to choose-- but the Freljord is a very hard place to survive so it requires this harsh commitment. \n> \n> So I was looking for an honor system that by accepts and embraces the notion \"I must die.\"  Obviously I took elements of the common \"berserker\" myths  (my name is Odin after all) but I combined them with elements of Bushido-- particularly as defined by Hagakure** to humanised the honor system and make it more ideologically realistic.   (Berserks exist in myth, but we don't actually know very much about what the real people who did this thought or believed.-- so borrowing from a similar death obsessed warrior ideology felt right) \n> \n> Now...\n> If we figure being a man in the Freljord is to knowing your role is to **die**-- before you become a burden on your family, and ideally to die in a fight that protects your family or ensures your children will have a better life than you did.   That philosophy is in conflict with a raw primal truth -- i.e. none of us want to die. \n> \n> You are a warrior.  You know facing your own death is best way for your children and tribe to survive...  But instinctively and subconsciously, you don't want to die.   \n> So one way of dealing with that conflict is to avoid the temptation of cunning or strategy.  (As Bushido is sometimes prone to suggest).  I.e. if you were to lead a battle, if you were to plan the attack, you will be tempted to protect your own life.  --And that would show an unforgivable moral weakness -- you would be betraying your honor and family-- by even considering your own life has having more value than them.  \n> \n> Thus for most Freljordian men it is better not to be tempted and not to have a plan. Let the women and weak-bodied priests worry about who lives and dies, let them worry about supplies and politics.  \n>  Instead as man you must live in the moment, you must be ready to protect your family, and you must be eager for a worthy death. \n> \n>  (***i.e.  Harakkure quotes:    \"In the words of the ancients, one should make his decision within the space of seven breaths. It is a matter of being determined and having the spirit to break through to the other side.\"   -Or-  \"Matters of great concern should be treated lightly.\" Master Ittei commented, \"Matters of small concern should be treated seriously.\"   -Or- Even if one's head were to be suddenly cut off, he should be able to do one more action with certainty. With martial valor, if one becomes like a revengeful ghost and shows great determination, though his head is cut off, he should not die. )\n\nThat is some nice addition and I will definitely keep this in mind when reading the incoming stories..\nIt sure makes sense when you think about it!\nYour engagement on the boards is definitely appreciated :))","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2018-12-19T19:30:41.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Odin can i ask for some thoughts on true ice weapons, are they untouchable except to the iceborn, like touching dry ice, and can it melt under any circumstance like say Brand decided he wanted one, how were the Freljord smiths able to shape them into weapons","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-12-19T20:16:27.823+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The exact interaction of different primal magics is probably what you would expect.  \n\nThink of True Ice as a powerful multiplier.

Turning the true ice into a weapon focuses that power.

Is he born superhuman?\n\nI mean, he's performed feats like cutting a bloody swath through a battlefield.  Considering that those people are trained soldiers and probably more jacked than the standard man now a days, Darius doing that is an incredible and terrifying feat.  Most people might be able to kill 3 at max before they die if their lucky, while Darius mows through them.  Then we've seen him treck his way through the Freljord after losing a lot of his men in a fruitless campaign ordered by the last Noxian emperor.  He would have been fighting and killing men and women iceborns, probably multiple within the same battle.  Finally, a pack of wolves could simply sense that challenging him meant instant death.  Imagine a artic wolf, multiply it by the feljord, and then realize what it would take to be strong enough to scare them with an aura (what regular people even have auras?).\n\nSo ya, Darius might not be Magical, but he has some other innate power that he might not even be aware of himself.  Calling him a superhuman feels pretty accurate.  I think He'd probably be one of the people the ancient shuriman's allowed to enter assension since he is probably one of the few who could survive it.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-12-20T15:49:31.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So is he Runeterra’s Guts, or is he some naturally born Captain America?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2018-12-19T21:34:14.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I also ask about some of the polygamy in the Freljord, I understand a Warmother can have multiple Oathfathers and I guess vice versa, but could a Warmother also multiple wives as well, same with men","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-12-20T03:18:59.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Marriage and other oaths are ultimately about children in the freljord.
