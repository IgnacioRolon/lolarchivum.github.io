I know i should contact actual support on this but I cant log into the support page without the password, my account was already logged in on this board page so this is my only option. If any support employee can find a way to help me I will be really grateful.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-29T21:38:59.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, we can help!
