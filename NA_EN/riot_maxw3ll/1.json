Riot Maxw3ll here with my first Red Post of all time. I joined the Champions team about six months ago after seven-ish years’ experience in the industry. I’ve worked at a couple places, most recently being Blizzard, and had a background focusing on Collectible Card Games. \r\n\r\nSo, as a show of good faith, I figured my first act as a Champion Designer should be that of removing some old RNG from the game. I’ve got some Blitzcrank changes I’ve been working on that I’d love to get some feedback from y’all on. These should be pushed to PBE later today.\r\nJust a disclaimer up front: I’m not planning on shipping these changes to live with 9.7. I want to get a temperature read on these changes in PBE to make sure we’re heading in the right direction with Blitz before we pull any triggers.\r\n\r\n**Goals:**\r\n1. Make the Passive more consistent and not discouraging you to cast spells.\r\n2. Reduce frustration around Blitz’s ult passive and widen its uses in team fights.\r\n\r\n**Passive: Mana Barrier**\r\nShield Strength: 50% of current mana -> 30% of Max Mana\r\n\r\n**Ultimate: Static Field**\r\n~~Passive: When Static Field is active while in combat, Blitzcrank randomly shocks a nearby enemy every 2.5 seconds~~ (removed)\r\nNew Passive: While Static Field is active, lightning charges Blitzcrank’s fists, marking enemies he attacks. After 1 second, marked enemies take 50/100/150 + 30%AP magic damage.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, a second auto attack will not refresh the mark, nor interrupt it. If you attack again during the mark, nothing extra happens, and if you attack after the mark, you’ll apply a new one. Blitz can mark any number of targets, limited by his access to them and his attack speed.\r\n\r\nAgain, just as fair warning, I don’t expect to ship these changes this patch, but I will be listening and responding to feedback where I can.","replies":[{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2019-03-15T16:35:12.540+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":4,"body":"Very good changes Dan, his static field RNG was super outdated","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2019-03-15T16:35:05.005+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"Seems pretty great, would have loved to see something done with his current W though, or just his mana costs in general.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Maxw3ll","date":"2019-03-15T16:37:48.154+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rathar Dashing,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=A8F8ArAw,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-03-15T16:35:05.005+0000)\n>\n> Seems pretty great, would have loved to see something done with his current W though, or just his mana costs in general.\n\nI had a couple stabs at his W, but the ability was adding a lot of strategy to how Blitz wanted to approach fights.

Rather its your ADC/you or the enemy, once a hook lands it's basically the start of a large series of events. It's not like Thresh hook which you MIGHT take, you might not. Blitz hook is a go-button and landing it means shits about to go down. \n\nAdding a mana refund seems fairly pointless in that situation. Especially given how strong the ability is inherently.

A lot of the depth of learning to play Blitz at higher levels is playing a push your luck game with trying to get the most damage out of your ult passive before using the nuke.\n\n2. The shock can be applied as many times as there are targets, but you can't stack multiple shocks on the same target. IE, attacking a minion three times in 1 second will only apply the first shock, but as soon as that shock happens, blitz can apply another.\n\n3. No range. If they're marked, they get shocked.\n\nThank you!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Boltonator","date":"2019-03-15T16:27:41.686+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":10,"body":"Oh wow!\n\nJust expressing my sudden interest in Blitzcrank now and I get downvoted for it, lol.\n\nCrazy community I tell ya...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scrandor","date":"2019-03-15T21:26:05.106+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"hey! i'm Scrandor, i've been challenger for 3 seasons now and for the first two of the seasons i was a blitz otp. i'm usually (also currently) the highest elo blitz player (in NA at least)\n\nfor the shield changes, i _think_ it's a good change because i think the majority of the time it pops i'm under 60% mana (although i'm not sure). While I'm not sure on the numbers, I agree with the philosophy here, trading off survivability just for using skills does feel rather odd.\n\nthe ult changes are of concern to me though. in a comment you mentioned you were thinking of being able to 'queue' an extra charge which i think is almost necessary to keep his strength similar to live.\ncurrently the bread+butter combo is hook+auto(unless you can one-shot)+e+(get as many procs of r off while running beside them (you only auto during this time if, after autoing, you would still be in range to E them) waiting for e cd to come back)+r when they're as low as possible without killing (to get max procs without taking kills)\ntying his ult passive to his autos is a little worrying as it doesn't seem to mesh well with the playstyle (usually it's much better to use your time pathing while waiting for E CD rather than autoing)\ni do think it really does have the potential to be good though, it just seems awkward in its current iteration. the queuing charges is a REALLY good idea and is probably one of two suggestions i would make.\nthe other concern i have is surrounding the numbers. i don't exactly understand the ap ratio increase. i think blitz is well-defined as a support character who has main functions in utility and tankiness. almost every game i finish with 0 ap (other than baron and the adaptive force rune (which might even go to AD, though i'm unsure) so i would make a bid for the base numbers to be slightly higher with a lower (or even non-existent) ap ratio. the only AP support item that is even slightly good for Blitz is shurelya's, but I would never want that over the other support items (zekes, knights, locket, etc.)\nthis take, however, obviously comes from my personal ideal that Blitz should not be built AP (in accordance with the support role, generally)\n\nall of this said, it's important to address that i have vested interest in blitzcrank being strong and therefore am speaking from some place of bias.\nas well, my personal opinion is that blitz is in a great spot right now, so i'm also speaking from a place of fear that he will become worse.\nthanks! overall really happy that blitz is getting focus and i think the changes have strong potential :D\ni'm really open to having conversation about my thoughts as they aren't perfectly fleshed out atm, as well as clarifying anything i've said that might need expansion!","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordRedStone Nr1","date":"2019-03-15T16:58:50.149+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Those changes sound really promising, I look forward to trying them out on the PBE!\nThis integrates his W more in his basic rotation (more AS for more marks) and makes his ult hits less random while preserving the core functionality.\nReducing the hit damage is fine imo, as you get to proc it more reliable and possibly more often. I like the increased AP Ratio though ;)\n\n{{sticker:katarina-love}} \n\nSwitching the passive to max Mana is definitely the right call, but is it possible that we can also get the cooldown reduced with level?\nMaybe 105/90/75/60 on levels 1/6/11/16 or something along these lines?\n\nFinally, for future red posts, I encourage you to look at this [Boards Markup Guide](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/mouP6um4-boards-usage-guide-part-1-boards-markup).

I believe the rune 'Unflinching' should work for his overheat on W (not sure if tenacity/slow-resistance in general do not work for self-applied slows, but i think they should) \n2. There is one bug that makes you listen to the Blitzcrank Mana Barrier passive after death for the entire game, which can be a very big slightly annoying :)\n3. Grabbing Ezreal in his E-animation sometimes hinders Blitzcrank from moving and pulls him towards Ezreal, which provides me with joy, especially under the opposing turret \n\nAlso I had some recommendations for Blitzcrank changes:\n1. His mana cost on W of 75 seems pretty high especially in early level, would prefer a scaling 50/55/60/65/70 to make it viable\n2. His base mana is very low \n3. Since Blitzcrank might be the easiest champion to counter in the league and is put into an obnoxious matchup every single game, i would have liked to see a small mana refund of maybe 20-50 mana on his grab on hit; As not hitting your skillshot should make you cry for your loss of resource, hitting should at least give you some sort of reward. Some match-ups turn high-risk/high-reward into 'go roam there is nothing to get' on botlane.  \n4. A silence of 0.5 seconds on his ultimate active is quite short, i would also like to see it scale maybe even up to 1 second just to make sure that it is not possible to flash before getting knocked up after a grab through tenacity\n5. Also his overdrive (W) seems to be decaying too quickly after the duration has been decreased somewhen in the past. This could also be changed slightly.\n\nMost of the changes were recommended due to his Mana Barrier being almost completely irrelevant in early laning phase. I dont think any of these would overbuff the champion in lower ranking but would make him more viable in higher ranking. \n\nMy comments on your changes: \n\n- Make the Passive more consistent and not discouraging you to cast spells.\nI agree\nMost of my recommendations are mana related and address this issue.\n\n- Reduce frustration around Blitz’s ult passive and widen its uses in team fights.\nI disagree\nThis idea just seems to be removing some kind of mechanic. Knowing your passive could hit minions should just make you avoid fighting inside of minions (moving wisely). I dont agree with making the champion easier than it is. I would rather like to see changes to the champion, that make him more viable in higher elo. Also this seems to be buffing his damage, while i think his damage is fine if we are not comparing with Tahm Kench :) \nTo widen its uses in team fights, i simply recommend increasing the silence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AIQ","date":"2019-03-15T16:37:35.756+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":7,"body":"So it's an on hit thing with a 1 second gate? \nDoes this apply to abilities too?

Thanks for chiming in!\n\nOne thing I wanted to solve was not force players to have to weigh casting their spells against their main defensive output. It's possible that I'm wrong, of course, but I found that the overall feeling of getting a smaller shield for missing a hook was kicking someone when they were down almost. The positioning game we ask Blitz players to play in lane is a fairly fun pattern, and since Blitz is so mana gated, I didn't want to take away actions Blitz players could take just to maximize his shield.  Happy to talk more about it; I'd recommend playing a game or two on it.\n\nI didn't add in any R flash mechanic, but I can put some thought into it.

That said, a bit of feedback on areas where I'm seeing potential concerns.\n\nOne concern here is that there was always been a gimmick of AP-burst Blitzcrank, and I worry about this increasing that by adding another *reliable* damage proc in laning, since you can now be sure that burst lands where you want it to -- and keep it up once per second.\n\nIt also synergizes oddly with Blitzcrank's unusual attack speed boost, as attacking faster is meaningless to the effect unless you happen to be within easy melee range of *multiple* targets (which is strong for farming, but Blitzcrank is traditionally not a solo laner or farmer), especially since he already has an auto-attack reset if he needs it. At any point did you consider whether or not power could be cut from Blitzcrank's attack speed boost to give him something that fits a bit more into this pattern?

Furthermore the AP ratio just doesnt make sense since he just isnt played as a mage at all and would take a lot more for people realistically to buy AP items on him. I truely think you could make the static field passive less frustrating if you just would take the current itteration of the passive and focus on prioritization of the ability.\n\nSome personal thoughts to what i think that could benefit blitzcrank are:\n\nChanging the mana cost of his hook to 75 at all levels, in comparison to other champions with hooks it just feels really bad starting the game with 263 mana and a hook costing 100 at all levels, a different itteration of this change would be to keep it 100 and refund 50% of the mana if it actually hits a target, in that way your atleast rewarding being skillfull at the champion and giving the enemies room to capitalize if he does fail it.\n\nHis W also costs 75 at all levels with just feels quite high if ur trying to go for a W into Q it costs currently 175 mana, and in the early game that is litterally about half your mana pool. The numbers overall just feel outdated in comparison to other champions that go for their hook combo it is far less punishing in terms of their mana pool and mana costs. i think making his W cost 50 and scale it to 75 at lvl 5 would be fine.\n\nAlso his current mana pool seems quite low for a champion that has a passive that relies on his mana for it to be usefull and all his spells apart from his E have really high mana costs.\n\nI hope you look into some of these options and more so will look into giving blitzcrank some quality of life changes rather then completely changing certain mechanics.","replies":[{"poster":"papi carlo","date":"2019-03-16T15:15:16.860+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"God bless you Ashkan.

Changing it to scale off maximum mana removes this strategic dynamic between playmaking in teamfights.\n\nHaving an uncontrollable but longer ranged sunfire cape is part of his identity (seriously has anyone tried to build one a tezla coil from scratch?).  It assists his farming for toplane, and also uses procs from the relic shield when played support, something that most supports tend to struggle with between taking more damaging poke and their carry killing minions first.  Turning it into yet another auto-attack on-hit effect feels lazy, and contradictory given what was stated about why the shield is getting changed, now encouraging players to never use his ultimate so he can rotate between marking multiple champions. \n\nIf anything was to be changed, I'd do it like this; \nI'd rather his rocket grab be altered to be thrown from and at an angle to match his animation, this would spread his skill floor and ceiling as nearly everyone is used to skillshots being just a straight line projected from their champion.  Can't be that difficult to implement given diana &amp; victor have existed for years.\nAnd lower the movement speed penalty of underdrive on his W, this would give him plenty more reliability without outright adding more gimmicky damage. \nAnd increase the cooldown of his ultimate a bit at max rank, I liked the scaling up usefulness buff he got some time back, but with 45% cooldown reduction it's basically on a 10 second cooldown late game, rather strong for an instant AOE.  I'd thinks fair to nerf if the overdrive buff I previously suggested was in place.\n\nIf your post's changes are going to be forced live anyway (I'm cynical since kogmaw was the only reverted rework when others were rebuked worse).

The Q costing 25%-33% of his entire level 1 mana pool goes a long way to that, so that should definitely not be changed. \n\nAs a reminder - Thresh gets a FLAT 3 second CD refund on landing his hook even if it hits a minion etc. while also giving his ally potential mobility (whereas Blitz hook has a shorter wind up and drags you all the way to Blitz' cast location, not trying to say the abilities are 1:1.) \nBeyond that, to what end \"rewarding *not* using the hook\" is best left up to more creative designers.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"lJayFromTheBayl","date":"2019-03-16T18:09:34.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yet still no fiddlesticks buff. update and change the same champs over and over and over.","replies":[{"poster":"Miss Ally","date":"2019-03-17T05:58:58.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=lJayFromTheBayl,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=A8F8ArAw,comment-id=005c,timestamp=2019-03-16T18:09:34.373+0000)\n>\n> Yet still no fiddlesticks buff. update and change the same champs over and over and over.\n\nUh you get changes all the time like in patches 8.15, 8.9, 8.4, 8.3, 8.2, etc...

As a support champion the damage output is not one of the issues that make him less reliable/viable in higher ranking. \n\nThank you for reading feedback. \nI would also like to see what you think of my recommendations below.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Duffers","date":"2019-03-15T23:08:33.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any chance you can also buff his attack speed or attack animation speed so its just enough so he can use Auto E Auto to kill wards like Leona without having to use W early always annoying when a ward lives on 1 hp because his auto attack is so slow early game.","replies":[{"poster":"Miss Ally","date":"2019-03-15T23:13:58.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Duffers,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=A8F8ArAw,comment-id=003b0002,timestamp=2019-03-15T23:08:33.316+0000)\n>\n> Any chance you can also buff his attack speed or attack animation speed so its just enough so he can Auto E Auto wards like Leona without having to use W early always annoying when a ward lives on 1 hp because his auto attack is so slow early game.\n\nLeo has to use abilities to clear wards also.","replies":[{"poster":"Duffers","date":"2019-03-16T00:27:10.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why I said Auto E Auto for Blitz so it would be the same as Auto Q Auto for Leona just Blitz has to use W early to be able to do it due to his attack animations on autos and his E being so slow despite them having the base same attack speed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
