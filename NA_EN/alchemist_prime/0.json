So I&#039;m going to try my best and hand draw (Yes I&#039;m seriously doing it by hand) and its going to take a while. I&#039;ll post it here to show how you guys how far along I&#039;m going. \nEverything is a WIP until I say so.\n\nhttp://pre07.deviantart.net/9095/th/pre/f/2016/229/e/2/runeterra_base_by_strikerprime27-dae7xw4.png\n[](http://pre07.deviantart.net/9095/th/pre/f/2016/229/e/2/runeterra_base_by_strikerprime27-dae7xw4.png)\n\nThis is the base for the Map so far... I want to make this as detailed as possible and its going to be a challenge. I have have split the map into 4 quadrants So I can detail it much better. Also...Thinking of Making the Blue Flame Islands a bit bigger and shifting it more to the right...\n\nMountain Concepts: IronSpike, Tempest Flats, The Great Barrier, and Mt.

I've put in a lot of thought on where everything is and also using logic:\nhttp://img11.deviantart.net/86fe/i/2016/229/7/f/landmark_locations_by_strikerprime27-dae89or.jpg\n[](http://img11.deviantart.net/86fe/i/2016/229/7/f/landmark_locations_by_strikerprime27-dae89or.jpg)\n\n[Tu ~7:00 ish AM]I am using this specific sheet as my final sheet, obviously still a WIP. Each square you see is 2inX2in. Drawing Freljord hurts like hell especially since I splitted in quadrants.

I will add a 4x24 in area down straight through Valoran, giving me room to expand the Runeterra, and especially the S. Valoran on the way. This will also give me some clarity, of the divide spreading the Supercontinent in half. Expanding this will also allow me to shift Ionia a few inches south.\n\n[We 2:57 AM] Update made Ionia 35% bigger, and central Valoran larger :) here's the current map. Low quality as I don't want to use the scanner atm.\nhttp://img11.deviantart.net/e12a/i/2016/229/8/a/expanded_runeterra_map_by_strikerprime27-daec9bd.jpg\n[](http://img11.deviantart.net/e12a/i/2016/229/8/a/expanded_runeterra_map_by_strikerprime27-daec9bd.jpg)\nHere's relative size, and that's a large notebook.\nhttp://img09.deviantart.net/2974/i/2016/229/9/5/map_size_by_strikerprime27-daecajm.jpg\n[](http://img09.deviantart.net/2974/i/2016/229/9/5/map_size_by_strikerprime27-daecajm.jpg)\n\n[We 4:30 AM] I'm using this texture for the The Great Barrier which consists of Mount Targon, Tempest Flats, and Morgon Pass! Probably not that color for Mt. Targon though...\nhttp://pre08.deviantart.net/cdbf/th/pre/i/2016/230/4/5/gb_color_scheme_by_strikerprime27-daeck8h.jpg\n[](http://pre08.deviantart.net/cdbf/th/pre/i/2016/230/4/5/gb_color_scheme_by_strikerprime27-daeck8h.jpg)\n\nI'm taking a bit of a break for a bit..\n \n[Th 4:45 AM] A friend recommended I use a program to render the artwork, I'm playing around with it with some scans. Its going great!\n\n[Th 7:52 AM] Progress being made, I have most of Runeterra drawn, Ionia has its landmarks, the city of Shurima has been drawn! Need to add more stuff though... like the damn jungles, Bilgewater, and the Shadow Isles. I felt like I could have done more for Noxus though... Well most if them live in the Immortal Bastion anyway... More to come!!!\n\nhttp://img12.deviantart.net/2741/i/2016/231/4/3/runeterra_outline__1_by_strikerprime27-daehfg0.jpg\n[](http://img12.deviantart.net/2741/i/2016/231/4/3/runeterra_outline__1_by_strikerprime27-daehfg0.jpg)\n\n[Fr 6:54 AM] Sorry, a bit slow on the updates...

There are a few things I'd change, a few seas I'd add (Gangplank boasts of his conquests) and nations I'd swivel or swap around, but still - not bad.  Good work especially on the Freljord outline from the event map, though depending on your projection, it might be a little undersized.\n\nI couldn't spot Rakelstake (I was looking for a frozen lake, but I guess at this scale it's not even going to be a pixel), but saw the Howling Abyss bridge.\n\nBecause I've had this issue myself, and worked out what I believe is a tolerable solution, have you encountered 'The Serpentine Problem' yet?

The ones we know about are Valoran, Ionia, and the \"Southern Continent.\"  Valoran contains most of what we're familiar with on the top half of the map from the old \"Pancake Map\" as I call it.  The \"Southern Continent\" contains Shurima, and likely things from the southern half of the map we're familiar with.  Ionia is probably larger than it once was, and is its own continent now as well to some degree.\n\nHonestly, the biggest thing I can suggest is that you should do your own thing!\n\nDon't feel constrained by the old pancake map, and let your creative juices guide you.  Take chances, break from the established mold, and do things your own way.  Runeterra is a world, with continents, seas, and all kinds of huge geographical areas and features.  These things are your playground to do with as you please!  There are lots of hints hidden in newer lore, especially the Shurima lores, that give away how the area is put together, and you can use those to help guide you too.\n\nIn any case, I wish you the best of luck.  And remember to have fun, even when the damn Serpentine River makes you want to tear your hair out!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alchemist Prime","date":"2016-08-16T15:45:15.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok guys I must sleep... no suprises... till I wake up 10 hrs later.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alchemist Prime","date":"2016-08-16T10:39:21.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guys, I'll take a break for a couple of hours.
