Tried logging in today and found it was taking a little longer to get past the \"logging in\" message. Occasionally it would give me the \"Unknown Error; an unknown error has occurred\" message. Finally I managed to log in, but it seemed to have difficulty displaying my information and data. At first it told me I couldn't play ranked/draft as I didn't have 16 champs. Then when that finally stopped (after logging out/in and a clean uninstall/reinstall) it lets me, but it doesn't display any of my league/profile info (rank, LP, placement) or champion mastery points. Occasionally the same error pops up while in the client, and when I click it enough it goes away and the client continues functioning normally. \n\nI am slowly regaining access/seeing my data populate the right spots, but I don't know why this is happening or what could be causing it.\n\nIt might also be worth mentioning that for the last patch or two, my client has been frequently shutting down after a match finishes (so there's no post-game lobby, it just closes). I don't know if the two are related but I've probably uninstalled/reinstalled a few times over the past couple of months attempting to correct the issue.

Let me try to help explain a bit:  The errors in your client seem to be due to some sort of odd connection issue.  Your computer needs to establish a connection with our PvP.net Servers (the client) in order to ask for all of the info to be populated.  However, this connection either doesn't exist or is unstable, so the info is not popping up.  As for the post-game lobby, this doesn't appear because your connection to PvP.net (the client) while you were in-game was \"lost\" so it doesn't pop back up again.\n\nTo get this resolved, make sure that you complete all of the steps found in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).  There are quite a bit of steps there, but they are all crucial in hopefully resolving this issue.\n\nFeel free to reply back if you are still getting these issues!","replies":[]}]}
