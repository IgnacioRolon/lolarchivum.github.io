I am tired of getting one shot by Zoe mains and tired of 600 move speed from W passive. I would like that Riot would do another hard nerf to Zoe in her Q CD, W move speed and damage, and E sleep duration by a bit. Then if thats not enough to bring her down just remove her from the game please, make Zoe be the first champion to ever be deleted.\r\n\r\nPS: For all the Zoe mains this is just my opinion don't take offence just speaking my mind on how brainless and OP your champ is :D","replies":[]}
