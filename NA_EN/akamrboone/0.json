If I mess something up, please inform me. I like to be as corect as you'd like me to be. :3)\n\n     Born the daughter of Pelic, an astute elementalist, and his wife Mila, Miranda had shown at even a young age to possess an almost shamanist affinity to the natural elements. Living in relative seclusion in a long forgotten swath of land along the Great Barrier Miranda grew up assisting her father in his research on how to heal the lands still scared by the Rune Wars. \n\n     Pelic taught his daughter much of the arts of magic, swordplay and of the elements. It was not long before Miranda’s born talent and natural skill rivaled her father’s experience and discipline.  As her powers manifested she subconsciously grew a strong bond with the world of Runeterra as well as knack for fighting. It was also during this time that Miranda saw firsthand just how much of a devastating impact The past Rune Wars had left on the land.\n\n     Pelic finally obliged his daughter’s eagerness to join him in the field. One night, less than a week after her sixteenth birthday, Miranda and Pelic set off on a short expedition into the southlands.  As she walked with her father through the ravaged lands she found herself often hearing the wind cry in sorrow and feeling the Earth beneath her feet shift in anger. The misery and pain of wars past scratched at her mind as she walked with her father, who himself remained relatively at peace.\n\n     Throughout the entire adventure Miranda focused hard on keeping herself composed, and even attempted to communicate with the elements in order to ease their pain. But the elements would find no rest in Miranda’s voice, and she ultimately drew the conclusion that these lands were just broken beyond any sort of hope. Miranda never wished to enter the lands south of the Border again, and to this day she never has.\n\n     For nine years Miranda trained becoming stronger with each day. After her father’s recent mysterious disappearance while trying to find a location called The Undergrove, an area he claimed to have discovered near the border or Urtistan and the Shurima Desert where the elements have shown signs of regrowth, Miranda begins to fear the worst.  With only fractions of her father’s research and no maps to rely on Miranda makes her way to the Institute of War in the hope of finding the assistance needed to locate the Grove, find her father, and finish his research.\n\n     Upon arriving, Miranda’s talents as an elementalist as well as the value of her father’s study were instantly appreciated by the council. They extend to her an offer to fight in the League as an independent affiliate in exchange for a bed and limited access to the Institute’s archives. With little to no say in the matter, Miranda was reequipped to Fight on the fields of Justice in the hopes of one day finishing her father’s research.\n\n* ** Just a quick rundown of Miranda’s physical description.**\n\n     About 1.75 meters (5’8ish”) and 26 years of age.  Deep green eyes and black hair that drapes down below her shoulder line. She is very active, being a fighter and all, so she has a bit of a thinner frame with some muscle under her skin. Not a gratuitous bust (like most champions. -_-) and no cleavage in her outfit, or at least very little. She’s pretty, modest, a bit quiet and extremely powerful. :D\n \n      She wears heavy leather / light plate into combat complete with a bunch of little straps and studs and rivets and whatnots. Her hands and head are exposed. Her blade is a crystal blue colored sword that is inlaid with silver runes around the base; each one represents an element. When she is in an empowerment, the associated rune will shine brightly and hue of the blade will change.

The character concept is incredibly original and the mechanics are different from every other champion currently within the League.
