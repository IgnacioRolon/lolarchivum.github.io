While we can't take away that loss, since the other teammates were still affected by you leaving the match, we definitely need to address why your client was crashing before you queue up for anymore ranked matches to make sure you don't get any more of those penalties.\n\nIt sounds like there was some kind of bad interaction between your pc and the client files, so I'd suggest doing a quick repair and testing it in a custom or practice game to make sure everything is running smoothly now.","replies":[{"poster":"Shifue Draven","date":"2017-07-21T04:56:52.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol nice try but it's you guys this has been this way across two computers and i have done multiple repairs with your hex tool.  This randomly happens trying to play. Everything on my pc is update as well before you say that so are you going to give me a real solution or bs more? It's bad enough being kicked in the face with this match making among other issues but the client has way to many issues for all so lets talk REAL solutions not oh it's you.\n\nBTW the team was not affected by me it was affected cause YOUR client locked up and I could not pick losing promos in champ select is unacceptable.","replies":[]}]}]}
