If you&#039;re in the middle of a fight and kill the target with your passive on them you get a stack right? Well say the enemy jungler comes in and you fight them. Your passive isn&#039;t on cooldown, but you can&#039;t mark them since you&#039;re in the middle of the fight. I think that it&#039;s necessary to make her passive to where it can also be activated with a key. This may make it harder or easier to mark champions in teamfights. Just little thing I thought I might say. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-09-16T05:05:05.975+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mark of the Kindred is actually deliberately locked out while Kindred's in combat. That's because we want Mark of the Kindred to be something you engage with strategically, picking targets to hunt ahead of time, rather than something you put on a target you think will die during the current fight. For that reason there's also a delay between selecting a target and being able to collect on the mark (so that marking something right before you engage on them a second later isn't the optimal play).","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-09-16T11:56:23.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When selecting a target for Mark, is it limited to the enemy that can be seen?\n\nMy question really is thus: It says Mark shows the enemy, can it be used on the jungler to give everyone vision of him?
