Bard already has a beard and he resembles Santas classic look in the first place, but it would need a few touch ups here and there. Also, the meeps would be given a green skin resembling elves. As for the abilities, his Q (Cosmic Binding) would be wrapping paper or a bow. If it stuns then  the stunned target will appear to have a bow wrapped around them. His W (Caretakers Shrine) would be milk and cookies on a plate and his chimes would be Christmas presents, or vice versa.  His E (Magical Journey) would likely stay the same except a wreath would appear at the front of the gate. As for his R (Tempered Fate) it could either remain the same, freeze targets in a snowstorm, or wrap everyone in wrapping paper.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr FreakinSmarts","date":"2015-03-24T00:08:45.356+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wrong time of the year bud.","replies":[{"poster":"64539310_DEL","date":"2015-03-25T19:53:26.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dr FreakinSmarts,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=TRjrj5Y3,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-03-24T00:08:45.356+0000)\n>\n> Wrong time of the year bud.\n\nThat's why I said, \"In the making.\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-24T00:06:07.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.
