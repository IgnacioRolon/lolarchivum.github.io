I hope you take this into concideration \r\nRiot and thankyou for this amazing game its rated 11/10 for me lol","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-05-22T21:42:48.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then you may as well effectively remove both, and start upping the IP price of champions and skins considerably.\n\nRemember that a lot of income comes from skin sales, and you'd effectively be saying you can now get whatever you want for free with enough time.

Current the divide is that cosmetics are monetary purchases only (if you want a specific one), and occasional rewards otherwise (through crafting and chests). Making every available through IP means that the most frequent players -- often people who buy a lot of content -- can now use their huge IP reserves to buy all the content they want for free.\n\nIt's a potentially sizeable cut to Riot's income, unless you can find a solution to that problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Veig√†r","date":"2017-05-22T22:34:17.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is right on - I know people with 150k IP sitting in the bank wasting away.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KCC SHAD0W","date":"2017-05-22T22:32:45.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they could just raise the score of making ip into rp and rp into ip","replies":[]}]}
