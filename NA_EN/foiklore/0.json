Press Restart to restart your PC, which can sometimes fix the problem. You can also press 'Advanced Options' to try other options to repair your PC.\"\n\nHowever, after restarting it goes to \"Diagnosing Your PC\" then later goes to \"Updating your system\" and THEN it messes up at about 73% and says \"Error C0000022 applying update operation 122043 of 142219 (\\Regi...) \n\nHow do you fix this?\n\nThis happened a few months after installing League, so my mother made me uninstall, but I installed again and our computer started doing it again. So after uninstalling for the 2nd time, our computer has been working fine (it has been at least a month since I've uninstalled.)\n\nSo was **_League the problem_**? Does it need too much space that it can mess up our computer?\n\nI've been wanting to play again but I'm not sure if it'll mess up our computer again, the desktop is HP Pavilion Desktop.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-06T20:43:05.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea this sounds like some type of failing driver or another component rather than a problem with League itself. I'd recommend doing some general pc troubleshooting, you might want to try restoring to a recent stable build of windows.
