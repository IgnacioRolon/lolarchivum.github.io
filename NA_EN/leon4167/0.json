I'm just starting to wonder if there's something wrong with the severs and not just my internet. Or if I'm just getting unlucky but still I've never had these problems so badly until just a few days ago and it hasn't gotten better. I've turned my all us my devices that use Wifi off as well as trying to connect to the Ethernet and turning all the graphic settings to the lowest they go and still I have problems. Every game my MS is good and fine for a few minutes then starts spiking up and down randomly to as high as 5000 then just drops as suddenly as it rose. And I'm not the only one who has had this problem lately. Lots of other players I play with have it worse as disconnecting twice or thrice a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-01T22:08:18.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to find any record of issues with the NA servers, but I have noticed a trend of ISP routing issues lately.
