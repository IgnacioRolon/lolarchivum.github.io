Riot Support Just Doesn't Care","url":"https://imgur.com/a/FxhaLPg","image":"https://i.imgur.com/BYlcRRM.jpg?fb"},"up_votes":29,"down_votes":35,"body":"Just had a talk with two Riot supports, the first one, I was checking on the status of my chat restriction. I was told to wait it out and I said that is perfectly fine. I go to eat, come back and my account is randomly suspended. Hop into another Live Support and this is the conversation that ensues. My main problem with this chat is that the Rioter kept ignoring my questions (about if players reported me) and just seemed to not care or even want to listen. This was way too subjective to be a fair punishment.\n\nBtw, one of the supports has the name Kaitlyn Trapkween which breaks the name terms (Just because you're not offended by a name, doesn't mean it's not offensive. References, puns, and wordplay are great, but if they're attempts at sneaking some offensive language, we'll flag it. If we change your name and you don't think it was offensive, let us know and we'll talk.) because its references drugs, but they're a Rioter so its okay.","replies":[]}
