Clear your camps, gank a lane or two if you can, maybe get an objective like Dragon or scuttle if you haven&#x27;t already. By then you should have passed the needed 3 minutes.\n\nKayn is a champion who gains the majority of his power from his transformation. Assuming that the game runs for 30 minutes, this is 10% more of the game where his powerspike is being delayed.  That is particularly severe, and this increases more as most games generally tend to be shorter over time.\n\nFurthermore, your suggestion is rather poor.  Do you believe a Kayn player would remain in fountain for 3 minutes? O_o  I question the severity of your advice, as it is something which would already be occurring.","replies":[{"poster":"Icy Hot Shoto","date":"2018-07-17T12:49:31.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're sitting around waiting for the timer to hit, then yeah I would imagine you're doing nothing but staring at the timer.

If you can manage that every game, and your team is just so behind that you can't wait an extra 4 minutes... might need to question what you and/or your team has been doing.\n\nAnd thank you Vyniadus, I don't play Kayn so I wasn't aware it was actually 4 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Bears Dont Care","date":"2018-07-18T23:20:09.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gakupo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LIEd6EJ2,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-07-17T12:49:31.735+0000)\n>\n> If you&#x27;re sitting around waiting for the timer to hit, then yeah I would imagine you&#x27;re doing nothing but staring at the timer.\n\nWhich no one is doing so why even make this statement dude?\n\n >If the Kayn is good, he can survive the 4 minutes to transform into Raast/Shadow Assassin while getting work done that he would&#x27;ve done even if he transfomed.\n\n\nWhich has absolutely no relevancy to what I stated. Your solution is literally \"Keep doing what you've been doing while waiting 4minutes.\"  That isn't at all productiveand is hardly a suggestion.\n\n> \n> Heck, it doesn&#x27;t even take that long TO transform in the first place, the quickest I could find in the jungle was about 6 minutes, 40 seconds. If you can manage that every game, and your team is just so behind that you can&#x27;t wait an extra 4 minutes... might need to question what you and/or your team has been doing.\n\nOkay aaaand again, this doesn't address anything that I have stated.\nMy statement \"I think it would be good if Kayn can choose his transformation rather than wait an extra 4 minutes for a transformation he would possess anyway.\"\n\nYour statement \"Well you earn your transformation in X, and you should be doing Y while you wait the 4 minutes.\"  This doesn't address the concern at all, it is literally dancing around the actual subject at hand.  SO I can't really refute something that is literally summarized as\n\n\"Do what you've been doing already.\"\n\nLike... if you had said \"It doesn't really hurt Kayn to wait an extra 4 minutes.\" that would be a bit more substantial.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Vyniadus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LIEd6EJ2,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-07-17T00:36:28.096+0000)\n>\n> Why is there all this talk about 3 minutes, the lockout duration is 4 minutes?

His powerspike would remain the same, it would merely be a QoL change.\nMind you, this wouldn't buff Kayn, it would merely be providing him what he will achieve anyway.  \nIt was also introduced at one point on the PBE but Riot never went through with it for some reason.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vyntrius","date":"2018-07-17T00:36:28.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is there all this talk about 3 minutes, the lockout duration is 4 minutes?
