Also you have to his play style, he doesn't play to win the lane, he plays to win the game, which is so much more important. Even Bjergsen, right after his arrival in NA, commented on how much he improved by playing against Hai, in comparison to all the mid in EU.\n\nFurthermore, most people would agree that Cloud9, with Hai as Captain, changed NA for the better by allowing it to finally be able to compete internationally, and forced the other teams to actually step up their game and play decent league of legends to even be able to compete in their own region. That's why when you say Strategic play in NA,  people instantly think about C9.\n\nSure, his condition kinda forced him to retire earlier then he would like, but again its his call, and i believe that if he managed to make great shotcall up until now, this one should be no different.\n\nBut eh, i guess for you, his latest K/D is all that matter :^),  such a nice fan!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aych Pii","date":"2015-05-13T14:14:58.746+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"You've got to remember that he was their shotcaller, so while his mid lane play wasn't exceptional he was still an important part of the team.","replies":[{"poster":"Hinro Honato","date":"2015-05-13T15:31:26.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"poohmandu was the shotcaller for skt t1k also if I remember correctly and while not quite as bad c9 was going the same way as them last season.

He will in turn steal from your jungle to make up for lost creeps, and the situation will be laner taking jg creeps, jg taking lane creeps, which results in the same amount of gold being taken off the map, with less of it going to your team because of lost potential +bonus gold from jg killing jg creeps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2015-05-13T17:32:00.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are bigger problems if I am playing on a team with a jungler with devourer than making sure he gets Dragon and Scuttler.
