Riven seems a lot more brute strength to me, while Yasuo is more about technique.  The way Riven's sword is built, I feel like it's more for wide, sweeping attacks on a battle field against multiple opponents.  This would also make it easy for Yasuo to block her standard attacks with his shoulder armor.  (This next part is not backed by any real research) Yasuo, being more samurai like, would excel in duels and 1v1s, which is what this match would be.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2016-08-22T14:38:23.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really wouldn't try to make sense of the usefulness of the weapons the characters use.

We are given no indication of their relative prowess to each other. Only that they're very good amongst their peers. \n\nThough since you mentioned samurai and duels I'm gonna give a true story. \n\nWhen Japan was more or less forced to open their borders to British it was apparently common for duels to arise between the British sailors and various samurai. \n\nThe samurai lost so often that dueling the Brits was made illegal to preserve Japanese honor and social hierarchy. \n\nIn other words, if Riot is going to actually draw inspiration from history I wouldn't put much stock in the samurai when confronted by a more advanced empire.","replies":[{"poster":"Tattersall","date":"2016-08-22T18:03:44.870+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the history lesson (not sarcasm).

And yeah, the reason why I mentioned it at all is because of the various myths about samurai and katanas that are pretty much all bogus. \n\nNow do not take that the wrong way.  Katanas were good swords, for what they were intended to do: draw cut through lightly armored or unarmored opponents using the metallurgical processes available to Japan at the time of their creation.  \n\nBut, while they really good at that, one of the best swords at it, honestly, that's not the only quality a sword is to be judged.\n\nThe other important thing to note is, Japan (except for an embarrassing invasion of Korea and China and the Mongol invasion) really didn't go outside their borders all that much.  So the Japanese got very very good at fighting other people using the same martial art discipline as they were.  While the British had been fighting across Europe, Africa, and Asia.  They had their own art, and learned how to deal with more.  And stagnation will almost always be worse than a cornucopia of experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-08-22T20:25:17.326+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically isolationists aren't great at fighting people with worldly experience.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tattersall","date":"2016-08-22T22:08:11.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HA!

For instance the Japanese did end up defeating the far more advanced and expansive Russia and the previously mentioned Mongolian invasion.\n\nThe samurai had very little to do with it though.  In fact there is a story (possibly apocryphal but captures the mentality of the time fairly well) that when the Mongols did start their invasion of Japan, the Japanese samurai lined up before the enemy ships and started calling out their names, titles, and generally how badass they were.\n\nThe mongols laughed, and began to fire their cannons at them.\n\nIn the end both ended up being decided by the Japanese common soldiers advancing in the tactics of their enemy, and (especially for the Mongolian invasion) because the Japanese got so damn lucky with their weather it is insane.  While the Russo-Japanese War was with the heavy aid of British intelligence, and the fact that apparently the Russians decided to organize the war like a bunch of idiots.  They couldn't even organize the first wave of reinforcements right, it was just a bungle.\n\nBut as I said, this is all if Riot decides to take notes about how the world works through history.  I've made a few posts around the site that Riot really doesn't care about anything that I'm typing in that regard.  If they want to say that their samurai are the most badass warriors of all time and could cut through a Noxian war machine with one strike of their elite haxxors sharp katanas, well it's their fantasy world.  I will find that absolutely hilarious and eye-roll worthy.  But it's entirely up to them.","replies":[{"poster":"Tattersall","date":"2016-08-23T01:43:08.198+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm starting to feel bad for Japan.\nAnyway, I was going to launch into this counter-point based on some random stuff, but then I read the end of your post.
