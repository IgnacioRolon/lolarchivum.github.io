For example, the Arclight skin line was originally just Varus mixed with Kid Icarus, but then a story was created out of that skin. Now the story is that Varus and Vayne are \n\"holy avengers uplifted by a gigantic golden-tentacled god (so in his splash Vel&#039;koz is testing the faithful and Varus and Vayne are supernatural zealots that passed that test and ascended).\"\n - RIOT Kindlejack\n\nSo I think that splash arts are meant to give you that first look into a skin or champion, and it really is a great splash art that tells a tale. For example:\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4QHRGvVcAADjYq.jpg\nThis is a great splash art. Most people agree with me on that. But I feel that it&#039;s so much more than just a picture of Diana as a demon priestess. I see a person who has made a pact with a demon mask, one that gives her the power to accompish her righteous goals, but a demon nonetheless. The sigil that seems burned on to her forehead is proof of this contract, but the expression on her face seems subdued, like she knows she has to put on the mask, but also knows that she loses herself in the process.\nWhen I thought up my question, this was really the only splash that immediately came to mind, but feel free to discuss more than one splash.\n\nSo that&#039;s that. Now, what splash art (including base splashes) do you find that *you* can overanalyze? What splashes do *you* think tell a deeper story?","replies":[{"poster":"Neamean","date":"2017-03-11T05:46:23.439+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/april_fools_selfie_splash_final.jpg?itok=BcCfYqoU\n\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4hsbxlb85qU/VRqK0_slEZI/AAAAAAAAnDE/bBjnYxLhpOs/s1600/AmumuLoadScreen_8.png\n\nRight in the feel","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2017-03-11T14:32:22.702+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"_50 Shades of Pink_\n\nhttps://static.lolwallpapers.net/2016/04/5704c534e1952.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Xilixer","date":"2017-03-14T07:38:25.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"need to upvote this to 50","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Papa Andrei","date":"2017-03-11T01:47:35.807+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.leaguesplash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Creator-Viktor.jpg\n\n\nProbably this one.

That or coming to life as the book burns away.  Kindle said that someone is hunting the monsters in the book.  I say the burning of the page is what happens when one of said fiends escape.  Not necessarily that Yorick IS the main one trying to change things, but rather he just happened to walk out.  Hell, the book itself could be cursed!  Whosoever opens the book and read will inadvertently release terrible demons that have been binded and imprisoned upon the pages!\n\nBut yeah.  I don't see Yorick doing anything but having come to life and manifest from said pages. You know, unless he didn't manifest and the hunter just happened to have gotten \"sucked\" into said story world.  In which case, he's going through some crazy trip where the pages burn away as the pictures and descriptions become a reality.","replies":[{"poster":"PhoenixOfHeaven","date":"2017-03-13T20:12:01.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it's true, the way his cloak is he isn't quite moving, so it's hard to tell if he's entering it, leaving it, or just standing there. As you've figured out though, what matters is he's currently outside of the story. The story looks grim and he isn't inside it. I'm taking that as a contrast to his lore, since this splash WAS updated with his update, wasn't it? He's outside of the grim-looking area, which could easily be compared to the Shadow Isles. What matters is he has the same storybook feel as the other three skins, but only his is damaged. What the damage of it could mean could go anyway, but knowing Yorick's innate lore, I like to think he's escaped the area, and will likely return to fix it. He's either leaveing for the first time, or returning to fix it.\n\nMaybe you are right with his 'Comeing to life' thing, but either way the result is the same. He is no longer apart of this world.

Group splashes are a way to resolve bandwidth issues (if you know any illustrators that can hit our splash quality please send them our way, I think we've hired them all) and the splash discipline have tried tackling the challenge in different ways:\n\nBeast Hunter tried a dynamic composition that focused on the fantasy more than the individual skins, while Gothic Horror used a creative break with tradition to focus on the skins. Similarly the Chef group splash tried to create a composition that put equal focus on all the characters and have them interacting, while the RPG (part 2) splash was a large 'master' piece that had each individual's splash cropped and blurred from.\n\nSomething we talk about a lot is balancing product goals with artistic principles. The Beast Hunter splash actually has fantastic composition - for a painting, but doesn't work as well for showcasing the skins. The Gothic Horror splash focuses heavily on the purpose of a splash but at the cost of a more singular work of art.\n\nAlso try to remember when it comes to opinions on the art there are players who love a splash and players who don't, not everyone feels the same way!
