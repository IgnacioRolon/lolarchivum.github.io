I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s random or if it&#039;s triggered or whatever.\r\n\r\nI guess the real question is:  Is there a champ (or something) teaser/easter-egg in the game right now?

Thanks for answering.  In answer to *your* question, I can say that I don't think it's a ward, because I'm not quite sure it's *always* an Urf sound.  Anyway, if you have no idea what I'm talking about then I'm probably hearing things.  Maybe it's the activation sound of an item I don't normally use or something.  I don't know.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vhan8765","date":"2016-10-23T00:52:20.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I'm aware there aren't any new champion teasers out.\n\nIvern hasn't even been out that long, so there better not be any new champions out yet.\nThe Star Guardian skins already wrote off his existence, we don't need that much more making it seem as though we never got a new champion in the first place. :/\n\nAs for what noise you're hearing then, I haven't heard anything of the sorts; maybe you're getting some kind of sound glitch?","replies":[]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2016-10-23T00:49:50.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No... is just from the star guardian thing, so you get a \"ching\" every one and then","replies":[]}]}
