It was a very involved storyline that spanned over the 3-4 years we had the JoJ, and it involved so many other champions and events (including a big one with introducing the Dominion map, which is now removed). It really seemed like the JoJ existed solely for that one lore guy to write the backstory of how Swain becomes Grand General, in real-time. Even his Tyrant skin was introduced as part of the JoJ conclusion with him taking power over Noxus in the very last issue. \n\nHowever, it's kinda accepted that the JoJ, especially any bits involving Summoners, is no longer canon. And the new canon is that Swain is still/always been the Grand General of Noxus now.\n\nBut his main lore on his Champion page remains unchanged. Assuming only the Summoner bit doesn't exist, he still doesn't 'start' as the Grand General of Noxus. The Sion Reborn Promo page also actually keeps the whole plotline in Kalamanda/Dominion **canon** because he and {{champion:7}} directly reference how she helped him (by pretending to be {{champion:59}} in their 'fight'). Also Boram Darkwill is still mentioned to have existed, and that Swain defeating Keiran Darkwill and attaining his position through that duel is still canon.\n\nSo I'm just really confused. At this point, is only some bits of Swain's old lore kept 'canon' till Riot knows what to do? And if so, like which bits?\n\nOr no definite answer till his big VGU/revamp?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BoiseBossBear","date":"2016-06-21T04:21:12.237+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about Ahri's story, Stray Fox?

They were going to release it with the Ahri statue they made, but the statue wasn't to people's liking, so it got canned and that lore addition likely got put to the side in the process. \n\nIt's very possible that it will come back as color lore when Riot updates the Ionian lore. When that would happen is anyone's guess, but a Rioter informed me that there are a few Ionian champs that need updates since they still mention the Institute of War, her's being one of them.
