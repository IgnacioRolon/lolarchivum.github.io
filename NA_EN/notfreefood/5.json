Before we get started, I wanted to ask a question: I just finished watching Re:Zero. What did you think of the ending? \n\nhttps://s29.postimg.org/6308wdmuv/21954263.jpg = What the fuck is Re: Zero?\n\nhttps://s24.postimg.org/dtlrxaylh/34636y753ehge.jpg ...\n\nhttps://s24.postimg.org/dtlrxaylh/34636y753ehge.jpg ...\n\nhttps://s24.postimg.org/dtlrxaylh/34636y753ehge.jpg ...\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Cul143J.jpg\n\nhttps://s29.postimg.org/6308wdmuv/21954263.jpg = why???? \n\nhttps://s24.postimg.org/dtlrxaylh/34636y753ehge.jpg = you didn&#039;t read the notice? \n\nhttps://s24.postimg.org/dtlrxaylh/34636y753ehge.jpg = the correct answer was: &quot;That was an amazing final episode. I had my doubts due to people talking about the saltiness that would be inevitable, but it&#039;s nice to see the anime tied up the loose ends and I&#039;m really happy that Subaru managed to patch things up with Emilia. (Though I wish we got to see a bit more of some of the other characters for a final time *cough* Rem)\n\nDid anyone else feel that Petelgeuse&#039;s expression of love for Satellia resembled that of Subaru&#039;s for Emilia in episode 13 (the episode when he and Emilia had a fall out)\n\nSome parts did feel a bit dramatic, but all-in-all it was impactful and I was left teary eyed twice: Once while watching Subaru save Emilia and gang a final time and second time as styx helix started to play at the end because the rollercoaster ride is finally over.\n\nI honestly applaud Tappei Nagatsuki for making Subaru&#039;s personality and circumstance sink to such a low point only to make a comeback to a beautiful ending that arguably would not have been possible otherwise.\n\nDefinitely one of the best shows I&#039;ve watched in a long time and I&#039;m more than happy to give a 10/10 rating.&quot;","replies":[]}
