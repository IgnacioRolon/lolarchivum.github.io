I'd like Riot to stop ignoring Mac players &amp; playtesting as the borderless mode isn't the only issue we're having right now and it's hell to play on a Mac atm.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-02T22:51:02.997+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've had success in getting most of those lingering fullscreen/borderless Mac issues ironed out, so go ahead and hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see if they can get yours as well!

So frustrating to play on a window just small enough that if you move your mouse to the edge and click I can actually click out of LoL and start making new folders and s on my desktop.  Borderless used to be so smooth and filled the screen.  Please at least comment RITO!!!  There are like 3-4 separate threads about this issue!","replies":[{"poster":"Token Scorcher","date":"2017-07-13T16:41:29.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"calm down, Riot gave a great reply right below. just scroll down.
