You may want to try messing with your monitor's brightness or contrast settings to make it more comfortable to look at.\n\nAs for the FPS issues you're having, this may be caused by corrupt or missing files for the snowdown map specifically, but it's hard to tell without more context on the issue. Most framerate issues can be fairly easily resolved by working through the steps in our [**FPS Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting), so I'd really recommend you go through those solutions for now.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any positive change for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Queen Kazi","date":"2016-12-15T02:48:14.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having FPS issues as well which I partially attributed to the death of my cpu fan but after replacing that the FPS lag continued. I was running around 9-40 FPS in any given match. I did find something that seems to help which was changing my processor power minimum. Not sure with other operating systems but Win10 seems to default it to 5% and upping it to 20-40% seemed to do the trick.\n\n**Control Panel > All Control Panel Items > Power Options > Edit Plan Settings > Change advanced power settings > Processor power management >  Minimum processor state. \n**\nAlso realized my cooling policy was set to passive and changed that to active as well.\n\nNote that changing this settings should not do any harm to your pc but it's not a terrible idea to reset them out of game to conserve power if you don't use hibernate settings. \n\nHope this helps!\n\n{{summoner:31}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emeritus II","date":"2016-12-15T02:36:33.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been experiencing the same issue, at first I thought it was my internet, but this is the only game I lag this bad.\nI literally have people teleporting it is so annoying!","replies":[]}]}
