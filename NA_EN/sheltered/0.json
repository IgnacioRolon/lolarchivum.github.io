I’ve had my account compromised before so I was worried that loding automatically into a game queue lobby meant that someone was on my account and that I probably logged them out of it - \r\n\r\nMy question I guess is, is this actually an indicator of someone having been on my account, or am I just being overly paranoid? Is it possible to log in and just be in a lobby already? \r\n \r\nI’ve changed my password to be safe, but I really wanted to double check. \r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-15T05:44:00.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmmmm I'd say you were probably taking the rights steps by changing your password! There's not really any reason why you would load straight into a match or lobby without having kicked someone else off. I would be extra safe and hit up our account recovery agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!","replies":[]},{"poster":"guz96","date":"2017-12-16T03:38:36.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@broporo Can you answer me i got a question buddy","replies":[]},{"poster":"sheltered","date":"2017-12-15T00:40:54.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump?","replies":[]}]}
