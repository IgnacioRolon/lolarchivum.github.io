Last year, it was mainly Normal PvP matches that had high levels of toxicity. But now no matter where you go, you will experience someone either mocking and insulting anyone they feel is doing wrong, targeting enemy players to grief them in an attempt to tilt them rather than just playing the game, or like my latest game, reconnect and disconnect for the first five minutes of the game.

There's a lot to break down here (more than I'd want to type out), but I do think its worth discussing! I stream semi-frequently if you ever want to hop onto the channel discord to chat! I think it would be a super interesting discussion of how you think the game meta affects player behavior. I'm rather unconvinced either way, but I'll be the first to admit I haven't given the connection too much thought.","replies":[{"poster":"yándere","date":"2018-09-07T02:05:19.317+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I think it would be a super interesting discussion of how you think the game meta affects player behavior. I'm rather unconvinced either way, but I'll be the first to admit I haven't given the connection too much thought.\n\nI'm not OP but I have some thoughts on this (as I'm sure a lot of people do). I don't think it's that a particular meta causes players to be toxic, exactly. It's just that League is, in the \"best\" metas, a game that is fraught with frustration already, and this has been talked about in the community extensively over the years. Here is why I think this season is different.\n\nOne of the greatest ways to breed frustration is to remove someone's agency, and many League players are very frustrated because they feel that they have very little or no agency in the game. I certainly feel this way. I can't tell you how many games this season have ended with me crying (yes, crying over a video game...) because I just felt so powerless to do anything to influence the game. You can probably guess that I like to play bot lane, mostly support and sometimes ADC. Earlier this season I felt pretty good, I was climbing at a high rate and felt like my actions were having an impact on the game. There were of course problems, such as level 3 ganks from junglers, and even though these things were annoying, I felt like I had the ability to deal with those setbacks. Now, if the enemy jungler ganks at level 2 or 3, and my jungler does not countergank, the lane is over; almost every gank requires me to blow all my summoner spells, and many times even that is not enough to survive, and the tower will not protect me. This feels awful, naturally. If my jungler can't get there fast enough, or my mid laner isn't a highly mobile champion, there isn't much to be done. \n\nBut it's even worse than that. The jungler doesn't even have to gank my lane, but maybe they gank top. Not even camping, but just one single gank where they get a kill. Maybe the top laner made a mistake and deserved to die, but even this single gank can decide the fate of the whole game. The game is about a numbers advantage, and how you can surprise the enemy with your high damage and your numbers advantage. Like that infamous game where Fnatic hid in a bush next to baron pit and waited to surprise the enemy team. That's basically all of League right now. \n\nOftentimes, whichever lane gets behind early is like an open wound for your team, and unless you can quickly react by taking an advantage elsewhere, you are left with this gaping hole that you can't fix, and it just keeps bleeding out until the game ends. I've had many, many games where we won the lane, even dominated the lane, but because top or mid received extra pressure from the enemy jungler and we weren't able to respond (or our jungler doesn't care to respond) we just lose anyway. I like to roam a lot as a support, even on enchanter supports that you don't expect to see roaming (for precisely that reason), but this season I feel that roaming has little impact on the outcome. I feel especially scared to leave my ADC at bot because they won't be able to survive a gank, even under our tower. I'm not confident in my ability to peel or negate damage as an enchanter anymore, and most people don't even play enchanters except for Nami. I personally feel that my playstyle is not welcome in League anymore; there is basically only one linear way to play the game, and it is not how I like to play. Again, this leaves me feeling alienated and lacking agency, and I've been playing the game for over five years, consistently reaching mid-high elo every season since season 4. Many ADC players have said this same thing: the champions they like, and the way they like to play, are not viable. \n\nMy not very expert opinion is that the jungle has too much influence over the game. Not just the jungler, but the JUNGLE itself, including neutral and epic monsters, and plants too. The game is played too much around scuttle crab, dragon, rift herald, and baron. If the enemy has a more favorable early game comp and can secure early scuttles, herald, or god forbid an early infernal dragon, the game is pretty much done. Baron buff is basically a magic GG button; unless you are severely behind and achieve a steal, securing baron almost guarantees your victory without even much effort, even if you have not taken a single inhib turret yet. It's pretty frustrating as a player when the enemy team can secure baron and push in your base not even by grouping or attacking turrets, but just by standing in the general vicinity of a structure. They don't have to put themselves at risk from poke during a siege because of how weak turrets are, especially because of the cannon minion's ridiculous range and the overall tankiness of the wave. Nexus turrets are also a joke; if inhib turrets go down, the game is over, there is almost no point defending nexus turrets because, by this point in the game, almost everyone on their team can tank multiple tower shots without risk.\n\nSome people might argue, isn't this the point of League? Taking objectives should result in a win. Well, yes and no. League is a game generally played out in multiple parts, which most refer to as (1) laning phase, (2) mid game, and (3) late game. However, in a meta that heavily favors the team which secures the most objectives as early as possible, there is almost no point in the laning phase or late game existing. The separate phases of the game lack balance, power is heavily skewed toward mid game, and the mid game comes much earlier than it used to. Does it matter if I killed my opponent five times in lane and got more CS, if their team just comes to kill me, takes an infernal or herald, and grabs a free turret or two? What's the point of even killing them 1v1? If you don't or can't roam to other lanes and kill everyone/take objectives, your lead is meaningless. Hell, it's even a greater advantage for the enemy when they get a ton of gold for killing you. This is where you get people saying they can't \"carry\" anymore. Well, you can carry, just not by winning your lane. The lane doesn't matter. \n\nTherefore, people who excelled at outplaying their opponent in lane feel that they have no power even if they won their lane, if they cannot get their team to press their advantage by taking objectives like herald or dragon (especially infernal). Likewise, champions who come online in late game don't get a chance to scale, as the game is entirely won in the mid game, and again only if you got those early epic monsters or scuttles. If the enemy team can gangbang you at bot or top early in the game, that means an early dragon or rift herald for them, and that almost always translates to a win in my experience. There are exceptions, of course, but this seems like the general trend. \n\nThis overall sense of powerlessness and hopelessness breeds frustration and toxicity, especially if you don't understand what's happening or that your preferred playstyle just does not fit into this meta, and often people will shift blame onto their teammates for this. This is why you see those posts of people complaining about \"inters\" in their games; well, they're almost certainly not inting, the enemy team is probably just good at ganging up on them. Or, even worse (and this is something I see 100x more this season than previous seasons), they just give up. Enemy team got baron? We cannot defend against them. Enemy jungler is playing someone like Eve, Khazix, or Rengar, and they snowballed? There is nothing we can do. Enemy team took rift herald and got an early infernal? We won't be able to stop their push or compete with their damage. Maybe you've seen that phrase \"go next\" become popular recently; it's like the new \"open mid,\" except people say it to their own team (and I hate it). People legit just give up in this meta, and honestly I find it hard to blame them, because most times there really is nothing you can do. By the time your top laner has died to a gank from the jungler and mid two times, the game is pretty much done, unless you were there to negate those ganks in the first place. Once a team gains that advantage from those early kills + objectives, it's incredibly hard to come back. \n\n**tl;dr** Many players who preferred to play the game a certain way are feeling alienated and powerless in the current meta, which heavily favors early game champions, especially early game junglers, who can create an insurmountable lead by early ganking. Neutral and epic monsters also have far too much impact on the game. Feeling hopeless and powerless breeds frustration, which often leads to toxicity, and a lack of understanding for how the current meta works can lead to players shifting blame onto their teammates, or just giving up completely as soon as anything goes wrong. Not saying this behavior is excusable or warranted, but perhaps that gives some perspective on the issue.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Altonius Amakiir","date":"2018-09-06T22:52:47.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that's asking for a bit much in this situation. To me, it seems unreasonable to ask anyone to give a calm answer devoid of blame when you (or your company/ other members of your company) have wronged them. While I understand the policy for player-and-Riot communication is based on Riots doing it of their own will, with their own time; you are still representing the company as you do so. That comes with all the responsibility the entire company would have. And a company shouldn't be getting upset over their customers being upset about something the company did wrong. \n\nI personally do feel bad for you Rioters, you get so much shit trying to help the community. You do it because you recognize someone should, but because it's all optional no one else will. So it's always the nicest Rioters responding. It's just a shitty system. Riot _should_ have a team whose job it is to deal with these kind of things, but because of how things are, nice Rioters get cussed out when they're trying to help (because they're the only ones to talk to at Riot) and the community can never get communication.\n\nI would also like to say that I want Rioters to stop blaming the community over this situation. If you sit and think about the way company PR is set up at Riot and don't hold some communism levels of faith in humanity, then it's quite clear (at least in my opinion) that there was no way else things would have ended up,  except like this. It may have taken longer, or shorter, but eventually we would have ended up like this. It is not the community's fault, to blame the community is to blame human nature. Riot needs to revamp how they handle PR, or it is my solemnly held opinion they will not last another 4 years. This isn't meant to be mean btw, this is just me looking at the facts available to me.\n\nP.S. (less chill here, mostly me venting on the stupidity of the situation): That comment, while certainly aggressive, is no where near bad enough to justify not responding to on that basis alone (which you avoided that pitfall, I applaud you good sir or madame). If you think that is bad, work some retail.  As a person, yeah, ignore it; but right now, you represent a company, there are different levels of acceptability for each. A company is expected to reply to a concern like that somewhere, and promptly.

Part of that solution, which I&#x27;d love to hear from y&#x27;all, is what you think all of us (Community &amp; Rioters) can be doing. Would love to brainstorm ideas.\n\n\n\nAs for solutions, I think the following may assist:\n\n1.) Make muting more visible: Right now I have to hold down tab and click a tiny button to mute someone, and admittedly in the heat of things you may forget muting even exists.  How about this:\n            a.) As soon as you enter the game you receive an obtrusive and very visible tooltip warning against toxicity and reminding players to mute toxic individuals.\n            b.) At key trigger moments (such as a player first death) issue the team/player an unobtrusive reminder to mute toxicity.\n\n2.) Reward positive behavior: Make no mistake capitalism only works because the rewards for conformity are exceedingly handsome, but in the end, everyone is just working in their self-interests. LOL is no different. Honor rewards are a fantastic idea but it could use some tweaking.

If you have the specific outcomes of every single report you filed you might be able to analyse the way reports are reviewed\n\nThat said, I think the bigger reason is that the actual outcomes of a report are much more complex than that. The automatic review might easily consider the report valid, but still not take an actual action because it was a first-time occurrence of very mild toxicity. Likewise the system might suggest that a single somewhat passive aggressive remark has lead to an action, when it was just the final straw.\n\nThe only way to work around that is by changing the concept of actions to \"verdicts\" of some kind, that display how much toxicity the system detected.\nBut that will without a doubt create problems of its own: Since the scale of actions is now very nuanced, the chance of the reporter agreeing 100% with the verdict is very slim. As a result people will hardly ever experience those verdicts as \"good\", while every major disagreement with a verdict will be a very memorable bad impression. Negativity bias will do the rest and people will feel even **worse** about the system, even if it's objectively (and in the bigger picture) functioning very well.\n\nI still believe the best idea would be that once a month upon login you are given the overall stats of how many people have been punished due to your reports, at the time of the report or later because of repeated toxicity.

One game I had someone sit and every five minutes talk about how he is going to report me for stepping away from my monitor for less than 2 minutes. Did it all game until he got enough of a rise out of me to where I finally wanted to say something. I just don't see what other option there is. When I mute I feel like it takes away a part of the game. Yeah usually the chat, especially the All chat, is filled with tons of toxic behavior, but I also like seeing people compliment each other and also handing out compliments for epic plays that people have made on your team or even the enemy team. To just completely eliminate the ability to bond with other players and enjoy playing with players stranger or not, ruins the game for me. It's quiet, less competitive energy; that's good in the aspect of eliminating toxicity, but teamwork wise and team morale wise, it really doesn't help the game.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-09-06T20:12:36.846+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"If you turn around and be toxic, be it through chat or by trolling, you are doing so by choice.

This should not be a thing if there is supposedly a good report system that should be eliminating this problem. Additionally, there is more ways people cause grief than just petty insults, which I believe that many people seem to be forgetting. There is literal running down the mid mentalities, Afking and then coming back repeatedly to prevent remake votes, outright refusing to accept surrenders and keeping players hostage because you feel that you can 1v5 carry, and many more than I could spend all day thinking of.\n\n2. Quitting the game.\nBecause I've invested a lot of time and money into this game and have grown to love it.

But occasionally, you get the jerk who assumes that you were inting when you really were having a bad game and could do literally nothing since you're up against a champion that outmatches you, an enemy jungler who camps you, and an ally jungler than never aids you. So now you solely become the target of everyone's rage in this losing match.\n\nI understand that toxicity is bad and I openly understand that whether or not I was defending myself or not, it is toxic and it is something that shouldn't be a part of this community. But really just because I want the community to be less toxic if not just plainly absent of toxicity does not mean I have to sit there and tame my fingertips just because I'll come off as a hypocrite.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-09-06T20:56:42.948+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"> So basically if someone sits and calls me a useless piece of shit all game and continues to do so for the rest of the game, I'm being a jerk by responding.\n\nIf you add to the flame, all you've done is contribute to the poor attitude of the game.

So if you are in the minority and said only a few things but everyone else is friends with the person who began the toxicity, you will get banned and they will get off with a slap on the wrist. Other times, Enemy players simply don't care because if they won the game, there's nothing for them to be mad about that would warrant a report. Many others are just eager to get to the next game, completely ignoring the issue with toxic players. \n\nI respect that there are millions of players and that it is difficult to deal with all of these toxic players at once, especially when others add to the toxicity. But I feel you are again a bit shortsighted in terms of how many toxic players there are. Like I stated in my original post, last year there were few if any toxic players on ranked, a decent amount of toxic players in norms, but no more than that. Now? No matter where you go, you will find some form of toxicity, whether it is on your team or the enemy team. Sometimes it's just bad manners, sometimes it's a tyler1 wannabe who is running it down mid because he couldn't get his favorite champion.\n\nI'm really wondering what your purpose is at this point. Is it just to identify me as a problem and ignore the fact that regardless toxic players are an issue, or do you just not really care much to let the idea of toxic players annoy you?","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-09-06T21:27:41.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">The report feature is useless unless everyone as a whole reports all together.\n\nStated otherwise by one of the Rioter's in charge of the code, as well as in the [Reporting a Player article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player).\n\n>I respect that there are millions of players and that it is difficult to deal with all of these toxic players at once, especially when others add to the toxicity.

I even can openly point out that I have been toxic at times and I have suffered penalties for it. But for some reason, after I came off my hiatus this year and started playing League again, it seems that compared to last year, the community is 10x worse than it has ever been. Last year, it was mainly Normal PvP matches that had high levels of toxicity. But now no matter where you go, you will experience someone either mocking and insulting anyone they feel is doing wrong, targeting enemy players to grief them in an attempt to tilt them rather than just playing the game, or like my latest game, reconnect and disconnect for the first five minutes of the game. Rejoin the game at 20 minutes in and then feed.\n> \n> I really just don&amp;#039;t know what exactly to do with this game anymore.

No, I'm not saying that I openly want toxicity, but I generally feel better about matches and enjoy them more seeing players work together as a team, compliment each other on what they are doing right and not blame each other for what they are doing wrong.

But, at this point I can't help but do it with the jerks we have to play with. Just had a blitzcrank yesterday after making this post in rank who fed three kills (I got baited and died three times myself so I fed also) and then all I said was \"Lemme just farm for now lmao.\" He caught an attitude, went mid and stayed in lane with Katarina because I was 'being a noob who just wants to farm.' My friend Kingdom Chain has been saying for a while now that a lot of the good players left League for Fortnite. And I'm sad to see that this may actually be true.
