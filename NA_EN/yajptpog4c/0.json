We're currently running compatability tests to see if this is something that's being caused by certain graphics cards (as this doens't happen 100% of the time), or if it's an issue on our end with the particle itself.","replies":[{"poster":"YaJpTpOg4C","date":"2016-06-10T21:32:55.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayeee my favorite Rioter!
