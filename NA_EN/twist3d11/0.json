Dont listen to the kids that think you need 2000$ of \"gamer\" hardware.\n\nPrebuild PCs are always about 200-300% more expensive for the same quality, than building one yourself.\n\nIf you want to be able to play other games with high/maxed 60fps, 8GB of decent ram (40$), or 16GB if you multitask very heavily (60-80$), a GTX 1050 TI (130$), intel i3-6100 CPU (100$) would probably come to about 500$ with the other parts.\n\nIf you just want to play league, a GTX 1050 (100$), 8GB ram, and a cheap, modern AMD CPU (40-60$) would be more than enough, stuff it in a mini-ITX case and you have a shoebox that stomps any console and most laptops four times the price.\n\nIf you are in the market for a prebuild rig, look for something with a GTX 7050 TI (unlikely, now), GTX 1050 TI, or GTX 1060 6GB for the GPU, in ascending price, at least 8GB of ram, at least a 5th-gen intel processor, or 6th-gen (skylake) like i3-6100, i5-6500, if you want to upgrade over time. AMD CPUs tend to only be worthwhile for very cheap computers (4 to 8 weak cores, compared to two or four fast cores), gaming is not their strong point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Twist3d11","date":"2016-11-28T23:54:13.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well I was just at best buy and almost walked out with $1300 computer and I just don't want to make a bad decision when I have a desk top already and I could just upgrade it with some help","replies":[]},{"poster":"Live2LetDie","date":"2016-11-28T23:52:30.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well.. whats the budget?
