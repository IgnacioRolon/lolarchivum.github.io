I&rsquo;m looking to form a group of mature players that would want to practice in a premade 5s environment and potentially, after working out kinks, make a 5s Team. As the title indicated &ndash; this is really for those that get shut out, but still want to improve! I&rsquo;ll add everyone if there is interest in this and ask them the times and days that work for them, but I&rsquo;d hope to aim for 3 nights a week for 3 hours each with breaks in between games. Also - manners are important. Playful jokes are fine, but full rage is no good! ADD in game IF u got Q&#039;s Write below\r\n\r\nPost filling out the following if you seem it is worth your time~\r\n\r\nIn Game Name &ndash;\r\nAge &ndash;\r\nWilling to use Skype/curse/discord voice chat (y/n) &ndash;\r\nRole Preferences (Order Them) &ndash;\r\nWilling to swap between playing your top 2-3 roles (y/n) &ndash;\r\n\r\nFavorite Champions Per Role &ndash;\r\n[Mid]\r\n[Top]\r\n[Jungle]\r\n[ADC]\r\n[Support]\r\nAnything you&rsquo;d like to add~~?\r\n\r\n&bull;It is important for us to have good team comps, but no one should be forced into a champion that they hate. We&rsquo;d just rotate roles based on what we need if people were willing and had the champions for it.","replies":[{"poster":"CG SaintRubble","date":"2017-01-14T17:47:01.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In Game Name – XLiLxShepherdX( can be changed)\nAge – 21\nWilling to use Skype/curse/discord voice chat (y/n) – Yes\nRole Preferences (Order Them) – Support, ADC, Mid, Top Jungle \nWilling to swap between playing your top 2-3 roles (y/n) – YEs\n\nFavorite Champions Per Role –\n[Mid] Zyra, Lux, Leblanc, Akali, Katarina\n[Top]\n[Jungle]\n[ADC] Cait, MF, jinx, Vayne, Varus\n[Support] Zyra, Nami, Morgana, Lux, Tresh","replies":[]},{"poster":"xRoadRunner","date":"2017-01-14T16:24:12.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: xRoadrunner\nAge –25\nWilling to use Skype/curse/discord voice chat (y/n) –yes\nRole Preferences (Order Them) – Mid, top, adc, support, jungle\nWilling to swap between playing your top 2-3 roles (y/n) –yes\n\nFavorite Champions Per Role –\n[Mid]{{champion:131}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:61}} \n[Top]{{champion:111}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:122}} \n[Jungle]{{champion:120}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:2}} \n[ADC]{{champion:29}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:222}} \n[Support]{{champion:143}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:161}} \nAnything you’d like to add~~?
