I just LOVE to play xerath. At this time, my favourite skin is scorched earth Xerath. But I would realy love to see a new skin for this champion like Iron man skin. Would it be possible to make it? Champ skills are perfect to go with the skin. \r\n\r\nQ - he shoots from the hand (beam of power)\r\nW - An attack from middle of his cheast \r\nE - shoots from his hand (ball of power)\r\nR - stretch out his hand and shoots mini rockets that land on the point where you aim.\r\n\r\n(When he has 425 or more speed, he would put his hands like iron man and float/fly ower the surface) - Amaizing, amaizing, amaizing!!!\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t see why would it be so hard to make it.
