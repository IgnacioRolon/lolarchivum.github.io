I've also noticed that champion select and the store/hextech menus are sluggish. I talked to a few people and they also seemed to notice it. Anyone else having these issues?","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2016-03-26T22:08:32.335+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay i'm having this issue in a layered sense.\n\nFirst my ping problems started about 2 months ago, at the time i was getting around 70-80 ping. It went up three times so far with the last one being the beginning of this week to put me up to 150 and with that last one i've been getting this same problem with laggy champ select, store and hextech menu. The ping is always there but the menu lag is on and off and usually only when you first enter them as it tends to kind of wear off.\n\nSo far it seems riot is on it and after investigating they seem to have found the problem is much worse than they thought so its taking a while before any news of a timeline is getting to us. All the same your still on the lucky side so hope your ping doesn't rise anymore. As either the ping rises or it goes back down and you instead get a lot of packet loss lag with teleporting and inactivity issues","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2016-04-07T07:46:12.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GREAT NEWS, My ping has finally dropped back to its 70-80 range.
