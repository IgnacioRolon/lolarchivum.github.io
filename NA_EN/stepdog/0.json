Any help?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to be the owner of my club \"Joseph Stalin\" with the club tag: \"Fanta\"\r\n\r\nI transferred leadership to my friend since I didn't really play the game any more. Just got back into league and I find out the person I gave ownership to had been perma banned, so currently, there are no leaders. I was wondering if there's a way to give me the leadership status back? Would like to give my friends the Officer title so they can invite people when im not on. \r\n\r\nHelp would be appreciated. Thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-25T22:31:23.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks to hear that happened, and we'd like to help get an owner back to your club.  The fastest way to get a transition moving along would be to have the owner reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  If he can't be reached, have a veteran member reach out to us and we'll see if something can be done.  We'll reply back asap!","replies":[]}]}
