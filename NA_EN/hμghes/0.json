Unfortunately, that would require a change in the unlocking game mode system, or a change in the quests as they currently are, both of which I highly doubt will change for this special case. They have mentioned in the past that not all quests they release are intended to be able to be completed by every player, which could then be reapplied to special cases such as this as they arise. While losing isn't something that I or they would want to encourage you to do intentionally, you could try to recruit a group of players who are willing to help you with this. Even in a loss, you will gain experience, and the loss won't be counted in the quest.","replies":[]}]}
