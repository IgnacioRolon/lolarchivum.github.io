Today i just wanted to talk about reworks.  Recently, there have been many reowkrs - fiora, MF, and GP getting reworked last patch and the juggernaut changes soon to come.  But, before  I talk about this, I wanted to discuss what the purpose of a rework is:\r\n\r\nIMO, the point of a rework is to change a champion to make him or her less broken while still keeping their identity and a place in the meta.  Then, we are confronted with the definition of broken.  Broken to me =/= OP, in fact many broken champions such as Poppy acttually suck.  Broken IMO is when a champion has such a lack of counterplay that they are either op or are up do to their kits being too annoying to play against if they had decent numbers.  Take poppy - if she could survive the laning phase, then because of her ult giving her a high lack of counterplay she can simply ult the support... and there is nothing you can do.  I also want to take a look at recent reworks.  I will group them in to 5 categories:  Very good, good, meh, poor, and terrible\r\n\r\nVery Good:  \r\n\r\nAshe - it made her a viable adc with a steroid but keeping her cc adc identity, and after a patch or two is now very well balanaced\r\n\r\nSion:  We all know about this.  Sion pre-rework had no identity and completely fucked scaling.  Now, he is what he should be - a tanky untoppable juggernaut with cc and the ability to come back from the dead/the brink of death\r\n\r\nGood:  \r\nTrist -  thoughshe still has her problem of being unstopabble due to self peel late game, that is her niche - she got turned into a &quot;real&quot; adc with a kit that worked together really well\r\n\r\nGP/Fiora/MF:  This is yet to be determined, but honestly i think GP and fiora will be a bit OP albeit given new, viable positions in the meta\r\n\r\nMeh:\r\n\r\nCassiopeia - she is actually somehwat viable and has a role as a late game ap dpser, but the nature ofher passive basically just encourages her to wait until 30 minutes to get strong\r\n\r\nPoor: \r\nZilean - Zilean whilst having his toxic automatic double q combo removed is now sadly just bad.   IMO nthey should increase the range and travel speed of his q\r\n\r\nterrible:  Veigar - we all know why here.  He is useless unless you are way better at your opponent in regards to them dodging/you hitting your e, which is needed for your w to hit","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2015-08-11T05:40:53.223+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with your high level point.

It may be time for some tweaks for him if he's not viable so I'll run it by them and see if there is any room for a buff. \n\nIf he's already strong there may be other ways to improve his QoL without buffing him. Will investigate, no promises.","replies":[{"poster":"Archenz","date":"2015-08-11T12:29:12.711+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no he's very viable.

(yes his W lost a lot of viability with the reliability nerfs to his E) but more of a feel/frustration aspect.\n\nVeigar still has most of his damage, he still has his best case, and he even has some added range for team fighting now. All of these can be seen as positives. But the real question here is, \"at what cost?\"\n\nVeigar used to be my absolute favorite champ to play. It'd make me giggle with an evil glee when I'd ult + Q and enemy, walk away and score a kill only to hear my master of evil laugh with me. But now I find veigar nearly unplayable, and this frustrates me, as I spent a good chunk of money on FBV and I LOVED that skin. (the little sound effect on last hitting a minion has to be my favorite aspect) \n\nBut since these changes, I've lost agency with veigar. I am no longer in control of when I kill my opponent, and am forced to wait for them to screw up, or my team engages before I can find a target to nuke from orbit. Not only that, but I've also lost my last line of defense. I played a match with the new veigar one day vs a fed rengar. I see rango jump at me with his ult, I drop my E right where he'd land. I die instantly, and he gets stunned only after mangling my corpse. \n\nBut out of all of these changes, I'd say the one I dislike the most was converting my Q from a point and click to a skill shot. Yes, I know this was meant as compensation for the lack of safety veig would have with the nerfed E, allowing him to farm at further range, but honestly, this is was the straw that broke the camel's back. I severely miss my fade away Q's, and it's so much more frustrating trying to farm and harrass my opponent in lane now, and to top it off, his Q is now AoE, so my spell vamp runes that would let me sustain in lane with the best of them are now worthless.\n\nSo please, if anything, bring back veig's old Q. I miss playing my master of evil, and I don't want to feel like I wasted money on such an awesome skin I'll never use.\n\nPS: with his new skin FBV's sound effect on last hitting with his Q doesn't sound right when you kill 2 minions at once. The overlap is kinda annoying. :/","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Taigongwang","date":"2015-08-11T20:38:00.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just hope that the recent backlash from the Morde and Fiora reworks has taken some effect internally. I havent talked to any Fiora player who liked the rework, nor have I talked to anyone that looks forward to Morde becoming a melee ADC/Support/Tank/Bruiser.....thing. \n\nHats off to whoever did Gangplank though. He feels like he did before, with an interesting zoning mechanic now. The Silver Serpent thing for his ult is kinda weird though. Doesnt really feel like it needs to be there, and that it was just tacked on to promote farming with the Q even more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cuix","date":"2015-08-11T08:17:19.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotScruffy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zBMtJhVB,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-11T05:40:53.223+0000)\n>\n> We also know that not every update has turned out perfect and we have tried to learn as much as we can from everything we've done (good and bad) to keep improving out update quality and connection to the original champs.\n\nSo, seriously, what happened with Cass?

She was either a long range AoE DoT mage who could spam powerful poisons and whittle you down.....or she was a DPS machine who once she got a DoT on you would go to town with Twin Fang spam\n\nI personally feel they should have sought to really amplify the DoT mage feel...she a snake lady, basically THE perfect poison DoT mage.  I would have much preferred the resetting E get removed and replaced with something else that highlighted the feeling of slowing poisoning your foes to death.  Best feeling in the world for a player who loves DoT's is seeing someone flash away and escape off screen, and you just sit there knowing in 3 seconds or so your going to get a kill.\n\nInstead they went with the Twin Fang spam DPS identity.  Now granted she has had success in professional play which is great, and for the people who enjoyed her spam-E (heh) playstyle the rework was wonderful.  But half of cassi players were left basically losing who they felt their champ was","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sp441","date":"2015-08-11T13:17:11.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just twiddling my thumbs hoping that the Urgot rework stays true to the character and combat style.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blade of Justic","date":"2015-08-11T06:18:56.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with everything except for the position of Sion.\n\nPersonally, I hated the reworked Sion kit and would have preferred if they took out his AP ratios and got rid of his shield.\n\nSion's ult was the most fun part for me and now all I get to do is run into things.\n\nOtherwise, I'd have to say \"yes\" to the original post.","replies":[]}]}
