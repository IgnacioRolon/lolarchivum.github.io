Sometime you just want to spectate a game instead of playing.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-24T21:22:20.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know what feature you are referencing, and sadly, it is not available in the main page of the client anymore :(  You can always right-click on any of your friends in-game to spectate them, or you can view other 3rd party sites like Twitch to spectate people playing as well.\n\nGive me a heads up if you have any further questions!","replies":[{"poster":"NocaNoha","date":"2016-05-25T18:16:34.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there any specific reason why was that feature removed? I really liked spectating those games when I couldn't play or if I was unwilling to play at that moment\n\n- Find the game with the champion you like..\n- Spectate those Diamond+ (?) ranks\n- Try to replicate later on.. it's fun\n\nAlthough.. the only thing I hated is the fact that I can't see in-game masteries/runes they are using :|\nI still hate that in the e-sports statistics.. I can only view it later on, when the game is finished","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-25T22:04:14.988+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I definitely know what you are saying!  I wasn't apart of that team or apart of that decision at all, so my guess would be as good as yours to be honest.  \n\nI really do love the idea of being able to select a champion, and spectate a very high MMR player whose currently playing that champ though!","replies":[{"poster":"Kobold","date":"2016-05-25T22:25:42.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would you ask the team involved to respond to this topic though and give a response as to why it was removed or if they are going to implement it later to the client? If they are looking forward to implementing it have them reference the post you responded to as Ideas for the implementation of the Spectate finder.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NocaNoha","date":"2016-05-30T09:08:58.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the answer, I hope they do implant your suggestion as it even seems far more efficient than the previous feature, where we had only 5 games to choose from (And hopefully one of them has the champion you are seeking)\n\nJust picking a champion and letting the game find a random Diamond+ matching to spectate sounds great! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"AramsAreBest","date":"2016-05-26T01:03:20.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you aren't part of the team just ask someone from the team...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ragingpuma","date":"2016-12-05T12:48:23.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just would like to spectate any game, doesn't have to be a high MMR game.

It was actually half the reason I'd log in some days. Even if I wasn't playing I'd end up buying skins before I logged out sometimes. People just like to watch and learn more about the game so I don't see the point of removing it as a function.\n          {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}]}
