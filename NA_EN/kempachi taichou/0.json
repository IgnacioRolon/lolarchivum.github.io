Even if the support ends up tanking, there needs to be utility coming out of top and JG as well. Four glass cannons and a support tank don't win the game. Even in sup goes tank, the the jg or top still has to use a utility champ with some hard CC and the other another tanky champ. Not another glass cannon...","replies":[]}]}]}
