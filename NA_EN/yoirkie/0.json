The preset ones are just extra and don't count towards your total.  They just exist so new players can use the pages when they don't have other ones yet.\n\nYou can also buy them with RP, but I wouldn't recommend it.  Rune pages often go on sale as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-06-22T03:45:38.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You start with two editable ones and can get more for something like 7000BE, which is nothing by the time you need them.\n\nThe others are not editable or removable, they are just decent presets for a majority of champions and examples for new players to use. Between those and two more you can accommodate most champions decently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Bad Touch","date":"2019-06-22T03:33:31.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Beats me.
