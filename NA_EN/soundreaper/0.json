I posted this on the 6.20 Buglist megathread as well and just thought I should post it here to see if I could get any help. I'm still having the same problems in 6.21!\n\nServer: NA\nType of Bug: Client/In-Game\nDescription: Game does not load in after Champion select in Normal Blind, Normal Draft, or Ranked. The game opens to a black screen then gives the error \"You have disconnected. Please check your internet connection and try again.\" The game closes, then the client comes up and asks you to reconnect but it does the same thing no matter how many times you reconnect. It only occurs for that game and then the next few rounds, the game has no problem loading in.\nVideo / Screenshot: It's a black screen.\nSteps to reproduce: Attempt to go into a game.\nExpected result: Supposed to show champions and load into game.\nObserved result: Simply goes to black screen and never loads no matter how many times you try to reconnect.\nReproduction rate: Can happen ever other game or like after 5 games.\nSystem specs: Macbook Pro (Mid-2012), i7-3720QM, GT 650M 1 GB, 10.12 Sierra\n\nI really need help with this, I have now have 9 games with a 20 minute leavebuster because of this bug :(\n\n-SilentHypnosis","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-20T23:11:27.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Black screens in the client before loading into a match are typically caused by your client being unable to reach specific servers.

It must be something to do with the Mac Client. I went through the connection guide and edited the DNS settings as that was the only potential problem I saw. The problem has still not been fixed.\n\nThanks,\nSilentHypnosis","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-26T20:37:25.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this were a problem with the Mac client, it would be affecting *everyone* using the Mac client. Since we're not getting bombarded with reports, and because all servers your access online reside in different geolocations, It's definitely possible for something to be wrong with your network routing *specifically* to the League servers. \n\nI *strongly encourage* you to work through **all** the steps in that guide so we can confirm your local settings are 100% good. Let me know the results.","replies":[{"poster":"soundreaper","date":"2016-10-26T23:22:11.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!\n\nAfter deleting the game and redownloding the game again, I ran through the guide one more time. I have been running on a wired connection, I turned the firewall off, configured the DNS as shown, used the packet loss tool (no packet loss problems here), played League with that being the only open application, updated to the most recent version of OS X Sierra, changed the Admin settings for League, and lastly verified there were no proxies in use (I don't use a VPN). Even then, I encountered the problem after playing 2 games just fine.\n\nBased on this, perhaps the problem has something to do with the ports as that is the only thing I cannot verify as I cannot log into my University's router. I don't understand why ports would cause the game to not work after several games work.\n\nA very confused,\nSilentHypnosis","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-27T17:44:08.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be deeper issues along your route to the servers.

I have received LeaveBuster at least twice this week for five - 20 minute periods because I never connect to the game after champ select and my team has to end up voting for a remake.
