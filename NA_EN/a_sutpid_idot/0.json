Thin walls so any champ without a jump was massively outclassed, random buffs could make or break a game, you could easily pull minions into the fountain at base so taking an enemy inhib was detrimental, could also easily pull players into fountain with someone like blitz or naut making games take forever to close out. There were other issues I can think of off the top of my head.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-07-15T03:20:44.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Username checks out :P\n\n...On a more serious note, you might, but extremely few people do.

Kayn talon and zac are the most oppressive for me","replies":[{"poster":"Ilovemobas","date":"2019-07-15T03:50:18.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Sutpid Idot,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=u0QATrT4,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-07-15T03:43:05.878+0000)\n>\n> I don't really think poppy is that bad IMO.
