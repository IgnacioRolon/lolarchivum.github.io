Pretty confident that this will be rolled out in the near future.\n\nWhile broadcasting and having the client set to 1080p is obviously optimal. It's worth noting that even if you're unable to broadcast in 1080p, it would be nice to either resize the HP bars when the client is in 720p or simply set your client to 1080p while broadcasting. It becomes difficult to see what's going on in team fights at 720p because the HP bars take up more space. The icons on the minimap are also a bit harder to read. Here's an example:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MPMViwV.png\n\nOn the left is an HP bar in 720p. On the right is an HP bar in 1080p downsampled to 720p for size comparison. HP bars take up roughly 33% more room in 720p.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bi0major","date":"2015-01-21T18:09:47.223+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is Ariel Horn, for those that don't recognize the tag. Good question. Among the 1080p or 60fps upgrade, I think we would see an appreciable increase in game smoothness and clarity from 60fps.

We already produce our shows in 60fps so it's a matter of testing to ensure that the distribution partners can accommodate and won't default to variable bit rates or fewer frames.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Obscurica","date":"2015-01-21T17:11:50.877+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. What are the current plans for the broadcasting of the LPL? Why does the current bandwidth issue exist, causing the tension between casting both OCE and LPL out from the same studio -- was it an unforeseen hangup, or what were the reasons considered for the schedule clash? \n\n2. Kriz and Emily were volunteer casters for the CBLoL scene, but appear to have retired from that role recently. Does this signal plans for an English broadcast for the Brazilian scene as well? In general, what are the plans for South American esports, especially given Brazil's known issues regarding Nintendo's recent wholesale departure and the infrastructural deficits?\n\n3. The LMS is now the only major non-wildcard circuit to lack English broadcasts in any shape or form (excepting a couple VODs from me to try and bridge the gap for enthusiasts). I've been told that Garena TW wasn't planning one in the first place -- will this be addressed in the near future, and can I help? \n\n4. How much oversight does Riot have over competing organizations in China? There've been rumors of bait-and-switch contracts and shady agents during the China-Korea player transfers -- is that within your jurisdiction, or wholly up to Tencent and L-ACE to manage?\n\n5. OGN, now LCK, used to have 1080p available for subscribers, as well as the Twitch icons. Will at least the stream quality level be made available again in the future? (720p still causes clarity issues at times--names and numbers are especially affected). Speaking of which, are you adamant about keeping the LCK acronym? \n\n6. There've been significantly less coverage of collegiate and grassroots tournaments since S2--for obvious reasons, since the LCS and its peer circuits take precedence. But I personally feel this might be hindering developmental opportunities for future casters and players (the pressures of a live audience and face-to-face competition is incomparable to doing so within one's bedroom). Are there plans to spotlight more fan-operated initiatives?","replies":[{"poster":"Curatrix","date":"2015-01-21T17:47:14.333+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"are you adamant about keeping the LCK acronym?\"\n\nI feel like KCL (Korean Champions League) sounds much better than LCK (League Champions Korea).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Magus","date":"2015-01-21T18:35:24.437+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. The current plan is to twofold: (1) Invest in the broadcast so that it increases in quality. While the core casting team is strong, there are a bunch of opportunities to get the quality of the cast up. (2) Figure out how to get each game cast live. We're dedicated to doing that. We foresaw the bandwidth issue at launch but understand that in the long term, this will result in a great experience for LPL fans. We've seen that it takes a major investment to create a quality esport broadcast and we're ready to do so for the LPL.\n\n2. Can't really speak to this, sorry.\n\n3. There are no immediate plans to have an English LMS broadcast that I'm aware of. The team's primarily focused on running the new league and delivering a strong local broadcast (which I agree with - those should be the priorities). I'd imagine once the foundation is laid, English cast will be on their priority list.\n\n4. Our \"central\" esports team in LA works in partnership with our Riot office in Hong Kong and Tencent, similar to how we work with OGN/Kespa/Riot Korea. We let the local teams take the lead in both cases but we're there to advise and help them improve at a high level.\n\n5. I've talked to the OGN crew via Riot Korea and that 1080p option wasn't \"true\" 1080p. They've told us that they output in \"true\" 720p so that's what we're going with. I'm honestly not a technical expert here on these matters so I don't want to venture into waters where I can't speak with much authority. We won't call it 1080p if it's not 1080p - and to be clear, OGN controls bitrate and output quality. In terms of the LCK monicker, we let the local offices take the lead on the league name - it's not mandated by the central team. Calling it 'OGN' never made much sense to me, as an aside.\n\n6. I think future pro players can get plenty of spotlight through challenger and streaming, but we're certainly interested in helping create opportunities for and spotlighting potential future casters.\n\nedit: clarity on #5","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatedTitan","date":"2015-01-21T16:13:42.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Will the Southeast be receiving some LCS one weekend?

What Riot is basically enforcing is the perception that teams own the players, and players have little to no imput on where to take their careers because they and their potential employers are persecuted if they take initiative AFTER THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT ARE FULFILLED. It was worrying with Bjergsen and became alarming after the Scarra incident.\n\nI understand you're trying to control malicious cases, but nothing in the ones that happened pointed to bad faith, yet the rule assumes there always is. Contacts started by players, mosly in innocent conversations about future, according to the information given to us, were met with brutal fines, giving the public the perception that they did something deplorable, some wrongly say ILLEGAL, and Riot has done nothing to address that fact. \n\nA \"what if\" cannot cause Riot to take away from a player their internationally recognized right to determine the terms of his employment. Receiving a job offer when employed is not even remotely morally questionable, and while in a closed competitive environment restrictions must be set in order to keep the integrity, you simply cannot allow yourselves to justify yourselves within than context and forget something as basic as employment agency. Teams don't own their players. A player's drive to seek to better his work dimension cannot just be outright sacrificed for the possibility of wrongdoing, and nothing that Riot has done to address this issue points in any other direction. The promise to find a viable workaround should not be a \"we're working on it\" like replay systems. This is a serious issue, treat it as such.\n\nBefore you point out you've instated new rules and released \"jurisprudence\" on the original rules about \"poaching\", you're right. We noticed you evn addressed TSM's blatant pay for silence on the Santorin case by requesting officials to be notified of the negotiationsbefore they start. The issue stands: making exploring options for a player a supervised procedure by both current employer and Riot just enforces the perception that players aren't in control of their employment. You're not asking yourself \"what if\" a team notified of the interest of another org pays that org to rescind their bid for that player. The curent system allows for that, negotiations made unbeknownst to a player, yet you only seek to defend orgs. I don't know what the answer to this isuue is, but you're currently very not on the fucking ball, pardon my expression.","replies":[{"poster":"AngeltheDumbBoy","date":"2015-01-21T22:13:58.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So organizations are just allowed to be screwed in these deals? Players are allowed to just up and leave cause they want too? That's not how sports work. I don't think any sport allows a player to just enter into negations with another team before their contracts are expired. Teams have to go through the proper channels, which means if Team A wants a player from Team B, they have to contact the management on Team B. If you allow players to enter negotiations at will they will be compromised. It's a serious issue and needs to be handled carefully. Proper procedure needs to be educated and enforced.
