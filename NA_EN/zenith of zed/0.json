I was able to change everything except left click. Left click completely doesn't work, unless I am in a menu such as the settings or shop. I have spent hours trying to resolve this issue without any progress. I have since then been leveling up a secondary account I created a while back which has worked perfectly fine with no issues. I realize riot acknowledged the issue, however it has been about a week and my account is completely unplayable. Does anybody know any fixes? Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-11T00:04:20.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was an issue last week that caused settings to reset or config files to mess up for some players.  If you're having an issue still as a result, your best bet would be to manually reset your config:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nHope that helps your main!","replies":[{"poster":"Zenith Of Zed","date":"2016-11-11T01:26:39.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, haven't tried that yet.
