It's like when you try to reroll or change masteries, the butonn just goes grey and nothing happens anymore. The timer runs down to 0 and then stays stuck on it. Then we have to open task manager to close all League of Legends programs active before we can restart the game.\r\n\r\nIt's weird that it happens on both of our computers at the same time. Internet still works fine for everything else. \r\nWe use windows 10 both on an MSI laptop.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-28T21:42:25.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmmm if this is happening for both of you at the same time, something is likely affecting your connection after it leaves your network. Basically, it sounds like that connection is getting interrupted which would explain why you're unable to change champions or mastery/runes.

Usually the client is able to reconnect, but perhaps it doesn't always and then this happens?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-28T22:46:56.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayyyyy you might actually be onto something here. Do me a favor and also try an ethernet connection really quickly as well to see if its the wifi signal or the actual connection that's giving you issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2017-08-30T15:41:48.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue is still not solved. It also happens during the queue now. We can't move closer to our router, but is there at least a way to fix the issue where we have to close the client, ctrl+alt+delete and end all league of legends processes before we can restart the client?\nI don't accept that it's all due to us having a bad connection. It's the game crashing when connection goes bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2017-08-28T23:31:25.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think it would happen when using a wire since I don't have these short disconnects. It doesn't happen every game so it's not as easy to reproduce. But I just wonder if there's a way to make the client not crash when I disconnect (it's happening about 1 in 3 games now and every time I have to remove LoL programs through ctrl+alt+del before being able to reboot the client).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
