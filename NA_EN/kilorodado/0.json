Do project hunt her?","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-11-22T02:35:24.962+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"PROJECT is a pretty bleak future, one with technology that borders on magic to us and revolves around control and belief. For Zoe we wanted to try something more upbeat and connected to our own world; urban fashion, near-future tech, bright graffiti colours, fun! I used a mood board similar to DJ Sona's for the pitch and the general idea was 'If DJ Sona is the world's most popular DJ, Zoe is the one stealing her stem files and distributing free Neil-Cicierega-esque mashups.' Having said that, DJ Sona is not really canon in any universe yet so they aren't officially connected, just saying she's not PROJECT Zoe. Ekko is a hacker in the PROJECT universe, so if we did do that skin she _might_ look similar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tears Of Flame","date":"2017-11-21T15:24:05.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meh...maybe....Star Guardian Zoe makes more sense though","replies":[{"poster":"ZedUsanGovos","date":"2017-11-21T16:20:50.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.

Hell if you wanna get technical the Video game based ones could even be in that universe as playable characters by said out of the system champs as fun propaganda entrenched video games.","replies":[{"poster":"YoRHa No5 Type N","date":"2017-11-21T14:56:24.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that's not realistic for what league is. What he/she meant imo is it could be possible she is apart of the project universe in league of legends and who knows maybe we'll get project Zoe one day.

Champions don't get two different skins for the same skinline. Lancer Blitz doesn't count-- it's the same skin, with two different fantasies and a few changes. I mean like Aatrox getting a Battlecast skin, since he already has Mecha-- or Dark Star Kha'Zix getting a Cosmic skin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZedUsanGovos","date":"2017-11-21T15:14:09.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, those four (Program, PROJECT, BC, and Mecha) ARE linked. However, I never thought of Arcade being a part of it. I assumed that it'd be separate, due to their retro particles being reminiscent of much older games-- games which would not usually exist at this point in time in the PROJECT Universe. \n\nIf we were to line up our world with the PROJECT world, the Mecha vs Battlecast (War of Metal) would take place in 2020 or so, the rise of the PROJECTS (First wave of PROJECT skins-- Overdrive) takes place in 2030-2040, as evidenced by the advanced technology in the city in Overdrive (Neo-Ionia, I believe), the G/NETIC program (Disruption and probably Hunters) would take place around 2050 (hehe Blade Runner 2049), as Ashe, Ekko, Kat, and possibly Vi and Vayne are much more advanced than the previous PROJECT models, and the Program skins would most likely be late 2070 or early 2080 (hehe Cyberpunk 2077).\n\nVery few games in our late 2010s are pixelated, which leads me to believe that the same could be assumed for PROJECT. Now, I'm not against the idea, but I personally don't think it'd take place at the same time. Perhaps BEFORE the War of Metal, but I doubt they're connected to the PROJECT Era.","replies":[{"poster":"Zerdun","date":"2017-11-21T15:36:23.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking that they could also be from a something similar to an intentionally retro game design as well. Think similar to cuphead. The Game is smooth but seriously the game almost looks like it belongs on the genesis/SNES or an old disney cartoon (some scroller type games looked really really nice for their time) \n\nIf we are considering linking the Hacker Zoe as a part of the Project Universe we could also potentially link the video game based skins to the hacker skin and forge a tie in there. \n\nThe Arcade line of skins seem to have two sides, one being the actual arcade players, sona, ahri, Ez, ect. While others have significantly more pixelation to their design like Veig. Then when looking at the Hacker Zoe skin, with her artwork and champion design I would swear she belongs somewhere around both lines. This is considering how her hair has those see through rectangular particles falling out of it and the color shifts after certain distances.","replies":[{"poster":"ZedUsanGovos","date":"2017-11-21T16:20:12.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mhm. I mean, to be fair, we haven't actually seen much of the actual city that PROJECT takes place in. We've only had two cinematics and a gamemode which only showcase the upper parts of the buildings, and the recent cinematic only shows this little alleyway where Vi, Vayne, and Jhin meet. For that reason, I haven't seen anything to prove that the PROJECT Era would be the kind of Era to have video game propaganda. But along the same line, I haven't seen anything against it. Who knows? Rito will just have to clear it up themselves.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
