When I download a replay from the LoL client it works fine, my issue is that when I click the drop down menu and pick a player that I want to follow it doesn't actually lock the player down. Let's say I am watching a replay and I want to watch a specific player, this is the bar Riot gives us. \r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/kPJhn\r\n\r\nThe replay bar is at the very bottom of the game and if you accidentally touch the bottom of the screen then the player you wanted to follow gets reset back to manual mode. Even if I don't touch the bottom of the screen with my mouse and I just jump around the replay of the game, the player I choose to follow gets reset. If I want to follow a player can it actually lock onto him? I don't want it going back to the manual or automatic camera just because I accidentally touched the bottom of the screen.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-22T02:13:44.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should be able to double click on a champion to center that camera on them, but if you hit the border of the screen at all it *will* cancel the camera focus.  You could also try locking the screen movement while watching replays, though I'm not actually entirely sure if that option will work.","replies":[]}]}
