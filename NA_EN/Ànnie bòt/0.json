Your analogy is flawed; It assumes that breaking the rules of one game would be equivalent to posting a bad comment about a game providing service.

Riot has a very simple system of escalating punishment tiers: 10-game chat restriction, 25-game restriction, two-week ban, perma-ban. Since you didn't do anything to warrant an escalating punishment, that tells us you had already received your two-week ban, and with it, an explicit warning that you were one punishment away from a perma. \n-Indefinite chat suspensions were used several years back by Riot, and found to be ineffectual. People just racked up thousands of games of chat restrictions, and expressed toxicity in other ways.

I'm sure you're not really a toxic player you were just frustrated -- and League itself enables toxicity. You don't even need players for it to be toxic, it already is.\n\nI recently got a chat restriction because I was frustrated. I'll admit I went a little too far perhaps, but I was literally losing several games in a row due to AFKers, supports who weren't \"supporting\" or buying sighstones, and people all in intentionally 1 v 5 scenarios. The ints would go into chat and say \"I'm tilted I'm tilted\" yadda yadda yadda. \n\nSo I call those people out two games in a row, and I get reported and restricted. My first ever disciplinary in this game all happened over night. I'm a bit upset about it because I suspect the other players who were the true toxic as hell people received no disciplinary. For throwing the games and making sure the opponent won.\n\nWhat I learned from this though, if you solo queue do yourself a favor and just /mute all. I went from Like 75lp in G2 all the way to G4 over night because of these types of players. Never in my life, have I hit a losing streak like this.\n\nAnd now every time I log in, I get a notification showing what I did in those two games and exactly what I said. Like holy crap Riot, are you trying to piss me off by never letting me live that down? Just more stuff built into this game that enables more toxicty. Seeing that every time I log in pisses me off.
