I'm wondering how many times do you have to get leaverbuster in order to get banned or suspended.\n\nSo like, if I were to get low-priority queue for 20 minutes once, and then I leave 1 more game, would that get me a suspension?\n\nOr does it just depend on the consistency of leaving games in order to get banned or suspended?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-20T15:24:07.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, Leaverbuster won't penalize you for just one game but anything after that is free game.  If your leaves are consistent or have a history of leaving, then you face the risk of having your lower priority queue escalated.  We won't really suspend you unless the leaves are intentional, but the down time period is a chance for you to troubleshoot whatever is causing you to leave.","replies":[{"poster":"ProPatricko","date":"2017-10-21T04:45:17.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ohhh, I understand now.
