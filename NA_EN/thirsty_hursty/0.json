I was not racist, I swore a little bit but most of it was me saying I'm not ganking a feeding lane and the fact we are losing due to teams negativity. My team found this to be negative community behaviour.\r\n\r\nNow to be fair about a year ago I had a 2 week suspension for the same thing but this was a year ago. I reformed, had a couple drinks one night a year later, woke up and and had a chat log for TWO games. \r\n\r\nRiot is just looking for reasons to ban accounts permanently so players make new accounts and spend it all over again. I'm not that stupid, I know I'm sportsmanlike, I receive honourable awards consecutively. i dont deserve to have every dime I spent taken away\r\n\r\nWe as the community need to step up to riot and ask for them to stop stealing our money, or we leave. This game is not a job, it's a game and riot needs to treat it so. Even if you have never been banned ever, you will one day because of a premade you got placed with doesn't like your jungling route, and you retaliated and stuck up for yourselves. s the skins are nice. However, if you're worried about toxicicity then just remove chat for silver and bronze. That simple. Don't steal our money, come up with a better solution.\r\n\r\nThis is the biggest game in the world and it's actuallly fading now because of Nazi Riot. \r\n\r\nI will be starting a Reddit group and a few communities to perhaps transition into some better MOBA developers and games such as DOTA (whom riot stole the game from). \r\n\r\nThis is riots only cash cow. They are good for absolutely nothing else. You wanna ban players not used to established communities? You wanna punish punish punish instead of nurture a little ? Perfect. Let's take our money elsewhere. We are the customers. We write their paycheques. \r\n\r\nLet's leave and go somewhere better. LoL is nothing but a joke now hence the acronym. Paying these people only obligates them to ban us. If they weren't making money , they wouldn't be able to afford to ban us permanently. Chat restrict ? Fair. 2 week suspension? Fair. No awards ? Fair. Perma ban? Line crossed. Bottom line. Let's put riot in the dirt.","replies":[{"poster":"Reformed Kensei","date":"2017-09-18T09:31:02.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's really retarded solution to permaban toxic players. \nSeriously when u flame u get chat restriction, so why not just restrict chat for good?

RIOT LOGIC\n\n\nFirst and foremost, how do you know the people who called you those things have NOT been punished?\n\nAnd secondly, this is a game where communication is key, so when you are permanently chat restricted you pose a detriment to your team and also, Riot simply does not WANT toxic people in this game, they think people who are that toxic simply do not DESERVE to play LoL.","replies":[{"poster":"Reformed Kensei","date":"2017-09-19T10:08:58.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some got, some didn't.

But in Riot eyes inting, and trolling is not toxic, so if you remove chat for flaming players boom you removed toxic behavior from the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-18T00:55:12.479+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was able to find the other account you were referring to, the one with the ban currently on it.
