If you queue or get autofilled support them you get an in-game passive that only allows you to buy items queued in the shop for supports only. They can do it for melee only, so why not support. And in champ select if you want to role swap make there be some way to give someone else the passive before champ select ends and thr game begins. You cannot give someone else the passive once in game.\n\nOr even make support only versions of all the summs. Kind of like how you cant't buy jungle items if you don't bring smite? Can't buy support only items unless you bring Heal (Support Passive) or Ignite (Support passive), and again if someone brings this version of summoners, no one else can.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosReyn","date":"2019-11-27T20:02:24.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But ADCs use heal, and multiple lanes use ignite.","replies":[{"poster":"kaijukitten","date":"2019-11-29T06:02:29.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ChaosReyn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Osh22WzA,comment-id=000200000000000000000001,timestamp=2019-11-27T20:02:24.551+0000)\n>\n> But ADCs use heal, and multiple lanes use ignite.\n\nIt's just an example. There'd be a Support Version of every summoner (except maybe Smite, idk), and again, only one person on the team could take the Support versions of the summoners. So whatever 2 summoners they took whether they be Exhaust (Support) or Teleport (Support), Flash (Support), Barrier (Support) etc. No one else would be able to take the support version of the Summoners after someone has taken any. And it wouldn't change anything about the actual Summoner spells except give the support a passive in game that allows them and only them to buy the initial support items.\n\nSo you queue up in lobby, you are support role. If this is draft the game automatically gives you the support version of the summoners like it'll give you Smite if you queue up jungle without already having it procced, if you were autofilled then you can change your summoners to the normal version and whoev wants to take Support role can put on the support version of whatever summoners they want. Or nobody takes the support version of the Summoner Spells and nobody can buy one of the beginning support items. They can still buy any other items they want. Doran's Ring, a Luden's, Armor, Warmog's, whatever. But they can't buy a Spellthief's, Relic Shield, Steel Shoulderguard's, or Spectral Sickle UNLESS they have a Support Summoner Spell, which again, only one person on the team can have.\n\nOnce one person on the team has taken a Support summoner spell, no one else on the team can. \n\nSo the ADC can still have regular Heal and Ignite, while the support would have Heal (Support) and Ignite (Support), which would still do the exact same thing as the originals, but give support's a passive that allows them and only them to buy beginner support items. \n\nIf there's an easier way to do this like the way they restrict some items to be Melee only and some to be Ranged only then I would welcome that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CrimsonRakan","date":"2019-11-26T15:02:05.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They did it to jungle and tied it to smite now it’s time to give it to supports","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosReyn","date":"2019-11-27T20:01:45.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue is just that: it's tied to smite.\n\nWhat are they tying the support items to?

If you make the items \"support only,\" well, I ask you, what constitutes a support? There are many champions who can be played support or in another lane/role. Vel'Koz, Brand, Lux, and Senna immediately come to mind, just to name a few. If you limit it to the champions who generally play support, they'll be picked in other lanes more and the items will still be abused in a roundabout way. If you limit them to people who are selected as the support in champion select by the system, what happens if the support and another laner decide to lane swap? There is no official system in place for that, though I think that there should be. And even then, what about picks such as Miss Fortune support that the pros used as a counter pick to Zyra a few years ago? Locking them to support leaves them with a wide variety of \"what-ifs\" that easily can come up, not to mention that they would have to add in an exception for each of these items in the code to allow a new champion designed for support to take them. Supports have a wide enough range of champions that they can't just make them melee or range only, and a wide enough variety of summoner spells that they can't just limit them to if you've taken exhaust, and on top of that, champions in middle lane also frequently take both exhaust and ignite. Unless they designed a summoner spell for support specifically that was detrimental enough for other roles that they wouldn't take it, but still appealing enough for supports to want to take it over all of their other options, similar to what Smite is for junglers, there just isn't a way to limit them to \"the person who's playing support role.\" Balancing the items to be detrimental enough to other roles, in the current case, their gold generation over the course of the game, is the only real way to even attempt to make gold income items work. They could remove gold income items entirely and just bring back Sightstone, 800 gold for some HP and 3 wards that refilled when you based, but that would also be counterintuitive, as the supports would then no longer have gold income, and support items would have to have their costs lowered as a means of making them cost effective from the support's perspective. Which would make them abusable for other roles because now you have items that are 150-200% gold efficient from the perspective of another role. Then all of support itemization would have to be balanced with the other roles in mind to make sure that the stats they give can't be abused. See how this keeps looping around? No, making them balanced from the perspective of the support by limiting the gold that other roles get using the item is the only balanced way to make it work. And yes, they will take some time to balance out just right. But increasing gold income is a risky thing in a game like League of Legends.","replies":[{"poster":"PalPlays","date":"2019-11-25T04:31:59.741+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have met a wall of text that I refuse to surmount.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Modnar Erom","date":"2019-11-30T19:32:15.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They don't even have to create support only items.
