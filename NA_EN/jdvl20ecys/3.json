But I would never say to messi or Justin Gatlin that just cause they are pros that dose not mean they know more.\r\nI'm almost never played game before Stopped be able to take run. I still can't run(I can but then I almost can't walk next day).\r\nI'm a smart kid to top 5% for sure. And actully really good looking, think Rekkles(we are from the same country, same colours) but im a little more posterboy handsome. \r\n\r\nBut the reason I'm dimond do I should even be low master if did not derp and tilt so much( that master prom.... Got one troll in the first game that I got pissed with then I had him in my three next games.. Lost them all.. Then tilt to dimond 3...)\r\nSo I watch scarras stream(he is very educational) and lcs china Korea. Listen to what the pros say and do. Constantly watch surrender20 and I experiment a lot and I was soraka mid, jungle, top god before they start play it in lcs and got her nerfed and reworked. I start play kassadin after the rework and had sick scoree when he was considerd trash and got buffed then 100 pick ban before gutted. Still play him. I hate is weak mid game but I know all matchups with him and build paths you can take. I miss the dfg dcap void Zhonya rush kassadin. Wreck dose pesky dongers. I probably the only high elo player that played and have succes with full ap corcki. Even carried games from top lane with him against renekton when he was god of top. So many people want to report me when I play Jana, soraka top mid to I have insane win rates with them. I knew and played sejuani long before chinderhulk right when she got her number changes in her kit(mini rework) that she was really strong and that chinderhulk would break her in the jungle. \r\n\r\nWhat I try to say is that I played lots of champs in lots if rolls. I'm dimond cause I have great game knowledge. Was just 1 and a half years since I was silver scrub and said \"wut wu whatt\" when ap Rengar kill me from no where in 0.3 sec and I had no idea why. The massive difference between then and now when it's comes to the champs, using smart cast, items and overall game play is what  made me become dimond.","replies":[]}
