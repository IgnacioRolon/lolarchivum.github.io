It's crazy.","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:136}} I love this Dragon. I love this Dragon so gosh darned. His Star mechanics allow for some damn good skin potential, and I just want some skin dreams to come to life. Here are some of those ideas. \r\nStarting off silly.....\r\n\r\n\r\nSurprise Party Aurelion Sol \r\nPassive: Balloons float around Ao Shin and make little rubbery noises when the hit someone. \r\nQ: Either a big smiley face is formed, getting happier as it flies, or Aurelion prepares a small cupcake that grows and grows into a bigger cake.\r\nW: Duh, the balloons go further out\r\nE: Aurelion flies around with party favors, making noise along the way with those little blowy noise maker things. \r\nR: He screams out a huge line of confetti and whipped cream and yells &quot;HAPPY BIRTHDAY&quot;, or &quot;SUPRISE&quot;, or something along those lines. \r\n\r\n\r\nDeep Sea Aocean....I MEAN DEEP SEA AURELION SOL! \r\nPassive: Either bubbles floating around Aurelion, or little tiny fish that either look very silly or very intimidatingly creepy ((like little anglerfish or piranhas) \r\nQ: A whirlpool is formed and or a big ol&#039; bubble\r\nW: spread out those fish/bubbles\r\nE: Aurelion Swims through the air\r\nR: Spews out a bunch of water\r\nAurelion himself has spooky angler stuff and bioluminescent patterns all over him, letting him still shine like a star, but from deep under the sea\r\n\r\n\r\nFireCracker Aurelion Sol\r\nHe&#039;d look like the Chinese Lion things. Lion Dance Kog&#039;maw illustrates the idea well enough, only now it&#039;d be on an egotistical dragon. \r\nPassive: Little rockets or flaring firecracker sparks \r\nQ: A big mesh of smoke and when it reaches the end it goes off like a big firecracker. \r\nW: Spread out those firecrackers\r\nE: A trail of smoke trails behind aurelion and firecrackers spark when he stops traveling. \r\nR: Smoke and firecrackers flare out of Aurelions mouth, and or he just breathes out a bunch of fire. \r\n\r\nAnyway, those are just some ideas I had. ((I&#039;m really hoping for that surprise party Aurelion Sol. He&#039;d make the best spoiled birthday boy)).
