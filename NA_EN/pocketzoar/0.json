Im not entirely sure why im getting matched with these guys. I have played as of today maybe 20 games total. Never played a moba before this. \r\n\r\nNormally i start the match asking for a lane im comfortable playing then i tell then i let them know im a new player and still learning.\r\n\r\nI just find it odd that as a low level account and a new player people in my matches are talking about being high ranked on main accounts.\r\n\r\nHow do I get around the toxic stuff. I dont want to globaly mute because i want to learn to comunicate with my team. I really enjoy the game itself but so far the playerbase has been not very welcoming of new players.\r\n\r\nAny advice other then uninstall?","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-02-11T21:37:11.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you don't want to mute them, then you can learn to ignore them if they aren't providing with anything constructive. \n\nSometimes they are trying to give feedback, just that they don't have enough time ingame to type a proper response. e.g. Sometimes after you die, they \"?\" ping your body or just ask \"why?\". If you look at that from a feedback standpoint, it means that you did something out of their expectations. So you can fire a question back and ask \"what should i have done instead?\". Some people will be nice and type it out. Some will just say \"noob, kys\", and you can't expect good feedback from them in game, so just ignore them. You'll also get different results when you ask after the game instead. So you can respond back to them \"can I ask you more about ____ play again after the game?\", the nice people will probably stay and teach you something. \n\nNote that there are periods of toxicity spike when a certain population is off a premise (6 letter word starting with \"sch\" and ends with \"l\") and some of them really don't have the best communication skills.","replies":[{"poster":"POCKETZOAR","date":"2017-02-11T22:44:19.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play with a diamond ranked friend who usually jungles and assists my lane if i fall behind.

They gave zero feedback.

I'd suggest that you play custom games 1v5 vs bots to learn to cs, learn the champions etc. After you get comfortable with moving around the map, handling your character, learning basic things like kiting, csing and after you get used to some champions, attempt to play PvPs again. You're gonna find a lot of toxic players, so it'd be better if you learned the game vs bots to some extent than going into PvP situations.","replies":[{"poster":"POCKETZOAR","date":"2017-02-11T22:39:20.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, i guess I just assumed that being a new player riot would have a system to match me with other new players.\n\nI didnt realize my first PvP match as level 6 would i would be with smurfs. I guess they cant recognize smurf accounts vs new player accounts.\n\nWhile bot matches teach me to cs and use different champions the rest is pretty much a steam roll.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-02-12T16:25:06.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After a while you're supposed to be only matched with people of your own level. Riot said sometime ago that by level 10 (I think? something like it) smurfs should only be playing with other smurfs. If you're already level 14 it should be already time for the matchmaking system to have figured everyone out. You're probably actually above your level in terms of skill or you're getting matched with smurfs that are actually super baddies (not all smurfs know how to play the game).\n\nAlso I really advise you to start muting all, specially if you're still learning the game. 8/10 times people won't be helpful to you at all, and even when they mean well it's often bad advice. It will also teach you to communicate with pings, which is an important skill to have.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-12T06:23:48.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me in game, same username as here.

It sucks. It really sucks. But its the best option. Don't subject yourself to the depravity of the player base. Or play with friends who don't care if you are new and will teach you things. You should ignore the communication part for now since you are learning the game anyways. Communicate with pings for now and later when you feel confident with your play you can start to keep chat open and realize it is still garbage to look at.","replies":[{"poster":"POCKETZOAR","date":"2017-02-11T22:47:33.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really apriciate that. Mute all and practicing my pings is a good idea. Just sucks i guess there isnt a way via IP to flag toxic smurfs and pair them together.\n\nI dont mind playing with and against smurfs. Infact I learn a lot playing against a good smurf.
