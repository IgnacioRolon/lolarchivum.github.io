They out-roated my team and played an insane split push game that was only possible since they were on voice comm (pretty obvious since they were premade and the derisiveness of the calls). Heres were the fun part is to my knowledge there were ZERO PREMADES on my team (didn&#039;t see any matching club tags on my side). So now its 5 RANDOMS vs a TRIO how in the fuck is that fair? Why do they get to have more influence on the game than any of us solos? I had to try to explain to my team that we had to give an inhib and try to fight the 4v5 but they wouldn&#039;t budge they walk between mid and top in the end losing both inhibs without getting anything done. I tried my best to carry that game I really did but in the end 1 &lt; 3.","replies":[{"poster":"Blanchimont","date":"2016-06-17T05:14:59.001+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not fair. This is a massive problem with Dynamic Queue and premades. The quality of teamwork in a premade is much higher and honestly, I don't think it can ever be fair when it comes to playing with larger groups. A group that has played together for a long time will have a massive advantage that cannot be measured by MMR. Sadly, they still do not let you opt out of being matched with premades.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2016-06-17T19:22:00.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't have to remove names from your match history.

The issue is that you can't assume that you do't have a 3 man premade or a pair of 2 man premades on your own team, just because they don't have the same tags. If you ask them they can just lie and you can't prove anything.

Theoretically, the system tries to match premades vs premades, but practiacally it changes the parameters the longer you are in que to prevent absurdly long que times, so in high elos it actually happens quite frequently that soloplayers face premades in order to keep que time 'reasonable'(still quite long though)\nThis is statistically proven for master/challenger http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/4tsuGXEq-dynamic-queue-statistics-for-61977-matches\n\nAt highest elos, the player base grows so thin that it can get hard for the system to find another fitting 3 man premade or two duos.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoLKiru","date":"2016-06-17T21:40:09.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Sword Dancer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=37VUuZBR,comment-id=000a00000000,timestamp=2016-06-17T21:02:36.117+0000)\n>\n> They are definitely premade, thats not up for debate.

It makes me sick playing with people who are intentionally feeding and griefing because they have friends in the game with them. \n\nlast game i had a 3 group on my team. They ran around all game literally running into 5 of the enemy to fight them, no matter what anyone said. They would flash walls for \"fun\" and just general greifing. The game before that, the dude said they were premade. Thresh goes 1/16 bot lane and they are just laughing. \n\nIt is so sad. Makes me bored of ranked. It seems 2/3 games go something like what i described. I wish they would change how you got lp. Make each game worth 25 lp and you get points for doing certain things.

If you could invite the 4 other randoms (or even 2-3 of the randoms) into a curse voice client it already increases your effectiveness as a team, even without any practice, by a huge amount. But Riot has been loathe to add it due to the added toxicity and difficulty of management that that creates, and any attempt at creating an outside client has fallen flat (curse voice comes to mind as something that lasted for all of 10 seconds as a pick-up voice comm).\n\nThe League community isn't compatible with DQ, but I don't actually think it has a thing to do with DQ. It has more to do with the fact that League players will probably never start making attempts to voice comm without Riot adding it, and when they do add it so many people will probably be toxic so as to make the system useless. But it's just hilarious to me to watch these players complain to Riot about DQ when the problem is a community that refuses to communicate with their team, with some solo players taking it as far as never typing in game at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-06-17T17:41:05.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"They are allowed to do this because everyone can do this.
