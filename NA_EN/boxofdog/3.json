They can help you secure kills, siege towers, sometimes even give you vision!\nBut what can we learn from them? That&#039;s what I&#039;m going to go into here.\n\nHere&#039;s an example:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fb0ntrV.jpg\n\nAs you can see, minions are sectioned into three rows. \nFront line, middle of the fight, and back line.\nAs well as three different kinds of minions! (Excluding super minions, which I&#039;ll go into later)\nMelee, Cannon, and Caster.\n\nIn the image I showed above, I colored a number of the minions based on their position and goal.\nLets get into the basics of their positioning, working our way backwards from the front.\n\n\n**The Front Line _(Colored in Yellow)_**\nThe front line is composed of Melee Minions, who have quite a bit of health but deal little damage.\nThey tank the damage for the higher priority targets and distract the enemy focus in the fight.\n_You can classify these guys as the Tanks, such as Leona, Maokai, Braum, Sion, etc._\n\n\n**Middle of The Fight _(Colored in Green)_**\nTechnically the cannon minion has a lot of health AND deals a lot of damage, so we&#039;ll classify him as a Bruiser (I&#039;m using this term VERY loosely).\nBruisers can be in the front or the middle, they have a decent amount of health and deal plenty of damage.\nTheir job is to deal the big damage that lowers the effort for the tanks. Generally they find themselves in the middle (depending on the champ) because they are a high priority in the team-fight, both keeping the back line safe, and the enemy front line dead.\n_These are champions like Jayce, Diana, Gangplank, Swain, etc._\n\n\n**The Back Line _(Colored in Blue)_**\nThe Caster Minions! These little guys die so quickly, but they dish out most of the big damage. They&#039;re ranged, cute and small but mighty (Kinda like Veigar ;D).\nThese guys melt the melee minions up front and seek to make the enemy&#039;s job an uphill battle.\nThey&#039;re in the back because they have so little health! They can get killed pretty easily, so they&#039;re being protected by 2 entire other layers!\nBest examples of the back line can be the ADC, support, long range mages..\n_On terms of champions I&#039;d say Caitlyn, Xerath, Sona, Tristana, Lux, etc._\n\n\n**The Assassin _(Colored in Red)_**\nNow I know that assassins do a lot of damage and that melee minion in red doesn&#039;t do that, but for all intents and purposes.. He&#039;s an assassin.. for a number of reasons.\nThe minion colored in red has one goal: To get to the back line and delete them, much like a real assassin. They want to get rid of the highest damage as soon as possible, so that EVERYTHING becomes easier. Like hitting the tower, getting inhib, or kicking at a champion&#039;s heels!\nUnlike the melee minion, real assassins have little health, but a whole lot of burst damage (as opposed to sustained, constant damage). Once their abilities are on cooldown, they can&#039;t do much. So they gotta get in, kill, get out.\n_Examples include LeBlanc, Ahri, Shaco, Rengar, Kassadin, etc._\n\n**Super Minions**\nSuper minions is the fed person who just kills er&#039;body :P That&#039;s it.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\nUnlike a real team-fight, a minion fight is over a pretty long period of time, and it&#039;s easy to analyze.\nIn a real team-fight, where you are may seem insignificant since it&#039;s condensed into just a few seconds.. But your positioning makes a world of difference.\n\nThat&#039;s it!

Caster minion is stuck at 85 at that point and Siege is having 140.
