Easily my second favorite team. I want both teams to go to worlds, and the only way that&#039;s happening is if CLG wins against TSM.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-08-24T06:12:29.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except CLG has step down on the gas pedal ever since they broke out of their slump. This isn't just a lucky run they got going. \n\nTheir biggest weakness was how they would get overconfident and make overly aggressive plays that ended up backfiring, They are doing that still, but to a significantly less degree and when they usually do it, they're almost always so far in gold lead that it almost doesn't matter if they have one slip up. \n\nThe synergy between Aphromoo and XSmithie is unmatched by few other duos right now in the LCS, the shoutcasters even made a comment about that. \n\nZionSpartan is a monster in the top lane, he has a massive champion pool and he can play carry top laners so well. I don't think there are many if any top laners in the NA LCS at least who could have made that amazing outplay he did using Gnar against the Naut/Yasuo coming after him. \n\nDoublelift, as much as I dislike his trash talking and his character, his performance is starting to live up to his words and has really cut down on his over aggression which was often the reason that would cost CLG games like this. \n\nThis is the most complete and strongest the players on CLG have been in years. \n\nTSM may not be the team they used to be a year ago, but they are certainly no pushover and its incredibly stupid to not give credit to CLG for playing so dominantly. TSM is a strong team nonetheless, they just need to adjust their playstyle and its not something that happens overnight. \n\nPeople are calling this an upset but honestly, my money was on CLG from the get go, I would have been shocked to have seen TSM win this series, CLG has reached a new level of playing that they haven't hit before. \n\nP.S. C9 fan, dislike CLG and TSM, so not a fan boy of either in particular.\n\nIf you look at all 5 position, you could make a case that 3 of the five position, the top player in the NA of that respective role is on CLG. ZionSpartan makes a very strong case, Aphromoo, no questions about it, and DoubleLift, with the way he's been playing lately has recently thrown his hat into the ring. Don't discredit CLG's success as being a fluke. \n\nThink about this, their weakest link is most likely XSmithie. That's fucking scary to think about as a team playing against them.

Problem is, the other two are not quite up to the caliber needed to be considered a triple threat. \n\nCLG I think poses a chances to run deep in the world, they play as a team and this series showed it, Zion got MVP, but honestly, its a slap in the face to the rest of the team to say he was the single best player, their entire team was on point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yordle Xayah","date":"2015-08-19T17:30:07.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"For how they are playing, there's no way **TSM** could win this.\nBut it's NA, so who knows.","replies":[{"poster":"BoxOfDOG","date":"2015-08-23T00:43:52.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FNC Maria,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=z7m6iP73,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-19T17:30:07.717+0000)\n>\n> For how they are playing, there's no way **TSM** could win this.\n> But it's NA, so who knows.\n\nYou're contradicting yourself.

I just think you guys are one of the most awesome fanbase in the LCS, and you deserve so much more than today's display. I was bashing on **C9** a while ago for the exact same thing. Such a meaningful brand as **TSM** shouldn't be treated as it is. They have a prestige they are not respecting. They haven't innovated since Katowice in spring, and it came back to chase them today.\n\nI'm not being salty, I'm just passionate about competitive league. I play in **NA**, I want the region to send off their best teams, and if **TSM** are gonna play as they did today, it's not gonna be pretty.
