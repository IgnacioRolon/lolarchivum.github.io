I've been working with Riot Support for a few weeks as well, and I have literally tried everything you could imagine.  I've looked through all the forums with the same or similar problems.\r\n\r\nI've changed my DNS to a public Google DNS.  \r\n\r\nTurned off my ppv6 (as I was instructed to do)\r\n\r\nHave ran WinMTR on both my desktop and laptop (because it works on my laptop on the same internet connection)\r\n\r\nMessed around with permission settings in the properties tab on the game client\r\n\r\nRan Hextech a millions times, and half a million times it crashed.\r\n\r\nDisabled Cortana from windows\r\n\r\nRan troubleshooting on the league client \r\n\r\nThat's all I can think of that I've done off the top of my head.  Any help and/or fresh ideas will be much appreciated.  Oh and sometimes it will randomly allow me to log in and I'm not sure what it triggering this.

They suggested you shoot those traceroutes over to your ISP to make sure they're aware that there's currently a problem with their routing which is causing such a large amount of packet loss. \n\nPacket loss happens before your connection ever reaches our servers, and it's not caused by any settings on your own network or pc, it just happens with bad routing or improperly working nodes that your ISP uses.","replies":[]}]}
