I also love how the bans are split up between people so that it&#039;s more of a group choice, and nobody&#039;s thinking &quot;Man I hope I get first pick so I can ban Bard. I hate that guy.&quot; Also, it&#039;s so easy to just pick your champ, discuss, revise, and be happy with your choice, and in agreement with your team... Except instead of discussing, I got some guy spamming &quot;when you tri your hardest but dont sucedd&quot; over and over until somebody dodged. Oh, and let me tell you about the dodging. Wait, no. Let me show you.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RvsMXWn.png\n\nAs the queue takes long enough as it is, it just doesn&#039;t work when you wait 5-10 minutes for everybody to pick their champs, but then have somebody dodge at the last second and be shoved back into matchmaking. I never even got to play a  game, because I was stuck in queue for 50 minutes, then my client suddenly froze and put me back into the role selection screen. (Which is just a small bug, and isn&#039;t even the problem here.) At that point I gave up on trying to get in a game.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/7vxP4Vm.png\n\nAhem. Well, anyway, those are just my thoughts on it, but I do think the all around experience is great (as long as you don&#039;t get dodgers, which you will.) My suggestion is that this is a selection mode that will be unlocked at Gold, or maybe Plat, where things have settled down a bit. Those are my thoughts, so what are yours?\n\n----------------------\n**TL;DR:**\n - Overall pretty good design\n - Took 50 minutes before I gave up trying to get in game\n - Longer set up time makes dodgers 10x worse\n - Should only be unlocked at gold+ where dodgers can't reach with their grimy hands\n\n**Rating:** (I just wanted to use these emotes)\n3/5 Rito plz's\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Shroom Junkie","date":"2015-11-06T02:46:43.862+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well this is in the PBE right? Its probably just because there's less people playing. A lot.

The PBE doesn't have too many, and I had I think around 9 or 10 before I gave up on trying to get into a game. Imagine the live servers. Plus, at this point in time I had to wait to get in because the login servers were full, and all other queues are disabled so players have to test the new queue. I think there were a decent amount of players on.","replies":[{"poster":"DeynaTaggerung","date":"2015-11-06T05:17:10.734+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even with plenty of people on I'd still say that people dodging in PBE isn't necessarily a good showcase of how it will be on live.

But when the queue time shortens up you should get games a lot faster after a dodge so it won't be nearly as tedious. Especially with all the people wanting to try out the new queue, early in the update you should get a game within seconds.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Devack The Holy","date":"2015-11-06T13:10:55.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I've had a queue pop after about ten minutes on PBE, which isn't outside the norm for me, and after a client freeze, forcing a restart, I got another pop about ten minutes later that went into a game. As for the dodgers, you're going to get a lot of people who only want to test the new champ select, and don't care about testing the AD rework stuff. When this hits live, it should be a different thing.\n\nAlso, limiting the new champ select to Gold+ is rather pointless. It kinda defeats the purpose behind the new system in the first place, which is to improve the ranked experience. And, sad as it may seem, most of the ranked playerbase is in Bronze and Silver.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-11-06T06:58:57.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The few days after the patch comes out are gonna be a nightmare.
