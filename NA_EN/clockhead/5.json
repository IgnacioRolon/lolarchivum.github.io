It's supposed to say \"So I thought TO give Windows 10 a chance\"\n\n**tl;dr:** Is gud.\n\nHonestly, it wasn&#039;t a mistake. I had Windows 7 on my computer before I had upgraded, but I was really iffy about it at first. I was one of the many scarred Windows 8 beta testers, which was even worse than the official release of the version, (yeah, I know, it seems impossible), and I had honestly lost all hope of Microsoft after using it for a long time. It was Windows, but there was this whole new element of unnecessary apps and things I would never use and never needed, and I felt like Microsoft was a door to door salesman trying to stuff a ton of needless lousy apps in my face. I hadn&#039;t heard any reviews or things about 10 when it came out, but some friends told me about it, and how they liked it a lot. I had decided to look at some reviews and screenshots, and it seemed pretty nice. Though still iffy because of 8, (something I will forever resent Microsoft for) I tried it. I think Microsoft had realized the huge ass mistake they made, and brought it back to a familiar state, and it made me happy. I still don&#039;t really use the apps at all, and just use the dedicated space to store frequently used programs. I find it more visually appealing, and very easy to get used to switching from 7, as opposed to how 8 was completely uncharted land. I suggest upgrading to it. Even if you have Windows XP or 98, or actually, especially so. Take it from me, somebody who dislikes Microsoft and always will (even though I use their products but shut up we all use comcast, but nobody likes them so no judge), it&#039;s actually worth it to switch.","replies":[]}
