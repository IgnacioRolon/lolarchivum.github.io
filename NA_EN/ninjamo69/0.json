I played a game of zed and since I have championship zed I decided to use it. But it said I didn't have it even bought. After the game, I restarted the client thinking it was a bug and I checked my refund page and it said I \"refunded\" two skins, championship zed and TPA ezreal. I never clicked onto the store. Has this happened to anyone before? If it has what did you do, I already submitted a ticket. Also, I'm not lying because I want my skins back.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-22T02:52:40.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submitting a ticket was the best move here. It sounds like your account may have been accessed by someone else.

I was wondering If you knew if there was a possibility of me getting my refund tokens back and my championship skin. I don't really care about the ezreal skin but since the zed skin isn't available anymore I would really want it back.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-22T23:02:26.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible, but the specialist that is assigned your ticket will need to investigate and make that call with you.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
