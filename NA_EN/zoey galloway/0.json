No emails to confirm they got my money, no emails for the items I should have received, nothing. Could someone maybe tell me how long it took them to receive an email?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-14T21:41:43.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on what tier you selected, I think.

I checked my junk mail and nothings there unfortunately. However i do have an order number there and it says my payment was successful! :D So i know they got my money, which is a relief! Now do I just wait 4-16 weeks to receive my items? Sorry, I realise you might not know and I appreciate the help either way!","replies":[]}]}]}
