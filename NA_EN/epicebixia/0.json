Confused, I clicked around my screen for about 60 seconds until I was kicked out to the menu screen. I re-queued, having to wait 5 minutes as a penalty before I could enter a game. I entered another game and the same bug happened. This time I have to wait 15 minutes to be able to queue once again. This penalty is completely unfair and I am not going to wait 15 minutes just to have the possibility of another black screen, and a longer ban. Can someone _**please**_ help?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-29T03:09:27.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically that kind of black screen in champ select is caused by an unstable connection with the servers your network needs to connect with in order to have champ select function properly.
