They NEVER instantly release a champion with a patch. EVER. They ALWAYS roll out skins/champs/events etc. THROUGHOUT the patch to give people something to look towards. Kayn will most likely be out later today unless something comes up in which case he'll probably be delayed a day or two. \n\nBe. Fucking.

There is tons of code involved with theses patches and if they just dumped it all in it would be harder to trace the source if an issue came up. New characters are a huge change so it is always best to make sure the rest of the patch goes through before introducing a new element.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rockm Sockm","date":"2017-07-12T12:12:02.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They never turn the new champion on until a ways into the patch.","replies":[]}]}
