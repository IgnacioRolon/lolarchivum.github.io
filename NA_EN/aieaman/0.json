I'm here to perhaps shed a little light and let you guys know Zac is not forgotten!*\n\nDefinitely don't think you're being rude! What I can tell you is that Zac's champ and stretchy tech is very difficult to work with, and that alone increases work time on him a lot. So using a popular community skin suggestion for him, Gentleman Zac - his clothes especially around his arms would have some crazy weighting and stretching issues. And it would also be really weird to see cloth stretching and turning into globs of goo haha I'd love to hear any suggestions on workarounds you may have to mitigate this!\n\nI know \"easy\" recolored skins have been suggested for Mr. Blob, but then it would seem unfair if say we released a 750RP Bubblegum Zac and have him wait a while for another skin instead of taking the time to make sure we make a super awesome blow-your-mind quality skin for him.","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2015-01-11T07:20:54.434+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering Zac's unique gooey appearance, how about a special *\"several simple skins for the price of one happy fun time Zac skin\"*-bundle?\n\n\nAnd by simple, I mean literal recolor. For instance, making a pink Zac rather than trying to do anything to make him look bubble-gummy.\n\n\nI mean, his base texture and appearance might look cool in a variety of different colours with little changes, like \"White Zac\", \"Black Zac\", etc.\n\n\nI don't know your client works, but if it's anything remotely close to Warcraft 3's editor, changing colour should be rather simple. And it's simplicity may allow you to create a bundle of cheap Zac skins sold at the price of one.\n--------------------\nDo note I'm not suggesting you do this for all champions, or anyone other than Zac. I mean do this bundle for Zac and literally just Zac as his nature would make a simple recolor look really cool.

To make Zac's arms stretch, I assume you are using a deformation gradient that defines how much each vertex follows the movement of the skeleton during the animations.\n\nIf pure red means following the shoulder end of the arm \"bones\" exactly, and pure blue means following the wrist end of the arm \"bones\" exactly, you just pick a particular shade of purple close to the floatie and make the entire floatie have that shade in the deformation gradient.
