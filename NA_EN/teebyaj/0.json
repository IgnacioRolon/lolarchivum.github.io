This is not a team to be some team to play some bullshit game and then leave after a few weeks. If you want to join you have to be able to meet some requirements listed below (As the team moves on if you do not meet these, I will and a following inc manager will have a talk with you and have to dismiss you from the team).\n\n1. Take consideration and make changes to those consideration.\n2. Listen to the shot caller\n3. This is a team game not a soloque, don't try to pull out the style points.\n\nThose are 3 main requirements for the team. Their will be prerequisites for the team as well. There will be tryouts held for positions (top has already been filled by me) I will be looking for certain aspects on the game play, such as warding, creep score, kill/death ratio, how well you are going against lanning opponent, take down of tower timer, dragon control, baron control. Everything.\n\nThere will be no subs on the team til further info. \n\nPrerequisites:\n1. No raging or flaming\n2. Have some sort of communication base (online use: ts or skype, for now we will use skype, later we will have a ts set up for us.)(Also all phone numbers when accepted will be needed to be contacted tournaments and practices purposes only).\n3. Ability to adapt to the game, not go soloque (Ex: if they're double adc such as jinx and ezreal get a Forzen Heart, instead of rushing Randuins Omen)\n\nWe will be able to flex with the schedule depending if you have school or work, their will be practices most of the week so make sure you are able.\n**\nCongrats to KittyCow to be our first analysis!!!**\n\nStaff:\nManager: TBA\nAnalysis: KittyCow\nCoach: TBA\n\nPlayers:\nTop: teebyaj\nJungle: TBA\nMid: TBA\nSupport: TBA\nADC: TBA\n\nWe will place in tournaments soon as our team is ready (meaning we have fixed our comps to perfections). Streams will be placed for our team and our games. \n\nRemember this is not a team that is to mess around with and join and try out for fun. This is where we change the scene and move to another level.\n\nFor Staff:\nI would like for you guys and gals to add me directly and talk to me personally about how you manage, analyze teams, and coaches on how you work the team to get better collaborations.\n\nFor Players:\nMessage down below info about yourself and the attitude you play with. Doesn't matter if I know you or not list some things down. Age does not matter. There will not be a deciding factor on the info below that will discriminate you from trying out or playing from the team. I just want a general info on how the team will work and communicate. Positives and negatives. As informed by people already placed info on here I will give you a general info, Place info on how you play and things you feel you are weak on. \n\n(Ex: My ign is teebyaj and I play top lane. I play really aggressive and tend to push to far without warding. Pushing too far cause ganks and tend for me to lose lane. I can usually make up for this taking tower and spilt pushing or ganking other lanes with tp. When I do ward, sometimes I don't really look at the map cause my map awareness is low and I still tend to get gank. I am willing to flash for a kill. I am also willing to give up towers for dragons and push the lane hard to give the pressure.) \n\nInclude info such as that, positions and play style.\n\nAs of now I am the Manager of the team, but I am looking to get replaced since I will be one of the players, but I will always be there to help as well. It would be nice to have more than 3 staff as well, to support these staff as they will be working hard to help the team as best as they could. In addition I will be looking for sponsors to help build ourselves from the bottom and bring us to the top.\n\nTryouts are TBA","replies":[{"poster":"ItsFrenchie","date":"2015-03-11T01:38:23.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump!","replies":[]},{"poster":"H O","date":"2015-03-11T00:41:26.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My IGN is H O I'm a platinum 2 support main who was diamond 4 in preseason 5, I play anything in the meta but mainly excel at Thresh, Annie, Morgana, and Janna.

Steady climbing though.  Play a diverse mid lane, I main nidalee and have a severe amount of roam potential as her. I have a large tendency to take over entire games as nidalee. But I also play annie, morg, cass, kayle, fizz regularly. I am currently learning tf, zed, talon and syndra. But anyways, my schedule is mainly in the evenings but usually after 1p.m. pst I can be on if asked. I believe my weakest point at this time is csing early, but its not super weak. I feel I can shot call if needed, and definitely would make a good front to a team. I also play all roles well but prefer mid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"calicoIRL","date":"2015-03-10T01:29:48.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi plat 5 atm.

I can play any other adc at a level i feel comfortable with. I sometimes have problems with getting zoned by shaco or eve. I use ward coverages very often to keep dragon warded as im the closest lane to it. I like to back with 1700 gold to buy a bf sword and a pink plus mana pot. This sometimes comes into me being greedy as i can die trying to reach 1700. My strong is csing as i can hit mostly all cs. Sometimes i can zone into cs mode and forget to poke, it happens rarely but i remmeber all AA ranges on adcs and can cs without getting poked to death by lets say CAIT . I tend to buy a single ward each back as it costs about 2,3 cs. I have been playing since beta test but stopped s2, came back end of s3. I have a great set of runes ranging from no mr to all mr adc runes. I can fill to a tank jg or a tank top or zed mid.But my best suit is adc. Come watch as i start my try harding. I do hope you select me GL HF","replies":[]},{"poster":"teebyaj","date":"2015-03-10T00:41:20.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump!","replies":[]},{"poster":"teebyaj","date":"2015-03-09T17:42:18.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try Outs will be held within the next three days! make sure to mark your calenders!","replies":[]},{"poster":"TBSImTv0Lt","date":"2015-03-09T17:09:58.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi I am an adc main currently diamond 4 and climbing (last season diamond 3) I have been looking to be in a serious team for a whole but it would never end up being one after a week or two. I usually play an adc that fits the team comp that we are having in a specific game. I have a few supports that I like and normally duo with and we all synergize well, so you may pick one that you like who would fit most in the team other than just me as a bot lane. I play a lot and free any day after 3pm est. I am an aggressive laner and usually roam when the team is needed. I am really good at coming back if after I get camped by the enemy jungle ( which I usually do ) I've been looking for a serious team for a while and hope you can take consideration of me being your teams adc.

I am a D5 Support main. My play style most of the time is high poke and high pressure in lane, but I would say my ability to be versitile to suit every situation / playstyle is one of my strong aspects. My ward coverage and map awareness is also very strong. In team fights my ability to peel for my carries is my main focus - but i would say my weakness would be in playing the high engage champions such as Thresh and Leona. I have to learn to balance my ability to peel v.s. my ability to take advantage of an engage opportunity. I work very well with others and keep a positive attitude through every game. I keep a clear head with objectives in mind through out the whole game.

I'm really strong when it comes to teamfights. I know how to get to my targets, and how to take them down in the most efficient way possible. I also have a pretty good amount of experience with ranked teams, and the tournament settings, and I have also won a few. My biggest weakness in lane is that I can get pretty aggressive without wards, or without noticing my wards have worn off. My strengths; however, are that I have a pretty large champion pool so I can play whatever fits the games needs. I also have plenty of experience against most if not all champions. I am not the best shot caller as I tend to get absorbed into teamfights a bit too much, but I listen really well to the calls made. As for playstyles, I don't have a specific playstyle, I adapt myself to the champion I am playing and to the one that I am playing against. I am a very amicable person, and am known to throw in a joke or two ;) I've been looking for a team like this for awhile and would love to try out!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2015-03-09T08:24:49.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm im gold currently but was plat 3 last season, would I be able to apply?","replies":[{"poster":"teebyaj","date":"2015-03-09T08:26:16.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Its Spongebob,realm=NA,application-id=K6EGEal2,discussion-id=P72gMEdr,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-03-09T08:24:49.556+0000)\n>\n> hmm im gold currently but was plat 3 last season, would I be able to apply?\n\nIts not much about ranking but play style apply and just make sure to do your best when try out comes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FYH Demon","date":"2015-03-09T08:14:32.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, i know i am on EUW, But would love a chat with you about a possible business deal i might have for you","replies":[{"poster":"teebyaj","date":"2015-03-09T08:21:28.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FYH Demon,realm=EUW,application-id=K6EGEal2,discussion-id=P72gMEdr,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-09T08:14:32.981+0000)\n>\n> Hey man, i know i am on EUW, But would love a chat with you about a possible business deal i might have for you\n\nYeah, sure go ahead. and is there an easier way to contact you? do you have an account on na that i can add and just message you directly?","replies":[{"poster":"FYH Demon","date":"2015-03-09T08:22:29.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=teebyaj,realm=NA,application-id=K6EGEal2,discussion-id=P72gMEdr,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-03-09T08:21:28.578+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, sure go ahead. and is there an easier way to contact you? do you have an account on na that i can add and just message you directly?\n\nI'll log into my NA account now..","replies":[{"poster":"teebyaj","date":"2015-03-09T08:25:43.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FYH Demon,realm=EUW,application-id=K6EGEal2,discussion-id=P72gMEdr,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2015-03-09T08:22:29.922+0000)\n>\n> I'll log into my NA account now..\n\njust add me at teebyaj","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"o7PP6gzluZ","date":"2015-03-09T08:02:48.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats up man!

Although i can play passive i pref being the aggressor. I'm really good at calling plays as well as shot calling for the team (if needed). I have done shot calling for multiple teams before so i have experience in that. I don't ever rage/flame its just not me and not my style, i understand bad plays happen but no need to bash your team over it. One of my negatives would be getting camped, throws my game of so hard.
