Very useful in lane; if you can predict where the enemy support will place their ward, get there first and be ready to kill it.\n* your e is a leash while your dashing in, therefore try and save it for added cc if you can engage by simply walking and q&#039;ing your target, then use e as soon as they start to run away.\n* more often than not you should save your w until you hit your e q combo, the mana cost is really high and if you miss the e q you end up wasting a lot of mana.\n* Try and save at least one cool down to react to counter engages when all-ining. Although your strongest combo (esp in lane) is (w)eq and drop r on top of yourself, be wary of just using r as soon as you engage in team fights (unless your hitting <3 targets.) Often saving your r will allow you to react to confer engages or assassins diving your carry. All to often I see Leona&#039;s blow all their cooldowns with the engage and consequently are unable to peal. Even your e can count for this as the little bit of a leash is often enough to give a good carry enough breathing room.\n* Body Block skillshots in teamfights if you can. With your W running you are really tanky and can take a lot more punishment than whoever the skill shot is being shot at.\n\nI&#039;ll prob add some more soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-05-07T19:26:11.505+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a leona support main, I would like to add some pointers. Leona can solo zone out the Enemy adc and support at times. She can trade fairly well while her adc farms. I take hp seals and glyphs to add onto my early tankyness. Leona can also roam after getting Her adc a few kills and help other lanes. One thing I love doing is warding in front of dragon, pushing lane, and when we see their jungler coming, we quickly go to 2v1 him while the enemy bot is busy trying to get through the minion wave, and by the time they come, their jungler is dead. Build lots of hp. Don't worry about damage. I would even say take cdr glyphs on her instead of mr because more cc AND more passive damage ( assuming your adc follows up). Against morg, e to the Enemy adc, WAIT until Morg places her black shield on the enemy adc, then either stall, or stun the Morg. A good Morg will. Black shield her adc as soon as you e her, so don't e q immediatley. \nMax w ( common sense ) and in team fights, STAY with ur adc. Don't chase to try to lock down a squishy. Leona is a better peeler then engager. What else?... Just get kills early with Leonas lane dominance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tin Tarantino","date":"2015-05-07T20:00:05.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've heard LastShadow9(the coach for team Gravity) say that when engaging on Leona W should always be the first button you hit. I think part of the reason is that if you land E/Q you will want the tank stats and W proc for the engage and if you miss you will still want the bonus armor for the harass that your opponents will go for when you miss the skill shot.","replies":[{"poster":"ArtaSoral","date":"2015-05-07T20:28:27.105+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tin Tarantino,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=E5e2i8qZ,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-05-07T20:00:05.598+0000)\n>\n> I've heard LastShadow9(the coach for team Gravity) say that when engaging on Leona W should always be the first button you hit.

W is an instant cast, once you hit the e you can hit w immediately and therefore get the armor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-05-07T20:08:41.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Leona isn't a tank without her W.
