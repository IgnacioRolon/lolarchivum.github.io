We didn't play a match to even consider a win or a loss, how is that reasonable.\r\n\r\nAnd on top of that, when you're in champ select and you see \"mid or feed\" or 2 adc because of lack of communication... we have to suffer a loss to not waste 20 min to deal with that.\r\n\r\nSeriously, remove the loss in promo from dodging.","replies":[]}
