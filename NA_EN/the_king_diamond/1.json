Zed doesnt magically gain more damage because people don't like him if you have 150 armor and he takes 85% of your hp with 2 q's and 1 e that's not possible. I would be more willing to believe it if he said something like say 50% but 85% I am gonna need some kind of proof.","replies":[{"poster":"Leverette","date":"2018-07-01T07:25:36.604+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually just recently I was playing the new Aatrox and, because Zed's burst had me tilting on the inside, I decided to cynically humor the situation by building full armor tank and proving a point to myself.

Lethality is a stat that's meant to be strong against squishy targets because the armor pen it provides is a flat amount. Against a squishy that builds armor, the flat amount ignores a larger percentage of their armor because their armor value is lower. Against targets with more armor, lethality is much less effective for the same reason, and since Lethality is something that items are budgeted for, they typically don't scale well into targets/teams that stack armor over raw damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Somebody Love Me","date":"2018-07-01T10:10:59.550+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"But then {{item:3071}} and {{item:3036}} along with lethality makes armor useless because  % armor pen is calculated before flat armor pen I think","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2018-07-01T00:06:13.249+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"...
