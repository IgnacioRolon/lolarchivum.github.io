For whole 4 years i enjoyed this game so much. For like 4 months I just feel bad every game. The desing of League is really terrible right now. Time to try out other MOBA&#039;s til season 8 in League will end. I really admire everyone who can stand this game right now and don't quit. Im not this strong. I wish that I was.","replies":[]}
