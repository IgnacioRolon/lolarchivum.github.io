And flash timbers doing AOE stun plus raw damage is too much. Plus AP itemization is slighty better than AD so she becomes stronger that she should be in my opionion. \n\nGaren is a complet stat check champions along side, trydamere, master yi, corki,mundo. The only way to be relavant with their oversimplistic kit is numbers. And since Garen doesnt have a dash or hook he gets free stats from his W and way big health regen. Yes he needs an VGU imo-and its 1 of my favorites picks from when i started till today.\n\nIn my opinion the closest we have to fair entry level champion is WW. Because he has simple sustain and attack speed boost when he is low paired to his Q then he can heal and never be that low when jungle, if the enemy isnt below the W threshold then he is quite slow. His Ult even though its supress you can side step or WW can miss it and rocket himself elsewhere ( and his ult takes the majority of his  power budget and if he miss he is half useless). His E is kinda problematic because it pairs Fear ( very strong and long duration CC) with damage reduction, but for early players it helps them not to die instanly. And more importanly WW isnt frontloaded with so much damage and AD/AP ratios.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Thingamajig","date":"2019-06-10T08:26:20.536+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"because outside of some specific metas he is never overbearing","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-06-10T13:43:58.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ornndyr2k19,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E5vKp43M,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-06-10T08:26:20.536+0000)\n>\n> because outside of some specific metas he is never overbearing\n\nhim firing qs every second that chunk you for 1/3 your hp is pretty overbearing","replies":[{"poster":"Thingamajig","date":"2019-06-10T13:51:24.822+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E5vKp43M,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-06-10T13:43:58.758+0000)\n>\n> him firing qs every second that chunk you for 1/3 your hp is pretty overbearing\n\noh and cait autoing you with headshot from her e or a trap for 1200 while having a considerable amount of armor i suppse is perfectly balanced\n\nbruv ezreal is one of the hardest adcs to be effective with\nyou can deal a lot of dmg but making the damage meaningful is the hard part for him\nand also he has this thing called a none existent early game \n\nif you are having an issue with ezreal gank him 3-4 times and his qs will be like cannon minion autos to you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2019-06-10T14:31:43.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E5vKp43M,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-06-10T13:43:58.758+0000)\n>\n> him firing qs every second that chunk you for 1/3 your hp is pretty overbearing\n\nAlso lets not forget they become undodgeable because he bought a tank item.\n\nUsually Tank items on ADC's reduce your damage output......\n\nJk it's Ezreal.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-06-10T12:59:18.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because he is visually appealing with a fun thematic and playstyle, high skillcap, and a general safe pick into most matchups.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FSRER","date":"2019-06-10T12:54:09.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"He is one of the safest adcs to play while having one of the best (if not the best) poke ability in the game while at the same time having huge damage on his w while at the same time having low cooldowns while at the same time having low cd ult while at the same time having a very useful and very high base damaging ult while at the same time having low mana costs on all of his abilities.
