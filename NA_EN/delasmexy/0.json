Punishments are given in an escalating fashion, with each offense earning you the next harshest punishment. The last punishment before a permaban is a 14 day ban, which the OP has received and only just got off of it today. They have only played 2 games since their 14 day ban ended, and they are already back to unacceptable behavior (especially with the hate speech), so I'd say this does deserve a permaban.","replies":[{"poster":"DeLaSmexy","date":"2018-04-24T05:41:42.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"where is the hate? i see a nibbler, someone who nibbles as in taking small bits at one another or my supp taking small bits of gold from me thinking i cant last hit","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2018-04-24T07:02:26.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DeLaSmexy,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jl1cXswk,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2018-04-24T05:41:42.748+0000)\n>\n> where is the hate? i see a nibbler, someone who nibbles as in taking small bits at one another\n\n This right here.\n> DeLaSmexy: %%%%% U AINT THE CARRY\n\nAnything that is censored on the boards is most likely some form of hate speech, which is Riot has zero tolerance for.

If you don't want to go by the number of letters, fine. How about we go by the fact that the word nibbler has not been censored in anyone's comments, and yet the word in your chat logs is. The chat logs you receive in the League client are not censored at all, so anything that is censored when you copy/paste the chat logs here is what the boards censor.
