I play Overwatch, Counter-Strike, MMOs (yeah i'm a huge nerd), and etc., but the only game I have problems in is League. \n\nSymptoms: \nContinuous random lag spikes (up to 500ping) throughout the game varying from just plain disconnecting or just iceskating everywhere only to have everything around me frozen and then reanimate back to life for a cluster poop of action. I literally feel like the nexus is blowing up on my screen every 5 mins. This has been on going since patch 6.18 or so...

It looks like your high latency starts inside your own network at a peak of *120ms*. Your latency then continues to stick around peaks of *126ms* along your entire route before hitting our servers. I'd recommend rebooting your modem/router by unplugging them from power and plugging them back in after 5 minutes. If you still see latency issues in-game after that, I'd reach out to a tier 2 support agent at your ISP and provide them these traceroute results.
