Your team has no ap.  If this is the case, it'd be better to pick a jungler than can do more magic damage than Lee.\n2. You're better with a different champion.  Even if Lee is stronger than some other champion this alone can make some other champion your best chance of winning.\n3. You don't own Lee Sin.\n4. Someone else works better with your team comp.\n5. Someone else on your team will feed if you play Lee Sin.  Not likely, but it could happen.\n6. Your opponents do not know how to deal with some other champion as well as they can Lee Sin.  I wouldn't count on this one though, unless you somehow know your opponents that well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BroadSlabber","date":"2015-01-20T03:46:54.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:5}}  is greatest jungler of them all.","replies":[{"poster":"DoraTheBrown","date":"2015-01-20T04:28:21.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when he was released\ntho i love xin, but he got some sht ratios","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-01-20T03:54:41.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"J4 is about as strong as Lee in different ways.
