You can't blame a champion because he is fun to play nor you can make a good champion boring because you hate seeing him so much.\n\nThe \"fun to play\" card gets really old when they also happen to be extremely powerful and forgiving in terms of scaling stupidly well with items. Would you still be playing Yasuo or Riven if they were gutted to the lowest win rates but they're \"fun?\" Probably not. I guess part of the \"fun\" argument people seem to run to is that they feel really unfair to play against because they don't have to worry about things like mana regen and negligible cooldowns with extremely high burst. They are very forgiving to play while brutally punishing opponents for making any mistake. I guess that's the \"fun\" part.","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-10-22T11:01:55.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ofc playing powerful character that give you good chances at winning gives some extra, but it's not the case with Yasuo for sure because you can see how his success rate is deeply bound to being recative in both offense and defense while having some field control for mobility.\n\nNow, would you say that Yorick was fun when he was the most unbeatable toplane? I wouldn't think so because he was also one of the least played champion ever. I have my spare of characters that don't shine in this meta/are not so powerful but I gladly play them while I refuse to play some of the top picks ebcause I find them either boring (Annie will never be in my list) or I don't like their style (Thresh for example).\n\nWhile some might use \"fun to use\" with \"I can win easily with them\" (which doesn't mean that said char is OP but just that they find easy to play good and so they win) others might do the other way around thinking that anything OP is fun or that we say X is fun ebcause X is OP while it's not true most of the times. You can see that because it's really rare that in balance threads the \"fun of playing him\" factor pops up when asking for nerfs/declaring X champion OP.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Macaroni","date":"2015-10-21T02:33:25.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nublu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pWJFYpNE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-21T02:14:15.690+0000)\n>\n> No deal with it a lot of champs are annoying to play against, they don't deserve a nerf because they annoy you \n> {{champion:83}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:89}}\n\nI see mana costs, except on Gnar (which also should be looked at) and Vlad.

Riven and Yasuo can come back from being behind in lane very easily because of how loaded their kit is with pure killing potential.
