I've just been running 10% crit in runes since IE got nerfed in 5.1 and Triforce Yasuo becoming the standard a few patches ago hasn't changed anything for me. I've tried Tri second on Yasuo and it's ok, but the only times I prefer it are when I'm playing top lane and want to split push all day. Otherwise, I still prefer Shiv IE. Triforce is a really strong standalone item on Yasuo and I see why people build it but I hate delaying my IE by 3700 gold, I hate not having my lifesteal item until my 4th item minimum, and I hate having Tri stuck in my inventory late game. \n\nPeople seem really convinced that you can't just run crit runes on Yasuo to reach 100% crit even though that's exactly what people did before IE was nerfed. People seem really opposed to the idea of running 10% crit in runes and I really don't know why; It gives you more early game power and cheese potential than 8.5 AD does, scales better, and opens up a much wider variety of final builds.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2015-10-25T16:47:23.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but by all means, let us keep nerfing the unpopular champs...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ferus and Ferrum","date":"2015-10-24T23:59:23.315+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"His popularity has nothing to do with his kit being toxic...

Was lee better when he was first launched? 100% yes. Is he still op? Not even slightly. Half of his strength comes from people not understanding what his purpose is in the game and what his weaknesses are. Sure lee has phenomenal damage ratios, but remember full ad lee is not that common or even that good and with good reason. Lee doesn't need to build damage to have moderate damage late game, but that is mediocre compared to a damage oriented jungler like a R.G. elise. Lee isn't meant to deal damage and kill people late game, he is meant to make plays for his team. And to say he isn't that hard to play: no it isn't hard to be a decent lee, but it's really hard to be a great one. We are not in the position to determine what makes a good player because neither one of us are at that level of skill where I can  say \"InSec sucks as a Lee because of x\". And let's be real for a sec, Lee is the only champion with a well known technique built around his kit that is essentially famous. \n\nLee requires a phenomenal amount of knowledge and positioning to perform at the level that he is capable of performing at, not just at the level of good enough. Other champions are quite similar, the champions referred to as \"flashy\" champs, like zed, yasuo, orianna, etc. I mean, take a trundle. Regardless of how good x trundle player is, trundle can only do so much with his kit, namely his e as his only true playmaker. Now compare that to Lee who has so much more capabilities and outplay potential. What I mean by an infinite skill cap is there is no point you will reach where you can't get better with Lee or any of the others I listed. Zed has a multitude of outplay possibilities and requires a lot of finesse when playing. Orianna requires management of your ball, and its positioning in fights. Yasuo requires quick reflexes and knowledge of how to best approach almost any encounter. \n\nLee was nerfed because it was necessary, but Lee is still strong but nowhere near overpowered. Lee is only good in the hands of a player who knows how to make plays, not kill people. If your goal is just to kill people, then Yi or Rengar or Kha'zix will do as better. Not early game obviously, but late game their damage is much stronger than Lee's. You don't really see clips of a Lee instagibing a carry at late game in the LCS like you see a Rengar or someone similar, because that's not his role. His role is as an early game threat and late game playmaker for his team. No pro player build raw damage lee because that isn't his job, so his ratios are irrelevant late game when an adc has 3x his damage per auto crit.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-10-25T05:24:52.912+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok. since Lee's ratios are irrelevant they should be nerfed to 20% bonus AD like Kha'Zix's leap.

Lee's high ratios are what gives him his strong early game, which is what makes up half of his identity as a jungler. Taking those away would cause lee to lose all of his gank presence early game (pre 6). If you aren't bringing cc to a gank, you're bringing raw damage, and as you can tell from someone like a Yi ganking at level 2, that isn't always enough. However, Lee can do that and it work based on his strong early damage, but ask anyone about his late game and 95% of people will say \"He falls off\", which he does. Lee is fine where he is. Other champions deserve attention more than he does.\nAlso, win rate isn't the sole factor in strength assessment.

He's entirely immobile, strictly melee, and has unremarkable CC. His strength is entirely numeric in nature, and that's probably not even an issue after the latest changes to him (remember that Worlds is on an outdated patch). I'd say that Mordekaiser is in a similar boat, with zero CC, almost no mobility, and very time-limited windows of range.\n\nHere's the thing. The champions you say got gutted had that happen because there was not a numerical value at which they could work. The problems ran deeper than numbers changes alone could fix. Of the champions you list, I don't think that's the case with any of them. Fiora has really interesting and skill and counterplay intensive patterns. If they're too strong right now, if she's just able to right click on people and annihilate them, drop some numbers and force her to use her passive. A similar approach seems to be working for GP, though in his case, a steep skill-curve could make him hard to balance for the experts and the novices. Yasuo and Riven do have issues of depending more on the player's strength than on that of their opponents, but Riot's working on changes to Riven.\n\nI can see cases, like old Eve and current Poppy, where the appropriate thing to do is to make sure that a champion is too weak to see competitive play, because the alternative is worse and there isn't the bandwidth to do an immediate rework. But that's a last resort, for when simple numbers tweaks or small functional changes aren't enough to get the champion back in line. The same complaints you're making have been leveled not so long ago against champs like Zed, Thresh, Vayne, and Lee Sin. Champions who, I note, are currently pretty balanced in competitive and solo queue and who have not received reworks, only numbers changes.\n\nBasically, be sure you know that number tweaks won't be enough. I think in the case of nearly all champs you listed, they will be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shonjl","date":"2015-10-25T05:08:16.232+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not trolling but is Riven even still a thing?

Maybe 15, if I'm being generous.\n\nYou know how many I've seen him in since the last nerf? 0.\n\nThe guy has been perma-banned to death in yolo ques (which is very different from pro play). This means that it's really, really, really difficult for Riot to get a pulse on where he is. Whether he's actually too strong and or why he might be. Quite frankly he's probably fine since his last nerf, but people still won't leave him unbanned. Personally I wish he hadn't been touched at all.\n\nThat said.. Are you really calling {{champion:122}} overloaded? That's a joke, right? He doesn't fit the criteria you yourself even stated. He doesn't have a ton of free passives laying around, he doesn't have boatloads of extra stats unless you meet certain criteria, ect. Just taking the popular champions to hate / champs you don't like and calling them \"overloaded and free stat machines\" doesn't make it true. {{champion:48}} is pretty much the definition of a \"free stat\" champion. He gets huge amounts of AD from his Q, reduces enemy AD, gets gigantic amounts of movement speed, attack speed, and % healing received increase from his W.. And gets a gigantic amount of free health, armor, and MR from his ulti (which scales with that % healing from his W). He's got more free stats in his kit then any of the champions you listed, yet I don't see anyone bitching about him.\n\nIt's fine if you don't like a champion, but please be intelligent in your discussion. Just throwing out the cool and edgy buzz-kill words doesn't make your argument more valid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miko Ryukudo","date":"2015-10-25T04:05:17.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are forgetting {{champion:266}} being gutted into oblivion.\n\nEveryone forgets {{champion:266}} T^T","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-25T04:14:19.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He also forgot...
