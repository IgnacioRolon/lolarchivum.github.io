Some champions are easier to play than others thus their win rates will be higher. Katarina is just easy to play and quite fun yet quite strong and hard to play against if you don't know how to control your cc for her ult. So people will play her and people will win with her =)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSlogs","date":"2015-03-10T19:44:06.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just above 50% with a 15% pick rate...
