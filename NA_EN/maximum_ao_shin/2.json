To prevent Shyvana from one shotting entire teams with her dragon's Q, there's a .001ish CD on Hydra to prevent multiple procs off of one AA. WW does 5 attacks over 2s, so of course each of his hits will proc the Hydra's AoE, though in all honesty, it's not really a problem given it doesn't affect his 1v1 and doesn't make his team fighting ability broken, similarly to WW and Shyvana. \n\nAin't a problem, really. Just helps prevent super abuse cases.","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Ao Shin","date":"2015-12-22T17:24:05.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so why have bork proc off his w?\n\n\ni just want consistency","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-12-27T02:20:01.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because BotRK doesn't have an internal CD in place to prevent 100-0'ing entire teams. lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
