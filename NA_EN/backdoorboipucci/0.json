Duoing is never boosting.\n\nFurthermore, smurfing is not prohibited, as the Match Making system can quickly set someone's Match Making Rating (MMR) to their appropriate level of skill within 10-50 games. Even if they're a certain rank, their MMR will be their actual skill - be it much higher/lower. They will be matched with players of similar skill - matching is based on MMR, not rank.","replies":[{"poster":"VaVoem","date":"2018-05-24T02:24:48.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"so a master player buys a new fresh lvl 30 account and starts playing he will be after max. 50 games teamed up with other master players? damn.. that is fast climbing :)","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-05-24T02:41:16.359+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, if he buys an account, it's likely that within 50 games it'll be permanently banned.\n\nIf he **creates** a new account himself and levels it to 30 himself, his ranked MMR will start much higher than the average player, and he will quickly climb after he is placed likely in high gold.","replies":[{"poster":"Epitaphfire","date":"2018-05-24T03:05:58.469+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Why is it that purchasing an account is against \"the rules\" but Riot will GIVE accounts to pros and streamers that are level 30 with ALL champs unlocked?

Technically it is illegal to sell accounts it’s just not incredibly enforced. The issue is you’re selling something you do not own. Something that is inherently free, to make a profit. Just like selling burned CDs is illegal. You may have taken the time to burn the CD, but you don’t have the rights to sell said product.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-05-24T03:16:12.512+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's put it like this: Purchased accounts are obtained from account sellers (none of whom are affiliated or associated with Riot), they derive sales by doing something that anyone can do for free...For profit, so they're making money just by making and leveling accounts.\n\nAdditionally, these accounts have innately compromised security (as the account seller likely knows the login credentials, and you as the purchaser don't have reliable immediate access to turn the account over to your own total possession without arousing suspicion), _and_ these accounts are often illegitimately leveled to, say, 30 as a baseline.\n\nThe illegitimate leveling could occur through levelling bots, which, as far as I know, play pretty damn poorly, and could start the player off in an inappropriate MMR, resulting in unfair games for people for quite a few matches. (though, that would also be the case by default for a skilled player levelling an account.)\n\nSo, between the illegitimacy, skeeviness, and lack of reliable security on these accounts (and the fact that they weren't yours to begin with), purchased accounts are entirely against the rules.\n\nStage accounts, however, as far as I can see, are accounts made by Riot for pro players so as to allow them to have fair and reliable access to everything in the game (allowing them to perform at their best ability with all the tools available), and are meant to be used in controlled circumstances (live tournaments and the like.)\n\nI'm not sure about accounts given to streamers, as they likely wouldn't fall under the category of stage accounts, but, regardless, accounts given directly by Riot are given freely (as far as I know) and with a promise of trust. How people can trust those who would _sell_ accounts for a _free to play game_, I would never know.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BackdoorBoipucci","date":"2018-05-24T01:03:08.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the quick reply, I edited my original post to clarity that i'm posting here because i'm being asked to login again in the support section and it gives me an error","replies":[{"poster":"Modi","date":"2018-05-24T12:35:03.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Use chrome's [incognito mode](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-05-24T01:11:49.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try logging out of the boards then logging into support.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Moonboy65","date":"2018-05-24T03:54:27.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"most likely security reasons","replies":[]}]}
