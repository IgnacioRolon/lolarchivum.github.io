However now everyone understands that verbal abuse is about the only report that actually does anything... So when they think I play bad.. I get reported for verbal abuse.. When I take a position someone else wanted .. I get 4 verbal abuses.. \r\nAn example.. I ping someone in game the other day.. I ping  them twice to back away from baron.. We don't want to do it.. He reports me for verbal abuse.. Im stuck with another 35 games of ranked restrict.. Fuck this dude.

Chat restrict makesure sense.. hell just ban them from talking altogether for 35 wins... doing ranked restrict just makes normal drafts less fun for others.. but unskilled does nothing however it should..","replies":[{"poster":"Ice Weasel X","date":"2015-05-13T04:55:18.643+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UE Graphic,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=828K1qAh,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-05-13T02:38:27.299+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for the comment although I believe that having afk and verbal abuse be the only actual reports that do anything is just frustrating..\n\nThey're not...\n\n> unskilled should do the same thing as verbal abuse..\n\nUm, no.  Being unskilled isn't against the rules.  Verbally abusing people is.\n\n> and why should verbal abuse ban you from ranked?\n\nIf you can't follow the rules, why should you be allowed to play?  Ranked is the highest stress game mode.  If you're a constant source of stress, you're a negative influence on the other players.  Breaking *any* rules should get your ability to access game modes revoked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SmokedAlmonds","date":"2015-05-13T13:48:08.604+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UE Graphic,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=828K1qAh,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-05-13T02:38:27.299+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for the comment although I believe that having afk and verbal abuse be the only actual reports that do anything is just frustrating..unskilled should do the same thing as verbal abuse.. and why should verbal abuse ban you from ranked?

At least there could be  comparison of evidence of the questionable behaviors to help with the review.

Averages with frequency is a concern to address. Maybe possible for Riot to collect evidence of the frequency of the abusive behaviors; ~ in other words, the more reports which will flag you only in reporting conveys your officiating the specific report of questionable behavior for review when reporting out-of-bounds behaviors inside of League of Legends Games.\n\nFrom: FuryofThornsRedo","replies":[]},{"poster":"powerbats","date":"2015-05-13T16:23:11.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So since you feel unskilled should earn bans then you're totally fine with being the 1st one banned right?
