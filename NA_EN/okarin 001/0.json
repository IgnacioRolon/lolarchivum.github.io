I started a ranked SoloQ game and in the loading screen, nobody came over 0%, game freezed. I tried restarting, but the game was instantly marked as remake. I started another ranked - and same problem happened.\nSo I restarted whole LoL client. The game wanted to patch so I thought that's the cause. But as I tried to log in, it told me the password was incorrect. Somewhen I realized the server location changed from euw to north us. Why?\nSo I switched the server again and - no update. I could log in as ever.\nAs I looked at my profile, I saw that I've lost around 30-40LP for both games in total.\nI somehow feel bad, because when you try so hard to rank up and spend a lot of time of your day for it and then something like that just f'cks your whole plan an'l.. I'm quite angry right now.\nAdditionally, I can't start further games, but I guess that's a server problem (aswell?)\n    EDIT: Its not a server problem, I can be invited, but can't create a lobby by myself.\nSomething to prevent this from happening or ways to get my LP back?","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-06-09T22:54:50.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw nuts, it kinda sounds like your connection has been having some real bad trouble; I know exactly what it's like to deal with those issues when you wanna take the day to relax instead too. x( Can be a real kick in the balls.\n\nWhile I really wish I could I can't give you back the lost LP; I can't do have the tools and doing so would raise concerns with integrity in Ranked. But I do wanna urge you to troubleshoot your game's connection with some of the steps in our guide [**right here**](http://riot.com/12B7oac). There are a lot but it will help us try to find the cause of the problem, or eliminate connection as a cause.\n\nBe sure to test the results in a Custom game, that way if they don't help then you won't be flagged for a leaverbuster should you encounter the problems again, and then follow up with me so we can try something else. ^^","replies":[]}]}
