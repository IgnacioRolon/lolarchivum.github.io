This is actually really frustrating because they remake? So why would it matter it doesn't effect anyones ELO or anything like that and it put me in a freaking 20 minute queue for 5 games. Is there any way to get out of this or do I have to waste 100 minutes of my time to get out of this bull crap.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T21:04:35.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they had to remake due to you not being connected in time, that would be the main reason for the LPQ. The other players in the match were still affected by your afk, regardless of whether their ELO was changed or not. Also, you shouldn't have been hit with a 20 min LPQ timer for only one left match.\n\nWe should definitely try to address why you couldn't get connected to that match in the first place.

I'm just still mad that I got put in a 20 minute queue. If it was 5 minutes I wouldn't mind it that much, but 20 minutes holy crap.","replies":[]}]}]}
