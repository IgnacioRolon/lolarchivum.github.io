When a person starts talking shit or types a comment that aggravates the person not playing as well instead of giving constructive criticism or simply being NICE, IT'S GOING TO GIVE OFF A DIFFERENT REACTION. I reciprocate attitude and emotion so if someone tells me: &quot;Oh it&#039;s ok dude! Next time, learn to just ward or not face check the bush..&quot; then I would feel way more comfortable than instead of saying &quot;Yeah, this is why your bronze&quot; Like really Riot? You can&#039;t tell who started it yet you can easily identify who the mad person is. THE ONLY REASON WHY SOMEONE IS MAD IS BECAUSE SOMETHING IS WRONG\n\nTHERE ARE TWO PEOPLE MAD\nONE OF WHICH IS MAD BECAUSE A PLAYER ISN&#039;T DEEMED WELL ENOUGH\nONE OF WHICH IS MAD BECAUSE A PLAYER IS TRYING BUT IS UNDERMINED. Not even given advice. Just trash talked.\n\nAll this and I get my honor, chat restriction, and free loot revoked. Yeah whatever riot. Some league community. Maybe hire some people who can assess and read a little more thoroughly before making such a rash decision caused by the ORIGNATOR NOT THE PERSON MIMICKING THEIR ACTIONS. Lol.\n\nEdit: Answers from the community so far:\na) Each person is responsible for their own behavior.\nb) Don't cry when you get punished.\nc) Control emotions\nd) Don't respond and mute\n\nRIOT understands what they're doing. Keeping what I said above and I apologize. My actions, my responsibility","replies":[{"poster":"Canonic","date":"2018-03-29T19:49:35.961+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're the one that doesn't understand.
