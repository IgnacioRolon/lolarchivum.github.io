Viktor starts with Hex Core, A unique Item to Viktor.\r\n   My idea is that Taric starts out with a type of gem or has a gem slot as one of his items. The player could buy ruby, sapphire, topaz, emerald, opal, etc (all the games he talks about). The gem slot would increase a certain stat/lvl or add an effect to one of his spells. This could be either an item or a passive you buy from the store","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Graves III","date":"2013-09-26T02:21:36.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I don't like it if only because taric's current passive is fun in my opinion. I like beating the tar out of people while building frozen heart and iceborne. But I play raid boss taric. what do i know :P\n\nReally its a question of what has to come out of his kit to allow this?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cyrus Blackmoon","date":"2013-09-25T20:24:12.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea, though it needs to not have the same issues that Viktor's hexcore has; which is that one upgrade overshadows the others instead of working for a certain situation, and not having a late game build.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spirit Mononoke","date":"2013-09-25T16:21:41.243+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also creating a visual effect like a color change or something","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2013-09-25T23:39:42.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He could even 'socket' gems into standard items Diablo II style, but then they would be lost if he combines the item.
