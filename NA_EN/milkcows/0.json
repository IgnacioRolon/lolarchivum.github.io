They can appear in random spots and sometimes more than 1 appearing. Usually happens around the 10 minute mark for me as well. This should be fixed asap since many will think these are artifacts and/or signs of GPU failure when it seems to be a simple visual glitch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Topscorer17","date":"2018-01-17T12:47:22.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same thing happens to me!

I have those black dots after a while in a game (they aren't there at the start, they appear after). It's definitely not a FPS/config issue, since I've tried the method Porocles gave, and I still have those dots. It's not a config issue either (180Hz screen, 144FPS locked all the time, GTX 1070, i5 7600k 16GB RAM etc, definitely not a config which would have issues running League correctly). Sometimes the dots disappear, and appear again somewhere else on the screen. I hope there will be a fix soon, it's distracting :( {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"87870959DEL1","date":"2018-01-12T11:18:54.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still getting the issues.
