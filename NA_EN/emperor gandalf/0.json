At around 8%, it pops up with a message that says \"error while patching, please restart\". I've tried restarting and using the hextech repair tool, but none of those worked. I've tried googling the solution, bt nothing pops up. IS there a solution for this, and is this happening to anyone else right now?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-29T21:57:38.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're only getting to about 8%, that could be a sign that either the patcher isn't working with the admin rights it needs or some of those files are possibly corrupted.
