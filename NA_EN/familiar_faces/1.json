For this heavy scaling he's too oppressive as a ranged character especially in the early game and his lvl 1 persistant harass potential needs to be toned down.\r\n\r\nThought?","replies":[{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2014-11-02T04:43:18.824+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is a very reasonable idea, but I don't think the cooldown should not be too high at early levels because he should not be forced into maxing his core ability first, as opposed to right now where you can max his other abilities for different benefits (stronger snare or more MR reduction and multitarget damage). At the most, it should be no higher than 6-4 seconds.\n\nAlso, Overload technically does currently have a cooldown that scales with rank, on the technicality that it gives passive CDR.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2014-11-02T04:58:39.410+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Realistically, he is almost completely forced into maxing his Q right now.
