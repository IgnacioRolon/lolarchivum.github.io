I hopped into a bot game to try out this new yorrick rework, got into the game and noticed my resolution was off. So instead of tweaking all the settings i just hit reset to default and for some reason it set my resolution to 4k. My game was very zoomed in and i had to force close it. I tried recconnecting but it would crash immediately and give me a bug splat! I have tried running as admin editing the game.cfg file as well as reinstalling. Im not sure what i can do to fix this I need your guy's help!!! I would be willing to try editing the .cfg file again but im sure i did it right, changed the resolution around to a supported one and saved it? Any help is greatly appreciated while i wait for RITO to respond to my ticket!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-20T17:59:47.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't currently support 4K, and it's very strange that your default settings are acting up and causing you to bugsplat.
