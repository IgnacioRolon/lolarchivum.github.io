Why are you using games from 6 months ago as relevant for this tournament? The skill level of teams has changed drastically since then. EDG is no where near as strong as they were and SKT has improved enormously. FNC also improved enormously. However, SKT have barely revealed anything about their drafts so far, other than a couple pocket picks (renekton and Ryze). FNC have already shown an affinity to dual assassin comps, i feel like SKT will have a plan for that. Honestly i think it will depend more on who gets blue side 1st than anything else. \n\nSide note: FNC have 100% first blood rate (other than the remake), and SKT have yet to lose a second tier turret. Which of those stats do you think will fail first?","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-10-21T05:57:35.187+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"MSI was a good benchmark even though it was mid season.

Plus, FNC will have seen pretty much everything once they face KOO. \n\nSKT better not be looking ahead to the Finals yet. OG can definitely beat them if they don't bring their A game. \n\nI think FNC will take a tier 2 before they give up first blood. OG is going to be the first actually great team SKT has faced this tourney. It should be a good gauge where they are. I wouldn't be surprised if SKT loses because they haven't been pushed at all.

OH and btw, because you were talking about gold share being a useless stat, I just want to point out how weird OG's gold shares are... 3 out of 4 midlaners in the semifinals have a bottom 6 gold share (Faker 17th, Kuro 14th, Febi 12th). These teams also have the biggest gold share for top laners (Marin 1st, Smeb 2nd, Huni 6th). The ADCs also have very similar gold shares (from 25.3 to 25.7) So in general the best teams have mids who do a lot with a little and top laners who destroy with a lot, with very average ADCs.\n\n But then you see Origen; their top laner has one of the lowest shares of top laners at worlds while their mid has the 3rd highest gold share. But its actually not because of their carry mid. It is because of their carry ADC. Neils has the third highest gold share of all the ADCs at world.\n\nIn other words, Origen has a very different style of play than anyone else in these semi finals. The only team similar was AHQ, who also funneled everything into their adc, but instead of neglecting top lane they neglected mid lane. The thing is, SKT tore apart AHQ, even when they were looking even AHQ never managed to make it past a second tier turret. I would argue that both styles of play are very powerful these days. Juggernauts + Tahm support ADC carry style , but lots of TPs + extreme rotational play, especially in regards to splitpush, and recent reworks support a top carry style. But now we get to see the best of these two styles collide, and I would argue the top focus is more powerful. But they are very close, and extremely reliant on team composition.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-10-21T21:18:36.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you that top focus is stronger since they are playing on the top carry meta.

This is also assuming OG brings their A game like they did against KT, not that shit they were doing against Flash wolves. Also, them losing one game will mean they go all out in the game after. So 12.5% chance SKT 3-0's. I also agree that OG>AHQ, but you got to admit it was impressive watching SKT just roll over AHQ without even trying. And if you want to see their A game: Watch the group stages vs EDG and the OGN Finals vs KT.
