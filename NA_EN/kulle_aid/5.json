I sit at around 43 ping in game. which isn't bad but its still some ping you know. This is more out of curiosity with the recent video that was posted on league on this topic. My buddy who is on a college campus out of state has a ping of 3. Now I find that crazy. I saw on that video that riot has some Direct lines with internet providers, but I don't know which ones, and I'm curious if my provider has that. Or if there is anything on my end I can do. I have Comcast as an internet provider and have a hardline connection to my computer. The ping is steady, but is there really a way to reduce it on my end?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-03T04:24:01.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your latency at this point is determined by your ISP routing to our servers. The decisions that your ISP and their partners make in how to route your connection directly affects how long it takes for your connection to hit our servers.

I see Comcast xfinity is on your ISP peer list so I would think the ping would be even less if they have already done this. Could it be due to a firewall through windows or Norton internet security that slows the package in transit? It seems there is little I can do to reduce ping, but I wanna make sure I do what I can to get the package in transit as fast as possible. Just have had a hard time knowing what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-05T22:04:11.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best thing you can do to ensure your connection settings are compatible with League is to work through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), as this will ensure as few things can conflict with League as possible.
