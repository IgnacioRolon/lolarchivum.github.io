I tried the hextech tool when it started and that made it WORSE. no idea what is going on but I really hope its this patch.

None of what your guide suggests fixed anything. The fact that I go from 300+ to even going to 1 fps is on your end. How do I know it is not my end? I play other games and no FPS issues or lag at all.

Playing ad carry on bot lane can be really anoying when you can't farm properly because game just freezes for a moment, you can't move nor attack for like a second or two.
