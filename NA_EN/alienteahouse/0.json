I want to start playing matches and I've tried but when it comes time to choose a Champion there's none there. I've looked through my collection, the free to play and they still don't show up.  I don't have money to buy any Champions or IP either. Can someone help me out?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-29T22:20:56.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes this can happen from some awkward connection issues as well. Your client needs to pull the champion list from the servers when it's your turn to pick, and if it gets hung up there and can't pull the data it won't ever show you anything. Check out the steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and make a few adjustments, then hop into a custom or practice match to test it out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xurreal","date":"2017-10-29T18:21:09.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, AlienTeahouse.\n\nWelcome to the game! I hope you are enjoying playing.\n\nIt could be a small issue with the filters. What I suggest doing is taking screen shots the next time you try to start a game up and are in champion select.\n\nAlso, try typing the name of a free champ to see if it comes up in the Search Refiner in champ select.\n\nOther than that, yes, nothing is perfect and you may be facing a technical issue.\n\nFiling a ticket with support is your best option at this point. You can always talk to support about anything. It's why they are called support.\n\nAt the homepage of LeagueofLegends.com down at the very bottom, there is a link to support.\n\nYou can click [**this**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us), too!\n\nBest of luck on the fields of justice. And if anyone is giving you problems, don't buy into the negativity. Just mute them through pressing TAB and their corresponding \"Volume\" icon to solve that problem\n\nNever let any player who judges you hurt your feelings. You have to try to be good so just keep playing!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
