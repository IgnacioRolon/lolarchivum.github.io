The TL;DR of this ticket was that our Vayne and our Vel'Koz (the only two doing well on the team. I was queue'd with the Vayne, and we did not know the Vel'Koz personally.) had a very suspicious disconnect in a team fight, which led to them both being killed and the loss of the game right after. I submitted footage of it, as well as a screenshot of the chat (just to be sure), but I also specified several times in my ticket that I was not one of the ones who disconnected. So it was a very big surprise to me that my response was a generic copy/paste response to troubleshoot my connection when I was not one of the ones who had even disconnected, and that it was a verbatim response to what my friend received who actually DID disconnect and submit a ticket.\n\nIs there any specific reason that this happened?  It's a little discouraging to feel as though they didn't even read my ticket without giving me a generic response that was irrelevant to what I had been saying to them.. Thank you for your time! :)\n\n(Screenshots of ticket/response included)\n\nTicket: https://i.gyazo.com/52dd3e781d5c439a65cdc3fa716c264a.png\nResponse: https://i.gyazo.com/5ab1e3de6635a2c408388662554ff374.png","replies":[{"poster":"braiindamage","date":"2017-03-16T19:56:21.063+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"dab","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-16T20:29:41.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"R041 is a good dude on our tech team, and I spoke to him to see what happened.  From what I understand, he received your ticket as well as a few from your friends.  After further review, he determined that a connection issue was occurring though he could have clarified better.  We will also review reports,  but we do not share the outcome of our investigations.   \n\nTo also be perfectly frank with you, issues like this are 99.99 not a result of a DDoS issue.  What you're suggesting may have occurred in the match is pretty serious, but is  usually some network issue.  It can certainly be by our servers, but there are other factors too like ISP problems or LAN issues if you all are in the same place.  \n\nI think we could have been more specific and better about addressing each of your concerns.  Sorry for all of the confusion with that.  :/  Feel free to hit him up in your ticket if you have any other concerns or direct feedback for him.  He can take it!  I hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[]}]}
