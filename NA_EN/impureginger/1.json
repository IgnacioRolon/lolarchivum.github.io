For me, he doesn&#039;t make the chiming noise for the first two pulses of it.  I&#039;m not sure how to recreate this, and I lack a recording device, but it&#039;s just what I said, and then after it&#039;s fine.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-24T17:50:27.885+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nThanks for the report!
