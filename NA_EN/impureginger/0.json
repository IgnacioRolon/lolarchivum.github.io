My suggestion for an adjustment (if it&#039;s necessary, bard isn&#039;t particularly adept late game regardless, that&#039;s probably intentional) is to change his ult to have a passive that lessens its cooldown by a second each time Bard collects a chime.  Alternatively, maybe once the player gets a certain amount of chimes?  It&#039;s not a huge buff, but Bard is overly lackluster in the late game and the extra uptime on his ult would help, and make chimes more relevant late game.  \r\n\r\nThanks for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"Scaling Q","date":"2016-03-30T22:58:25.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The cone damage chimes they added actually helped a lot.

For the OP:  I felt similarly when playing Bard. He does actually have a pretty good win rate over game time curve. As in, he tends to get better late game.  Clutch ultimates and map mobility through magical journeys do some work, perhaps? \n\nI do start to care less about those chimes, so I like your suggestion of making them more essential as the game goes on.  We make them too required and people will just go chime-hunting all game, though.  Tricky balance.","replies":[{"poster":"Scaling Q","date":"2016-04-02T07:47:48.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of people try just building full tank Bard, but I found that it seems to lack a lot just because Bard's base def is so low it isn't worth fully investing into imo.
