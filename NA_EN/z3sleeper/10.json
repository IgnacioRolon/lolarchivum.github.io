Yorick can still beat Morde even with this heal\n\nI honestly wouldn't care if they removed this if they buffed him to compensate(which they won't). Sure him healing like this is annoying, but it's hardly game breaking and isn't very useful outside of lane. Removing this interaction would just be a pointless Morde nerf and minor Yorick/Malz buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-10-09T14:03:20.835+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rWvcm15R,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2018-10-09T13:27:12.226+0000)\n>\n> Yorick would stomp Morde 100% of the time if they removed this heal\n\nFalse, he would just receive his normal healing amount which is 62.5-237.5 (champ + minion) rather than 100-380.\n\nIt'd be a playable matchup instead of a one-sided push.\n\n> Yorick can still beat Morde even with this heal\n\nAs a Yorick main, this is strictly false. No damage Yorick does to him sticks since Yorick deals damage primarily as DPS. Morde's passive is the actual counter to this, shielding him to reduce every attack's damage to his actual health while healing back half of it as soon as he dips to 50%.\n\nI mean, you can clearly see it in the image. What should have been a somewhat advantageous situation for Yorick turned into a huge disadvantage in an instant.\n\nThe only counterplay Yorick has is to call for his jungler since Morde is the easiest champ to gank in the game.\n\n> I honestly wouldn&#x27;t care if they removed this if they buffed him to compensate(which they won&#x27;t).\n\nSince this doesn't affect anything other than the Yorick/Malz/Zyra/Heim matchup, why would he need compensation that would affect every other matchup?","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-10-09T17:58:51.916+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Z3Sleeper,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rWvcm15R,comment-id=00070000,timestamp=2018-10-09T14:03:20.835+0000)\n>\n> False, he would just receive his normal healing amount which is 62.5-237.5 (champ + minion) rather than 100-380.\n> \n> It&#x27;d be a playable matchup instead of a one-sided push.\n\nYeah no. Yorick would just W morde (with his shitty 325 MS and awful attack speed) and spam ghouls when they come up. There's no way in hell morde could fight back and he would be forced back for just trying to CS, eventually falling behind in cs and losing lane.\n> \n> As a Yorick main, this is strictly false.

You can kill morde or force him back with a gank. Then once you get a CS lead and build TF you can burst him with Q. If he keeps shoving to build his shield he's an easy gank. Your jungler is an idiot if he doesn't camp a pushing morde at top.\n\n> Since this doesn&#x27;t affect anything other than the Yorick/Malz/Zyra/Heim matchup, why would he need compensation that would affect every other matchup?\n\nOh yeah, because Morde doesn't lose enough lanes as it is. Time to make him lose to champs he counters as well.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \n\nMorde shouldn't be touched until his VGU anyway so this topic is pointless.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-10-09T18:12:49.834+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rWvcm15R,comment-id=000700000001,timestamp=2018-10-09T17:58:51.916+0000)\n>\n> Not true at all.

Currently he just completely shoves him out with 0 counterplay other than \"jg camp my lane\".\n\nAnd like I said, he could simply use his W *as it was intended to be used* and hit Yorick with it for the full heal.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-10-09T18:18:47.715+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Z3Sleeper,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rWvcm15R,comment-id=0007000000010000,timestamp=2018-10-09T18:12:49.834+0000)\n>\n> Aight then that&#x27;s not Yorick, that&#x27;s the jungler.\n\nSome champs auto-lose to other champs. You don't see me complaining that Morde can't beat Vel'Koz or Anivia. It's just the way the game is. Mordekaiser is by no means broken or OP, so there is no reason to nerf him.
