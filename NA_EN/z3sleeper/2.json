I would love if {{champion:63}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:17}} were the bot lane meta for a while (with marksmen still making up 30% of bot lane picks or so).  One thing to keep in mind though, is that MR is much more effective than armor, so the team would still need an AD source in another role to balance out the lack of an AD marksmen bot.  That means that you'd still likely see marksmen in top or jungle {{champion:133}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:104}} or even mid {{champion:236}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:81}} so the marksmen class would still be represented in the game even if marksmen weren't viable in bot for a while (and 30% pick rate would still be considered plenty viable by non-marksmen-monopoly standards).\n\nI think the healthiest diverse meta would look something like this:\nTop: Primary front line (Tanks[all], fighters[all], Battle Mages, beefier Skirmishers)\n\nJng: High engage / beyond enemy lines (Vanguards, Divers, Slayers[all])\n\nMid: Extremely diverse; Artillery (artillery mages, marksmen), Assassins, Battle Mages, utility/cc mages\n\nSup: Diverse utility providers (enchanters, wardens, utility/cc mages)\n\nBot: Long-ranged damage dealers (artillery mages, marksmen) and utility carries (utility/cc mages, secondary enchanters) for extra laning synergy with a support\n\n\nEvery role would also have some exceptions, like top Urgot (unique marksman/juggernaut), jungle Fiddlesticks (mage) and Kindred (marksman), mid enchanters (lulu) as counters against overly high-engage focused team compositions (ie., double assassin comps), odd supports like Teemo (AP marksman) and Shaco (assassin/catcher) for vision control via traps, and special cases like bot Mordekaiser (juggernaut).\n\nSo team comps in such a diverse meta could vary a lot between matches:\nTop: {{champion:41}} \nJng: {{champion:54}} \nMid: {{champion:81}} \nSup: {{champion:16}} \nBot: {{champion:161}} \n\nOr \n\nTop: {{champion:50}} \nJng: {{champion:121}}\nMid: {{champion:25}}\nSup: {{champion:89}} \nBot: {{champion:119}}\n\nOr\n\nTop: {{champion:75}}\nJng: {{champion:11}}\nMid: {{champion:43}}  \nSup: {{champion:412}} \nBot: {{champion:69}} \n\nAnd every class would be playable in around 2 different roles each.  Rather than a marksman being mandatory, you'd just need to fulfill these requirements: a front line, a back line, sources of magic damage, sources of physical damage, sources of CC/utility.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2018-07-01T15:41:38.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AmbientGlub,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fscYWqmG,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-07-01T01:34:03.683+0000)\n>\n> If you nerf all AD items you&#x27;d have to nerf AP items.
