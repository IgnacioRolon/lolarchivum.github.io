In addition to this, the build paths of Energize items don't synergize with each other at all, since the highest damaging Energized effect will negate the damage coming from other Energized effects and thus invalidate the 900g Kircheis Shards you have to build.\n\nBut hey, it makes Statikk bounce to 7 targets instead of 5 and makes RFC range bonus go up to 185 from 150 AND it makes everyone hit by Statikk slowed by 40% for 1 second while increasing Statikk damage by 30%. That's good right?\n\nNo, no it's not. All that gold efficiency of the 2 other Energize damage effects? Gone for a minor buff to realistically only *one* of those Energize effects. Because you simply have no room for all 3 and rarely have room for 2 of them. If you're playing a Crit ADC, you WILL be getting IE since we're back to those days. So you're gonna have {{item:3006}} {{item:3031}} ( {{item:3087}} and/or {{item:3094}} ) (if we ignore PD and Runaans).\n\nIn this meta though, building a 2nd Zeal item after your core two items is suicide. GA and BT are basically mandatory. So that's 5 slots to boots, IE, Zeal item, GA and BT.\n\nSo now you have 5 slots filled, the game has been going on for 30 minutes. What do you build now?\n\n{{item:3095}} ? Or {{item:3139}} for anti-cc/kiting/LS/MR, or {{item:3022}} for kiting/survivability, or {{item:3036}} /{{item:3033}}  for tank shredding/GW/overall DPS increase?\n\nIMO, it won't be Storm. Ever.\n\nNot even Twitch, the champion who can probably get the most out of the slowing Statikk effect &amp; AoE damaage, will use this because for him,  {{item:3153}} and {{item:3085}} are also mandatory.\n\n---\n---\n\n#How I would change it\n\nTHAT ALL BEING SAID. I'm not just here to say it's garbage without providing a possible solution.\n\nFirst off, making the damage stack at all is a huge no. We don't need the Energize burst meta back. But there's a way to make them synergize better without straight increasing burst damage. So instead, let's focus on making them more viable as DPS items (yknow, what this class is based on).\n\nTo do this, I think we gotta kill what makes RFC a little more special: the Energize rate increase. Here's how I think it should go down.\n\n{{item:3094}}\nChanged Passive: \"Attacks become Energized 25% faster.\" changed to \"Attacks become Energized 50% faster *when moving*.\"\n\n{{item:3087}}\nNew Passive: \"Attacks become Energized 50% faster *when attacking*.\"\nAS reduced to 35% (from 40% to compensate for this being a straight buff).\n\n{{item:3095}}\nNew Passive: \"Attacks become Energized 15% faster for each Energize effect you have.\"\n(Increases _total_ Energize rate by +15% for each Energize effect you have (to include itself)).\n\nSo RFC is the long range attack one that synergizes with simply moving and attacking with its effect.\nStatikk is the one where you have to be close to use it and thus gets the on-attack buff (with a nerf to AS cuz that's a pretty big buff to the energize rate).\nAnd Storm is the IE of Energize effects so it increases the total rate.\nSimple!\n\n---\n---\n\nEdit: \n\n> Considering a movement speed of 380 units per second (with normal tier 2 boots), moving energizes 12.5 charges per second, while an average attack speed of a normal level 18 champion who has ~1.2 attack speed with just Statikk Shiv energizes ~14.5 charges per second (given the average possible attacks to energize charges). Moving is roughly 15% slower.\n>\n> Taken from the [wiki](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Statikk_Shiv).\n\n390 MS is cleaner for the conversions so I'll be using that.\n\nHere's the Energize rates with this suggestion: \n\n> Base Energize Rate: 12 per attack and 1 per 30 units traveled\n> Current {{item:3094}}: 15 per attack and 1.25 per 30 units traveled (16.25/s at 390 MS)\n> {{item:3094}} increase: +0.5 per 30 units traveled (=> 1.5)\n> {{item:3087}} increase: +6 per attack (=> 18)\n>\n> Format:\n> Items: X charge per attack and X charge per 30 units traveled (charge per second of movement at 390 MS)\n>\n> {{item:3094}} + {{item:3087}}: 18 per attack and 1.5 per 30 units traveled (19.5/s)\n> {{item:3095}} (alone): 13.8 per attack and 1.15 per 30 units traveled (14.95/s)\n> {{item:3095}} + {{item:2015}}: 15.6 per attack and 1.3 per 30 units traveled (16.9/s)\n> {{item:3095}} + {{item:3094}}: 15.6 per attack and 1.95 per 30 units traveled (25.35/s)\n> {{item:3095}} + {{item:3094}} + {{item:2015}}: 17.4 per attack and 2.175 per 30 units traveled (28.28/s)\n> {{item:3095}} + {{item:3087}}: 23.4 per attack and 1.3 per 30 units traveled (16.9/s)\n> {{item:3095}} + {{item:3087}} + {{item:2015}}: 26.1 per attack and 1.45 per 30 units traveled (18.85/s)\n> {{item:3095}} + {{item:3087}} +{{item:3094}}: 26.1 per attack and 2.175 per 30 units traveled (28.28/s)\n> {{champion:48}}  Build of {{item:3095}} + {{item:3087}} + {{item:3094}} + {{item:2015}}: 28.8 per attack and 2.4 per 30 units traveled (31.2/s)\n>\n> Essentially having all 3 makes the energize rate a little more than double the base (217.5% increase)\n> ...and having another Kircheis for whatever justified reason you may have would increase it to 240%...\n\nOnce again, doesn't fix the item slot dedication to defense (GA + BT) and IE issue but it makes Energize effects actually synergize better and thus makes Storm more viable to build into.\n\n---\n---\n\nAnyway, thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Anime Fizz","date":"2019-03-01T23:56:06.201+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem with the item is that it gives too little stats for its cost.\n\nAlso the bonus damage part itself of the item is completely useless since you're pretty much ALWAYS going to build it after you already have another energized item, which will make it irrelevant.\n\nI say remove the damage part of the energize effect it has (or increase so its the highest of the energized items) and if you do then you can just make it a 65~70 ad item again at a 3000 or 2900 cost.\n\nOr keep the low stats and simply increase both the storm energize base damage (so you actually gain some damage from building it compared to shiv or rfc) and the bonus effect to like bonus 60% of the energized effects.\n\nIt needs basically either to have a very powerfull passives with bad stats for its costs or have actual stats if the passives are going to be as tame as they are now, riot really underloaded the item.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-03-02T02:10:30.747+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"it gives adc a 40% Slow.

It's good, but doesn't scale well into the game. Just like previous Stormrazor. If they make the stats a bit more attractive you'll start seeing it more once people catch onto that. AD and AS is still a very potent combo, it's just hard to fit into builds right now because people want to max that crit chance and need some life steal too. Ideally this is a 4th item, but why not get a PD and a massive shield and maxed crit chance? Or ER to give you more ultimates for more kills, more plays, more everything?\n\nIt competes with too many good items, that is all.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2019-03-02T04:23:54.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Exactly why it needs to be a good item itself as well considering the point at which it will be bought. The slow being a powerful skill to have every 5 seconds in the early levels is meaningless, as you will never have it at that time. By the time you have it, late game has already begun. Also have to consider that *it's own energize damage* is being tossed out the window as well, meaning -50 damage for +30% (PS: it ends up weaker at all levels since RFC/Statikk will gain a max of 42 bonus damage from the +30% while losing Storm's 50).\n\nStorm will NEVER be first item. Storm will be at best a 4th item purchase after IE and Statikk.\n\nSo if you're gonna have it compete with the likes of {{item:3026}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3036}} it had better be decent enough to even be considered an option.\n\nAs it stands, Energize simply procs way too little during fights (about once every 6 seconds). This suggestion cuts that down to about 3 seconds, 2.5-ish if you have all 3 which also means you're foregoing the massive utility/defense of Phantom Dancer and the above options.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hilsun","date":"2019-03-01T14:59:20.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I need to actually play with it a bit more before I can have a real opinion on it.

It just doesn’t buff energized by enough to make it worth building over a defensive/lifesteal/armor pen item. It’s garbage as a one off item and if you’re building an energized item you’re better off getting an infinity exge after. That’s already three item slots. So let’s say you somehow opt for more damage to your burst? Just more AD, any other crit item, or armor pen will do that job better than stormrazor can (without it being buffed till it’s broken). \n\nSo it’s just such an auxillary item that there isn’t feasibly a time someone would want to build it over any of the alternatives. \n\nOn the other hand, I think your suggested changes to both rapidfire cannon *and* statikk shiv are net nerfs. The 5% attack speed is more valuable than 50% increased recharge rate from moving, which only really can be abused by yasuo. The 25% faster recharge on rfc is better overall because autos charge faster than moving. If you buy all three and get 145% increased recharge while moving and 45% increased recharge while auto attacking, it’s still lackluster because it’s an on hit that procs every few autos at best, one that furthermore relies on crit. \n\nI can narrow down the problem to one crucial thing. Statikk shiv requires a crit to do reasonable damage, to get reliable crit you need 100% crit chance which takes 4 items, furthermore infinity edge increases the damage of statikk shiv’s crit as well, so you need it to maximize its damage.
