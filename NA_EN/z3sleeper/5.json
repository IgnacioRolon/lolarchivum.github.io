It's kind of impossible to harass without hitting minions with q. If you just last hit, then Yasuo will naturally push. You said that he has his ult and cc, that is only possible with hitting q's on minions(even if you just use your abilities on the champ you will still push due to the minions going for you). There is no way that Yasuo cannot push unless he absolutely never uses his q which basically means that you can bully him into his turret. And his q isn't the only way that he pushes, when he uses his dashes, that also pushes, if he e's through minions and eq's you, the minions will still harass him and with e damage, will still push the lane. Most of the things you mentioned above only happens if he pushes. By the way, i'm not saying he does have a bad early, he has a pretty good early, but he can't win a 2v1 with no kills.\n> [{quoted}](name=PB4UAME,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4YleZYwO,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2019-02-20T03:43:52.478+0000)\n>\n> freeze with the pressure and threat range he can exert in many match ups, and the safety of his incredible mobility + windwall + CC + passive refresh on ult.","replies":[{"poster":"theChibiTina","date":"2019-02-20T11:45:42.713+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"He won't naturally push if he's only last hitting with his Q unless you're not trying to farm at all.

That combined with the fact that he roams early makes camping him pretty much useless unless it's before 6 and he's extremely pushed up.\n{{champion:420}} Yeah, this champ needs no explanation.\n{{champion:75}} If you camp this guy, that basically means he's bad and pushes the lane instead of either freezing the lane or farming in tower. Unless he gets a triforce and is against a pretty easy lane.\n\nOk, if you fight the enemy laner, what happens the minions start attacking you, and usually the player backs away, which means Yasuo follows. Which means that the minions also push. The logic of him pushing a lot is more easily applied to top lane than mid lane/bot lane.
