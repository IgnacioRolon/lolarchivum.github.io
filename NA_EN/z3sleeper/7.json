You assume wrong.\n\nIf you simply look at Renekton from that point of view, you'd see what I'm saying still holds true. Renekton used to have limited target access -- being that he only has a moderate range dash on a long-ish cooldown that can only be cast twice if it hits someone. This means to get to the back line he had to barrel through the front line which wasn't easy to do with how modest tenacity and healing were back then. Thus he built tanky so he could survive late game teamfights enough to put out at least some damage (with his ult, Q and Sunfire) and serve as a CC bot if he could close the gap on any priority targets.\n\nNow fast forward to today. *Everyone is a valid target* due to Conqueror and BC. He can't *waste* his spells on non-priority targets because Spear has them right back up after a W and an auto. Thus his mobility is also not being gated, meaning he's dashing around more and able to access priority targets more easily. He can't be as easily killed when building damage anymore due to a combination of Legend: Tenacity + Steraks + Merc Treads (if necessary, not always all 3) and his overbuffed Q healing combined with Conqueror and Death's Dance's broken interaction together with AoE spells. And ofcourse BC shredding everyone during his rampage.\n\nSo 1) his damage doesn't fall off and 2) his viability in teamfights doesn't fall off either. Both scale much more as the game goes on now.\n\nAaand onto Pantheon, he is the exact opposite.\n\n1) His damage *does* actually fall off. He needs to build bonus AD to scale whatsoever (due to the tAD ratio on E being removed) but doing so just isn't a viable option. Sadly the meta is so warped that building actual tank items and being a CC bot is no longer an option, so instead he builds BC, GA, EoN and Steraks to unload as much damage as possible while still having more health to tank at least two or three more attacks but with no sustain to back it up.\n\n2) His teamfight presence for the above reasons is absolutely lacking. Either he performs like a jank assassin/diver and kills someone only to immediately die afterwards or he simply does some damage then dies or he serves as a mediocre peel for the ADC (the latter being the most viable option, which is why you tend to see Pantheon in the support role most of the time). While he does have the BC AoE shred like Rene his is a short range channel that isn't helped out by a double dash re-positioning -- it's harder to land on multiple targets and half the time it gets cancelled or they walk out of it.\n\nThis is why Panth is being reworked. He's gonna be changed to somehow fit into this damage + sustain meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2019-05-07T11:20:13.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Academy Kayn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=No9Yhfx8,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2019-05-07T00:28:53.676+0000)\n>\n> You mistake the idea of an early game champion.

Earlygame or lategame is completely independent from role. Renekton used to be a good laner that actually fell off in lane, and in the 1v1, to finally only have a true teamfight stunbot tank lategame, which was actually fair, considering his crazy early damage.\nIf we take another example, Nasus, he's garbage earlygame but scales to become an excellent laner and splitpusher by midgame.\nYou seem to completely forget that there are items or scalings that make patterns less relevant. Panth can poke you early because you can't trade back or all in back. When it's mid/late game he simply can't do that EVEN IN THE 1V1 because you just all in and kill him. Champions stay the same but patterns change according to game time, even outside of teamfighting and even if no objectives have been taken on the map.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dingding123","date":"2019-05-06T20:13:50.025+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who has gotten gold/plat every season with primarily Renekton since his release (more recently on another account), I can say with confidence that the croc can make use of some pretty goofy runes and while only somewhat giving up his early game bully mantle actually have a really good lategame.\n\nCelerity + Nimbus + Relentless Hunter + Phase Rush/Arcane Comet (yes, with {{champion:58}}!) is fun; they let him roam around the map with ease once he has a bit of KP and either of those keystones are pretty good in lane considering Ren's abilities are all instant.
