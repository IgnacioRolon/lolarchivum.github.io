It doesn&#039;t matter who i play or where i play them i can never do good. It&#039;s starting to get annoying because i can&#039;t improve when I lane against people who actually know what they are doing and i go 1/15 and they still camp my lane. So my question is, How can I fix this? Because, frankly, I&#039;m about to give up. I can&#039;t play another game where I would be more useful being AFK then actually playing because i don&#039;t feed when AFK. So please, help me.","replies":[{"poster":"DrTeath","date":"2018-03-30T10:28:36.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go watch [this dude ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLk0vqad8dXss0QGwCHTRxg)  he explains why he does everything he does .
