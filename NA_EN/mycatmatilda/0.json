Not to mention the icon is technically an arcade icon like the missions require.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-12T20:28:27.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That event emote does only work during the event, but that's not to say this arcade event won't be coming back around sometime in the future either! Also, it turns out you *can* use that arcade baron icon to complete missions, any arcade icon will count towards arcade mission progress!","replies":[]}]}
