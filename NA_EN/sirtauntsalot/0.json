This is absurd as I said before. \n\n>Yes, whoever wants to access a private entity's services has to abide by their rules, or suffer consequences like post >removals and punishments.\n\nThe internet is public, Riot uses the Internet for its cyber roadways, its not private. Its more like a public subway full of all the same types of people you love so much. \n \n> Online or in person, is there ever a good time to be a brat?\n\nYes there is. \n\n> I know I try to be reasonable, and I think that's a much better thing to value than the ability to say whatever you want >on someone else's platform.\n\nFair enough.
