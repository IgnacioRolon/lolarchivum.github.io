Personally I'm tired of seeing, flash, ignite, heal, smite, and exhaust every single game. Perhaps buffing the other spells would help with this but introducing some new spells would be exciting.\n\nHere are a list of some summoner spells that I thought may be fun.\n\n* Summoner Throw - Throw an enemy champion or monster a short distance. Think Singed Fling.\n* Summoner Boost - Receive extra stats briefly. Such as AD AP and Armor.\n* Summoner Decoy - Create a fake copy of your champion.\n* Summoner Lightning - ~~Play God and strike an enemy champ with lightning. Similar to ignite except damage is upfront and is magic based. ~~  \n* Summoner Stealth - Turn Invisible for a short duration.\n* Summoner Boon - Send your champion a moderate amount of gold.\n* Summoner Shop - Summon a shopkeeper for 15 seconds anywhere on the battlefield. Team benefit. \n* Summoner Recall - Reduce your recall time to 2 seconds. \n* Summoner Winions - Scales per level. Summon some minions to your side. \n* Summoner Revive (reworked) Edited - Similar to the current the Guardian Angel but revives you with 45-175 HP (scales per level). Could be used for baiting out tower divers.\n\nThese are some idea's that I had. I realize that there are some balance issues here but these are just **ideas**. Also feel free to add some of your own!! The game could really use some new spells.\n\n**Edit: Added several of your spell suggestions that I thought sounded intriguing.  **\n\n* Blood Pact - Decrease your Ar / Mr (scaling), but deal 20% of damage back to attackers for 3 seconds.\n* Summoner Artillery (ranged only) - Increases attack range by 150 for 10 seconds.\n* Summoner GIB - Disables an enemies flash usage for a short time.\n* Summoner Mechanic - Repair an allied turret.\n* Summoner Slam - Preform a small AOE knock-back around your character.\n\n**Edit: This is pretty cool. **\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Blue Moon Wolf,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NmvKyE7A,comment-id=0020,timestamp=2015-03-10T03:18:51.526+0000)\n>\n> here's an Idea, passive summoner spells. you don't have an activation for them but just having them on you gives a buff that scales with your champ.","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-03-09T16:59:36.873+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"single eboy","date":"2015-03-09T18:08:58.087+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please, we need the Poro! ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2015-03-09T23:06:31.471+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"especially {{champion:201}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Major Sparkles","date":"2015-03-09T17:01:01.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:30}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-03-09T18:36:41.423+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would be epic, mind if I post some ideas?\n\n**Summoner Fortify**\nCauses the target allied tower to block the next 4 (+1 per level) champion basic attacks and 12 (+2 per level) minion basic attacks that could damage it. Shield lasts for a maximum of 10 seconds. While the shield is active, the tower gains 35% attack speed.\nRange: 5750\nCool Down: 240 seconds\nChampions it can benefit:\nSafe/Farm Lane Champions\n{{champion:41}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:83}} \n\n**Summoner Golden Age**\nIncreases your passive gold per second by 150% for 15 seconds. Is reduced down to a 15% boost for 5 seconds after taking damage. Once it runs out, you do not gain any gold per second for 4 seconds.\nCool Down: 210 seconds\nChampions it can benefit:\nHyper Carries\n{{champion:84}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:18}} \n\n**Summoner Disrupt**\nInterrupts channels and dashes on the target champion and cause their cool downs to be frozen for 1.5 seconds.\nRange: 900\nCool Down: 145 seconds\nChampions it can benefit:\nAll Damage/No CC Champions\n{{champion:84}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:91}} \n\n**Summoner Mechanic**\nHeals the target allied tower for 25 (+35% missing health) health instantly. Multiple Summoner Mechanics can be used on the same turret, but Summoner Mechanics used after the first are reduced to 25% effectiveness from the last Summoner Mechanic meaning the first would heal for 25 (+35% missing health), then 6.25 (+8.75% missing health), and then 1.5 (+2.18% missing health). This debuff lasts for a duration equal to the cool down of the Summoner Mechanic first used on the turret while it was not already debuffed to other Summoner Mechanics.\nRange: 750\nCool Down: 250 seconds\nChampions it can benefit:\nALL CHAMPIONS with a few standing out:\n{{champion:268}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:83}} \n\n**Summoner Recruit**\nNon-epic monsters that have been killed within the last 12 seconds can be revived to push down the target lane. Monsters are revived at the champion's current position. Monsters have 80% (+3% per level) of their maximum health and 85 (+4% per level) of their attack damage and attack speed. Towers will try and kill these targets after champions, but before minions. Recruited monsters grant 5 gold, but no experience.\nThis spell can replace Smite to buy Hunter's Machete and it's upgrades to become 4 different upgraded Recruits. If the champion has both Smite and Recruit, both will be upgraded. No matter what upgrade is chosen, recruited monsters health will be increased to 80% (+4% per level).\n**Oppressive Minions:** The equivalent to Chilling Smite. Causes recruited monsters to have their basic attacks slow the attack speed of enemy units and towers they hit by 30% for 2 seconds. Enemy champions only have their attack speed slowed by 20% for 1.5 seconds.\n**Destructive Minions:** The equivalent of Blasting Smite. Causes recruited monsters to have their basic attacks deal 33% splash damage around their target.\n**Rogue Minions:** The equivalent of Scavenging Smite. Causes recruited monsters to be able to be released into the target section of the enemy's jungle. When an enemy enters that section of their jungle, the monsters will charge at the target with a 5% movement speed boost and attack them. If a monster is told to go into the enemy jungle, they lose 66% of their armor and magic resist.\n**War Minions:** The equivalent of Challenging Smite. Causes recruited monsters to have 25% increased movement speed and prioritize enemy champions instead of minions. Their basic attacks deal 4% (+1% per level) bonus damage to enemy champions as well.\nRange: Global (targeting which lane/jungle section)\nCool Down: 260 seconds\nChampions it can benefit:\nFast Camp Clear Speed Junglers\n{{champion:32}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:77}} \n\n**Summoner Destruction**\nDeals 180 (+20 per level) true damage to the target tower instantly. This is reduced to 90 (+10 per level) if no minions or Zz'Rot Portal minions are within range of the tower.\nRange: 400\nCool Down: 185 seconds\nChampions it can benefit:\nHardcore Pushers/Split Pushers\n{{champion:268}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:11}}  {{champion:75}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:48}}  {{champion:23}} \n\n**Summoner Smoke Bomb**\nReduces the vision range of all champions and minions around you by 50% for 3 seconds and causes your champion to enter stealth for 2 seconds.\nRange: 850\nCool Down: 190 seconds\nChampions it can benefit:\nWeak Early Gankers/Suicide Lanes\n{{champion:31}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:106}}\n\n\nThis way, it provides much more choice. For example, is that enemy Jungle Lee Sin going to pick Flash and gain even more mobility or pick Recruit and gain more pushing presence? Is Jax going for the ultimate safe lane with Fortify and Golden Age or is he going to get Smoke Bomb and Flash for the increased sneakiness and mobility? Is Nasus going to choose Teleport or Destruction for either more stacks or extreme late game pushing, or is he going to pick both and leaving behind Flash? Is Trundle going to go to war with the enemy towers with a Destruction and Recruit combo? THE CHOICE IS YOURS!","replies":[{"poster":"Major Sparkles","date":"2015-03-09T19:03:35.232+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"A tower heal spell would be awesome.
