You can also click the button again to opt out. \n\n\n**If you're not on DJ Sona's team**, you won't be able to opt in to hear her music.\n\n*Side note: Make sure your in-game music is turned on, as it's tied to DJ Sona's music!*","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-03-03T00:53:08.456+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there any particular reason it was put there as opposed to on the scoreboard or somewhere else with a precedent?

I'm asking because the first month or so after the skin was released I didn't even realize you had to opt in, and after someone finally told me, I still simply forget it in most cases since it's a small button hidden somewhere on the HUD that is only there every 10 or 20 games. I've asked some of the people I play with about it, and they told me pretty much the same: they either didn't know about it, or constantly forgot to actually press it.\nI would have understoof it during the initial flood of the skin in every game, but now that this has died down, I feel that opt out with a more obviously placed button would be a much better choice. As it stands, I think a huge part of the community misses out on a lot of the work that went into the skin not because they want to, but because what they have to do in order to experience it is pretty terribly communicated to them.(If you won't consider making it opt out, maybe at least add a loading screen tip that says \"hey you can op in to hear sonas music\" when the skin is present in the game?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-21T23:09:20.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you load into the game, there's a pop up on the lower right hand side that lets you know you can/how to opt into DJ Sona's music when there is one in your game - it's similar to ARAM and the rules popping up about not being able to return to base to shop. \n\nWe felt that rather than forcing people to hear DJ Sona's music, it was a better to give players a choice to opt in if they wanted to.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-08-04T01:40:23.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I posted that as a response to the post above, I was never suggesting that they could.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-03-20T01:29:22.742+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Although she's an ultimate skin, we can't do this since there are scenarios where they may be a Sona on both teams. :]","replies":[{"poster":"Caytheles","date":"2015-07-27T12:43:21.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plz reply!!, but is there any chance that You will be able to Purchase more songs in the Future? like Lets say the store has a tab called \"Ultimate Boosts\" You can add more modes to her with more music! \"Would be for purchase though\" and then you can switch out \"Tracks\" in that tab with Tunes you purchased already.
