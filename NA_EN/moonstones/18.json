By this i mean you can select what wards you like and in game it will randomly pick one to put down every time you place  a ward.\nCurrently there's not much gain to owning more than one skin.

Specifically for supports, *at least* since they're the role expected to buy the most wards. I'd personally be happy if there were a Lulu-based one, with a little Pix on it or something.\n\nNow I got that out of the way: What I like about Ward Skins, is that it could add more 'personality' to you as a player. Say you're a huge Soraka fan and you want to show it, you'd buy the Starcall ward, so you can show how much of a fan you are even if you're not at the moment playing Soraka. Also, it might provide an incentive for players to buy more wards throughout a game, since you just got a cool new Ward Skin to show off (Specifically if said ward skin was based off of your favorite champion: *I cannot stress enough how much I want more champion based ward skins*).\n\n---\n\nThey can also, like certain champion skins have been in the past (The Victorious Skins, for instance), be something of a pride thing: I recall there being a ward skin for being gold or above (I think) last Season, or if you go to a convention and you get a ward skin. Because of how it works, you can show off this little achievement of yours (Making a certain rank/visiting a convention/etc) no matter what champion you play, since wards are a universal thing. As opposed to if the reward/gift was just a skin for a specific champion: You couldn't show off if you never played said champion.\n\n\nI can't say there's much I 'dislike' about the idea of ward skins (Besides not enough champion-based ones RITO PLLZZZ!), but at the same time, I do feel like they might be a bit expensive when they're worth RP, and if you're playing a role that doesn't buy a lot of wards, or just a player that doesn't buy wards in general, even if you have a ward skin you really like the look of, it might not be worth the cost to you. (EDIT: And as others mentioned, being able to change ward skins in champion select would be a welcome feature.)\n\n---\n\nAs for Ward Ideas that DON'T include the much-needed champi-**[Redacted for getting annoying]**, I've seen quite a lot of people demanding a Poro-based ward skin. I'm fairly happy with the Fist Bump Ward skin I have now (Thank you, Lyte C=), and pretty proud of having it in general, so I can't think of a specific 'theme' or something that I'd enjoy having more besides... well, you get the picture. \n\nAlthough you could also consider bundling a ward skin with whatever the new ultimate skin will when comes out, that'd  be pretty cool.\n\nEDIT: I keep editing this, and I'm sorry, but I kept thinking of some ideas.\nAnother idea I'd like to through out, would be faction-based ward skins, specifically ones of the various City-States of Valoran, like how there was a Shurima ward for the event. I could see this coming out if you ever had a lore event of Demacia vs. Noxus, or Zaun vs. Piltover, or the like, for players to show their support for a specific faction.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-09-26T23:55:42.470+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah, thanks for the awesome, in-depth feedback!

I believe the Riot Fist Bump ward skin and the Mecha ward skin are the best so far. The reason why I believe is the overall look and animation.\n\nI agree with everything that has been said previously, including that a way to select the ward skin in Champion Select would be awesome! Sometimes I forget that you have to go into the shop to change it.\n\nThe only thing I dislike is that the Riot Fist Bump ward skin is difficult to get your hands on. I **REALLY** want it, but it seems like the only way to get it is at special events, which usually don't take place near where I live. So a purchasable option, even for a limited of time, would be wonderful.\n\n**Some suggestions I have are:**\n\n**1.** More ward skins that go with sets of skins or are related to specific champions. (Similar to the Draven and Starcall ward skins)\n\nI like to buy things in bundles if possible and if there was a ward skin released in a bundle with a set of skins, it's an insta-buy for me and I'm sure a lot of players that buy the bundles would agree.\n\nA good example would be an **Arcade Ward Skin**. Have it be a miniature arcade machine or the Final Boss Veigar trophy that Miss Fortune is holding in her splash art.\n\nAnother good one would be a **Pool Party Ward Skin** that is a beach ball, inflatable tube or surfboard sticking out of the ground.\n\n**2.** Ward skins that randomize in a set upon being placed. (A Legendary Ward Skin kind of)\n\nFor example, if there was a Taric Gem ward skin and I bought it. When I place it in-game have it randomize between looking like a Sapphire, Emerald, Ruby, Opal, ect. So every time I place the ward, it rotates between them for variety. \n\nThey could even be priced slightly higher because of this effect. I'de say around 1,000 RP would be sufficient?\n\n**3.** Ward skins that you can only buy when you hit certain ranks. (You could have them look like the medals on the profile screen)\n\nIf you're in Bronze offer a Bronze ward skin in the shop that is purchasable for RP or 5-10k IP, but when you get to Silver, allow the players to purchase the Silver version for another 5-10k IP, then Gold, Plat, ect.\n\nSo that you can show off the highest rank you've achieved as a ward skin and give a little more use for IP (Because right now in my opinion, there isn't a lot to buy with IP once you have all the champs aside from runes and rune pages, so this will give a little more use for it.)\n\nPlus I think Diamond or Challenger ward skins would look awesome!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aamano","date":"2014-09-26T22:14:39.055+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I /like/ Ward Skins, but I don't feel like that Wards are seen enough to justify paying for one\n(that being said, I have the S3 Championship Ward, and Harrowing Ghost Ward)\n\nI really want an Anivia Ward (maybe her egg passive :D) but I know that won't happen since she ins't popular ;~;\n\nbut yes, overall I think the character themed wards are my favorites\nbeing able to show off your favorite character pride {{champion:34}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:34}} ","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-09-27T00:07:03.419+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"An Eggnivia ward skin would be awesome! ^.^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PhoenixOfHeaven","date":"2014-09-26T23:59:18.947+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe have them also be bought for a large amount of IP? they don't seem grand enough to be RP exclusive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miya Tenaka","date":"2014-09-26T22:31:39.919+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"As it has been said before, being able to pick your ward skin in champion select would be great!
