The PROJECT line looks a lot more like what a resistance to the Battlecast line would be. They realized that they can't overcome the evolution so they begin trying to augment humans on their own terms to defeat Viktor, making a point of keeping the original flesh and body, but accidentally end up with creations that actually have less of the original personality that Viktor's creations do as they struggle to match his overwhelming forces. \n\nOf course they hint that there is some humanity left but it causes inner conflict, a struggle to either bring it out (Robocop style) or the remnants of humanity cause issues with the tech/software. Either way thinking that it began as a gambit for survival via fighting fire with fire makes the whole skin series seem more interesting to me.","replies":[{"poster":"DemonCrayola","date":"2015-09-20T03:30:59.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In all fairness, it's difficult to add up a concept when it hasn't been explored with cinematics, promotionals or lore like PROJECT or Battlecast has. If anything, using the Resistance skin line as the protagonist between the two is just as fruitful as saying that the... Idk, for examples sake, the Headhunter lineup is the contra to the Battlecast lineup. Maybe the Headhunters are those who utilize high end technological upgrades without consulting to biological modifications to destroy the Battlecast terror? Especially with assassins like Rengar, Akali, and Cait as a sniper (which in concept bears assassin qualities) sort of pushes the idea of a \"move in, execute target, move out\" approach that would work as a fitting tactic against terminators. Of course we'll never know because there's nothing to promote that skin line.  \n\nStill, I really do like your theory. However, directly from the Battlecast promotional website, the Resistance lineup actually has a reference to the Battlecast skin line. This was Viktor's quote when talking about Battlecast Kog'Maw: \"My enhancements transformed the organism into a mechanized mortar. Full scale production initiated. The skies will scream with living artillery. **The Resistance** will crumble\" ( from http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/skin-release/battlecast-skins ).
