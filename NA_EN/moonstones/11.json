I don't care about splash art, and I don't even much notice model or texture changes. Particles, sounds, and animations are what control the feel of a skin, and so that's what I look for in the skins I buy. Here's some I think are pretty good:\n\n* As you say, Arcade Sona is definitely a good skin. For me, what really makes it work is the \"Armor up!\" particles that appear when she uses W. \n* The new Mecha skins are pretty good, thanks to the strong thematic cohesion and consistent use of motifs like the hex grid.\n* Surprise Party Fiddlesticks is very good. It doesn't have any animation changes, but it has on-point sounds, particles, and model changes. It even changes the terrified particle and the spell icons!\n* Pool Party Renekton nicely recontextualizes Renekton's fury, and reinforces its clever concept with good animations and sounds. The whistle makes this skin.\n* Simple, well-done 520 skins like Uncle Ryze, Li'l Slugger Trundle, Monarch Kog'maw, and Commando J4 fill the lower-cost slot nicely, while still adding something to the champion.\n\nAnd some thoughts on ones I don't think work as well as they ought:\n\n* Spirit Guard Udyr looks, sounds, and feels great. But it's hardly conceptually different from base Udyr. I know, I know, control vs. savagery, but with the savagery side so datedly expressed on base Udyr, SGU really just feels like Udyr Udyr. It offers a *better* experience than base Udyr, but not a different one.\n* Ice Drake Shyvana is pretty, but ultimately, it feels like a palette swap. It doesn't go far enough with the ice theme, in either sounds or particles.\n* Aether Wing Kayle and Eternum Nocturne are similar to SGU. They're pretty, but their theme isn't as distinct from the base skin to really make the skin as compelling as it ought to be. With Eternum, the voice is so filtered that the new VO (the main draw of a Legendary skin) loses its draw. Similar voice filter problems plague Battlecast Vel'koz, Soul Reaver Draven, and a few other skins.\n* Primetime Draven's does a very good job at sticking to its theme in sounds and particles, but the VO is too one-note. Base Draven established that Draven likes referring to himself in third person in only a handful of his original lines, but Primetime takes that good element and drives it into the ground. \"Draven doesn't do subtle,\" but the skin could at least use a little more variety.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-07-20T04:36:32.482+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, thanks for the honest feedback! I know it can be hard to say you don't like something, and for me especially, it's sometimes super hard to pinpoint *why*.\n\nI agree, I love skins that are more than just a palette swap. I love the skins that make playing the champion a different type of experience. Like you said, Pool Party Renekton is a nice change of pace for Renekton players ~ it's a little more on the fun, playful side. Plus, spamming his back animation is always fun. :3 \n\nSince you've got some solid ideas about what you like and dislike, lemme ask you this ~ are you more of a fan of a line of skins, for example Commando, so you can make a whole team of them, or would you be more partial to a skin that emphasized a champion's lore?","replies":[{"poster":"Thales","date":"2014-07-20T15:42:50.524+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, this is a lot of feedback you have in this thread!\n\nI'm not inherently a fan of skin lines (though my love of symmetry would make a line with only four champs feel irritatingly incomplete), but they usually produce at least one instance where the line concept meshes perfectly with the champion to produce something awesome. I really like Pool Party Renekton and Commando J4, but I don't have any particular interest in getting Pool Party Graves or Commando Lux, for instance. Running the full set of some line is cool, but so hard to arrange. I sort of wish there were some minor cosmetic bonus when running a full skin line. Like your towers all have sunglasses if you're running the full commando line.\n\nI do like lore skins if they're pulled off well. One challenge to do doing so is that a champ's lore tends to be pretty well encapsulated in its base skin these days, so finding a distinctive direction to go in for a lore-based skin can be tricky. There's also the question of whether skins are the best medium to convey lore, given that they usually read as less \"canonical\" then other content. I suppose some recent-ish lore skins are Creator Viktor, SGU, sorta Blackfrost Anivia, and Tyrant Swain, all of which do kind of feel like just enhanced versions of the base champion. Only Blackfrost Anivia really plays well with Anivia's lore, and it's more of an alternate-universe version than a straight evolution. I think lore skins could work well, but not for every champ and not in every situation.\n\nShow me Freljord Queen Sejuani. Show me a high general Swain that doesn't just get flashier particles. Show me what will happen to Varus when the blight completely consumes him. Go back in time as well as forward. Show me Renekton before he fell to fury and madness. Show me card-sharp Graves from when he was buddies with TF. Above all, make these feel different. These lore skins should be dealing with huge, character-defining moments. Would Renekton walk with so animalistic a gait before his fall? Lore skins should add more to a character's personality than just snazzy looks and sounds.\n\nBy the way, I've seen Spellthief Lux mentioned several times as a favorite skin, but I've never quite understood why. Could someone explain her appeal?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-07-20T16:26:29.840+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah, that's a really cool add-on idea for a full skins team. \n\nI agree, sometimes lore skins can be super tricky. Plus, if the lore isn't super prominent, it may be difficult for some players to understand why the skins exists in the first place. \n\nI really like the idea of a pre-fury Renekton. I think that'd be a cool angle to play off, especially since we have skins like Pre Void Kassadin. It would be cool to show what champions were like before x event, and even cooler if we could portray that in skins. 'Cause honestly, it'd be cool to see what some champions looked like before certain events! \n\nFreljord Queen Sej would be amazing. I think Sej is one of the under appreciated champions. I mean, who doesn't like riding around on a boar (OR A BEAR IF YOU'RE PLAY AS BEAR CALVALRY!)\n\nAs far as Spellthief Lux is concerned, I think everyone likes that skin 'cause it's the best in her line. At least, that's why I like it so much. A lot of her skins are sort of combat-oriented, and this one kind of stands out. Plus, I know a lot of people aren't a fan of poor Sorceress Lux 'cause of her splash. xD","replies":[{"poster":"Thales","date":"2014-07-20T17:01:42.235+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pre-void Kass should totally have the voice filter removed.\n\nIt's the little details that can make or break a skin. I'm a big Sejuani fan, and the main thing I like about Bear Calvary is the concussive whine after you use her E. With Arctic Ops Varus, it's the delicate mechanical plinking sound for his autoattack. Conversely, Hazmat Heimerdinger to me feels like just a palette swap, because the sounds are mostly the same, and the grenade has an electric particle rather than a chemical one. I like Haunted Zyra, but the hard-reorient on recall and the fact that her necromantic energy autoattack has the same sound as her base skin's make the skin fall just short of great. Sounds are one of the best avenues for conveying a thematic cohesion to the skin, but one false note can bring the symphony down.\n\nYou raise a good point about the prominence of a champion's lore being a factor. In light of that, might lore skins be best released in conjunction with a major lore event like the Shadow Isles or Freljord events of the last couple years?\n\nI guess with Spellthief Lux it's in part that I don't really look at skins as they compare to other skins for that champion, and don't notice splash arts one way or the other. If Lux's other skins were as good as, say, Ziggs's skins are, I'm not sure if anyone would notice Spellthief Lux.","replies":[{"poster":"RavenHusky","date":"2014-07-20T17:20:28.146+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue I take with the other Lux skins, is that the military theme of all of them is at odds with her in game personality.

The fact that it also based off Girls Generation and a fan made skin idea, makes me even happier. I would love to see this turn into a theme.\n* Blackfrost Anivia - Despite it being buggy, the vfx are awesome. I love the idea of giving champions \"evil\" skins. You should ask Riot Penguin about his life time goal to do this.\n* Soul Reaver Draven -  One of the most coolest skins imo. I just like the theme of soul reaving...\n* Ghost Bride Morgana - Riot Morgageddon could probably give a better reason than I can. It's utterly gorgeous in design and visuals. I also like the idea of folklore related skins such as this, Lochness Cho'gath, and River Spirit Nami.\n* Battlecast, Mecha, Full Metal, Hextech, Steel Legion, etc. (Pulsfire?) Skins - Who doesn't love high tech and metal based skins?\n* Arclight and Justicar Skins - Shiny and Awesome. Feels like your a judicator putting justice in summoner's rift. I like the idea of giving these light themed skins to evil/dark champs. Thresh would be a good conteneder, but I would hate to see the theme just be restricted to just evil characters though.\n* Arcade Skins - Probably for the same reasons you provided. I like the idea of putting a generation of tech/electro music and gaming into a theme. Suggestion: DDR Orianna? She's a pro at dancing according to her lore.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-07-20T05:15:06.629+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OH MAN. DDR ORIANNA IS SUCH A COOL IDEA. \n\nOooh, a Popstar theme?! Who else would you put in it?!","replies":[{"poster":"Mansana","date":"2014-07-20T07:00:07.009+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad you like DDR Orianna. I always imagined her ball having a rave oriented light effects with bass and more 8-bit sound effects for her skills. If this skin was made I'd probably call all my friends over so we could start fist pumping on summoners rift. There's a lot of creativity that could go with the skin.\n\nI'm not sure who I would add in for the popstar skin line. I would probably be too biased. I've been corrupted by Kpop since 3 years ago... even though I have no clue what they're saying, catchy beats and little english phrases make it hard for me to embrace other types of music. It's quite sad. But if I would choose I think I would put the following:\n\n* Caitlyn - Riot Zeronis said he would really like to make this skin possible or at least some fan art especially with fan creations like [this one](http://abskiee123.deviantart.com/art/Popstar-Caitlyn-437192360). I'm sure the fans would love this skin.\n\n* LeBlanc - This would probably be a little biased since the artist that I would want to reference is (surprise!) another Korean. Her name is Ga In. I would love LeBlanc to reference her and the dance from Abracadabra by Brown Eyed Girls (Dance Version); you may also know this dance from Gentleman by Psy. Before you look up the song... it \"might\" be NSFW. They both have short hair and their smokey appearance seems very attractive. However, I don't think it's necessary to reference anything... just thought it would be a nice touch since her staff could be visually changed into a microphone stand.\n\n* Syndra - Probably a lot of bias. Syndra is my main champion. I'm not sure if the theme would mesh well with her kit or personality. I really like her SNSD \"Hoot\" dance reference for her current model. But this is just me playing favoritism.\n\n* Ezreal  - Many suggest him because we need more lady fan service. Not sure what other male champions fill the popstar theme... Malzahar? I'm not sure what ladies are into.\n\nIt's really hard to choose champions so they can perfectly fit the theme. I usually let the creativity up for Riot and the community, especially Riot because your surprises are always awesome.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ahri Body Pillow","date":"2014-07-20T00:41:43.492+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Popstar Ahri!!!!
