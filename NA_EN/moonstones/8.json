You can grab more info about the Snowdown and all the stuff that's going on [here](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/snowdown-coming#snowdown-stuff)!\n\n**TL;DR**: When you buy a Legendary skin this Snowdown, you’ll unlock a free Mystery skin! If that Mystery skin happens to be a Legendary, it unlocks another Mystery skin and can continue to snowball from there. *Ultimate skins also count!*\n\n**A couple things to note:**\n\n* If your Mystery gift is a legendary or an ultimate, you'll continue to snowball and receive **another** Mystery Gift. \n* If you gift a Legendary Snowball, the person you're sending it to will **also** receive the Mystery Gift. \n* If you gift someone a Legendary Snowball and their Mystery Gift is a legendary (or ultimate), they'll receive **another** Mystery Gift. (TL;DR, you can snowball from gifting.)\n* There is no limit as to how many skins you can snowball with! *Feelin' lucky?*\n* Surprise Party Fiddlesticks and Primetime Draven, while priced as 975 RP, are legendary skins and are part of the Legendary Snowball. *They're permenantly discounted as a thanks to players.*\n* Legacy Legendary skins listed in the [Snowstorm Sale](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/caution-snowstorm-sale-incoming) are also part of the Legendary Snowdown. \n* There's a double legendary chance for the mystery skin you get from Legendary Snowball. Normal mystery gifting doesn't have this multiplier.\n* Legendary Snowballs bypass the normal 10 available skins rule. You only need to have one eligible skin. This only applies to the Mystery Skin attached to the legendary. Mystery gifting still has the 10 item restriction.\n* You'll know if Legendary Snowball is active when you see the [check box](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CW5Wm7HWQAAefXT.jpg:large) on the purchase confirmation page in the store. If you see that, there will be a Mystery Skin with your purchase! \n\nI think this covers all the odds and ends! If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask!","replies":[{"poster":"delonix","date":"2015-12-17T01:49:54.495+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are Astronaut Teemo, Lion Dance Kog’Maw, and Piltover Customs Blitzcrank legendary skins with permanent discounts or did they lose their legendary status?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-17T05:45:01.804+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're not tagged as legendary skins, so they won't be part of this promotion.","replies":[{"poster":"elon wątroba","date":"2015-12-17T08:45:16.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blitz used to be a legendary, did that change?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-17T16:20:27.103+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It did.
