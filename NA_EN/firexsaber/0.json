I see a lot of the negative feedback out there already, but I think it would also be good to point out what was good about the event and what would continue to work for the future. This is my opinion obvious, so feel free to agree/disagree/post memes/whatever in the comments below.\r\n\r\n**The Good**\r\n\r\n**Tiered Rewards-** I like the reward system here. I think it was a good choice having little pay-offs while working toward a larger goal. The rewards themselves were also pretty good and things that we'd want to work for. (POOL PARTY MINIONS!!!!)\r\n\r\n**Community-Wide Points-** I found it pretty fun for the entire community to be working toward something. Having the common goal/ event felt rather unifying, which is good in a PvP environment in my opinion. \r\n\r\n**POOL PARTY MINIONS-** Yeah, I really like these. I hope minion skins start being released mire often. (Like Snow down minions, those would be great. Imagine casters throwing snowballs)\r\n\r\n**The Bad**\r\n\r\n**Five Man Pre-mades** I understand that the point of this event was to get people playing in groups, but having it have to be a five man almost discouraged it in some ways. For instance, sometimes we could only get four people and it made us hesitant. What was the point? What if we fought a five-man and won? Would we end up costing the community points? Maybe we should just wait around to see if a 5th person shows up. (Downtime= less games played!)\r\nWhat I would suggest is giving points for groups of three plus with maybe a super bonus to five mans, even if that means upping the points that are needed to go up tiers. \r\n\r\n**Points On Wins- **It was a little extra demoralizing to lose now, since it cost the community points. (5 mans aren't always against 5 mans, I find). I would suggest what I suggested above: Giving out points for losses, but giving a bonus for wins. That way everyone feels like they're contributing.\r\n\r\n**The Ugly**\r\n\r\n**The Points Tracker-** If it could be updated more than once a day, that would be good. It was a little bit frustrating to not be able to see how we were doing more often.\r\n\r\nThis is what I think anyway.

It was an event, kudos.\n\nThe Bad\n\n1. The 5 man requirement was just way too much, I think it should have been 3 or more people. \n\n2. The timing was just terrible and kinda seemed like an asshole thing to do. Not everyone is flowing with cash, many people have been saving up just for the steam sale, why would you think they'd drop that to spend 10 bucks on rp to GIVE to someone else. Thats just silly.\n\n3. Really....Mundo? I mean....the other skins were so much better. I dont even play zac but that one was better. I think there should have been like a pole to see which skin the COMMUNITY liked as a whole. Maybe that would have motivated more people to try to reach the goal. Because I know that I didn't care at all but still participated.\n\nThe Ugly\n\n1. Really, we win..a..discount? Come on\n\n2. The whole gifting thing literally just disgusted me. Seriously Riot. The gifting should have been 5 points and the teaming up should have been 20. From my understanding, people spending money on your game was more important than anything else. Which as I said, is disgusting. I understand your a company and your here to make money. But don't pretend to care when its quite obvious that you don't. \n\n3. Again, I can't even stress enough how that whole gifting thing was just sad. If the community hates each other, why the hell would they want to send a random stranger that was probably harassing them all game a skin? Sigh\n\nSide Note:\n\nAs I said, this is just purely my opinion and how I feel about it. I just hope in the future Riot can do a real event for the community, instead of a week long cash grab. As crazy as this sounds Riot, giving things out to your community won't hurt you.

If we hit level 6, the players were promised both the champ, and the skin.  Giving a free 6300 IP champ AND a skin to every participant seems like too much.  Also, if you think about it, the other 4 Pool Party champs have more complicated kits and might not be as appealing to new players.  (If I was new, I would hate to get Draven.  His mechanics are just too hard for new players.)\n\nTL;DR: All other champs are too complex/expensive to give out.\n\nEdit: Who doesn't want to throw Ukeleles at people while being unkillable.  {{champion:36}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-06-22T23:12:14.278+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Bad\n\nonly 2 prizes really matter for the long time players.

I'm not friends with 4 other high plat / diamond players, let alone that would be online at the same time-- I don't know if you know this, but normals are kinda miserable when you drag your silver friend into a diamond match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SteveKareha","date":"2015-06-23T03:14:40.090+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**The Good**\n\n1. The Community working together for once. I will tell you this Riot, make more events like this, it makes the community nicer all together.\n2. ARAM and Dominion being played more. \n3. CHAT ROOMS ARE SO MUCH FUN. I MET A BUNCH OF GOOD AND FUNNY PEOPLE THERE!\n\n**The Bad**\n\n1. The premades, It should have been from 2 people onwards, with more points racking up the bigger your group was.\n2. There was no individual progress, like how much did I contribute? Individual rewards would have been good too for motivating people.\n3. Making the highest contributions available only via RP gifting. Granted you're making someone else happy but I'd rather spend RP myself.\n4. The Time limit was not enough\n\n**The UGLY**\n\n1. There was no feeling to the event overall, as many people said before Pool Party Minions already available would have been a good start, instead of a reward, maybe the next time make the minions available right away and replace that tier with a ward.\n2. People with the related skins should have earned more points.\n3. Discount rewards feel generally shitty, not everyone wants to spend RP on SELECT skins.\n4. IP bonuses are nice, but often feel underwhelming when you're the type of player who already has a hoard of IP. (Maybe if we had SOMETHING *cough* _Chromas & Icons_ *cough* to spend it on it would have been better)\n\n**The Future**\n\n1. More colorful events with ocurrences in-game\n2. More equal rewards for free players and people who buy RP.\n3. Throw in Chromas in events so it doesnt hurt your economy by giving out actual \"Skins\".\n4.

The fact that they still have their account means they still can get better, why take away from them.

If this is true and you were testing with one region, then is it really ok to make it so other region(s) can't achieve the goal?\n4) One week wasn't long enough.\n5) It didn't feel as much like an event because there wasn't a game mode to accompany Pool Party and the event wasn't advertised very much (also point 1). - People have also mentioned lane minions during the event, which would tie into a game mode.\n6)","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-06-26T17:21:23.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah the premade point earning means i was trying to pair up with random people for 5v5s and the matchmaking was a little rough. give points for premade 3s and or 4s as well and let the matchamaking fill the extras in.
