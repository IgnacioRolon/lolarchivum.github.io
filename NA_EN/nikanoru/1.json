I synced up with our Game Designers and discussed various solutions that could be put in place. We have some ideas that are currently in development, but we also know that spammers regularly adapt their strategy to overcome constraints we put in their way. This is not the first time we defend our players from the spamming problem, so we're approaching it a bit differently.\n> \n> Anyway, we're going to implement some mechanics to stop/reduce the amount of requests, but additionally, we're working on solutions that will let you gather more information about the person that is inviting you. Things like a link to their profile, their level, etc, should help you to distuinguish a legit player from a bot. I'm planning on giving you some more details soon, or maybe ask our Game Designers to describe the problem and our plans form their point of view.\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[]}]}
