This has occurred every game since I updated to patch 6.12.  By hitting escape I am able to exit from the loading screen to a crash message, \"The Game has crashed\" (something along those lines), and attempt to reconnect but it the crash message reappears a few times and before the reconnecting is successful.  Once I actually start playing and get past the loading screen I have no problems. Also got a leave buster penalty because I didn't realize what was happening at first I thought it was slow....after 8 minutes I realized something was wrong, but the crashing is more irritating.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-16T00:23:23.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm...do you have LoLReplay running by any chance?  If so, try disabling that to see if it helps.\n\nOtherwise, it looks like there is an issue connecting to the individual Game Server or your computer is not able to load League of Legends properly.  Connection issues are usually much more common so I would like to rule this out as a possible root cause first.  To do this, make sure to complete all of the steps found in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).  There are a lot of steps there, but they are crucial in hopefully resolving this issue.\n\nRespond back and let me know if it doesn't help at all!","replies":[{"poster":"TomSparks","date":"2016-06-16T09:10:18.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe you were right with a connection issue, the problem isn't occurring at all anymore!
