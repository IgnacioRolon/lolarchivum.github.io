So for the longest time I've avoided pvp. When I first learned how to play, my friend who was teaching me, told me to just avoid it. So for the longest time and even now, I'm still afraid of it. I've played a ton of bot games (the QUEEEN of bot games) and just back in November, started to play ARAM. I'm level 30 now and I've only had roughly under 30 normal games so far.\r\n\r\nI'm just really scared to play because I'll get flamed at for not being very good at playing normals. I've played support for most normals (yes I'm a girl) but only to learn the mechanics of it. I definitely hate being support but I can't really play any other role for fear of it. Most of my normal wins are due to playing with friends, but  now that I'm 30, I'm being put in games with people who are ranked silver and low gold and the occasional bronze, which is silly to be afraid of I know, but I just feel so inadequate. ;c I'm such a scaredy cat and I want to play normals with \"ease\" without friends.\r\n\r\nSo if any of you have any tips and your experiences, please share! It'll be nice knowing I'm not completely alone in this field, or if I am, >.< sorry.\r\n\r\nP.S. I have a smurf, and playing normals on that is completely fine for me since everything is low level. I just wish I didn't let my friend get to my head about avoiding pvp completely.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2015-01-04T23:22:40.595+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best thing you can do is just play. You just kinda have to get over the fear of it all.\n\nIf don't end up being very good, your Matchmaking Rating will decrease and you'll play with weaker players. The inverse if true of course if you do super well. Eventually, you'll end up playing with players at your skill level. So don't worry about it!\n\nWhat you're seeing with your smurf is that playing with/against real people doesn't have to be scary. Just play!

Bots are better than 90% of the player base.\n\nTo be honest, there's no real secret to getting over the fear. I didn't have it in norms, but I had it when I first started playing Ranked and still get it every now and again since I don't try to climb that often. You just have to suck it up and try it out. First time is likely going to suck, but that's alright. Let your team know at the beginning that you're kinda new to the role, and do your best. As you play it more and more, you'll learn the differences between playing against someone else as opposed to a bot and you'll adjust. The fear will gradually decline along with your growth. After awhile, PvP will feel normal and you'll wonder why you were scared for so long.\n\nPlaying with friends is actually really nice because you can count on them to be supportive knowing ahead of time that you're still adjusting. Some randoms will try to help if you tell them early on in the game, but at this point it doesnt matter who you play with. You just want experience. If you see that someone has nothing productive to say (only flaming for being inexperienced which is really dumb imo), just mute them and keep practicing.

I was playing WoW and a few friends had started League. My friends aren't people who often enjoy PvP so we played custom games vs each other or the bots and I'm talking about the basic bots who walk to lane and die over and over again. This was before CO-OP vs AI. After I hit level 30 those friends started to play less and playing a custom game without anyone else vs those bots was boring so I started up PvP.\n\nI remember my first game really clearly we were vs a Karthus {{champion:30}}  and I was Ashe {{champion:22}} the first time seeing his ulti I tried to flash it. My whole team made fun of me and really put me down. The {{champion:4}} Twitch Fate on my team started to make fun of my item build and pointed out what I needed to buy for a little bit and another team mate of mine said 'not worth it she's bad and worthless.' I felt so put down after that game I honestly wanted to quit and I did for a little bit. \n\nA little while later I ended up looking over the forums and there was a 'help school' for new summoners and I ended up adding one of the coaches and started to ask him questions and they were so helpful and nice. His first tip was to forget the flamers and remember everyone learns at a different pace. He also told me to try and avoid ranked until I had a better understanding of the game. He would link me guides to different champs and I would try to stick to the same few. {{champion:37}} Sona {{champion:22}} Ashe and {{champion:84}} Akali.\n\nMy overall advice is if you are enjoying the game don't let others control your experience of it. If you enjoy one role stick to it and master some champions in that role. Try out Team Builder when you're soloing and not with friends. People in team builder tend to be a lot nicer and understanding when you are learning/testing out a new champion or role. If you have questions or need advice or want someone to play with you can add me in game.

Kills are worth roughly 15 creeps. If you're out cs-ing your opponent by 15, you have the gold equivalent of a kill lead. This is even important for supports because sometimes people just leave entire lanes worth of free farm. Also, the goal of League when playing against people is to do things for free. Punish them for not protecting themselves/objectives. This is important on a macro scale (let's take the tower/dragon/baron) and on a micro scale (I should hit the enemy when he's stuck in his auto attack animation/when he's in my range).

Stay as mobile as you can. Successful mids are those that can dish out harass and get their cs while avoiding the opponent's harass and making it difficult for their opponent to farm. A good person to practice this with is Syndra. Three out of her four spells can be cast while moving. One of the reasons she's such a powerhouse in lane is that she can use her Dark Sphere and Force of Will while actively moving to dodge her opponent's counterattacks. Also, a lot of new/inexperienced mids underestimate the effectiveness of autoattacks. Early game, they represent a decent amount of damage.

The smurf's being matched with people who should be closer to your own skill level. This will be a better way to transition into playing more PvP on your own. Don't give up on playing with friends though, since that's hands down the best way to play.\n\nIf I'm trying a role or champion I'm not familiar with, I tell people in the pre-game lobby that I'm doing that. It lets them plan accordingly (they can choose picks they're more comfortable with) and if they start flaming me it gives me a way out (\"Hey, I warned you before hand I was new at _____\"). Almost everyone is fine if you tell it to them like that.\n\nYou'll probably want to keep playing on both accounts, to get more experience. Ask your friends if you can try different rolls while you're with them. If it's possible (such as if they can come over to your house or you can meet up somewhere), have one of them watch what you're doing in game as you're doing it. Often more experienced players can point out little things you can improve to help you learn a new champion faster. If a friend can't come over, use a service like na.op.gg to record your games and watch them later to see if you (or they) can point out what you did wrong.\n\nYou'll get the hang of it, it'll just take a little while to get over the nerves.
