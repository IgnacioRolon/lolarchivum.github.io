You almost never saw any form of scripts or hacks in DotA (at least in my experience), however from different accounts of previous League scripts it's almost certain that the 2 games can not be compared in this area. In DotA, the last major exploit (that I remember) was  where you could change the models of trees into pumpkins to see juke paths much easier. (This was actually a lot more important then youd think from reading it.) There were no actual changes to any gameplay, however. There were only model changes. I don't believe that there is any way to change any sort of in game things besides models in a live game played on DotA. League, however, has had several exploits in the past involving players changing game files. This could be in part due to the fact that DotA may have a tighter system around this or handles the game files differently- I'm not educated enough to tell you this. Assuming Riot integrates it in the right way, there shouldn't be any issues with people using any feature from practice mode into normal games or to enhance their scripts.
