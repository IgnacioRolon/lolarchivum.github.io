Because i would love to make a skin for yasuo but if i made it i want to have it for free at least + why didnt u give some more champions the void skin or the NEW god fist lee sin skin{{champion:157}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hudzâcă","date":"2017-03-29T18:06:24.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like Yasuo soo....
