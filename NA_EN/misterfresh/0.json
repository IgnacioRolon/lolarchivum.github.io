It doesnt matter if its a normal game, aram,custom or training. The screen gets black after the champ select and I get the pop up that I could not connect to the server. I reinstalled the game and repaired it a few times already. I already changed my DNS. The only way to join the game was to constantly restart the client till it magically connects and than Im like 5 to 10 mins late in to the game. Leaver buster incoming I guess... I added all the important exe from league like the rads.exe and lol.exe to the firewall exceptions, still no improvement. Its feels like its random if I can join or not. I also tried to start the game in windowed mode and I still could not connect. Im playing normally on the EUW servers from Germany.\nThe problem started after the last small patch. I could play without any problems last weekend  (06.17.2017). \nIf anyone else has this problem or a suggestion for a fix please feel free to write it down below. \n\nHELP MEEEEEH {{summoner:3}}\n\nUpdate 2:\nI removed my display driver (UDD) and the League client completely from my PC and reinstalled everything from scratch, still no improvement. I randomly can and cannot connect sometime. So I would say that the display driver is not the main cause of my problem{{summoner:3}} \n\nUpdate 3:\nI updated my router firmware and opened up the league specific ports. No progress at all, cant play league anymore{{summoner:1}} \n\nIm writing a Ticket now. I assume that my problem is caused by my internet provider. They must have done something that prevents me from joining the game. I dont really know what else I can do. Maybe the universe is telling me stop playing {{champion:136}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-06-25T04:03:23.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That does sound really exhausting. ;_;\nI don't mean to discount your troubleshooting, but I want to make sure that you've tried everything so far in the Connection Troubleshooting Guide [**over here**](http://riot.com/12B7oac). Honestly it already sounds like you've given that guide a run for its money, but each step can help us eliminate potential causes for the disconnect.\n\nIf you already have tried them all, you should reach out to our Tech Support team [**in a ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for them to take an in depth look at this problem to see what's keeping the game from going into Loading properly. They'll have more steps you can try out and can look at logs to see any specific problems that are causing this.","replies":[{"poster":"MisterFresh","date":"2017-06-25T09:19:19.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, \n\nhonestly I tried to do most of the easy steps from the guide like you already said. One of the missing things that I did not try was to setup a static ip and port forwarding ( I hate port forwading...{{summoner:21}}. Too many devices at home and too many guests ).\n\nI will try looking further into the cause of my problem. \nI deinstalled my graphic driver completely (UDD) and deinstalled the League client again and Im downloading everything from scratch again... If nothing else helps I will have to format my PC and if even this doesnt help I will have to stop playing till a new patch comes out where my problem will be solved . {{champion:26}} CHRONOSHIFT\n\nIf I cant solve it, I will write the suggested ticket.
