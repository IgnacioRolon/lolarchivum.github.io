She snowballs FAR too easy with just Q and it&#039;s basically a instawin because the damage she can do before you can even react while dodging most of your abilities with Spell Shield. She deals far too much damage with so short cooldowns from a safe range barely anyone can contest her on. Late game she is almost impossible to kill unless you focus her and the rest of her team destroys you in the process which is a instant loss. So either rebalance her or remove her seriously. It&#039;s almost as pre rework Evelynn OPness.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}
