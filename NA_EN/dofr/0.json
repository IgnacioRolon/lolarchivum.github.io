His W lasts less and only needs 2 seconds to be reactivated (iirc), it also scales with his maximum health and with his opponent's maximum health so it's not useless if you aren't building AP.

His passive and E are lackluster and forgettable and I would love for those to be removed.\n\nQ and W are pretty bland and as long as his R is a global ability I would be fine with it, even if they changed it to a completely different type of ability.

I liked the idea of his W being a channel that breathed fire in a cone after the cleanse and heal over time. Q could easily either be a skillshot or switch between range and melee, sword or gun.

So much wasted potential, and such a terrible visual update. Rest in peace, my beloved Desperada skin.\n\nI'll never forgive them for this. Her rework easily was among the worst in the entire history of this game with **almost zero interaction** between the guy in charge (**Stashu**) and those who actually played her before. Anyone even know where the hell that guy's right now?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2015-04-09T19:28:36.829+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eve and Poppy are getting \"Sion-Class reworks\" as quoted by a Rioter. So those two will hopefully be as cool.\nOther reworks like Ryze's are smaller since he is not visually offensive and only needs a gameplay change.\nAnother thing is that some champs lack a theme, or at least a noticeable one, and that's why they get reworked.","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-04-09T20:00:12.221+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sion-class means... Totally changing role of a reworked champion? \nSion rework is more like creating totally new champion.

His passive doesn't feel at all like his old ult, so I wouldn't count it (probably because you don't attack as fast, old ult was an AS steroid too).\n\nHe went from high AD, lifesteal, team healing bruiser to high CC lockdown and initiation tank.  The only things he kept were infinite health and a shield he can detonate to do damage.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
