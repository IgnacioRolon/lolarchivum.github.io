I mean, suppose we keep the same bonus and restrict it: would Ahri need more mobility then, and if so, how much more? This isn't about giving Ahri a pseudo-flash on Q or something, it's about tying her mobility in better to her nuke. Simply removing the decay would make the movespeed bonus a lot more powerful, without necessarily making her too strong. You're also jumping to conclusions here, as if Ahri would need to be broken OP just so that she could survive a more restrictive movement speed boost, when even just making that change without buffing her movement speed would likely still leave her as a very successful champion.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-02-24T07:23:04.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> this change would make for cleaner and more predictable play patterns, because her utility would no longer be dissociated from her damage.\n \nThe less predictable part ought to be obvious.  Precisely when the MS boost will activate is dependent on the opponent's movement, and the opponent doesn't know when the Q will be cast.  Trying to predict exactly where Ahri will be, even if we assume that she will keep moving in her current direction, is more challenging.  As a result, both sides are guessing more than they are currently guessing.\n\nOn the cleaner front, Ahri's play pattern no longer has a clear optimization case.  Previously, Ahri wanted to land max range Q, and the opponent wanted to avoid max range Q.  Now, Ahri gets unclear value from many ranges of landed Q.  The opponent no longer has a clear idea of where to position relative to Ahri.  Unclear optimization leads to muddled gameplay; strategy games work better when goal states are clear.\n\n> Is it really that bad? I mean, suppose we keep the same bonus and restrict it: would Ahri need more mobility then, and if so, how much more? \n\n* Ahri can miss\n* Ahri now must react to when the MS buff is triggered; harder to plan routes for the ball\n* The MS buff occurs later.  In particular, if two mids attempt to trade skillshots and shoot at the same time, MS on hit is pretty useless for Ahri, when on cast it is very valuable.\n\nAll in all, X% MS on cast is obviously a lot better than X% MS on hit.  It would need to be 2X% or even 3X% on hit to have an equal contribution to power budget.

Previously, Ahri wanted to land max range Q, and the opponent wanted to avoid max range Q.  Now, Ahri gets unclear value from many ranges of landed Q.  The opponent no longer has a clear idea of where to position relative to Ahri.  Unclear optimization leads to muddled gameplay; strategy games work better when goal states are clear.\n\nThe reason a max-range Q is optimal is because it gives Ahri's opponent the shortest window to avoid both applications of damage. It is not optimal in the sense that Ahri something out of it that she couldn't otherwise. There are different ways of tying her mobility to her damage (you could have it apply on the first instance of damage dealt with her Q on a champion, and perhaps refresh it on a second application, for example), but ultimately doing so would still allow Ahri to use her movement speed boost to readjust her orb as she can now, assuming her orb has enough time to readjust. Max-range Qs would still give her a movement speed buff, so there's no loss in optimization. Ideally, though, her optimal Q use shouldn't be its max-range use, but rather the use of it at close to middle ranges while repositioning mid-fight, which I think can be encouraged using her mobility.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=SmokingPuffin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NkvEEE0B,comment-id=002400000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-24T07:23:04.274+0000)\n> \n> Now, if your goal is to nerf Ahri, you ought to just come out and say that.  No need to beat around the bush.  If the plan is to keep her around the same power level, this change is not healthy.\n\nThe intent here is not to nerf Ahri in a general sense, and I don't think anyone genuinely interested in a champion takes a look at them and says \"make them less powerful, doesn't matter how\", or \"let's buff this champion without discussing where they need buffs\". I don't think the mobility on Ahri's Q should be unconditional, and so if something is getting nerfed, it's her freedom of movement using that ability, which ultimately is a nerf to her mobility by itself. If there is a way to rebalance the ability so that Ahri keeps the same amount of mobility and remains healthy, then that would be fine, and if she ends up being too weak, it would help to understand what she's specifically lacking (besides free movement, which I don't think is entirely healthy). While I don't have all the statistics in hand, a cursory look at Ahri's pick and win rates says she's pretty successful, so she'd be able to take a nerf like this fairly well. She also received mana cost nerfs recently, which could easily be mitigated or reverted in case she falls too low.\n\nAgain, you are following the reasoning that Ahri *must* have unhealthily strong mobility to remain viable, and that any buff to her raw movement speed bonus would break her, neither of which I agree with.

In particular, if two mids attempt to trade skillshots and shoot at the same time, MS on hit is pretty useless for Ahri, when on cast it is very valuable.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why I think Ahri needs more restricted mobility on her Q. Unconditional mobility means Ahri can immediately (and quickly) retreat to a safe range once the throws out her Orb of Deception, making it extremely hard to hit her back or even poke her in the first place. While Ahri is meant to be evasive, she is also meant to be at her strongest when at a risky range from her enemies (which is why her Fox-Fires have a short reach and her E makes enemies walk towards her), so her evasion should come into play when she's genuinely in combat with her opponent, and not just poking them from a distance. Ahri is most interesting when she's putting herself at risk and moving around her enemies at calculatedly short distances, so I'd rather place more power there if she needs any than encourage her current max-range Q+run away poke pattern, which also carries the lowest amount of interaction with her opponent. It's this excessive safety that caused the nerfs to her mana costs in Patch 5.3:\n\n\"*It's safe to say that Ahri's return back to her kitier, mage-ier (that is a word) roots has been a success, but her new-found mobility has left her feeling a tad overbearing. For someone that skirts the edge of fights so well, Ahri wasn't taking enough risk for the reward (less dashing in, more dashing out). Forcing this fox-girl to walk the line for her guaranteed damage makes expert use of her Orb-speed and Charm, which is where we'd like to leave her feeling - skillful and satisfying to play, but vulnerable when making mistakes*\"\n\nWith that in mind, I'd rather have an Ahri with more restricted mobility but better usability to her skills, than an Ahri who can poke at very little risk, but with a greater drain on her mana.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-02-24T16:55:47.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Ideally, though, her optimal Q use shouldn't be its max-range use, but rather the use of it at close to middle ranges while repositioning mid-fight, which I think can be encouraged using her mobility.\n\nWhy is this desirable?

Max-range Q eliminates a lot of counterplay by turning a two-part nuke into a one-part ability, and reduces a lot of Ahri's gameplay as well. Firing Q from closer ranges can guarantee an initial hit, but also gives her opponent a window to dodge the true damage on return while also placing them closer to Ahri herself, and Ahri gets to do cooler things with her orb and movement when trying to move it around the battlefield, rather than just trying to catch enemies at its edge.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=SmokingPuffin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NkvEEE0B,comment-id=00240000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-24T16:55:47.806+0000)\n> \n> Good design requires clear intent, and I don't hear one from you.

If that means she gets to have more power elsewhere, that's great, but also not my primary intent. To categorize this as a desire to just buff or nerf Ahri in general is both overly simplistic and misleading for the core argument.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=SmokingPuffin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NkvEEE0B,comment-id=00240000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-24T16:55:47.806+0000)\n> \n> I don't understand your question.

By that rationale, you could shift all of a champion's damage onto a single ability, and they would somehow have no issues. What matters more than just a champion's power budget (which is also an estimate and not an exact measure) is a champion's health. There are definitely a lot of things on Ahri that could be buffed without breaking her (her mana management, for example), but I feel that she might not even need a buff with the change I'm suggesting. If she would, however, i.e. if she became unviable, despite there being a lot of healthy levers on her to pull it would be worth finding out which one would need to be adjusted specifically.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=SmokingPuffin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NkvEEE0B,comment-id=00240000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-24T16:55:47.806+0000)\n> \n> I am arguing neither of those things.

Ahri is a mage-assassin: by design, she wants to get closer to her opponent in order to kill them, and her W, E and ultimate all cater to that. She does have good poke, and that's fine, but she's meant to be at her strongest when at risky ranges from her target (i.e. Fox-Fire distance). Even her Q, her pokiest ability, is most interesting when used from up close. I'm not saying she has to lose her poke, especially since poke is core to a lot of healthy assassins' playstyles, but I do think she should be encouraged to make riskier plays with her Q, and not just try to land it from the farthest distance possible.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=SmokingPuffin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NkvEEE0B,comment-id=00240000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-24T16:55:47.806+0000)\n> \n> Ahri is not Vayne, and does not have the tools to stay close to the enemy for long.

I would rather she had riskier power with lesser mana costs, than safer power with greater mana costs. Again, buffs and nerfs don't just get dished out at random just because a champion needs to be more or less powerful overall, they're done with a very specific intention in mind.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-02-24T22:26:56.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The topic here is balancing, not design, and even if it were design my intent here remains clear: I want Ahri's basic ability movement to be conditional upon enemy interaction. \n\nYou are proposing mechanical changes and worrying about champion health.
