Then they suck at Vlad. A Vladimir should never need a gank, and a jungler should only gank a Vlad lane if flash is burned or the enemy is pushing to the tower. \n\nIf you're talking about the enemies, then believe me, their contribution can sometimes be deadly. \n\nWith Spellvamp runes and Hextech, a Vlad can rock 18% spellvamp at level 6 easily. With his multi-targeted Es and ult, plus his pool nullifying damage for a small bit, sometimes a jungler gank that would have been successful gets turned into a double kill for me because the low-health/half-health laner just had to \"help\". The number of times I escape with 50-100 HP thanks to the health the enemy gave me alone is outrageous.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathToEcchi","date":"2016-01-17T02:19:21.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being a multirole player, I hate when jg mains say 'i can't gank that champ' or 'we won't get a kill anyways'.

There's so many times I see a jg complaining about some lane feeding when they've never even tried to countergank the hard camp that's happening.\n\nHere's the thing. If the Vlad is any good, you won't push him out of lane. He'll just retreat back to his tower, then wait the minion wave and W cooldown and gain back most of his health. Worst case scenario you'll have wasted time just to burn a teleport and all you managed was making him come back stronger. \n\nThere are some times where ganking a lane plainly isn't worth it, and if Vlad is winning the lane (like, one-two kills/levels ahead and he already went base) then it is much more effective to try to snowball other lanes to try to get that midgame power that Vlad doesn't have and tell your laner to play passive and just take it like a good bitch. That, or coordinate with your midlaner and get a 3 man gank, and hope no one dies to take him down. Â´\n\nNote: this only applies if Vlad is ahead. If he's even or behind, camp that motherfucker and feed off him as hard as you can.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Alleo","date":"2016-01-18T14:23:58.570+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was playing top once and I pinged and asked repeatedly for help and my jungler straight up said in chat \"sorry bro, top lane is an island\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2016-01-16T11:43:28.353+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"well better dont pick soraka vanye into thresh lucian if you want a gank","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2016-01-16T11:47:28.472+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"The last time my jg ganked my lane was 6 games ago, if you can call walking up after we're dead a gank.
