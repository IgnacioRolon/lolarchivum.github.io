If suddenly Riot guts these champs ({{champion:45}} , {{champion:38}} says hi) I would probably be extremely pissed and never buy skins again. Yasuo is probably safe because I started playing him after he got gutted but Hecarim is FoTM atm so that means nerf time. \n\nI wasted my refunds early on in my account because while I was researching a champion to main I found an outdated guides to champions that listed their skills before they were nerfed or changed majorly. I insta bought Yasuo and Lucian and Kassadin with RP and was confused as to why  Lucian wasn't removing slows when I dashed, or why yasuo didn't get 4 stacks of his dash and why he didn't generate extra flow with windwall, everyone just seemed so much weaker than the guide made them seem. I later found out that he had been nerfed repeatedly since that guide was written. Same thing with Yasuo nerfed ridiculously since release but I kept him because he was lots of fun. We all know what happened to Kassadin...\nAlso I bought Poppy skins as she was the first champ I decided to main, but when I found out she was going to be reworked I decided to drop her and refund the skins.\n\nComing from dota I wasn't used to champions being nerfed so drastically in such a short time frame. Some of my favourite Heroes in dota have remained essentially unchanged in their playstyle for years with only minor tweaks to their numbers/stats.

Not saying this is a better, just that it resulted in me burning through my refunds as I learned the hard way that I need to make sure before I buy any champion In League:\n\n1) I make sure the guide is for the current season and preferably the current patch.\n2) Read the change log  for the champion to make sure they haven't been nerfed recently\n3) Make sure they aren't currently Flavour of the Month which means they are about to be immediately nerfed (unless ofc they are a part of a special group  {{champion:7}} {{champion:92}}  {{champion:238}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}}  {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}}  {{champion:64}} that have Immunity to Riot Gutting) \n4) Make sure they are not about to be reworked (Started maining Poppy only to find out she was about to be completely changed)\n\nSure I know all of this now, but by that time I've already blown my 3 refunds :(","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GuiltyGecko","date":"2015-04-14T16:43:14.874+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"3 is way too much.
