Their was at least 2 iterations of Magma chamber, neither of which got made. I recal the latter one was scraped because their was not much support from the 1v1 and 2v2 standoffs in snowdown showdown. (which the map would have basically replicated) But looking at the maps we already have, Riot really needs to better promote these maps. If TT had a YoloQ and not just Team 3v3s, or if Dominion had Any ranked Q at all, it would greatly increase interest in those modes. \n\nThe abyss is getting attention though. Bunch of items are being made available, new texture updates (check PBE) to make it more inline with the new SR. And Even a new summoner spell, based on the Legend of King Poro. So The game modes do reflect game choices. \n\nThe thing I liked about Accession is that it's 100% a different game, in the sense that your goal isn't to destroy the enemy nexus. But to basically fight each other in a death match while collecting relics and power ups.","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-04-26T10:33:39.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last time Abyss god any of Riots attention was when they wanted to sell winter skins.\n\nAlso by telling about HotS i meant Riot could create 5v5 maps with just different lanes etc. So we'd still play 5v5 yet tad different.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JunkÎ¿","date":"2015-04-25T08:41:29.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They scrapped Magma Chamber because they compared the playtime of One for All (30-40 min game) to Snowdown Showdown (1v1,2v2 about 5 min games) and declared that people aren't interested in it enough.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Bard Dog","date":"2015-04-25T14:23:36.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"heroes is good, but there's some stuff in it that's gamebreaking. namely the shared experience. \nif a team gets 2 levels ahead, theres a very strong chance they're going to dominate the rest of the game with no risk of losing barring afks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Occams Raiser","date":"2015-04-25T03:38:07.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I heard no one liked it.
