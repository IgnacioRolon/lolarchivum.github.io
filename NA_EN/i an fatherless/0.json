So, as you can guess, I'm 10/10 frustrated with trying to play. Then, I get an out of range and can't get back into the game when i restart my PC because I'm a leaver since it's my fault the game is ridden with bugs. Now, the leaver buster timer for 5 minutes just keeps restarting. When it finishes, and I try to play, it starts at 5 fresh minutes. I reinstalled a whole new OS and the game and I still have a new 5 minute ban?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-17T02:28:55.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your *low-priority queue* is restarting because your connection to the game platform is *poor or unstable*.
