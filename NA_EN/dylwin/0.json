Since I downloaded league, when I play with friends the queue pops for them but it doesn't for me, it just says reconnecting. I don't have problems for any other games. When solo queueing my time goes to around 6 minutes then just stops searching. Sometimes I can accept the queues, but most times I can't. Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-18T04:45:16.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really sounds like your network is having some weird problems with our matchmaking servers, or possibly that your client isn't showing the queue pop from some kind of display hardware/software issue. \n\nFirst up, I'd like to have you try adjusting your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure you're getting a solid connection with *our* servers. Just because other games or websites load just fine doesn't mean you're getting a good signal to us. \n\nNext, make sure your drivers are updated and try turning on low-spec mode in the client options. That will disable some of the animations on the client and should make it easier to navigate.\n\nEDIT: It'd also be worth the time to try disabling your firewalls/antivirus when queueing. Sometimes certain things like that can block League's access to our servers from not having the right exceptions set up.","replies":[{"poster":"Dylwin","date":"2018-01-04T01:24:49.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still having the issue.

It seems like I get to accept matches more often when I stay in the client during the timer rather than tabbing out to do other things while waiting. It wasn't a complete fix, but it does let me join more games. I'll give your suggestions a test as well, thank you!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dylwin","date":"2017-12-18T03:59:32.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can message people at all times, I can do everything on the client, but my queues almost never pop.
