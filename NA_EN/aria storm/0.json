When I saw the new skin set... i just had to make my own team. :)\r\n\r\n{{champion:497}} and {{champion:498}} : I would like them to share skin sets, I got the idea for Rakan so Xayah had to follow. Yes, they are newer champions, but this is for the next set of SG skins, which may been 1+ year depending on how well this new set sells. If they haven&#039;t received a skin by then, then they are due. \r\n\r\n{{champion:163}} : I&#039;ve seen this suggested here and there and I thought it would be adorable. She only has her launch skin.\r\n\r\n{{champion:44}} : He doesn&#039;t have that many skins, only one since his rework, three otherwise. He has to have one, he is perfect for it.\r\n\r\n{{champion:76}} : Before you chew me out on her having a lot of skins; hear me out. She is the only champion that fits the theme of being able to transform into her familiar. She is an older champion. Half of her skins are recolours, and only two are 975 +, and half her skins are legacy or seasonal and not readily available. She also hasn&#039;t received a new skin in two years. She is one of leagues oldest champions and is due for a legendary.","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2017-08-13T19:26:01.842+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like that Taliyah's familiar is a reindeer, like the recall and splash of her Freljord skin. \n\nI think Riot has even said the plan was to always have Xayah and Rakan receive skins as a set.

Also her dress might be more leaning towards Nida if it had less plumes (I don't know if I used the right word) and follow more the figure of the character without the skirt being so buffed and maybe have a bare shoulder.\n\nThat's just my personal view, I'm in no way an art critic. xD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Almighty","date":"2017-08-14T00:32:40.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"_:Throws money at the screen:_\n\nRiot, this Taric skin NEEDS to happen!\nIt can cost 100 Gems for all i care.\nIt needs to be made!\n\nOh, and hire Karui Yoru as a lead concept designer while you're at it.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \n\n_**Almighty.**_","replies":[{"poster":"Aria Storm","date":"2017-08-14T02:34:40.892+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gems are _outrageous_\n\nThank you, glad you like them!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Neamean","date":"2017-08-14T00:31:32.261+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I think a yellow one would be better for Taliyah.","replies":[{"poster":"Aria Storm","date":"2017-08-14T02:30:43.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought about Yellow, but in both sets of star guardians, there is no yellow one, I wanted to keep up the colour palette.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2017-08-13T20:32:26.840+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like Taliyah's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PeachyBubbleStar","date":"2017-08-15T08:52:04.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i really love this, and i especially love Taliyah's design and LOVE the addition of the pet being a deer familiar since it matches her story and stuff ;A; <3 the only thing is, i think she's need a different hairstyle, perhaps something like upward thick buns/pigtails? twin braids? bangs? idk i love new hairstyles on skins tho xD overall these are really nice ;A; and Taliyah needs a new skin considering she only has her release one... she's also 16 and a good personality to be a star guardian, she should be the next Legendary skin star guardian tbh","replies":[{"poster":"Aria Storm","date":"2017-08-15T20:29:33.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did think about a new hairstyle, but wasn't able to think of one.

Coupled with her being blue, I think it's too similar to her existing skin. I mean, I love deer (stags in particular) - but I don't think it's... appropriate? \n\nI'm also slightly disappointed that Xayah and Rakan's familiars don't have a shared appearance or theme, in the sense of being kindred like their guardian. During Xayah and Rakan's shared dance, I want their familiars to also dance and it look appropriately yin and yang.\n\nBut, all-in-all, pretty awesome choices. I'm also particularly fond of the fact you included two males, especially non-twink males, as well as the fact you added a second tank.

I do agree there needs to be more tanks, I wanted to do a jungler but the only ones that really seemed to fit was Vi?","replies":[{"poster":"Eeyore","date":"2017-08-14T13:48:22.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are there any mythological creatures known for their ability to construct? Or, any mythological creatures that are believed to cause avalanches? Khepri came to mind for the fact he pushes the sun across the sky, but I'm not sure how you could make a giant beetle look cute and familiar-y. I'm just imagining having her familiar being the one that weaves her ultimate. Similar to that scene in Fellowship of the Ring with the horses-in-the-waves, her ultimate could be her familiar stampeding forward with waves of cosmic energy training behind it. A stag almost makes sense given its horns. You could also do a jackalope, although since they are already present on Summoner's Rift, it might be a bit weird to see a star guardian version. \n\nThere's the fan champion, DhaMa, who is two creatures that together resemble yin and yang. I don't think it specifically has to be about colour, but also their body shape. I would hope for them to look like they complete each other. Alternatively, they could look completely different, but their bodies should easily lend themselves to intimate animations - like the two of them curling up together for a hug. One of them having wings will almost certainly make any play animations between their two familiars really awkwards, since wings aren't particularly flexible. I love your ferret like design on Xayah's, perhaps Rakan's familiar could have an identical body but with mohawk feathers most of the way down its back, instead of a pair of wings, and maybe no tail feathers?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Rq2opzn.jpg http://i.imgur.com/36vwNBj.jpg\n\nI was looking at the list of champions and picking a jungler is actually pretty hard. I'm not sure Vi would suit it. Maybe Diana or Evelynn? Ahri even has a taunt for Evelynn referring to her as the girl under the bleaches. As a Brit I would interpret that as a slut due to similarities to an English idiom (a slur I would find appropriate for the queen bitch in a line of schoolgirl skins to call Evelynn, as well as the fact Ahri of all people is saying it makes it ironically funny), but Google leads me to believe it may also refer to someone who's invisible/low on the social hierarchy, akin to saying \"the place the goth kids hang out\" (and since she's the stealth champion, that interpretation also makes sense). Your server says \"NA\", so maybe you understand what Riot intends it to mean. If it's referring to her as a goth/wallflower, than it could be an opportunity for a more gothic Star Guardian - the edgey kid who got star powers, and finds the whole situation totally lame and boring. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GoRh6gu.jpg http://i.imgur.com/2J4wZed.jpg http://i.imgur.com/8IjsIlz.jpg\n\nHeck, throw Diana and Vi into the mix and maybe recolour Xayah, and you've got a troupe of gothic Star Guardians. Although this might be too much of a good thing. Maybe stick to just Evelynn. (The first image I shared above would totally suit her hair.)","replies":[{"poster":"Aria Storm","date":"2017-08-14T19:45:56.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure there are a lot of mythological creatures that create things, it's a question of researching it. I'll see about that once I find more time to make adjustments. :)\n\nFor xayah... maybe a gryphon, winged unicorn, or a hippogriff? I could borrow more from rakan, maybe. \n\nIt is an interesting idea, but I just don't see a star guardian Evelyn unless her upcoming VGU changes her significantly. Diana could fit. I'm a little annoyed because before the jungle changes, any champion could jungle and be \"viable\" but now the pool is a lot more limited. Nidalee isn't even in any position right now because of the changes and she lost her pounce resets. \n\nI've seen kindred suggested here and there and it's interesting but I'm not sure if it fits. I don't think Elise works. Are there other humanoid junglers that could work? Lee and hi don't,  Ekko is off meta but viable and could work. Kayn doesn't fit, aside poppy the only yore that can kinda jungle is kled.  I think im the only one that takes Talon jungle Sometimes.  Talon is more Gothic like Syndra but could work, at least if he gets the legendary. \n\nI think Vi I think can fit,  though, she would be the more scrapper one, kinda like sailor Jupiter.  \n\nAs for that taunt with Evelyn.
