He&#039;ll start the animation but it&#039;ll cancel halfway through and he&#039;ll start to walk until he&#039;s at the 12:00 (directly behind) of whatever he&#039;s attacking, then continue to attack. This happens against minions (which makes it impossible to cs in lane), champions, monsters, and turrets alike. Not sure if this is the bug that is being looked at, but since he&#039;s down at the moment, I thought I&#039;d just leave this here","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-29T16:39:31.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Draconist,\n\nThanks for the report!

What's going on Rito?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blakstone","date":"2015-06-30T02:07:45.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed that too.
