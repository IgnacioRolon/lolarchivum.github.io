I have spent money and time on this account and would like proof because I do not see how I could get banned while not even in America or having access to internet for that matter. At your request I am able to provide my deployment orders as proof I was indeed gone and my xfinity bill with mac address with proof that I didn&#039;t even have internet service for months please respond it would be greatly appreciated. As far as im concerned either my account was hacked or I got flagged because I dual boot kali linux on this desktop also and have pin testing software as that is my job if that is the case, could there be some directory or link explaining what programs and actions may get people flagged although I figured they are two different OS systems and should not correlate directly.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2017-05-23T11:29:04.794+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You need to contact Support as they are the only ones who can actually help you.

Even if riot was interested if people run Kali on their machines (which they are not), the game client would be completely unable to discern if they do, because Kali, like most Debian derived Distros these days, runs ext4, which the Windows virtual FS cannot even read...\n\nProof: My work colleague runs Kali on his home computer...and he plays League from a VM out of his Linux Distro.\n\nAlso, its pEn-testing, not \"pin testing\"...\"pen\" stands for \"penetration\", a \"pin\" is what you connect on an old IDE drive to decide wheter it runs S or M configuration.","replies":[{"poster":"OutOfYourLeaugeK","date":"2017-05-23T06:48:41.376+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know it shouldn't flag the account was just a thought since I wasnt home anyways and live in the barracks and roommate also deployed","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-05-23T21:10:04.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your service. \n\nOn to the matter though. What exactly does it say when you try to log in? Does it say permanently banned or does it say suspended? They may think that your account has been compromised and locked it to secure it.
