Before {{champion:79}}'s rework in Season 3 (I think), his E only inflicted an AoE slow not an AoE knockup/displacement, which was a LOT more tolerable. I think it should be changed back to an AoE slow because nothing is more frustrating than getting stunned out of nowhere and accepting your death because of his absurd {{summoner:4}} combo. At least you can react to him if it were a slow.","replies":[{"poster":"Wet Dryman","date":"2017-08-21T17:22:20.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Not sure why Riot decided to rework his E into an AoE E with buttloads of more functionality.\n\n\nTheir design policy of that time, they gave him any means to make him go in melee instead of playing from range and be a Jungler/Top champion. It is kept now because their new design policy for Tanks is just \"have shit tones of CC\". \n\nHaving slow on E is great change because it solves most of his problems for example:\n- making interacting with him impossible because his displacement negates dashes or your attempts of punishing him (he will just walk away while you're removed from game for 1.5 second without much effort involved)\n- disrupting half or entire team every 5 minutes with flash without counterplay better than Malphite's R while also being able to displace them with R\n\nAnd apart of solving problems it adds to interactivity because if he wants to have easy time landing R properly he needs to apply slow from E and slowed champion didn't lost already as he can slightly reposition himself to be displaced in better for him position or just blink/dash out of it. And Gragas himself can still predict where that person will move and aim his ult accordingly. It's win-win situation.\nMy only concern is that it will feel samey with his Q and will make him a slow abundant champion. That's why imo his Q should apply different form of utility (and it doesn't have to be CC).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DaNinad","date":"2017-08-20T14:37:13.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"When a 50% win rate champion needs to be nerfed lol","replies":[{"poster":"Wet Dryman","date":"2017-08-20T14:57:12.959+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look at his pick rate.
