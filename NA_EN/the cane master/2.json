In my honest opinion, the same would happen with Solo Queue if it never existed. Nevertheless, players then use Dynamic Queue as an excuse for the lack of skill that they are unable to admit or even spot if they wanted to evaluate themselves. What really happened was people stop arguing for roles, toxicity in champion selection is gone, players are finally able to enjoy climbing both solo and with as many teammates as they&#039;d like, advanced strategies and comps that are only possible with intense communication and team practice finally see the light of the day. Everything goes well, even number of people playing ranked never decreased one bit, it even increased.\r\n\r\nSeason7: Riot decides to reverse all this.\r\n\r\nYou ask yourself why would Riot do this, and even why am right, and why is the title a doomsayer? Because what will happen will look this: The Flex Queue (Dynamic Queue replacement) will get a significant drop in number of players. As solo players make the most of LoL player base, the number of people needed to queue up with the similar MMR and at the same time to get matchmade is really high, thus auto-fill turns on. This fucks up the 3&#039;s and 4&#039;s premades, playing off roles, and losing on everything they wanted to showcase. The arguing for roles starts again, toxicity rises, solo players (that are mostly lonely, pathetic and egoistic people) are happy. Premades stop playing Flex Queue, maybe even quit LoL, and why? Because people aren&#039;t able to play a team game with already known teammates (even real life friends)?\r\n\r\nRiot please make some sense here. LoL is supposed to be a team game, not a single player game where you work with other single player gamers towards a goal that you all have a different strategy in mind on how to achieve. And even if you&#039;d somehow like share your strategy, you don&#039;t have the voice communication tool in game. And even if you had it, 2 minutes of champion selection chat/talk with strangers cannot replace the endless hours of friendship and practice with premades.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-10-13T17:56:40.170+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Riot please make some sense here. LoL is supposed to be a team game, **not a single player game where you work with other single player gamers towards a goal** that you all have a different strategy in mind on how to achieve.

And even if you had it, 2 minutes of champion selection chat/talk with strangers cannot replace the endless hours of friendship and practice with premades.\n\nActually, that's exactly what ranked was/is about. Your ability to win and win consistently, regardless of the circumstances presented you (barring extreme ones like feeding and afks). Team rank was about your ability to communicate and use your team synergy to win against other teams. \n\nWhen you start to mix the two, there becomes an inherent advantage due to team having higher levels of coordination and synergy. I know this from personal experience in this game as a solo player and also from other games like Call of Duty and Overwatch where I play exclusively in pre mades (hence if you were to look at my W/L ratio in those games, it's through the roof. OW was around 76% and COD was even higher at 93% in TDM).\n\nCompetitive is suppose to be about pitting players on equal playing field. You yourself said in that same paragraph I quoted that pre mades can have hours of practice together to get better. Explain to me how this would equate to a level playing field when you go up against solo players who have never met each other until that very moment?\n\nYou're right about one thing though, people hate change and are resistant to anything that poses as a drastic departure from standard. While this was a change of a high scale, it brought about several fundamental problems with it which is what people disliked: you simply can not mix pre mades with solo in a competitive environment. Even if it only happens once out of every 10 matches, it's still not acceptable. \n\nVoice communication, while is nice especially in pre-mades, isn't particularly necessary, pings work well provided people aren't abusing it or using it to troll. If I'm playing as Nautilius and ping target on their ADC followed by ulting, it's not rocket science to figure out what's going on. Some of the most elite teams/premades are currently at worlds despite language gap being an issue. Being a C9 fan boy, I know that Impact when he first joined, knew very little English, thus pings were often the go to for communications. \n\nDQ (The merge of pre mades with solos) had a fundamental problem right from the very beginning of its implementation. Despite having an entire season to try and fix this, they weren't able to get to a point where it worked well hence reverting and getting rid of it. \n\nRiot very rarely ever goes back on a decision, especially one of this magnitude. The fact they decided to revert DQ in of itself should be enough proof there was a problem with it.

SoloQ was boring and difficult for friends to play together, especially if you had 3-4 people who wanted to play ranked with you. DynamicQ is a nightmare for Solo players since you have a harder time communicating efficiently with the premades in your group who are more than likely using coms (though not a guaranteed). \n\nThey both had pros and cons, but neither is better than the other. \n\nNow, will Flex/Solo for Season 7 kill the game? No, not really. But it might just cause wait time issues and perhaps more need for Auto-fill since the queues will be split into two groups. \n\nWho knows though. \n\nI personally enjoyed Dynamic Q just because I play with a lot of friends and family, but sometimes never had enough for 5s nor could we all schedule to be on: but I still understand the appeal of SoloQ since not everyone plays with other people.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-10-13T18:59:29.085+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, there is a fundamental flaw with the solo queue/team queue in that you couldn't play as 3-4 group. I also agree that DQ also had a flaw in that solo players have a harder time communicating efficiently then those in premades.\n\nI do disagree that neither is better than the other. \n\nThe team/solo as it stands is a better system. Competitive is about even playing fields for both sides. By introducing premades v.s. solo, you're tilting the playing field in one team's favor. Team/solo restriction, while not perfect, almost always guaranteed a level playing field. Even in the event of duos in the solo ladder, it was still realistically possible to beat duos.","replies":[{"poster":"Desolas Arterius","date":"2016-10-13T20:57:07.266+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I disagree unfortunately. The playing field in rank is never going to be even, regardless if we're in SoloQ or DQ. \n\nIt's not because of coms or premades though, it's because of smurfs. Smurfs are the reason competitive is muddy. A Diamond+ smurf could easily carry games regardless if they're in SoloQ or DQ. That isn't fair to lower elo players regardless of the queue since they'll never know where they truly place due to the smurfs single-handily winning games or purposefully losing games to place lower.\n\nI will admit however, being in a premade has its perks compared to being solo, but a premade of 5 very rarely goes against a full team of Solos. Premades are usually pit against other premades, so there is some type of leverage to making the playing fields fair. \nBut again, the existence of a premade isn't what causes the unfair advantage; it's who is in the premade that does. Which sometimes is a smurf of higher elo playing with their lower elo friends. \n\nThat was just as common in SoloQ as it was in DQ. So to me, neither system was inherently better since both had their major flaws. \n\nI'm not bashing SQ, I think it was good for what it did, but I can't agree it is a better system. It was still flawed just as much as DQ was. \n\nIn my opinion, if we fixed the issue with smurfs and made ranking based on your individual performance (meaning if you average point/skill wise at Bronze level, then you'll more than likely be placed in Bronze even if you win 8/10 games). The placement system is honestly in need of a rework because basing your elo on your overall wins/losses doesn't seem to be effective when it comes to identifying a player's immediate skill level. Yeah, the system will eventually work itself out, but that's only over time if the player keeps playing ranked. The placement game system is pretty outdated and probably should be looked into come the LCU, or even during S7 ranked season. \n\nEither way, I don't think being on coms or being in a premade is that much of an issue in DQ, since premades majority of the time go against similar built premades. I just think it's the smurfs that are really causing the issues. Not saying having a smurf is bad, but it's definitely not helping the Ranked integrity, that's for sure. \n\nJust my opinion though. I do appreciate you willing to talk about this professionally :) It's quite refreshing to have an actual debate instead of being hit with Ad hominems haha.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-10-14T14:28:28.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG YOU'RE SO WRONG FACK YOU! (ad hominems ad hominems) /*sarcasm*\n\nIn all seriousness though, to each his own, its really a matter of opinion at this point.\n\nI think you are right that the problem of smurfs does create an issue of level playing field, but to me that's an issue that is prevalent in both of the two forms of rank play, so to me, it seems to be a problem that is entirely separate from the discussion of mixing premades with solos. Smurfing is not really contingent on the premades/solos. \n\nIt's a variable that Riot has deemed out of their control unfortunately. However the ability to control whether people can play with each other in premades is something they do have control over. Would be nice to tackle the smurf issue, but I honestly don't know how they would do so in a healthy manner.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2016-10-13T20:54:07.032+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually I believe Ranked was originally basically Dynamic Queue but was changed early on. It became Solo, but it was meant to be Team which is why Dynamic Queue was implemented, they wanted it to go back to that.  \n\nMixing the two is not ideal but it is necessary as both would suffer if they were split.  \n\nThe issue with DQ was more community backlash rather than actual flaws with the system. The flaws it did have were more apparent at higher elo's (such as Diamond and above) anyways, and most of the flaws at all elo's were being fixed towards the end. The community went into DQ with the opinion it was bad before they even tried it, they refused to change their opinions and instead of trying to work with Riot they stuck to the demand it should be removed. It was not a perfect system at all, but I believe if we had, as a community, gone into this with a more positive outlook we would have been able to make DQ work for everyone.  \n\nThey are not reverting DQ they are turning it into Flex Ranked and creating Solo/Duo again.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-10-14T14:45:24.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Neither system is ideal, I think everyone can agree on that. They both have pros and cons. \n\nI think the big reason for the backlash was in part an overreaction. But there was definitely some merit: playing against premades as a solo player is just flat out not fun. Period. Especially when you're locked into that game for the bare minimum of 20 minutes. No serious solo players want to deal with it, no serious solo player wants to even run the risk of it happening. Period.\n\nNo matter how much Riot was going to work towards addressing the problem, just the possibility of knowing that there is a chance you can get matched against one tends to leave a sour taste in people's mouth. \n\nDQ if you asked me, and I mean this as respectively as possible, was doomed to fail from the start. People are pessimistic by nature and resistant to change as you pointed out. So if you make a change which is going to have a clear negative impact on a large portion of the playerbase, its not rocket science to figure out how they're going to react to it. \n\nSo when all this couple with the fact it took nearly entire season to try and provide solutions to the problem, its going to create a huge shit storm, especially when the solutions appear to be in near direct opposition to what DQ was trying to do (Limiting high rank to solo/duo, wut?). When you start to address problems by making exceptions to the system, its going to start raising questions about the faith in said system. \n\nAs a solo player, I and many many others gained nothing from this DQ update and we took a hit. And for what? For a very very minor portion of the community. \n\nYou could argue that because its for such a minor group of people, it shouldn't be a big deal, which is fair. But its still makes solo players salty that our gameplay is being compromised for such a small group of players. \n\nThe premises of mixing premades with solos in a competitive environment was never going to work, even if they minimized the matchmaking chances to less than 5%, people would still abhor it and prefer the older system. It only takes one game out of 20 to leave a negative taste in people's mouth about the experience. \n\nWhen you throw in the issue of people following their favorite streamer and they experience problems with the new system as well, but on a much higher scale, that's only going to exacerbate the issue even greater (yay herd mentality!). Especially considering some of the \"solutions\" Riot decided upon to fix for higher rank players just made zero sense and screamed we have no idea what the heck we are doing.

This is fine, but instead of saying \"Omg premades, this system is garbage, remove it rito\", try and think how to solve this issue or alleviate some of the hardships. We may have been able to figure out a better system, there are millions of us and if we all put our minds to it i am sure someone could come up with a good idea.  \n\nI understand the Solo vs Premade communities and how DQ clearly favored one over the other, but there is something that is misunderstood here. Ranked was originally DQ but was changed to Solo/Duo, so Riot clearly intended for it to be DQ. Is it so wrong they wanted to focus the game back towards that? I don't think so, i think they didn't like how Ranked necessarily played out and wanted to try and something to change it.  \n\nThe only issues I have with DQ is how it screwed up the entire ranked ladder as far as skill goes. This is why I don't care that it is being split, to me Solo and Premades were never an issue, but this boosting and people getting to undeserved ranks is the biggest flaw. That is not even DQ's fault to be honest, you are intended to get further by playing with your friends, but to a degree... A Bronze V player shouldn't suddenly be high gold or even Silver. Then there are extreme cases of boosting where you have Bronze/Silvers in Plat and Plats in high Diamond.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2016-10-13T18:50:03.647+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"> What really happened was people stop arguing for roles, toxicity in champion selection is gone\n\nthat was the new champ select, not DQ.

At it's very nature, you are being ranked with a *group*, so why on earth does everyone in the group get an *individual* ranking when they obviously didn't earn it by themselves? It's no secret that DQ messed with matchmaking (Riot themselves even admitted it). It's also no secret that groups have an obviously better communication advantage than others...it's an incredibly innacurate system that I have trouble justifying for anything, especially for the \"but I want to play with friends\" excuse\n\n>  players are finally able to enjoy climbing both solo and with as many teammates as they'd like\n\nonce again, the entire integrity of ranked as well as the balance of power for actual solo/duo players were sacrificed...so that friends could play together?

They don't actually want to grind or put dedication, they saw that they could bring their norms mentality to ranked and so they did\n***\nI'm getting tired of quoting you so I'll just say this about your 2nd part:\n\n- Having 2 queues is obviously bad because it splits the community. Nobody wanted that until they realized that it was either all DQ or 2 queues...I guess we got the best of the two bad choices we got. \n\n- If solo players make the most of the community (which they do), solo queuers should've never been massively attacked by DQ. They lost so much influence in the game it was almost a joke that 4-mans were considered more healthy to ranked than solo queue players\n\n- 3/4man premades have no place in ranked. It screws with matchmaking, creates unfair communication advantages, undercuts the influence of solo players, screws with the integrity of ranked (once again, how can anyone justify giving an *individual* of a group the Diamond 5 ranked when it was really the entire group of 3-4 mans doing the work...that literally makes absolutely no sense in a ranked system that focuses on individual skill...) #/4 man premades are less important than 1/2/5 man players and you can't have both\n\n- Once again, the \"arguing over roles\" and \"champ select toxicity\" where solved by the *champ select changes*, **not** *dynamic queue*\n\n> solo players (that are mostly lonely, pathetic and egoistic people) are happy\n\nOH BUDDY THIS ONE I'LL QUOTE FOR YA!\n\nyou...holy crap dude, what the actual fuck. What on earth goes up there in your mind where you think that solo queuers, the very *foundation* of league since beta, the sub-part of the league community that is essential for every match ever, the sub-community that ranked is *meant* for, seeing how it gives out *individual* rankings (aka, SINGLE rankings for SINGLE players) are less important than you and your buds that want to screw up the system just so you have a mode to play together in outside of...oh wait...*ranked was the only mode you couldn't play together in*. Jeesus christ dude, how selfish can you get xD\n\nsurely as a \n>psychologist\n\nyou know that insulting your intended audience loses respect and makes your points pretty much useless (although all your arguments were shitty anyways) so why on earth would you insult the largest and most fundamental playerbase of league when you're trying reason with them. Holy hell dude, that was just stupid af\n\nnot to mention how hypocritical that was! you have no foundation or reasonable argument to prove that solo players are lonely, pathetic, or egotistical. What a fundamentally stupid cheap shot that only highlights your toxicness where you take a shot at players without any knowledge of them. What a classic case of a superiority complex. \n\n***moving on***\n\n- who tf cares if 3-4mans stop playing ranked? They are a tiny percentage of the league community and they lasted years without ranked (and for good reasons that players have pointed out earlier). If they have become so dependent on ranked, literally the only gamemode they can't play with their friends on, that's some serious problems with the players right there, not the system.\n\n- as for the \"ranked was meant for teams, not individual players\" well you are just blatantly wrong. Solo queue, as stated in the very name itself, was designed to determine a *solo player's* skill. You were rated on how well you could work with teammates and how reliable you as an independent variable. If you wanted to focus on *team* play (note* a *full* team just like any other game) you could play norms or the very handy and blatantly obvious mode for teams: 5-man ranked\n\n#**_fin_**","replies":[{"poster":"The Cane Master","date":"2016-10-13T20:05:37.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"Except League of Legends is **TEAM GAME**. 5v5, not 1v1, meaning that it wasn't ever supposed to be played by solo players.

If you wanted a *team* score, you formed a 5-man *team*. \n\nHow does giving individual scores among a group make any sense at all? The game rewards you/gives your rank based purely on wins and losses which comes from an *individual* player being able to adapt to his teammates while remaining a reliable variable in games. It's still a team game obviously, or one of the components in determining your ranked wouldn't be about how well you can work with teammates. Unfortunately, when you have one team that is guaranteed to have 5 reliable teammates that work well together (premades)  and get a free pass by this aspect of ranked, it creates an unfair environment. There is literally no way to incorporate 4-man premades into ranked without screwing over solo players.\n\nSo once again, of course it is a *team* game because one of the variables that determines an *individual's* rank is about how well he/she can work with their teammates.

Clearly neither of us could do a simple google search for \"league legends boosting\" and not only get results but ADS right at the top for services.  No.  Clearly your anecdotal experience is proof positive that boosting is non-existent in League of Legends.  Why even lean on your rank, your Psychologist experience alone gives you enough insight into the human mind to prove that not only would no one ever risk penalty to a secondary account from Riot for boosting, but also I'm sure no one would EVER pay for such a service because all we want is to play with friends at our accurate rank.\n\nI am sorry for speaking out of turn to my betters.

Dynamic Queue did not reduce fighting over roles and champions nor did it reduce Toxicity in any way. If anything it created more Toxicity between Solo players and Premades, the Premades blamed the Solo Player and the Solo players blamed the Premade. What you are referring to is the new Champion Select, this is completely different than Dynamic Queue, this would have been implemented **regardless** of whether Dynamic Queue was or not.  \n  \nNow on to DQ.  \n\nI am all for Dynamic Queue and I am a firm believer that the a lot of the bigger issues with Dynamic Queue were the communities fault. However there are huge issues with DQ that could not be solved by simply changing a few things here or there. One of the biggest issues being the ability for 4 Diamond Smurfs to play with a Bronze player and carry them to whatever rank they wanted. This created a vast gap in skill between players in all elos which created a very negative and chaotic experience for those not abusing the system to boost themselves or others.  \n\nBasically the entire ranked ladder became the Silver tier, where new players, those boosted from Bronze by happenstance, those who fell from Gold, those who were genuinely climbing, and the average player who belonged in Silver were all trapped facing each other. Often those who deserved to climb would be stuck because it was basically a 1v9, those who deserved to fall were not falling because there was that one person capable of carrying them just enough to keep them where they were, and there were those who couldn't do either on their own.  \n\nDynamic Queue allowed this chaos to spread to the entire ladder due to how it was used by the community. This is an issue, while not necessarily DQ's fault, it is a large flaw in how the system works. One that is being fixed with the introduction of both Flex Ranked and Solo/Duo Queue, that way those who get carried to a certain Rank will not be able to do so in both queues and it will be apparent.  It will however create another big issue (again with the Community being the main cause) and that is discrimination between Flex Rank players and Solo Players.  \n\nObviously Solo Players will act like their rank is better than Flex Players, this is just how this community is. If you can't reach the same rank (or equivalent rank) in Solo as you did in Flex, you will be called boosted and your Solo rank will be used to judge you while completely ignoring your Flex rank. This is going to be a huge issue, one that doesn't even need to occur. There is nothing wrong with being a higher rank in Flex, you could have so much more synergy playing with friends that you rise higher. That is not a bad thing, in Solo Queue you often run into a situation where you can't communicate or cooperate with your teammates, you are just too different. There is a common misconception that Solo Queue is better because you are able to climb with random players by working together, this is false! Solo Queue is entirely how well you can carry by yourself regardless of what your teammates do. There is no need for any cooperation and your rank is determined by how well you can solo carry. Nothing wrong with that either, but people need to understand that both Queues have their own factors that go into deciding Rank. Neither is better than the other, in my opinion, and the proof of this is look at Challenger and Masters and the Pros Scene. A Random Solo player can not go to Worlds and succeed, they may have gotten to Challenger on their own, and that is admirable, but so did most of the Pros. They are there because of their ability to work as a team, not as a Solo Player.","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2016-10-14T00:34:34.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> the ability for 4 Diamond Smurfs to play with a Bronze player and carry them to whatever rank they wanted.\n\nThis existed with Duo Que...

Pretty sure he was doing it just by himself, and this season. Doesn't seem to be having any problems solo carrying either.\n\nBoosting is a problem that is difficult to address.

I know this is common to think when you are bad and don't want to acknowledge it, but I honestly believe the people in my elo are boosted. This is the first season I have gotten to Gold V, but that is only because of Promo Helper, every season I have gotten to my Silver I Promos multiple times, 2 seasons ago I failed more than 20 times. My point though is that I was able to solo carry myself to Silver I promos very easily and very quickly. It took me 1 week to get from Bronze 4 to Silver 1. This season however has been the most struggle I have ever faced, it took me 3 weeks just to get to Silver I and another couple weeks to get to Gold V. I haven't been able to get out of Gold V, and big part of that is how easily I give up lately, but most of it is because I don't think everyone is in the same skill range. It is painfully obvious that my ADC is worse then everyone else by leaps and bounds, it is painfully obvious the Top laner is outclassed in every way by his opponent.   \n\nI have lost so many games where I am playing excellent and yet can't carry my team (a lot of games where i play terrible). I have gotten several Penta's this season that were damn near pure 1v5's and yet still couldn't win because my team didn't take advantage and there is only so much one person can do. I mean I had to kill all 5 of them (with Leonas help), TP to a lane take 3 turrets and an inhib to stop my team from intentionally feeding because they thought it was over.  \n\nI have never had these issues before this season, this season is so stompy because the Bronze boosted player is going to lose to most opponents. This goes both ways btw, the other team also has these players but its because of this that I am stalled where I am. Its not fair that win or loss is decided by who has more boosted players because no matter how well I play personally, a 25/2 Riven is going to kill us all.","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2016-10-14T18:30:29.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely understand how you feel man, but I also think that the changes to the game, and the meta are contributing a lot more to the \"stompiness\" of games atm.\n\nEarly game matters (especially in our lower elos) SO much more than it did in previous seasons.
