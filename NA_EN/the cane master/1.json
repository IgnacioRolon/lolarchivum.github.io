Killing this monster will yield great monetary and magical rewards to the team, but it should not be confronted alone\".","url":"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Baron_Nashor","image":"http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/1/15/Baron_Nashor_OriginalSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151202202626"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"First off, in Season 6 we got every game homeguard bonuses to both bases post 20th min. mark. Having that+recall timer shortened by half really killed macro play in favor of  teamfights coming into Season 6.  Now it always comes down to 5v5 teamfights at Baron, smiting/stealing the objective and snowballing a game off of that, since the reward is higher than ever, a well-known meme might say way too high! Many champions rely on split pushing, and we are yet to see a split pushing comp/base race in competitive play due to all this.\nTL;DR Please consider removing empowered recall in the next season. Faithfully yours, a season 2 LoL veteran.","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-10-29T22:24:01.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"You aren't a veteran at D5.
