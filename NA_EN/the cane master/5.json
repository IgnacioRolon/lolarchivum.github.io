He has aoe, but also a 4 sec rewind with a heal, just to be sure you can't punish him.\n\nHonestly the whole thing seems to be a problem with how riot approaches this type of \"assassin/fighter or fighter/assassin\" champion design. They almost inevitably end up making a champion who is good at prolonged fights and is somewhat durable (fighter aspect), and then also has massive burst potential and safety w/ mobility (assassin aspect). At which point i've just got to ask, where is the counter play to something like that?\n\nThey want blatant counter play for champions like sol, but then just give these assassin/fighters the best of both classes, and sometimes even kits of mages {{champion:245}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}} then act like they're fairly designing the champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2016-05-02T02:00:54.326+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, people need to remember that exact statement. He doesn't have burst at early levels unless you get hit by his ult. To do his damage, he actually has to come up to you, in melee range, for an auto or two, then he runs away. He can be punished during that time, because his E is on CD.\n\nNext thing, the reason people are/was building Tank Ekko, is because Ekko sucks at prolonged fights. If he's going full AP, he'll only have a ROA with an Abyssal/Zhoynas to try to stay in a fight. In a teamfight, do you really think that an AP Ekko is going to stay near a target and auto them a bunch of times? No, they try to proc their passive, run around and try not to die until his E or Q CD is back up, and look for good Ult opprotunities.\n\nFinal thing about Ekko, if Ekko uses his ult to get out of a tough situation, how is that any different than any other ultimate in the game? Sion's use their ult to escape ganks, Malphites Ult can be used to run away, Shyvanna's ult can, and the list continues. If they blow their ult as an escape, use that opportunity to go agro at them in lane. You can literally see when Ekko doesn't have his ult up, so take advantage!!","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2016-05-02T09:04:26.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol well with zed his advantage despite being melee, is that his damage from auto attack trading increases as he builds damage for his abilities. So after the first recall, you can safely assume he will probably return to lane able to easily out trade you.\n\nOn the last bit though. The difference is that Sion, Shyv, Malph DON'T HEAL. And while most ults in the game do tend to have some form of CC or Mobility attached to them. The champion's kit is often designed to use their ult as part of their rotation, where ekko's seems to be designed to be saved for the most opportune time to escape or maybe burst.\n\nHere's where you're statement falls flat. If Ekko uses his ult to retreat from a fight, he heals back a portion of the damage and a flat amount on top of that. If the fight remains in the same area he might land a massive chunk of damage to top it off. Ekko is punished by sustained damage champions, but as an assassin counters sustained damage. His ult actually counters both high burst and low burst, high burst gets eaten and heal, where low burst gives his hologram time to catch up and burst the target, unless the fight is moving, but... he is given 3 slows, MS and a total 650 dash range.\n\nSimply put, ekko is broken because he is given a tool for every situation, where other champions are missing such tools. It's literally a case of the new lee sin. He will forever be impossible to balance, because riot will refuse to removing any of the utility from his kit (thank god for that AS removal on E) all the while failing to properly weigh utility and power. Riot will then struggle to ever bring his #s down enough that he is still relevant, but not broken. If we're lucky we will not have to wait 4-5 years again.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2016-05-02T21:35:21.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That part about Sion, Shyv, Malph, the heal doesn't matter in my comparison. I simply used them as decent examples of people using an Ult for an escape instead of agro. The next part isn't a great example either of what you said. An ult doesn't have to be a part of their rotation, because people will always use an ult, or any ability really, to maximize potential. \n\nA Darius waits till someone has 5 stacks on them, or is executable, to use his ult. He doesn't simply pop his ult after he E,W,Q's or whatever his combo order is. A Garen doesn't ult a full HP Target. A Shaco doesn't ult immediately after Ambushing in, nor would Karthus Ult before dying. Different champs have different Win conditions, and Ekko's ult win condition is running around an enemy till either he ults for the health and safety, or he ults for the damage. Saying that an ability can only be combat focused is one sided and biased honestly, when other champs have that decision.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2016-05-02T22:56:10.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm not even saying it should be combat focused. It's that his kit is given no holes. His ult heals him and deals damage.\n\nSo many of the mechanics in his kit are designed around mitigating punishment for mistakes.

Unless you stand in the same spot for three seconds, or just watch him use the animation in front of you, it's hard to land.\n\nRange Poke? Ya mean the easy to dodge from afar Q? Not even to mention that his Q has a hell of a wind up time, giving you plenty time to go left or right. \n\nLastly, you know what trading means right? Ekko isn't going to blow an ult just to heal a bit from a trade. His ult is only used to secure kills, or escape a bad situation, and when that ult is down, it's got a fricking long ass CD.

If a malph missed his ult he gets 0 value from it. Ekko can miss the damage of his ult, use it as an escape and still get value from having used it.\n\nBecause it's so difficult to predict an enemy's path when you're in lane and you hard engage onto them. It's actually really simple, if you can beat them they run back, if they feel they can beat you they fight in place (there is generally no reason to waste time and damage moving), if they need to kite you to beat you then they can't because of his 2 slows, dash, and MS steroid.\n\nDon't get me wrong, i'm not saying his Q is hard to dodge, but because of the long duration he completely zones you off from an area for a good 2/3 seconds. If you're melee then it would be much harder to dodge, because of minion block limiting your potential evasion.\n\nYou clearly don't understand what kind of trades i'm talking about, i'm referring to the kind of trades that pretty much only exist in the current game. Not the old trades that were small 10-15% of your HP skirmishes. I'm talking about the 70-80% of each person's max health. In which case healing for so much actually punishes the enemy for having traded evenly.\n\nAgain, the problem with ekko's design is that he has ways to mitigate punishment for misplays.

Probably just incoherent rambling.\n\nyou're literally low bronze 3\n\nover 87% of ranked players are better than you. \nekko is also your 2nd most played in ranked, and you have a negative winrate with him. which is kind of sad, because people have over a 50% winrate with Ekko even when they have never played him before. but anyway since you're doing so bad on him, I can see why you think he isn't absurdly broken, but it's not the champion, it's the player.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=The Best EV3R NA,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vxVOurAW,comment-id=00050000000000000000,timestamp=2016-05-01T21:23:52.056+0000)\n> So while everyone is distracted by Ekko who isn&#x27;t even a top 3 ban in higher tier play, meanwhile tank Fizz has the luxury of just going around and demolishing people. Also Fizz has a slow which is practically uneeded\n\nLol. Ekko is banned all the time in high elo. Probably the most banned along with Kindred. And Fizz isn't even played that often at all, and when he is, he isn't played as a tank. No idea where you are getting your info from but it's wrong lol.","replies":[{"poster":"WinBoat","date":"2016-05-01T21:54:20.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":13,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aazzlano,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vxVOurAW,comment-id=0005000000000001,timestamp=2016-05-01T21:45:37.107+0000)\n>\n> you&#x27;re literally low bronze 3\n> \n> over 87% of ranked players are better than you. \n> ekko is also your 2nd most played in ranked, and you have a negative winrate with him. which is kind of sad, because people have over a 50% winrate with Ekko even when they have never played him before. but anyway since you&#x27;re doing so bad on him, I can see why you think he isn&#x27;t absurdly broken, but it&#x27;s not the champion, it&#x27;s the player.\n> \n> Lol.

I never understand why you guys do this? It's hilarious. Instead of the traditional grammar nazi's and stuff, when it comes to league, you got the \"lets see his rank\" specialist.\n\n\nhttp://www.lol-mmr.com/profilev2.php?summoner=the%20best%20ev3r%20na&region=na Yesterday, I was better than 20% of the Silver 1 players, my MMR was putting me with constant golds/plats. Today it says Silver 2 cause I dropped a couple games, but none the less, a B3 beating the crap out of golds?  Yeah that's me.\n\nAlso, I havent really even played ranked since the whole DQ came out. I tried it for  maybe a day, and kept being put against premades and you wonder why I lost? Should be pretty obvious.\n\nAlso, this isn't my only account, but it's ok, you were probably carried to whatever rank you are lol.. In fact, I know you were carried, but not gonna go do a statistic check :)\n\nAlso, Ekko is not top 3 in plat and up, there was a statistic chart about 3 or 4 days ago I saw that got posted from all divisions. Ekko's mainly being banned in bronze. In plat, I think the number 2 ban was Janna, I know she was up there.","replies":[{"poster":"Aazzlano","date":"2016-05-01T22:31:30.000+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Janna is like never banned lmfao. No idea what you are talking about. She has a 0.51% ban rate (once in 200 games) \n\nAnd that's normals MMR. So what? I face Masters/Challengers in Normals all the time. Does that mean I'm Master/Challenger level? No lol.\n\nIf you can't climb out of bronze, that isn't the fault of DQ. Bronze is literally the worst players in the game, if you are unable to climb out of there, then you aren't better than them. Bronze premades aren't going to be any better than bronze solos lol.  \n\nhttp://champion.gg/statistics/#?sortBy=general.banRate&order=descend\nThis site shows ONLY Plat+ statistics. Oh look, Ekko is the NUMBER ONE ban. Shocking.\n\nAnd it's funny how you bring that I was carried to my rank like it would even be relevant. Like if I was, that my knowledge of what bans are in high elo would then be completely wrong. By the way, here is my op.gg \nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=aazzlano\nDang, looks like I was totally carried to my elo! You were right all along!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Krys Star","date":"2016-05-02T06:32:43.707+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"His stun is also 2.25 flat, which is crazy stupid high as either a tank or a mage-assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2016-05-03T00:44:17.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It also has a three second delay.
