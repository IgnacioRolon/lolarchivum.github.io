Main client NO pop-up showed up!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Riot,\nI was playing an ARAM game and I suddenly got disconnected. So I left the game and wanted to go back. But when I login again, I was in the client and I can not find my game anymore! There was no pop-up reminding me to reconnect. I tried to match a new game and it unexpectedly worked! I can match a new game with other players. I also checked my game history and there was no record about that game. That is so weird. \n\nMy wifi is working fine since I can create the discussion at this moment. Is this a bug? If i get a punishment later, can you please remove it since this is really not my fault. Please fix this Riot and I am looking forward to your response. \nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-18T02:33:55.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh sounds like you had a game crash server side. When that happens everyone gets booted out and can't rejoin because the game closes itself. Nobody will get any punishment, and you should have been able to requeue.","replies":[]}]}
