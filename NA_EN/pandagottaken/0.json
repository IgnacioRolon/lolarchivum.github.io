However now after trying to reconnect for around a minute or two it will report that the client has run into a bug splat and automatically close, we have tried reinstalling and everything else that is recommended on the bug splat help page (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) but none of them have worked. I would greatly appreciate any help that can be offered. The Mac is currently running on high sierra.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-31T22:33:19.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I strongly suggest dualbooting windows or linux alongside OSX, the client (even in WINE on linux) works a lot better.\n\nIt is free, easy and only needs about 35GB for windows+game or 20GB for linux.","replies":[{"poster":"PandaGotTaken","date":"2018-04-01T00:14:19.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was always tempted to recommend that option but the Mac my friend uses is quite old so i wasn't sure whether it would be able to run it or not.
