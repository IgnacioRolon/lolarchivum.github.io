I was super excited and bought all the merch  that i've wanted since I started playing League, but a week or two later his card was declined while trying to get an Uber and forgot which card that he let me use, so he filed for identity fraud (IKR) and had the bank withdraw everything that I had bought and I was banned for a store charge back not too long ago. I just want to get the ban off my tail and continue to play with the community.
