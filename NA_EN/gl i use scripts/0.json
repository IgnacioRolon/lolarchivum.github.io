Before I say anything, I want to say that if this isn't possible, it isn't that much of a big deal. I recently hit 999 wins and have seen many people play with someone from Riot for their thousandth win. Do they still do this? I am aware they are extremely busy. Again, it's no biggie if it can't happen. Just wanting to see if they still do this and if any \"Rioter\" would like to play with me for mine. \r\n\r\nThanks! :-)","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-07-26T22:48:45.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think they do that anymore, which is sad, because it was a really cool idea.","replies":[{"poster":"GL I USE SCRIPTS","date":"2015-07-26T23:45:46.921+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, that stinks.

Gonna ask when it hits 3000 though. It's funny because I've played with @RiotPendragon quite a few times. He was a questionable Master Yi when I played with him. I hope he's improved.
