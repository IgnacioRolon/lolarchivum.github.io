Then i still lose IP? please explain this to me? it is obvious that the only reason we lost was because it was 4v5...... so im punished because someone leaves... THanks riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-13T21:25:43.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really a bummer when someone disconnects from a match and leaves your team outnumbered for the game. LP cannot be modified or returned, as the system that assigns LP is automated to prevent abuse. I highly encourage you to report anyone who AFK's or leaves after the match in post-game lobby. If that player has a trend of disconnections, they'll most likely end up in low priority queue and be less likely to disconnect in the future. Players intentionally leaving matches to grief others can ultimately end up with a suspension.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
