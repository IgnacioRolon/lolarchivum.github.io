But i have been playing recently to find that in my games every 2-3 minutes i get Attempting to Reconnect on my screen. I have been reported several times because of this mishap. I have tried disabling my IP helper but none of those things work. If you have the same problem please tell me below so that i don&#039;t feel like i&#039;m being targeted by riot, and if you have a solution please please tell me below. This started after the new patch but my siblings and friends don&#039;t have this problem. If you have the solution to this pain please comment it down below. All help is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks ~ Dragon","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-24T22:35:48.956+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Attempting to Reconnect* is usually a sign that your computer is experiencing *packet loss* along your network routing to the server.
