Sometimes, his tentacles fail to move or even move around erraticly in random directions. I own the battlecast skin as well and i have noticed this issue only occasionally with the homeguard enchantment but i am pretty sure it has something to deal with that skin&#039;s respawn animation as when i wait a little bit and do not leave the fountain immediately, his tentacles animate as they are supposed to.\r\n\r\nSteps to replicate:\r\n1. use velkoz&#039;s arclight skin (or battlecast)\r\n2. purchase boots with the homeguard enchantment\r\n3. leave the fountain after the homeguard passive is proced immediately after returning to the fountain\r\n\r\nOccurrence rate: roughly 95% with the arclight skin, the battlecast skin has a much lower chance of occurrence, around 5%\r\n\r\ni love velkoz&#039;s tentacle animation but it does look a bit strange when this bug does occur and they don&#039;t move at all. The arclight skin is so beautiful but this bug makes me prefer his bc skin over it as i often buy homeguard on vel","replies":[{"poster":"zzman73051","date":"2015-07-20T05:42:16.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tentacle monster feet op","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-19T17:37:36.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya Gespe,\n\nThanks for the report!
