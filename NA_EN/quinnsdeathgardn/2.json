I feel it is a worthy risk to allow Taliyah to be knocked up too. This not only allows her to perform outplays by moving herself, but also adds counter by allowing champs that can stay on her to stay on her when they get close (since knocking them up would knock herself up with them). Being able to knock herself up makes so much sense in her lore as a stone mage that I really question why Rito decided to not add it to the game... Rito please?","replies":[{"poster":"ReshiKillim","date":"2016-05-20T00:41:03.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would allow enemy Yasuos to ult you whenever you did it.","replies":[{"poster":"QuinnsDeathGardn","date":"2016-05-23T00:07:50.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just another risk involved with it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-05-20T00:23:51.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They decided to not allow her to use W on herself as it gave too much power.","replies":[{"poster":"QuinnsDeathGardn","date":"2016-05-23T00:07:20.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AvantelWings,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KAAOKggn,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-05-20T00:23:51.906+0000)\n>\n> They decided to not allow her to use W on herself as it gave too much power.\n\nI see how it could, unfortunately. Although decreasing the push range of herself could alleviate that issue to an extent.","replies":[]}]}]}
