As a Quinn player who has loved Quinn&#039;s assassin play-style (as a mid, jungle, and bot ADC) and the fact that Valor actually plays a role in her kit and power, I am disappointed with how much has been taken away from her. So Valor is just a vehicle to Quinn when she is out of combat (completely against Quinn&#039;s lore btw)? Why is Teemo the only one that can blind people when Quinn should be able to blind people in order to escape skirmishes and/or get the upper hand in fights (both thematically and game-play wise)? A 2-second channel on her ult makes it completely useless in battle and simply takes away from her late game power (which is already comparatively weaker than other ADC&#039;s considering struggles she already has with team fights). Wonder if she&#039;ll getting a sitting duck skin after these changes. The ONLY change I happily accept is the increased vault speed (which has so many fun interactions while not being overpowered in anyway and require skill. A lot of this fun interaction has now been taken away due to her e (vault) canceling tag team and no longer bringing her right on top of her target (which won&#039;t let her vault to an enemy over certain walls and be able to follow up the attack. Did  I mention how i haven&#039;t seen any compensation for the loss of damage from her w Valor passive? (may have simply overlooked that part but i guess Riot wanted to keep it as a boring utility spell that is outclassed by Ashe&#039;s vision-granting spell) Why Riot, why... Was originally looking forward to the marksman changes to play Quinn more but it looks like I&#039;ll have to find a new adc to play if these changes end up going live... Yes, Quinn is currently underplayed but why ruin her playstyle and add a windeing disconnect between her lore and gameplay...","replies":[]}
