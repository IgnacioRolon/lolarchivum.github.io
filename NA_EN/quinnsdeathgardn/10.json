I feel this would be super useful for her, especially in the support role. It doesn&#039;t add a lot of power to her besides some extra vision over walls, which she already gets when she ults. Could this be something we change? I noticed this once I started to play a bit of Zoe, especially in the support role.{{champion:142}}","replies":[{"poster":"Atmosphere","date":"2018-07-09T15:46:49.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"She already has so much going for her, why does she need that?
