As an avid Kalista player, although I do not main her, I have ALWAYS found her q to be her most useless ability at times despite the potential to deal tons of damage with its wicked base damage. Could it plese be changed to increase the range of the q to make it actually possible to hit enemy champs since the way waves are set up makes it kind of hard to do that in lane... It would increase her skill cap more but think it is a worthwhile enough buff until she gets a full GU like Azir...\r\n\r\nLissandra\r\nI absolutely LOVE Lissandra (pissed at rito for taking away my double morello liss with no boots and 1000 ap full build), but, she has sucked ever since rito nerfed her out of most competitive play a while back. I know they tried to change her passive, which is a step in the right direction. It would be so much better if it reduced its cd on units kills too though, either 1 sec like for when she ccs or 2 seconds at double cd. She has a WHOPPING 48.9% win rate at only .99% play rate according to Champion.gg on July 10, 2017. Isn&#039;t the average win rate for a champ that low supposed to be above 52%? Rito please. SHe desperately needs this more than Kalista\r\n\r\nPlease comment and add suggestions!","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-07-10T20:18:49.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Kalista\n>Weak\n\nchoose one\n\nhttp://www.leagueofgraphs.com/fr/champions/stats/kalista/diamond","replies":[{"poster":"QuinnsDeathGardn","date":"2017-07-10T21:45:52.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ey, you know how to edit XD","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-07-10T22:08:25.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"edit? you mean when i added the link?\n\nyou're welcome, i'm tired of people thinking that kalista needs buffs","replies":[{"poster":"QuinnsDeathGardn","date":"2017-07-11T00:57:18.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no, i don't mean she NEEDS a buff. this is a suggestion to make her more attainable for lower elos and non-professional play in general.
