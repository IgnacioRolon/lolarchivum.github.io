The only reference to why this may be happening is the wiki that states that they will attack something within 350 range, barring other, higher priority target acquisition. Even when the enemy champion is within this 350 range, they still refuse to attack unless the champion attacks them first (in the case of ranged attacks that deal half of their health) or if I walk into AA range and attack them first. I know this was not the case last patch and this bug is extremely frustrating. Not sure which way the plants are designed to work, but they are working inconsistently between patches. This has made games as Zyra far harder than they should be, especially in long games.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nA frustrated Zyra main","replies":[]}
