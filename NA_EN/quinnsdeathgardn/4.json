I KNEW IT! It was a rather nice and subtle hint by Riot to include a voidling in Winter Wonderland Lulu's splash art, hinting at a Snowdown skin for Malzahar in the future. Oh the secrets they hide right in front of our eyes. I saw it though and have been waiting for the day when Malzahar would be getting this Snowdown skin and it has now come. Snowdown Malzahar is now on the PBE and I welcome its arrival. Thank you Riot for giving Malzahar this lovely skin and taking such a long time to make sure that is up to the standards of other, gorgeous skins that have been produced recently (a full year at least for a 975rp skin?!). Thank you, Riot, for giving lesser played champions love with amazing skins and would like to give my appreciation to the subtle hints that Riot gives out for new champs and skins that aren't always a massive event centered around them. \r\n\r\n(The voidling is in the background of WW Lulu's splash, near her crown. I outlined what I believe to be the outline of a voidling's head in the splash)","replies":[{"poster":"Talon Gerrard","date":"2014-11-21T23:13:39.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok. That is really stupid. There isn't a champion skin hint about Snowday Malzahar. **HOWEVER**, there is a champion hint for {{champion:201}} if you look towards the left. Look carefully and you will see a grumpy looking poro with a moustache. It's sort of right in the middle of all the poros looking almost directly to the right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2014-11-21T06:32:27.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its just a purple glow","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Dusteon","date":"2014-11-21T04:10:32.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...I think that's just some purple glow.
