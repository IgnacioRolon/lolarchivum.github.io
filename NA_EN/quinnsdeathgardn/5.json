However, in other games, it simply won't proc or stack at all on turrets. I am fine with it not procing on turrets (even though other champs like Jax and Zoe can proc on hits on turrets), but I find it a bit frustrating when it won't even stack to get me ready for my 3rd shot from hitting turrets. I am not sure what is causing the issue, but it may have to deal with the \"bug fix\" that was applied this patch that produced this bug. It is really useful to be able to use her w passive on turrets and it is simply confusing not knowing if it is going to work when you are going into a game...   .-.{{champion:518}} I would say the occurrence of the bug is somewhere around 50/50, but I would have to look into it more to get a better estimate.","replies":[]}
