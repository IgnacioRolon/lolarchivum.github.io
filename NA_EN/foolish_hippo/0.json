Please try again in a few minutes.\" I have already submitted tickets about the fraudulent purchases and changed my password but still can not access my account, so then I submitted another ticket about Account Recovery. \r\n\r\nI am at a loss here. I have had this account for a very long time and have had many great times playing this game, but this hurts a lot. \r\n\r\nMain Account\r\nSummoner name: Carlo\r\nUsername: Foolishippo\r\nServer: NA\r\n\r\nTicket for charges to account: (#31116552) \r\nTicket for account recovery: (#31116615)\r\n\r\nI will gladly answer any questions to prove I am the owner of the account. I just really hope to hear from a Riot employee soon, but most importantly have the charges to my account reversed so I do not have to pay $200 of Riot Points I did not want or buy.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nCarlo (Foolishippo)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-24T21:13:18.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're in the best hands with those tickets you've submitted! Once our account team can verify you as the account creator, they'll be able to recover your account and reverse and damage the hacker might have done.","replies":[{"poster":"Foolish Hippo","date":"2017-07-24T22:21:48.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah my account was just banned, so I am not too sure what you are talking about.\n\nEDIT: I did live chat with an employee, it was just a precautionary suspension, and I am currently in the process of getting the account back.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-24T22:50:46.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most likely those bans were placed because we noticed suspicious activity, and also because you mentioned that it's been hacked. It wouldn't be very good of us to sit idly by and let a hacked account be ruined!","replies":[{"poster":"Foolish Hippo","date":"2017-07-24T23:05:08.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yup you are right.
