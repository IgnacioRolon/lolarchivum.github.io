Even if you return to the game, you're still gone for a period of time which causes other players a negative experience.  The best way to restore your standing with the system is by playing without anymore interruptions.  I recommend going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to resolve whatever is causing your network to lose connection to the game server.
