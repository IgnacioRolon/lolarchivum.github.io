Eh, I don&#039;t know. Watching someone &quot;speedrun&quot; through it won&#039;t tell me if it&#039;s enjoyable.\r\n\r\nAlso, MyNintendo question : How does the gold coins works? Is it if you purchase X$ Worth of stuffs you get the associated amount or do you also get everything before? (Like if you buy 60$ of stuffs do you get 50 gold coins or 150) ?","replies":[]}
