I then loaded into the game without any type of HUD. So I closed the game and reentered the game again. Finished the game (we won) and then I get a low priority queue for 5 games 20 minutes each. This is unfair as I had difficulties and I understand the system doesn't really sense that but I refuse to play anymore games until that's fixed as its not deserved whatsoever!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-13T21:25:21.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry about the trouble you've been having.  :(  Even though you made an effort to come back to the game, it looks like you were gone long enough to get marked as a leaver.  I'd like to help troubleshoot as well if this is still an issue!  Are you on a 4K or is this a fresh install?  Leaverbuster will treat all leaves equally, but preventing anymore leaves can get your standing back to normal!","replies":[{"poster":"błackbear","date":"2017-12-14T08:15:33.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I know but it's still 20 minutes each game for 5 games for something I had no control over. I know it will. I'd understand if I manually left but I didn't and that's what's getting to me. Im still on the same client. I haven't uninstalled, just updated. But im sorry, waiting 20 minutes for a single game is what im honestly not going to do.","replies":[]}]}]}
