So I get a low priority que in ranked. Riot since everyone is having this issue or had. You really shouldn't throw anyone into low priority que for that reason. You should be able to detect why someone was disconnected instead of insisting on it being someone just afked. It's not our faults. One week we can run the game the next we can't?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-16T00:38:12.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once someone has disconnected from the servers, it would be preeeeeetty hard to figure out why. Mainly due to the fact that you've already been disconnected, there's no connection for us to detect anything from (if that makes sense). In the long run, our system doesn't issue LPQ's for just one left or afk game. It takes into account how often it happens and how recently it's happened. \n\nThat's not to say your client doesn't still need a little attention of course. We should absolutely address that direct x issue before hopping back in games, since you've already noticed that it could affect your gameplay. First things first, we need to make sure that you've got the latest directx drivers updated on your pc. Check for those, and let me know if that helps.","replies":[]}]}
