I prefer it but am not saying it suits everyone. I have old school gaming preferences. And I tend to prefer support characters but please humor me and consider directing me by steps to achieve such a thing. With the new update all my old configurations have been deleted. \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n{{champion:76}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:63}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-08T02:41:17.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seeing as the post you linked was back from 2009, those steps may not be 100% accurate anymore. I'd probably stick to adjusting your keybinds through the in-game settings. If you're having issues getting them to save correct, try a quick manual reset.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to your default installation\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
