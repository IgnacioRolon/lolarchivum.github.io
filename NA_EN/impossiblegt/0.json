This isn&#039;t a QQ thread. I wasn&#039;t expecting to get an S because I&#039;ve seen Jhins go 20+ kills with 2 deaths and still not get it. But I really wasn&#039;t expecting a B+ as my grade. Which made me wonder what exactly you needed for an S?\r\n\r\nSo, if anyone has earned any S grade with Jhin on ARAM, can you please share your score? I&#039;m honestly just curious how absurd his grading curve is, because apparently 16-4-17 is a B+, which on most other champs would be at least an A+, probably higher.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-31T07:37:32.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To get an S with Jhin, you need a score of 4/4/4 and a cs of 4, 44, or 444.\n\nIt also helps if your damage and healing follow that pattern.","replies":[{"poster":"Keep ur Jhin up","date":"2016-07-31T07:54:34.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Votable Jester,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0Ff30tAx,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-07-31T07:37:32.507+0000)\n>\n> To get an S with Jhin, you need a score of 4/4/4 and a cs of 4, 44, or 444.\n> \n> It also helps if your damage and healing follow that pattern.\n\nFeels good man {{champion:202}} \n\n(But no really it's probably the CS and overall damage)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"quatrence","date":"2016-07-31T06:57:07.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To get an S+ in ARAM as Jhin (I think it was an S+, I got a chest soo) I went 38/12/47 with 124 CS.

I long ago just stopped taking CS on ARAM because there's no reason to fight teammates for it. I usually just buy an income item or rely on kills for gold. Like if that stops you from getting an S on ARAM that's kind of like the ultimate feel bad. I'm a support player at heart, taking CS is forbidden for me.
