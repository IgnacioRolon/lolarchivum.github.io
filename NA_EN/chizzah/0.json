I recently heard that there are no rules in blind pick normals so calling out the role you want first does not mean it will be yours. Just so I am not confused if I &quot;steal lane&quot; or &quot;instalock&quot; during champ select am I safe from being banned due to a report/s?\n\nIf I do not flame, not being toxic, don&#039;t intentionally feed or go afk of course.\n\nAs a new league player I would like to know so that I can stop getting tilted by players doing it and just have fun joining them if it is does not break any rules.\n\nEdit: Since I started playing this is all I know thus the reason towards my confusion. I don't want to abuse the report system for instalocking and role stealing if its not an issue in blindpick which is what I have been doing up until now.","replies":[{"poster":"cope moment","date":"2016-08-30T01:23:21.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Instalocking is something that I typically will report, along with stealing lane as caneither screw with your team comp or ruin someone elses plan","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-30T01:23:03.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In blind pick, whoever picks first gets to pick first.\n\"Calling\" a role has _zero_ effect on your right to pick, and your picks are not reportable.\n\nIf people get salty about it, they should not be playing casualblinds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2016-08-30T01:08:21.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in blind pick who ever calls the role first gets it...\n\nbut the only reason to play blind pick is if you want to play a champ like {{champion:238}}  that will never get through bans","replies":[]}]}
