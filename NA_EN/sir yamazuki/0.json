Sometimes it can be hard to accept criticism, yet she has taken it in stride like a true Lux fan.

The style itself is nice, but it needs some work. You can tell her thighs are well... Awkward, and they honestly look like thunder thighs. The shifty eye look also distracts from the other nice aspects of the artwork. The upper torso is very well draw, and the details on her staff are quite lovely. As an artist myself, I can also tell you I know the hand trick~ placing the hands/hand behind the back because hands are a bitchhhhhhhhhhhhhhh to draw. You shouldn't do this, you'll only get better the more you try (: This is a nice first attempt, but I think it could use some improvements! Good job","replies":[{"poster":"Amy Khal","date":"2015-05-07T11:24:21.755+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi and thanks ! I've noticed that the thighs are the overall least favorite part, I'm taking it in consideration. And the hands are drawn but they're just hidden.
