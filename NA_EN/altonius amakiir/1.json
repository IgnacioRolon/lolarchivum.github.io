This has been a common bug in the past, where item sets just don't save properly, so I payed it no heed. I left the client after that game, assuming they never saved in the first place, and was going to remake them later. When I got back on to do so, I noticed they had saved properly, edited and saved again to be sure, then started another Rammus game. Still didn't show up. Is there some extra step I now have to do to save them on Legacy Client because of the new Client or is this caused by something else? How do I fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"zafey","date":"2016-12-12T13:02:05.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"open the legacy client in admin mode?","replies":[]},{"poster":"mailbox head","date":"2016-12-07T20:40:29.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've run into this problem as well.   Looks like when you create a custom item set, it adds it to config/itemsets.json, but does NOT add it to config/champions/{champ}/recommended/\n\nThe solution that works for me is to create/modify the item set, then play a game with that champ _using the legacy client_.  It looks like the legacy client knows to read out itemsets.json into the recommended folder, but the new client does not.\n\nRito if you can fix this, that would great.  Or, you know, maybe just add item set creation/modification into the new client.  Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Altonius Amakiir","date":"2016-12-08T01:25:02.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My problem is different, it just doesnt save them at all to my computer.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-06T18:04:31.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Were any manual modifications recently made to your config?  It sounds like your config may have bcome corrupt and not syncing properly.  I recommend resetting your config to help fix this up, but keep in mind you'll need to redo your bindings as a result:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nMake sure to delete the entirey of the folder for the reset.
