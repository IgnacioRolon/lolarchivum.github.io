For the last 7 days through my router connection game lags for a few seconds to 20 seconds every 5 minutes.

The \"Attempting to Reconnect\" would pop up, if I'm lucky for 2 seconds, if not so lucky for a minute. Frequently in game I'd be issuing commands and the champ would not respond, or fire off the skillshot like 3 seconds later (often in the wrong direction). Very very frustrating to play, and NO IT IS NOT MY CONNECTION.
