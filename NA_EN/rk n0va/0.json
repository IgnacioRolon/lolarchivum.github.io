That's not what I'm talking about. Im talking about people trying to make it seem like they get autofilled every game, its over exaggeratting. Yea you may get auto-filled 1-2 times in a good amount of games that you get your main role. Get over it. Some people aren't picking certains roles. So if you take a second to think about it and use some type of logic to try and see why it could happen. You search for a match and it looks for 10 players. It picks 10 random players, now from those 10, maybe the first ones to accept got their role because they were the first ones and no one was there to contest. then it could just go by who joined in and what they wanted. Because im usually one of the first 2-3 to accept. I RARELY get autofilled. Played a total of 14 games the last 2 days and not one autofill. The times I do notice I get autofilled is when im almost last to accept and thats when im watching a video or ran to get a drink or something. We can talk about the imperfections all we want, doesn't mean it'll be fixed. Maybe itt's random. There is no certain code or order for it. You dont like when people on the same team are auto-filled into each others preferred roles? Like really? Is that something that really bugs you?\n\"damn I got mid but wanted top\"\n\"damn I got top but wanted mid\" \nDamn two people didn't get their role, whatever will they do?
