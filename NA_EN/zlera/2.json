I have a question for the amazing people here on the League Boards.\r\nDo you think Riot should enforce a meta (and by extention, ban all off-meta players).\r\nThis is a serious discussion, so please don't spam this with \"anti-riot games\" propaganda, its quite frankly annoying.\r\n\r\nSo basically, my question - Do you think Riot should enforce a meta?\r\nPersonally I think they should not, its fun to try out new things in new things, like kassadin jungle or kassadin support, taking that away is taking away part of the most important thing in the game, experimentation.\r\nHowever, on the other hand, I understand why people would be upset to see a yuumi jungle in their ranked game, so I see both sides but I think experimentation is just way too much important to block out.","replies":[]}
