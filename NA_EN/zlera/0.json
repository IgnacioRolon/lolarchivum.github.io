The first amendment stops the government from restricting your freedoms (though even that has limits) however it does NOT restrict private locations or businesses from this, this is why you can be fired because you talk about politics at work while on hours, or kicked out of a business for calling people names. The same applies to online accounts, ie. League of Legends. Riot is *allowing* you to use one of their accounts, this is like *allowing* you to enter the building to do your business. So, all in all, Riot Games has every right to ban you for using \"toxic\" language, whether you agree with it or not. \r\n{{champion:76}}","replies":[]}
