All the other tier 4 masteries encourage some sort of interesting game play. Double edge sword is a risk/reward kinda deal, Bounty hunter encourages roamimg, Battle trance encourages long drawn out fights and juggernauts, Bandit is for supports and those who priorities gold income, Dangerous game encourages skirmishing and provides some safety to those who like fighting, and Fearless encourages initiating. The other two in resolve are kinda lame stat padding, but you get the point.\r\n\r\nGreenfather&#039;s Gift, on the other hand, doesn&#039;t really encourage any interesting game play. All it does is give an arbitrary trade window for some extra damage, which other masteries give with less crappy restrictions. Compared to the new changes, and some of the old masteries, this one just seems shitty.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-11-03T17:31:06.701+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"All of the masteries except Ferocity and a select few in Cunning are pretty shitty. \n\nPretty much everyone wants seasons 1-5 mastery system back.","replies":[{"poster":"137434","date":"2016-11-03T17:35:40.108+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"You realize that masteries were changed significantly throughout the course of seasons 1-5, and that they have always been full of shitty noob trap options right?","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-11-03T17:50:37.219+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, there were noob-trap options, but there were **good** options as alternatives, which included anywhere else in the tree. \n\nNot just one that hardly helps you vs another that hardly helps you.","replies":[{"poster":"SmileInABox","date":"2016-11-03T18:15:03.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't playing before this season, unfortunately these masteries are all I know.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-11-03T17:37:06.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^\n\nMasteries were totally different in seasons 1-3 vs 4-5","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2016-11-03T18:19:40.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"... it sounds like the only mastery change i like out of all the changes done...","replies":[{"poster":"SmileInABox","date":"2016-11-03T20:48:15.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y tho...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2016-11-03T16:57:56.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I expect this mastery is one of the reasons Ivern seemed so weak on release.
