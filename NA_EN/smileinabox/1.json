Players get discouraged when they play poorly and a fair number of players(often some of the same) will treat teammates poorly for little mistakes like first blood or missing a cannon minion.

Typical.\n\nI'm not the one currently struggling to get out of Bronze mate. Want to know how I got out ? I focused everything in learning how to carry idiots so when they start feeding and doing idiotic things, I could bring it back. While it's a million times easier to do in Bronze than Silver, there were many times I failed to get a lead. If I can't carry and my team mates are doing bad, I'm ready to forfeit. My only goal then would be to try not to fuck up next game so I can carry when my team mates when they inevitable feed. \n\nIf your team mates are feeding and you are feeling helpless to do anything because you're 0-7, then something went wrong. Don't waste your time. If your team mates are feeding and you're feeling like a God that decides who lives and dies because your 10-2 with 200 CS and 3000 gold to spend, then you have done something right. In Bronze you should be learning how to stomp and get fed because you 100% cannot rely on your allies. You have to rely on yourself. If you're not the one carrying then it's a waste of your time. This is the mentality you need to get out.\n\nOccasionally you get games where one of your allies is carrying hard so its best to make yourself easy to carry by not feeding and applying pressure but these games are very very rare. You will have to be the one carrying 95% of your games to climb out.\n\nTLDR; In Bronze its either you stomp games or ff.","replies":[{"poster":"SmileInABox","date":"2016-08-10T21:15:13.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can definitely see the carry mentality.

I've been reviewing your match list and the very 1st thing that stood out to me was your CS. Your farm is far too low. To be honest, I'm surprised you actually made it to B2 without fixing this. In one game you had 95 CS in a 30 minute game. You should be nearing 300 CS, 200 at the very least. I'm 100% sure this is what is holding you back from reaching Silver. It's the number one thing that got me out of Bronze.","replies":[{"poster":"SmileInABox","date":"2016-08-10T21:46:17.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh gosh, that game was rough.
