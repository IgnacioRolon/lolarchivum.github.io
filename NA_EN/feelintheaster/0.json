It was fun. It was truly fun. I can look back on this game and enjoy making it from bronze to plat. It was a ride. I went from sucking total dick and blaming my teams, to sucking a little less dick and only having myself to blame. This game is and will probably continue to be an amazing game. I&#039;m going to keep watching Esports for sure, I want to see the Koreans win! It&#039;s only natural. And i&#039;m going to keep watching Sky, Keyori, Spazie, Uber, AnkleSpakin, Blackinola, Lilypichu, Janee and all those amazing creators. But I am done playing this game. For two reasons.\r\n\r\nReason one. The game isn&#039;t competitive. This realization dawned on me from watching VideoGameDunkey&#039;s last LoL video and take on where League is. Playing ranked is not &quot;competitive&quot; enough for me. Don&#039;t get me wrong, you have to know what you&#039;re doing in there to win. But... that&#039;s about it. Ranked consist of keeping a positive attitude and doing &quot;your best.&quot; That alone is enough to climb. That means so so little to me. To know that I ranked up only because I played consistently and did &quot;well enough&quot; is very meaningless. _The whole reason_ I started ranked play was so that I could come across better competition which would equal more fun games. But that&#039;s not what I got. More ranked just leads to more frustration, _worse games_, and lack of competence from my teammates. Which is completely ok and understandable. Sometimes you get a bad lane, sometimes you&#039;re just off, sometimes the game lags, and sometimes your mom needs help with the groceries. It. Happens. But it&#039;s the fact that my &quot;rank&quot; my_ individual score _so heavily depends on the performance and variables of the game that makes my rank feel like nothing. Just a color next to my icon. And it&#039;s the same vice-versa. It sucks to know that you are the one who contributed to that guy losing when he was so close to diamond. This, of course, does not apply to the LCS. You can&#039;t look at the LCS and think LoL is competitive. The LCS and pro play is a different system entirely. And even then I wouldn&#039;t_ want_ to go pro! I have no desire to be a top notch esports LoL player. I just want intense competitive games that make me feel like... Well basically the feeling I get from any fighting game. My performance leads to my victory. My time, effort, and practice is what leads to satisfaction in games like that. If you think you are the cause of victory in your games, you&#039;re wrong. There are NINE other people, NINE, deciding if you win or lose. Of course this is all how I see, take it with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nReason 2. The obvious one. This fucking community. Lmao, this fucking community. You wouldn&#039;t tell by the forums or the comments on League videos because those are where the smartest, most clever, funniest people go. I&#039;ve never played a game where the comments had me in tears. Seriously some of you guys are fucking hilarious and so creative and _so_ talented... But you guys aren&#039;t the ones I deal with in game. I&#039;m no saint. Nope not at all, I come from a game genre where trash talk is really just another way to motivate and create competition. That ideology is inherently &quot;toxic&quot; but seriously if you get trashed talked in Street Fighter, MK,Guilty Gear, Soul Caliber, SSB, my personal favorite Tekken. _Thats game fucking on_! Thats hype! &quot;Dude you going to let him disrespect you like that? Hell no man! It&#039;s on bro! Fight me!&quot; lol I get excited just thinking about it... But thats not what you get from LoL. LoL in game... It&#039;s much more depressing. Much more heart-breaking. Much more... pathetic. And I admit, I&#039;ve been apart of it to a degree. I&#039;ve called my fair share of face-checkers &quot;scrubs&quot;. I&#039;ve said &quot;gg&quot; at the bot lane double kill 5 mins into the game. But my &quot;toxicness&quot; has always been in my eyes reasonable and related to your performance. The meanest thing I think I&#039;ve said is &quot;0/9 you&#039;re the reason this game is un-winnable, please uninstall for the good of humanity&quot; I&#039;m not a fan of swearing so I don&#039;t do it much. That is a toxic comment no doubt about it. Saying it would lead to nothing positive from my teammate. But recently I stopped playing LoL for about 2 weeks, and before that played less for 4-5 months. I played a few games that were competitive but so much more friendly. People wanted each other to succeed in the game. I was so taken aback when I played a game just minutes ago where i was 0/2 with 123 cs and people were saying &quot;Good job feeding Irelia&quot; After we all agreed we were all lagging in game. I admittedly made a really dumb engage because I was lagging, annoyed, not having fun, not focused, and these guys flamed the shit out of me. So much so that it was amusing how toxic they were. I couldn&#039;t even be upset I was so appalled. Never have I played a game where people on my own team told me to kill myself. To get cancer. That I don&#039;t live up to my name (RaidBossRenekton) and that I was feeding with only 3 deaths when everyone else had 2!? Sufficed to say my response to that was &quot;Lmao this community, I&#039;m so glad i&#039;m done with it&quot; And that lead to a string of &quot;People like you are whats wrong with this game, why does everyone use that excuse, you&#039;re just trash enjoy gold&quot; You know what. &macr;\\_(ãƒ„)_/&macr; Ok. I replied &quot;Right&quot; and went on to go god-like and win the game. In the post game lobby they continued to flame me after I heavily contributed to the success of that match... It doesn&#039;t happen always. And quite a few games are much more tame in &quot;toxicness&quot; And a lot of people aren&#039;t like that. But it happens enough. And It happens way too much on one side, or on the other (winning side or losing).\r\n\r\nWho would want to play a game like that. Who would want to_ play with people_ like that. There are more of people like them, than not. I don&#039;t mind getting called bad, sometimes I am. I don&#039;t mind &quot;get better&quot; when you only barely won a trade because i was lagging. No salt to be found here. But when my own team is flaming me and telling me to kill myself because i was &quot;feeding&quot; with 2 deaths, only for me to turn around go god like and win the game AND STILL have them tell me to get cancer? Nah man, I&#039;m good.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to be done about people like them. The game attracts them and they are playing the most. Every game I get into I innately  think &quot;I&#039;m probably playing with the shitest type of people are on earth, better not say anything&quot; The LoL enviorment is toxic, from the ranked system to it&#039;s players. And playing LoL has probably made me a worse person  in game than ever lol. So i&#039;m done. I&#039;ll play here and there after watching Uber&#039;s should you play or Spazies epic moments. But I have no real desire to play this game. Thanks for all the Years Rito, you&#039;ve been good to me for the most part. Good luck to you summoners, may you continue to enjoy the game and find room _in your heart_ to deal with the players you will encounter. Because I don&#039;t, and I can&#039;t. RaidBoss down.","replies":[]}
