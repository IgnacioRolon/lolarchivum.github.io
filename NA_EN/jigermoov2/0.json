Since there is no key attached to them, the authentications is actually hardware dependent.  \nSo if you need to reinstall it the way Microsoft determines if your copy is genuine is by seeing if your hardware is the same as when you installed it. \n\nFor this reason when changing components, especially the motherboard windows will not authenticate your copy. Your best bet is to contact Microsoft support and tell them that your previous motherboard died and they should activate your copy of Windows.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-28T18:44:00.976+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your windows has an issue authenticating your copy.  This isn't something I'd be able to offer much insight on, and agree with DTN that contacting [support for Windows ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/)would be your best bet.  They would be the best venue to help dry up that watermark!  Good luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-28T18:37:35.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think one time when I upgraded and needed to activate Windows but lost the key, I called up their customer support and they activated it for me without any hassle. If they can't do that for you, you should probably try to get ahold of a cheap W7 key; I don't personally advise going about using 3rd party programs or registry hacks to trick it, though they do seem to exist.","replies":[]}]}
