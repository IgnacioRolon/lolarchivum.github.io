{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2017-06-15T13:30:42.285+0000","title":"Universe page and races","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"So I'm not sure how many of you noticed,but when we got the Vastaya-update they actually added a small race-info-box to the pages of the updated champs that tells us that they are indeed Vastaya(even if the Vastaya are technically not a single race)\nAnd if we click on said box,we come to a page about the Vastaya.\nFor those who have never seen the box,it is above the \"related champions\"-box\nhttp://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_GB/champion/rengar/\n\nSo I was wondering if we'll see more of these race-info-boxes in the future?\nIt'd be actually nice if eventually every champion would list their race on the universepage(though I guess a lot of champs would end up in some sort of \"other races\"-section) and eventually could even get a race-section,similar to the region section.\n\nAnd all this got me thinking about what races we have in LoL and I realized that it is sometimes actually hard to tell to which race a champion belongs to.\nBecause of this I made a list that sorts every champion by their race and I'd like to know your opinions about it.\n\n**Angels**\n{{champion:10}} {{champion:25}} \nSo it's kinda difficult to say if Kayle&amp;Morgana qualify as aspects or not, hence why I'm counting them seperately.\n\n**Animals**\n{{champion:350}} {{champion:133}} (valor only)\nIt's not really known if Yuumi is just a regular cat who somehow got magic powers or if she belongs to some kind of specific race of magical cats, so for now I simply settled on \"animal\" as a broader category for possible future animal-champs. Also while he isn't such a big part of her kit anymore Valor would also qualify for this category.\n\n**Ascended**\n{{champion:268}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:101}} \nThe ascended might have been human, but they became something else through the ascension ritual, hence why they don't count as humans anymore.\nAlso based on one of the lore tidbits,there are seemingly failed ascended known as Baccai.And while these aren't true ascended one could count them towards the ascended anyway,simply because they are close enough\n\n**Aspects of Targon**\n{{champion:80}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:142}} \nHonestly I'm not sure if the aspects should truly count as their own race or if they'd still qualify as human. (or heck there are some implications that they might be a form of ascended).\nObviously they wouldn't count as human if there was ever another case like old Pantheon, where the aspect was in complete control of the body, but the current ones could just as well qualify as humans.\n\n\n**Aurelion Sol and his siblings**\n{{champion:136}} \nAt first I considered counting Aurelion sol as a dragon or a celestial,but in the end he isn't really a dragon,he merely looks like one,it'd be like saying that a human-looking god is automatically a human.\nAnd the term celestial seems to refer to everything that comes from the space,as the targonian aspects,Bard and Soraka are all considered celestials,even though they are vastly different beings,so it isn't very well defined(at least for now).\n\n**Brackern**\n{{champion:72}} \nHonestly Skarner is likely the only brackern that we'll ever get,so I kinda doubt that the brackern will get their own page,but who knows?\n\n**Constructs**\n{{champion:53}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:54}} \nAt first I wanted to differentiate between robots and magical golems,but since the robots are also powered by magic I decided to put these together.\nOrianna is here because she had every part of her body replaced with machines,so her body is now 100%artificial and thus I'd say that she shouldn't be considered human anymore.\nFiddle could also turn out to be a magical construct,but thats thats just speculation at this point,so I didn't put him here.\nAnd now Shacos short bio says that he is a marionette that has gone rogue.\nMalphite is now a shard of a giant ixtaal-construct, which in turn would also mean that he is a magical construct too.\n\n**Darkin**\n{{champion:266}} {{champion:141}}(obviously just Rhaast) {{champion:110}} \nThe darkin got their own page already, making it easy to identify them.\n\n**Demigods**\n{{champion:34}} {{champion:516}} {{champion:106}} \nWe barely know what exactly defines a demigod and what doesn't,so there might be other champs who are secretly demigods(I think Kindred is/was at one point described as a demigod, so they might fit into this category too).\nThe aspects and ascended were also described as demigods,but the ascended merely resemble them and we don't know if the aspects are real demigods or if that was just a comparison.\n\n**Humans**\n{{champion:84}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:67}}{{champion:6}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:246}} {{champion:517}} \nHumans are ironically one of the least identifiable species in the whole game,simply because it is rather difficult to find out where we draw the line about what is still considered human and when you wouldn't be considered to be human anymore.I thought about making \"augmented\" their own race(which would have included Viktor,Camille,Urgot&amp;Gangplank),but in the end augments are essentially fance prostheses and we don't say in real life that people with prostheses aren't human anymore do we?\nMundo,Ryze,Lissandra and Yorick are also rather debateable,but overall I think they are still close enough to humans that they qualify as one.\nSimilarly there are some champs who you might see as humans that I didn't put onto this list.\n\n\n\n**Minotaurs**\n{{champion:12}} \nSince it was confirmed that Minotaurs are not Vastaya,they'd count as their own race.\n\n**Sentient Plants**\n{{champion:427}} {{champion:143}} \nSome probably wonder why Maokai isn't here,but in the end Maokai is the spirit that inhabits the tree,not the tree itself(his lore even says that he'll eventually shed his current form,so he isn't permanently bound to the tree)\n\n**Spirits**(not counting undead)\n{{champion:432}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:56}}  {{champion:223}} \nGoing by Shens lore demons are also considered spirits,hence why Nocturne(who is called a demon in the story \"for demacia,though that might have been a mistake of the demacians),Evelynn and Tahm Kench are also here, though in general I think that spirit might be a larger term describing multiple subspecies(demigods seem to be a kind of spirit too), so we could also give \"demons\" their own race-page.\nI didn't count the undead of the shadow isles here,becuase I felt like seperating physical and spectral undeads was kinda weird.\n\n\n**Trolls**\n{{champion:48}} \nNot much to say here.We all know that Trundle is a troll and he is our only confirmed Troll in the game(some speculate that Jax is one,but thats again speculation)\n\n**Undead**\n{{champion:9}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:412}}{{champion:555}} \nOverall we don't know for certain if Amumu is truly undead, he might just look like he is undead.\nElise might be undead as well,but its unknown if she is biologically still alive or not and Yorick is actually called the last survivor of the order,which means that he is still alive in some form.\nFiddlesticks current short bio says that he is someone who was brutally murdered,who went on to posess the scarecrow,so he'd count as another undead, but this will likely change with his VGU\n\n\n**Vastaya**\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:497}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:498}} {{champion:518}} \nNot much to say here as the universe page confirms that these 6 are indeed the only Vastaya in the game.\n\n**Voidborn**\n{{champion:31}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:161}} and maybe {{champion:96}} \nSo the first 4 all seem to be voidborn that were long enough in runeterra to settle for a physical shape.\nHowever Kog'maw does mention a \"daddy\",which could mean that he was actually not born from the void itself,but rather from another voidborn,which would make him a really powerful voidspawn instead.But at this point it is also possible that kog'maws dad is just going to end up retconned or that he refers to the void itself or the watchers as his dad. Not to mention that even if Kog'maw isn't truly voidborn he might end up in this category anyway, since it'd be easier to just lump him together with the other void monsters.\n\n**Void touched**\n{{champion:145}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:90}} \nChamps that were influenced by the void,but aren't born from the void itself\nNot sure if Kai'sa actually qualifies as \"touched by the void\",because she still seems to be herself,just with a void creature sitting on top of her skin.So I might change her to human eventually.\nJax is also heavily hinted to be someone that was corrupted by the void,as he does mention that Icathia is his home.\nThough in general these champs could be considered simply human as well.\n\n**Yeti**\n{{champion:20}} (willump)\nWell the Yeti have appearantly gone extinct, so I doubt that we'll ever see another one.\nHeck I feel like we could lump several of these \"1-champ\"-races into a group article called \"creatures of runeterra\" or something like that :/\n\n**Yordles**\n{{champion:42}}{{champion:105}}  {{champion:150}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:115}} \nAside from  Amumu it is pretty easy to say who is a yordle and who isn't.\nAnd now they confirmed that Fizz is a sea yordle,so I put him in here as well.\n\n**Other transformed Champs**\n{{champion:69}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:102}}  {{champion:19}} \nAll of these champs once belonged to another race,but have now become something else.Tbh,I think I could have just put them into some sort of \"other\"-category and there are likely some who'd put champs like Mundo or the iceborn in here too.\n\n**Unique/Unknown**\n{{champion:32}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:16}}  {{champion:33}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:154}} \nRammus might turn out to be a demigod, an ascended or really just a mutated armadillo.\nAnd with Amumu it is somewhat unclear if he is truly a yordle or if he even is undead to begin with.\nSoraka received a new lore, but it only says that she is a celestial being, so it's not entirely clear into what category she'd really fall. Is she an aspect? A celestial spirit? We don't know.\n\n\nSo that was my list,what do you think about it?Do you agree with my points?Do you disagree?Did I forget someone?","replies":[{"poster":"Digielf","date":"2017-06-15T13:41:08.210+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Shaco's real face is revealed in his Wild Card skin, his case is a little complicated but Kateychaos confirmed that its his canon face.

And I mean God-amount of power. They're demigods - one of most powerful beings on Runterra and sure they're not consider human anymore. They are synthesis between human and Aspects. I suggest to you using the 'race' - aspects to divide them from human. But use this word with meaning \"creature that is possessed/have aspect in them\". Like example : if you'll evere get to be possessed by a demon, others will call you \"demon\" but it wouldn't mean that you are fully demon.

And I mean God-amount of power. They&#x27;re demigods - one of most powerful beings on Runterra and sure they&#x27;re not consider human anymore. They are synthesis between human and Aspects. I suggest to you using the &#x27;race&#x27; - aspects to divide them from human. But use this word with meaning &quot;creature that is possessed/have aspect in them&quot;. Like example : if you&#x27;ll evere get to be possessed by a demon, others will call you &quot;demon&quot; but it wouldn&#x27;t mean that you are fully demon. And if it&#x27;ll grant you god-amount of power I woul not consider you fully human.\n> Priests do not possess a full amount of &#x27;God&#x27;. They do not have God _in_ them. They are just believers. But in that case Targonian squad _is_ Gods. Demigods atleast.\n> \n\n\nThe problem is that Leona,Diana and Taric are not the names of the aspects.These are the names of the humans that house the aspects.\nPantheon however is the name of the aspect,the name does not refer to the human vessel.\nThat means that Pantheon is an aspect,wheras Leona,Diana and Taric merely have an aspect within them.\nAnd thats why I put them into seperate groups.Because Leona still refers to a human.Sure she is a human with magic powers and an alien spirit within her,but her body wasn't transformed and she is still in control for the most part.\nShe is still herself,just with a partner inside her.\n\nSure she has special powers,but we are talking about a world where a child can be born with the abilities to shoot lasers,manipulate the earth or throw castles.\n\nThe fact that the aspect could take them over isn't really relvant,because in these moments,they wouldn't be Taric,Leona or Diana,they'd be their respective aspects.\n\nThe demon example you gave is actually pretty good as I would count the posessed as a human as long as he is in control and his body isn't deformed by the posession..\nOnce the demon takes over,they wouldn't be human anymore,they'd be a demon.\n\n\n> And they sure as hell not spirits.

Why? Because Pantheon has no aspect in him.He is the aspect.\n\nNo. Why do you think like that? There is no difference between him and Leona and co. They all have the same amount of  Aspects in them. Why would Pantheon differ? The only thing that differ between him and Leona and co is that Aspect of war do not let him have a free will. While Aspects of Sun, Moon and Protection decided to give human that their inhabit some free will.\n\n> But the important detail is,that the aspect doesn't do it,he leaves Leona,the human,in control.\n\nNo. She isn't in control. Aspect just let her have control. But if you let someone who you vessel have control and you could end it in any given time and gain full control back, i think, that you are in control. You are the main guy in that relationship.\nPantheon works exact same way. There is no evidence that he does this differently.\n\n> But the aspects do not control each of their moves this way.They could do that,but they chose not to.\n\nBut they do. They supervise (i guess it's the right word) all of actions that taken by their vessels. If Leona will try something than Aspect of the Sun doesn't want her to do, the Aspect would definitly end her free will and gain full control of her.\nThey do supervise - cause Aspect of Moon waited to the time when Diana was near all of the head priests in Temple of Solari and then took control fully wiping the head priests,\n\nLeona does have free will. Just for now. But her actions and decisions are supervised by Aspect of the sun. So she is not _really free_. So for me that type of 'creatures' should be divided in specific category.\n\nAbout demon example:\n> the humans that simply gain flashy powers from their demon,while the demon lets them do whatever they want.\n\nNo and that's the main thing. The demon does not let you do whatever you want. He let you do whatever suit him and if you don't obey he just gain fully control of you. Thus that make demon fully in charge.\n\n> Overall I think our big problem is that you see the vessel and their aspects as one character.\nWheras I think of Leona/Diana/Taric and their respective aspects as 2 characters that merely share a body.\n\nHow could you see them differently when Aspects have fully control of them, They are not fully humans, they are just vessels. Vessels that were human, thet looks almost like human, but do not have _free will_.\n\n\n**Secondly,**\n> Yeah,but their bodies weren't transform beyond what can be considered human.\n\nBut they were transformed! Not a much, but were transformed, therefore making them not so much humans. I just show you that statement below was false.\n> Sure she is a human with magic powers and an alien spirit within her,but her body wasn't transformed\n\n\n**About Aspects themselves.**\nWe just do not know are they spirits or not. There are no strong evidence yet. For example:\n> So you say they are not spirits,because they have a spiritform?\n\nThey do have spirit form, but for now all spirits and spirit-like or spirit-descended creatures like yordles all have physical foem you could interact with. You can interact with Tahm Kench and Noc. Demons and other spirits, moreover, does not need any vessels, while Aspects sure need 'em.\nSo i feel to just add them to spirit \"race\" is just wrong. They seem like different thing.\n\n**----In conclusion on Aspect theme----** - first of all, as i mentioned before I think all Targonian squad should be in ONE category, cause there is no seemingly difference between them. Between how they operates and etc,\nAnd I would not call them human. They are on the exact border between humans and \"race\" that you believes Aspects are in. I respect your decision to think that THE Aspects are spirits, although i do not think they are.\nBut Targonian squad is sure neither fully humans nor fully spirits. They are just in between, therefore I think they should have their own directory.\n\n**----On the celestial----**\nOkay, you convinced me. But this piece in main post - it's needed to be there.\n> And the term celestial seems to refer to everything that comes from the space,as the targonian aspects,Bard and Soraka are all considered celestials,even though they are vastly different beings.\n\n**----On yordles----**\nHere we just need agree to disagree :) There is no need in argue, we just need to wait for yordle lore-update. Cause there it will be clear are they full spirits or spirit-like race like Vastayas\n\n______________________\nAnd good job on Amumu edit :)\nalso, It's really nice and cool to see another lore-passionate person.
