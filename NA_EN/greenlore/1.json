Even without explicitly knowing about the iron revenant's search for secrets, we could theorize that he put her there and that she was there for a reason.\n\nWhat it truly is interesting is what Beatrice actually knows for her to be that valuable and powerful. \n\nIn order to retrieve her, Swain journeyed to the core of the Immortal Bastion. This is apparently described as a very risky and secretive task. \n\nI highly doubt that this perilous trip consisted in Swain physically finding a secret passage in the basement of the palace and proceeding to avoid a number of traps ala Indiana Jones.\n\nWhat if at the core of the immortal bastion there were the *gateway for mordekaiser's kingdom of afterlife*? *And Swain literally walked unnoticed among the dead to steal Beatrice directly from Mordekaiser's grasp?* We know Beatrice whispered to a death's door Swain through a crow and proposed him some sort of deal, that I am going to assume included Swain \"freeing\" her from Mordekaiser servitude. But Swain somehow tricked her in *his own* servitude. This would also explain Beatrice's powers of gathering the secrets of the recently passed away. She could have some sort of connection with the afterlife realm, so that she could talk to souls in the limbo before they faded as described in mordekaiser new story.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2019-06-04T19:57:11.457+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it was obvious that Morde was responsible for Beatrice being there, but we didn't know why he placed her there.\nNow we do know why she was there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velasan","date":"2019-06-04T21:35:46.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Little did you know Swain was the Indiana Jones of Noxus!{{champion:50}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-06-04T20:50:43.012+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is something that is confusing me.\n\nIn his new lore.... does Mordekaiser still have any connection to the Shadow Isles, or doesn't he?\nIn Universe, he is still listed as a Shadow Isles champion, but these are never mentioned in his new lore now.

He wasn't even a Shadow Isles champion in his previous lore, he was just using it as a launch pad for greater things.\n\nAnd also, just a note to your narrative folks - be careful of the constant shifting of the lore. It's part of what's making the comic book industry start to reel (aside from it being a paper medium), as people don't like having to constantly relearn and re-understand the world that was already fairly well established. It'd almost be better if you guys didn't do lore for high VGU-worthy champions prior to their VGUs, as it's not only double work, but you're also scrapping modernized lore that makes a lot of sense to replace it with brand new modernized lore. Mordekaiser is a good example of this, as his previously updated lore fit pretty seamlessly into the lore and spiderwebbed out to connect a lot of things together.","replies":[{"poster":"Camille FerrÃ¸s","date":"2019-06-04T23:01:33.926+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Please say the second part louder.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Poodle","date":"2019-06-05T04:55:45.346+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Amen!

Basically you are hereby canonizing *lime green* as the official *vengeful spirit* color in runeterra. Be careful, there's no going back from that.\n\nSo it is safe to assume that a benevolent spirit may appear of a different color... Like *rose pink*. Wonderful. I can't wait to die to figure out my color\n\nPS: I would have personally made the big step and definitely separate Moredekaiser from the \"Shadow Isles green\". A \"Noxian red\" would have been fitting in my opinion.
