They lied.&quot;\n>  &quot;Your spirit is stronger than their programming.&quot;\n> &quot;They cannot take our pasts from us.&quot;\n\nBased on these we can assume that some kind of organization(it can&#039;t be an individual since the word &quot;they&quot; is used) or more likely some sort of corporation lured the champs into the project with empty promises,seemingly trying to reprogram their minds in the process,while erasing their own memories(it is likely that they wanted to reprogram them in order to make them obedient soldiers)\nThis would explain why Yi has the memories of someone else in his mind(they are part of said program,but his own personality wasn&#039;t destroyed) and even why Zed was attacking the other project champs(because he hasn&#039;t broken free from his programming).\n\n----------------------------------\n**So how does PROJECT:Ashe fit into all this?**\nWell I think it becomes appearant when you look at these lines:\n> &quot;We aren&#039;t weapons, we&#039;re human beings.&quot;\n>  &quot;Freedom is ours.&quot;\n> &quot;This oppression will not last.&quot;\n> &quot;Join the resistance.&quot;\n> &quot;We will end their tyranny.&quot;\n\nThere are likely some more,but I think it is easy to understand the point:\nAshe is leading a resistance against the creators of the project line(or maybe even the society itself) and for this cause she tries to unite the project champs(the PROJECT:DISRUPTION site even says that she fights for unity).\n\nAnd this is why she was chosen for the legendary skin,because this role pretty much mirrors her role in the main-universe;)","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-07-13T17:58:50.964+0000","up_votes":73,"down_votes":5,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2016-07-13T19:34:46.664+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will we ever get Project: Ashe's full dance music?\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/577309793104175104/y2jIo9dq_bigger.png","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-07-13T20:30:36.568+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think that's all Brandon wrote, but I'll let him know people are lovin' it - perhaps he'll write some more >:)","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2016-07-13T20:35:10.274+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll buy that skin for the dance music alone! _Please remove any afk warnings while listening to it..._\n\nI did some Fraps ingame recording of it, and stuck it on repeat for 37 minutes afterwards.

Chemicalseb took over from that point and made some magical decisions and created a really cool beat with those elements.With the time that we had we were able to make a 3 bar loop work for Project Ashe's dance. So glad you love the loop, I am hoping we can re visit that loop and make it a song!  I am sure Chemicalseb would love to chime in on how he came up with the piece he did!\n\nTo answer the motivation behind Avarosa's VO processing, we had a rioter who wanted to play the part of the VO. The rioter was super excited and as she is not the talent we normally use for events like these I decided to use a little heavier processing than normal to help the thematic.  The processing was fairly simple but effective in masking the talent recorded. We used Cubase to modify the VO using pitch quantizing and straightening, which ended up sounding as you hear it now, minus a few other plugins! In short, GlaDos was not the intention, but kind of cool it got close!","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-07-14T08:23:51.371+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"*sigh*\n\nI'll have to add you to my list of people with cool names.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mini Cats","date":"2016-07-13T20:50:33.793+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Y5vka27T,comment-id=00070001000000000000,timestamp=2016-07-13T20:48:55.362+0000)\n>\n> Okay, so I asked Riot Sound Bear (Brandon, who did the sfx for Ashe) about it and he said it&#x27;s a remix of an upcoming piece of music.

Some power in this future setting built cyborg warriors in the image of ancient heroes and villains, and intended to use them as tools for their own ends. They intended to use some technological power to mimic the abilities of the originals, but as these PROJECT champions began to explore who their memories actually belonged to their powers grew and they developed techniques their counterparts once utilized. That last bit I thought up from the promos last year, where they detailed the origins of the champion's abilities through their tech except for their ultimates, which all had unknown origins. \n\nI dunno I could be totally off base, just something seems weird about the memories of these champions and the whole \"Don't trust false memories\" vibe from last year. It feels like the names these PROJECT people bear are of the people who they were intended to be made in to or something.","replies":[{"poster":"FloRaider42","date":"2016-07-13T17:52:01.135+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really interesting and fits with a lot of details.\nOnly problem seems to be \"They cannot take our pasts from us.\", but maybe that refers to their normal/real past that has been overwritten with the personality of the \"old\" champions.\n\nSo either the \"real\" champions have been upgraded and their memories have been tinkered with to create soldiers,\nor normal people in that AU got upgrades and implanted memories that turn them into the champions/weapons.\n\nI stick to 2 for the time being, since only humanoid champions with weapons have been released so far in the PROJECT line.","replies":[{"poster":"KeydiamX","date":"2016-07-13T21:11:46.771+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the second idea. It would also explain why certain champions aren't full metal (Leona, Ekko, Lucian): The person captured to become Leona looked like her, so they didn't need to replace much of her body. While other champions like Fiora needed a complete face reconstruction. \n\nAnd why don't they construct complete robots and feed them with memories? Well it is said that PROJECT is, \"the perfect fusion of one’s supernatural essence with advanced weaponry and body augmentation.\" Supernatural essence...I personally interprete that as the soul (after all magic and soul-stuff plays a role in LoL) so they need real persons which they turn into cyborgs to create perfect soldiers.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MrryZ","date":"2016-07-13T17:14:35.217+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ashe is also unity because her goal in her lore is too unite the different clans of the freljord and that is a large part of her theme.","replies":[]}]}
