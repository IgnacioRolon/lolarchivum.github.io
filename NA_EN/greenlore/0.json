It appears that individual Game Server that you were playing your game on experienced some issues, causing your game to crash and made it unable to reconnect to.  If this particular Game Server crashed, and no one reconnected back to the game, then the games on this server simply disappeared.  No rewards/penalties will be given, and it will be as if it was never played. \n\nWhen we see issues like this with individual Game Servers, we investigate in-depth to determine what happened and take steps to prevent this in the future.  Hopefully you haven't experienced anything like this since!","replies":[{"poster":"Rosa Parks","date":"2015-07-23T06:09:32.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! I know this is sorta late for this forum, but the problem is back and its preventing some friends and I from joining the game at all.\nGood thing is that i dont get penalties for this disconnect, but i still feel bad about leaving people to 4v5s!! :c its not fair for me nor them.\n\nEDIT: Nevermind, I just got leaverbuster for no reason because of this glitch :c...","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-01-30T23:38:29.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah thanks for clarification.\nI was a bit surprised that the client told me the game crashed and not simply that i lost connection.\n\nAnd no I didn't experience it again since then(in one game,my game suddenly froze though,but i was able to reconnect).\n\nI hope you find the source of this issue ;)","replies":[]}]}]}
