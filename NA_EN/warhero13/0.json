I hit the Silver Promotion Series but due to a bet I made, I stopped playing LoL for a month. I came back and was out of promo series but i still had 100 LP. Now I won 2 straight games getting +14 LP and +21 LP added on to 100 LP. Why am I not getting into Promo Series but have 100 LP? and why am I getting LP when I'm already at 100LP?\r\n\r\n(i attached the screen shot of my 100 LP)","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-25T20:45:26.517+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys,\n\nI read this thread and it definitely raised some eyebrows for me.  I performed an in-depth audit of the OP's account, and did confirm that this appears to be a visual bug.  Currently, there is an incredibly rare bug where instead of displaying you are in a promotion series, it simply displays you at 100 LP.  This typically occurs when someone enters a Promotion Series, and does not play for an extended period of time.\n\nHowever, upon further investigation, your issue is far weirder.  Please keep in mind that we recently implimented a change to how a promotion series works.  From the moment you enter your promo series, you have 28 days to complete it.  If you do not, you are booted out of your promotion series and you will need to re-qualify.  However, you entered your promotion series on August 8th, and therefore should be already kicked out of your promotion match.  However, when I investigated your account, it appears that you are still active in your promotion series, are are currently 2-0 in your series.\n\nGiven this, I strongly recommend that you keep playing games in your promotion series to see what happens, and whether you are promoted to Silver 5 if you win your next match.  If you do win, and are not promoted, or if you experience any further oddities with your Ranked Status, please do not hesitate to contact us here in Player Support so that we can investigate further.

Got into a best of 5 promotion, then quit during the summer because of internet issues. It \"demoted\" me to 100 LP, but it turns out I was still in promotion, even sent in a ticket at first because I thought it wasn't allowing me to get into promotion. So if you win your next game, it should promote you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2013-09-25T02:19:03.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would open a support ticket at support.leagueoflegends.com\n\nGood luck","replies":[]},{"poster":"its just andrew","date":"2013-09-25T02:09:12.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot help him out.
