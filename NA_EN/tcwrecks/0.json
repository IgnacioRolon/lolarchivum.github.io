I've played several more since and now I have a much better idea of how her kit fits together. (Hint: it fits together like a fucking masterpiece ;_;)\n\nPicture it like this: lots of champions have leaps or dashes or whatever. Kha'Zix has his E, for example. Rek'Sai's tunnels work exactly like that... except that if you go back to that location later (and the enemy hasn't destroyed the tunnel by walking on it - and they aren't Zyra seeds, either, you need to stand on the tunnel for a second or so before it collapses) then you can redo the jump for free. As many times as you like.\n\nThat's a bit of an oversimplification - the tunnel burrow is a little too slow to be considered a gapcloser - but it should give you an idea of how absurdly goddamn mobile she is.\n\nAnother strength is... Well, it's kind of tough to describe. When burrowed, she's fast. When she unburrows, she deals damage and knockup. And while burrowed, the autoattack command is replaced with the \"unburrow at this target\" command. It leads to W being sort of a lite version of Hecarim's E; you don't get nearly the same amount of speed, and you can't push people around, but the knockup gives you a window to pull off a LOT of autoattacks, and if you position yourself right and use your Q, you can deal a boatload of damage around your emergence location.\n\nShe's also a really safe counterjungler because of her Tremor Sense. Without wards or anything, you can tell if your quadrant of jungle is inhabited. You can, for example, sneak into baron pit, use your E to head to the enemy red buff, and then either steal it or (if you spot an enemy champion moving nearby) reuse your escape tunnel to get the hell out of dodge.\n\n...And, um, her ult is nice. Really nice.\n\nYou know that thing that happens where you gank a lane, and then the enemy champ in the opposite lane of the map pushes like crazy because they know you aren't coming for them? *That ain't no thing anymore.*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gray Fanchon","date":"2014-11-26T22:16:54.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is very helpful to know, thank you. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dreamspitter","date":"2014-11-26T08:19:44.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Not really.
