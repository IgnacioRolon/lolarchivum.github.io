Your network needs to be able to get that information, otherwise it can't display what champions you can choose. which can result in those sucky dodges when you never meant to. \n\nDo me a favor and update some of your settings using this [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide. The steps in there cover the basics, but do be sure to run through those no matter how trivial they might seem. It's always good to cover your bases, but let me know if this doesn't seem to help in the future.","replies":[]}]}
