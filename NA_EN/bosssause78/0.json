I used to run the game at about 90 FPS average and now it down to less than half and stutters a ton. If you have Curse you will know that Curse prompts you to download the latest version of DirectX for \"better performance\" or something along those lines.\n\nHowever after I installed it hoping for better gameplay I realized i lost half of my FPS and encountered way more lag and stutters. I have no idea what causes this as im not to smart with computers but this only started happening when I downloaded it. This just happened so it may cause problems for the rest of my computers performance. \n\nAs I said im not to smart with computers so im not sure how to uninstall DirectX or if that will solve the problem at all. Step by step guides will help immensely.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-29T18:22:46.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your computer may be having some problems interacting with the game and causing your FPS to drive.  This could be a result of your DirectX prompt, downloading the most recent shouldn't necessarily cause an issue.  I'm betting it's a coincidence, but we can take some steps to rule it out.  Go over our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide that will provide a series of instructions to get this setup.
