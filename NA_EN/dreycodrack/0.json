In a game, doing my best, my jungler and adc were flaming at me. Adc was saying they can&#039;t expect much from me and that I was a very bad player and pointing out every tiny mistake I made.  Why weren&#039;t you doing this or that or what i was building and not habong any support for me whatsoever.  Standing there flaming while I was warding bushes. Saying it&#039;s 4v5. At the end if the match I was the one to blame. With two players against me there wasn&#039;t much I can do to prevent the ban. At the end he was me calling mentalky slow and treating me like I was retarded. He was telling me to go back to normals, and I told him I play to get better then he said if you actually learn. I called him a %%%got and I&#039;m the one who got banned.\r\nHow the fuck am I supposed to play well with the team bombarding me with shit and attacking me? I only died 3 times that match. \r\nI&#039;m a great player if you check my stats. Not perfect, but I don&#039;t deserve a 14 day ban over one match with the majority of the team reporting me. Check that link and see how good I do in the majority of my games.\r\nHe was treating me like I&#039;m retarded and I stood up to him so I got banned. I got my main account, but come on. \r\nPlease improve the ban system riot. If two %%%gots report you in ranked your banned. I did not deserve the ban for standing up to people who were bullying me.","replies":[]}
