He is most likely taking everything in stride.  You can tell how all of the other Ascended that were in attendance had differing mindsets.\n\nBut yeah. Rhaast most likely doesn't mind his new body since he just received it (or is trying to take hold of it)  Right now, he just finds the situation amusing if not a bit trivial.","replies":[{"poster":"Tegash","date":"2018-06-30T02:44:59.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keeping in mind Rhaast's comments about Kayn's abilties (\"Oh! I **do** like this~\"), Kayn's body probably also suits him and **enhances** his power.

In real life too, in times of war, there are those who see the conflict as a means to an end, and others who just \"enjoy the moment\"; aside from the majority who just wants it to end as soon as possible, of course. \n\nAlso, Rhaast possibily had fewer hosts than Aatrox (I'm quite sure that it's stated that Kayn isn't really the first one to touch the scythe since forever). He's still in a phase where he can't yet see what sort of \"life\" he's going to face. \nAatrox on the other hand has \"seen it all\". He's been stuck in this \"grab host, decay, get locked, find another host\" cycle for longer, and no longer wants to go through it. Also, he probably has a stronger sense of pride and dignity than Rhaast. \n\nOr maybe Rhaast wants to end it all, as much as Aatrox does, but has his own twisted sense of humor. Who knows.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2018-06-29T23:10:29.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Ascended - Protectors of Shurima\"\n\nYou read any of Rhaast quotes now knowing this, dude's insane.
