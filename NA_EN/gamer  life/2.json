Riot clearly dont care about this game.\r\n\r\nThe support staff are useless, just same bullshit that comes out of the mouths \"ow we now how it feels\". How about get off your ass and start doing your job properly. Like pass feedback on and maybe show that you give a shit about the game!\r\n\r\nWhy are there console games with small teams of people work at some of the game, yet they reply to feedback they get on theere forums and pass on feedback to the right people. Then there is Riot Games who cant be assed, how make everything 10x harder then it should be. \r\n\r\nRiot games, get off your ass and start acting like you care or close you game down because It boring and it a fucking joke!","replies":[]}
