A few weeks ago, in order to fix a issue with chat loading, I opened ports 5000 - 5500 on my router, as suggested in the video i referenced in my OP. Doing so solved the chat issue, and I was able to play games without complications. To solve my new connection issue today, i simply deleted the entry I made last week changing the port settings. I have now played a few games and it seems to be working correctly. Thank you for your response!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr√•co","date":"2017-09-06T02:15:15.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Having this same issue, and when I click on your \"connection issue\" link nothing comes up, page is just blank. However, I have played several games today until just now I get this network issue bug. It is NOT on my end it is on your end, fix your shit RITO, this is uncalled for. I am using Google Chrome, and if its a browser issue, then fix that shit too, stop forcing people to use shitty internet exploder.\n\nEdit: Come to find out it is ONLY on this account as well, logged into my smurf and it loaded up just fine. Hmm interesting. It is client side.","replies":[]}]}]}
