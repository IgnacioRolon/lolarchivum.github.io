If so, how? Since you only get 4 gold from the minions, until you upgrade your jungle item.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-11-06T17:28:00.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could do mid with smite who has good waveclear and doesn't need a jungle item to clear small camps. A support jungler/invading jungler like Ivern, udyr. shaco or something like that. That would be my guess although idk how effective it would be but you could essentially wave clear mid do wraiths, wolves, scuttle while your jungle does the enemy camps or you can do enemy camps while waves are pushed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Super Sandmanne","date":"2018-11-06T17:18:25.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it's definitely still possible, but before the jungler finishes his jungle item he'll get hardly any hold from lane minions. He still gets full xp though so by the time that item is in his inventory he'll be a couple levels ahead.\n\nAlso pretty sure the changes didn't go through on treeline if you're into that.","replies":[]}]}
