However, as of lately I&#039;ve getting a lot of unpleasant teammates. Those who simply don&#039;t want to listen to the rest of the team to the usual toxicity that arises from game. I&#039;m not exaggerating when I say the number of times I&#039;ve had terrible teammates was astronomically higher than when I get good teammates. I do my best to win my laning phase and help in team fights. In the end, I&#039;m being punished quite harshly for a loss.  One of my most recent ranked games my team was left with an unfortunate player Captain Lose Elo who kept disconnecting and reconnecting the entire game. Leaving us outmanned and unable to do a remake. \r\n\r\nYea, I get it, sometimes it&#039;s just unavoidable and I should just shut up and get over it since it&#039;s just a game. You have to understand though that it&#039;s unfair and most importantly just makes the game terrible to play.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-02-11T01:50:27.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

Using an Elo system for a team game is absurd to begin. Those who play extremely poorly (or are trolling) will need to incur massive LP losses and so they can be quickly sent down to the lowest ranks, while those who manage to play remarkably well despite the inability of the rest of their team must have their losses mitigated or perhaps even gain some LP even if they lose.
