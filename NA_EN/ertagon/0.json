We live in a society where many want right this minute. They will never understand or realize that by playing the game the same way they did before that they are getting pretty much the same thing they were getting before when playing the game. You can't change a player like that. They either need to adapt or go play something else because no matter how much whining and bitching they do, it's going to stay this way. I personally like this new way because being allowed to level your account means you always have a goal to get to the next level.\n\nInstead of getting rewarded for each game, you get rewarded for each level. Technically you do get rewarded every game through experience but so many people are spoiled that it's not enough. In a free to play game even.","replies":[{"poster":"Kim Sombath","date":"2017-12-21T22:19:28.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In three week time I was able to get 6300 LP for doing bot game, with the new system I was able to amass.....A measly 3400 + 9 Garen Shard","replies":[{"poster":"Dragfin","date":"2017-12-22T13:08:35.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Im a KR Smurf,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TOU64v0r,comment-id=000000000002,timestamp=2017-12-21T22:19:28.202+0000)\n>\n> In three week time I was able to get 6300 LP for doing bot game, with the new system I was able to amass.....A measly 3400 + 9 Garen Shard\n\nAnd this means nothing.

W/e your math might say it's not game changing either way like you and people like you make it out to seem. The fact is, people want things RIGHT NOW. The BE that a person receives is static. The experience is based on time played now and before. IP (BE today) used to be based on time played. There is no math you can do that could possible compare todays rate of BE versus the old rate of IP because the old system was based on time played and only time played.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2017-12-20T18:40:03.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please share the link with that data IÂ´m very curios about that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Warios","date":"2017-12-20T17:16:56.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dragfin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TOU64v0r,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-12-20T17:12:19.270+0000)\n>\n> Math and todays gamers don&#x27;t get along.
