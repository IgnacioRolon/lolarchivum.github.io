If you have a moment, you can check out his new bio [here](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/champion/mordekaiser/)!\n\nI've updated his VO tags so Shadow Isles lines will no longer play for him, as a bug fix for Senna (thanks, Skin Spotlights {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} ). \n\nAs for Noxus, his empire was there _before_ Noxus. So a lot of lines about modern Noxus/Noxians wouldn't really make sense for him. To make it easier to write Noxus lines in the future, he'll have to go without that tag for VO, though I will note  he _ is_ labeled as a Noxian champ on Universe.\n\nHope that all makes sense! Sorry we keep accidentally shipping old canon. Correcting VO tags is on our pre-launch checklist moving forward.","replies":[{"poster":"Dormammu","date":"2019-10-30T22:58:01.004+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the clarifications.
