It's a major crapshoot, especially with a randomized game mode, but your best bet would be to band together with at least two other human players and queue as a team repeatedly. Even if you only get crappy champ choices, the team coordination alone should let you reliably win enough games to advance to an MMR where bots stop appearing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Papa Andrei","date":"2017-09-21T05:28:37.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you have higher than B5 ELO, you won't ever see them.","replies":[{"poster":"Jkrexx","date":"2017-09-21T17:31:21.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Untrue.

These botted accounts are really only for leveling up, so you only see them while leveling up. Once you hit 30, more often than not youll just find other level 30 accounts which mainly consist of ARAM-only player.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zaryelle","date":"2017-09-20T20:04:08.798+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're worse than new players they don't even use skills sometimes they'll just dive.
