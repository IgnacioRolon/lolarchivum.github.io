I am new to posting on boards and I in no way mean to offend anyone and I hope that this will generate a real discussion about toxic behaviors.\r\n\r\nI will be telling two stories today; mine and my husbands. I apologize for the length of this post though I feel it is necessary as there is never a face put to the problem; now there are two. I am new to League. I am a bronze player and with all jokes aside, I understand I am not the most knowledgeable about the game. I do however, have a large amount of knowledge with depression and anxiety. I remember watching a video, one of the spotlights Riot featured about a boy who used league as his lifeline to handle his depression. This game was a way for him to deal with his stress. I wanted to believe there was a community of warm, generous, and loving people that existed in this game. I was highly mistaken. This is where my husband comes in. He has played league since season 2, he has put over 2500 hours into this game and well over a few hundred dollars, he&rsquo;s been bronze and been high plat. I know I sound as if I am bragging, but I want you to understand how long he has been in this and how much has been invested in this for him. I decided to play support, since he was an ADC main it seemed the natural choice. Things seemed fun at first, playing with him was generally great. I learned what to do and we spent time together. Then ADC&rsquo;s started to decline, they were useless and my husband wanted to try other roles. I was encouraged to play other roles as well. That&rsquo;s when things become bad. Since I had played with my husband in a role he was great at, things were fine. When we played roles, we weren&rsquo;t great at we got made fun of. At first it was just whatever but it progressed. I want to detail two experiences.\r\n\r\n**_1 The Jungler_**\r\n\r\nMy husband has started learned top lane, myself mid. We haven&rsquo;t played in a while since our main roles aren&rsquo;t very good. We decided to play today, and today is the day we quit league. We get into champ select and all goes well, a little confusion for our jungler on not knowing who to pick. He settles on Voli. We get into game and I play Annie mid and my husband Riven Top. We aren&rsquo;t doing bad, but not as well as we could either. It&rsquo;s a normal game so who cares right? Wrong. We both separately asked for the assistance of our jungler and both times something goes wrong. I am not blaming our jungler, I want to make that clear. The ganks went south and I ended up dying as well as my husband when Voli attempted to assist us. The part that makes me angry is the comments that ensued. Voli says he&rsquo;s &ldquo;Just rusty&rdquo; okay, it happens I am too. I picked Annie, playing into a Veigar, it&rsquo;s not going well Veigar got an early kill on me and when our gank went south he got a second. I&rsquo;m 0 for 2. Well, Voli pings me to go in I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m low on mana and Veigar can one shot me at this point, it&rsquo;s clear he knows what he is doing. Voli dies, and I get pinged, and pinged even more. Voli ask &ldquo;Yo wtf why&rsquo;d you do that&rdquo; like somehow that was solely my fault, maybe it was. Who knows. The game ensues and, of course, Veigar is massively fed and we lose. Oh well. Post-Game screen the ADC, Cait, types &ldquo;Thanks a lot Annie f-ing feeding the Veigar.&rdquo; Reported. But It doesn&rsquo;t stop there &ldquo;Go back to bots you f-ing c-nt.&rdquo; The report was sent but I know nothing will happen. No one came to my defense, no one else reported this person. Why should they? What&rsquo;s their incentive too? I was bad, she is mad that I lost her game for her. What can they do to fix it? The report doesn&rsquo;t make me feel better, doesn&rsquo;t make me feel like I am proud to be a member of a community that allows this type of behavior.\r\n\r\n**_2 The Pre-Game Champ Select_**\r\n\r\nThis followed exactly after the Voli game. I preface this with I know what I did was flat out WRONG. What they did was as well. I get to champ select with my husband. Okay blow it off, it doesn&rsquo;t matter though I am still hurt at the awful things said of me simply because I didn&rsquo;t win a video game. This is a fresh start though, I&rsquo;ll try. I hover Corki, my husband Riven. Then, the ADC and Support who are obviously duo-ed together ban my husband&rsquo;s champ, Riven. I type asking why as does my husband I say &ldquo;Yo wtf, he had it hovered.&rdquo; The support types back &ldquo;Oh, did he?&rdquo; and then bans Corki, who I have hovered. Next in chat &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice.&rdquo;  I am furious how Is this allowed? How am I supposed to play with people who enjoy hurting others simply because it&rsquo;s funny? So, I pick Janna and my husband picked Azir since the ADC had hovered Azir. Now they are angry, the jungler gets involved saying they banned our champs on &ldquo;accident&rdquo; it wasn&rsquo;t intentional. Oh? I suppose it&rsquo;s a trio makes sense as to why his champ didn&rsquo;t get banned. Again, I understand I was in the wrong and I admit that. I should have picked another champ and moved on. We get in game since I am forced to play with these people or I have to suffer a dodge timer because I didn&rsquo;t want to play with two people who enjoy hurting others for fun. In game they flame, I int, it&rsquo;s a mess. They call me names such as &ldquo;C- nt&rdquo; &ldquo;B-tch&rdquo; and many others. One even said I deserved to die for what I did. Now, tell me is that okay? Is it true that I deserved to die because I picked a bad champion? Now, we both know it was intentional, but think for a minute? What if it wasn&rsquo;t what if I was new and thought this champion looked cool, and wanted to try her? Do I deserve to die then? We get in post-game where I am called numerous things and one person even types &ldquo;Go back to bots and then KYS.&rdquo; Now, both me and my husband reported these people but who do you think will get a punishment? I know I got reported, it was made very clear by the three on that team. I was subject to rude and unjust comments simply because of two people wanting to be rude, Is that fair? Is that ok? I could have dodged yeah, and then got penalized for dodging. This could have been fixed. I believe if there was an ability to report a player before going into a game, then maybe I&rsquo;d have been spared those awful things. And maybe, you&rsquo;d still have two players.\r\n\r\nI don&rsquo;t want this to focus on who was right and who was wrong. I want to be transparent. I understand that I was in the wrong for acting how I did. I just wish that Riot would foster a community that supports helping instead of hurting people. I know I mentioned it before, but please think on this. A Pre-Game report system so that if something goes wrong, a good player doesn&rsquo;t have to be penalized for not wanting to spend at least the next 20 minutes playing with people they don&rsquo;t want to play with. I don&rsquo;t know the logistics for it, or how it should work. I just think this. You ban a champion your team has hovered? Not Okay. You insta-lock a champion because you didn&rsquo;t get your role? Not okay. Rude comments? Not okay. I believe if the **_MASS MAJORITY_** vote that you are not good to play with then you should be the one who &ldquo;dodges&rdquo; and gets a wait timer. That should be automatic. I know that having people qued makes this more complicated but I don&rsquo;t have all the answers, just a suggestion. I hope this suggestion will not only allow for an escape in a situation you don&rsquo;t want to be in, but also foster better behavior for players.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-04-11T00:33:44.896+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":6,"body":"Thanks for taking the time to write this up.\n\nYour comments do not fall on deaf ears.","replies":[{"poster":"GamblerOfLives","date":"2017-04-11T01:06:59.289+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":15,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=c28m6jWE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-04-11T00:33:44.896+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for taking the time to write this up.\n> \n> Your comments do not fall on deaf ears.\n\nboth should get punished:).  they broke the rules too:)..and now, they are mad, bcs they got reported (for a legit reason):))","replies":[{"poster":"Redeemed Vyrdaes","date":"2017-04-11T01:24:22.125+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"First game they didn't break any rules at all, they just had a bad game.

I just believe that those people don't deserve to be completely left alone simply because they didn't do something during or after the game. What they did was intentional, and toxic. There is no way around that. What I did was too, but the funny thing is the only person I know of who was banned was my husband. He's played for 6 years has hundreds of honors in all categories and never been reprimanded in the entire game, yet he got chat banned for 5 lines in the second game only.

Exact same reason. I never queue with less than one other trusted friend with me. Even then, the other 3 might still be toxic. Riot's party boosts were great, getting players to queue together for less toxic results. Perhaps this could be permanent, but for XP instead?\n\nAlso, this pre-game report system NEEDS to be implemented somehow; also a way to \"dodge\" a game due to bad player behaviour without penalty. There have already been hundreds of thousands, possibly even millions of reports about bots in ARAM and TT. If this system was implemented, people could leave champ select while reporting the offender WITHOUT getting a Leaverbuster and WITHOUT being forced to play with the offender.\n\nIn summary, the current system forces you to either get a Leaverbuster or to play with the toxic person/bot. There should be a third option.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2017-04-11T18:54:06.911+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've been saying it for years, we need a report feature in champ select.

I hope you take these statistics to heart and learn how to foster a better and brighter community than allowing these problems to go unanswered because your version of bubble-wrapped is others version of justice.

And showing the troll that you are affected only feeds them and confirms the success of such an offense, basically aiding them in using it in the future. If it were a world full of dying pets, we would all be telling ppl I hope your dog dies a slow and painful death. So anyway, the kys being the trend right now, it is thrown around way too often and you should really take it VERY lightly, as it is too general and too impersonal and it will be replaced some day by the next gen, as 'fk u' and 'go fk urself' and 'fk yo mama' have been replaced, as well.\n\nOntopic, don't try to play right after a bad experience, and don't fight fire with fire. I'm no saint myself, I can respond in a toxic manner in my own defense at times, but have been heavily muting recently. Picking someone else's champ, on the other hand,  is straight trolling and well... not ok. And neither is intentionally feeding. That's reportable and bannable.\n\nYour suggestion for a pre game report system has been posted before, and I fully support it, it is definitely needed. I have also suggested at least a warning for those banning intent pick champs, cus I'm tired of those lame excuses like 'oh sry wasnt watching'. The troll should be the one dodging, not me. Because even if we do have other champs that we learned to fill that role, for one: the ban is wasted, and second: you're still stuck with a person clearly intending to ruin your experience.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2017-04-13T13:19:55.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"dear OP, \n\nI don't want to be rude and tell you to act like the grown up that you obviously are. However this game is characterized by you having to get along with strangers and they are not always nice and for a couple of years now we can see that there's no magic way of making them nice.\n\nI am assuming you can take it because hey you are married so obviously there's that life thing you can manage alright and I get your point this game should maybe be ok to be an escape from life and not a piece of controlled exposure to troll. \n\nBut that just is not how it works, some people are just jerks online and you gotta deal with them. I understand you don't wanna so you're taking your head out of the oven and that's fine. But it's important to understand that so far there isn't really any kind of solution. There's no policy that can be implemented that will completely 'de-jerk' the game. \n\nNow with respect to this specific game that made you so upset. I do not understand your objection to dodging. I mean I get the idea of holding to the principle of objecting to being punished. What I don't get is why you get the idea that the case is you specifically being punished for not wanting to entertain a bunch of jerks. \n\nor alternatively if your mindset is that you're gonna hold your head high and stand your ground because of your principles, why does this not also come with the fortitude to shrug off these petty insults?\n\nI think you really could benefit from changing your mindset on this matter. I mean if you don't have this idea of you being punished for nothing and the whole situation being unjust, what is 5 minutes of drinking a hot cup of cocoa with your husband which you love, compared to 20 minutes in jerks-'R-us town?\n\nSo to you I propose the following mindset: Dodges are fine and free and if you don't want to play with a bunch of A-holes, don't. Now there's the sit-in-the-corner-cool-down timer. That's not punishing you. It's there to make sure other people don't dodge 24/7 to rig their games whenever they are against counters or with bad compositions or when Yasuo is banned.\n\nYou just have to sit it out for 5 minutes because some Yasuo OTP will dodge 24/7 if the annoyance timer isn't there. It's not you who is punished its that Yasuo OTP over there you just have to share in his annoyance because of a technical difficulty the system has in distinguishing you from him. \n\nAnd you can live with it because the punishment is not severe, and ALSO because you want justice to be done to that A-hole Yasuo OTP that keeps making everybody suffer long queue times.  \n\nIn addition, doing the right thing should not outright exonerate you of the consequences. I think doing the right thing is worthy of applaud. But so is paying whatever price this entails. \n\nI offer you in addition this additional mindset for when you don't want to dodge: don't get mad. **Get even. **Get into the game of trolling harder than the other guy. They want to get a reaction out of you? make them rage and cry: It's FUN!\n\noh i don't mean it like this, but actually i do. make the game into a super fun time zone where you try out weird shit like support AP tryndemare with ghost and smite. And then rile them up in chat with such gems as \"support trynd doing better than you\" and \"it's legit strat i saw it on youtube\". Learning is fun. Chatting with your husband at the expense of these three mooks is also fun. Turning it all into a big joke is mega fun.\n\nWhen you meet a troll, don't get mad.\nGet Even:\nbe of the following mindset: I troll harder. I troll better.

I want to stress that **_I in no way think the game can be \"de-jerked\"_** I just don't understand how this is fair. Its not that I have a problem with dodging because I don't. The problem is that I am subject to the dodge timer and those people just get to keep going on with what they are doing with no punishment. Its the same principle of people being help hostage in champ select. They get put in a role they don't want, like support, and then insta-lock lee sin and take smite. That is Just not okay, because now someone has to dodge and they  get away with it, or we have to play with a lee sin who is going to jungle because that's what he wanted, and there's nothing we can do about it until the game is over to report them.\n\nThe problem with getting even is that it can also be seen as trolling and I don't want to ruin my other team members game because one person did something that should be reported. Fighting fire with fire doesn't really work in most cases, and that actually got my husband chat restricted. I think it is wrong that there is no punishment for these people. and Riot consistently does nothing about it other than sending a generic email about using the report feature and being a good little summoner, and that's simply not okay. The upkeep of the community that they foster should not fall on the ever-changing emotions of teenagers. (Not that every player is one, but most players I know of are in the late teens early 20s).  I believe that the ability to report someone shouldn't be given to you after they have caused as much damage as possible. Like being able to report someone is a privilege. The problem with dodging, is that Riot isn't even transparent about it. They say on twitter to dodge if someone holds your game hostage, okay so how do I report them? When I've sent in support tickets to report people they literally say there's nothing they can do,  to use the report feature (Well, I can't do that if I dodge) and to not dodge as it breaks the rules (was posted about on Reddit a while back). \n\nI don't want to de-jerk the game I just want it to allow for new players to be able to have fun in more than 1 in 10 games. I have found that league is only enjoyable if you are extremely good and high-elo, or if you play with a group of people ( 3 is the best I've found). I think I should be able to have an enjoyable solo experience, without being required to be emotionally hardened so that rude and down right disrespectful comments don't get to me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nalisai","date":"2017-04-11T13:04:38.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There IS a way to deal with this, but unfortunately it's a slow and painful process.
