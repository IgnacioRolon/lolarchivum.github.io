This causes them to automatically be declined because I was never able to click accept in the first place because it never showed up. I now have a 15 minute penalty for declining too many queues.. Is there any way to fix this? I will usually receive a message saying \"Active Game not Found\" also.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T22:29:54.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client is not establishing a solid connection to the PvP.net servers, which are the ones that notify you of queues and sync your actions to the matchmaking servers.
