Sometimes it's just freeze (screen is freezing for a moment, also sound is \"bzz-ing\", then it backs to normal. Sometimes sound backs to normal, I can hear the game in the background, but I have \"no signal\" from my monitor. Nothing I can do then, just shut down my PC and turn on again.\nAlso I had few times that kind of crash, but then the message appeared \"lol.exe has been blocked by your graphic card/driver\".\nI have no clue why is that happening. I tried literally everything;\n\nWindows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10\nNo drivers at all\nFully updated drivers\nRegedit edits\nI even unistalled my Realtek sound driver, because some people were saying it might collide with NVIDIA audio driver.\n\nHere is pretty similar problem as I have\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=102362\n\nMy PC specs;\n\nGTX960\ni5 4460 3.2\n8GB RAM\nMSI H87-G43\nSSD 120GB + HDD 1TB\n\nIt happens pretty much in every single game. Impossible for me to play, because I DC, then I have to restart my PC and comeback to game.\n\nFUN FACT: It happens only in LEAGUE! I can play other games such as Overwatch, GTA5, Assasins Creed on nearly ultra details, never got a single crash. So I don't think it's hardware problem or overheating.\n\nPlease, for god sake somebody help me. I really want to play one single game without any problems. :(\n\nEDIT: Don't know how to attach file on this forum, so I uploaded my Logs on zippyshare.\n\nhttp://www13.zippyshare.com/v/4HWkVW9I/file.html","replies":[{"poster":"MarshmallowBob","date":"2016-06-09T19:40:16.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, I'm sorry to hear that you're crashing in League. There's a few variables I'd like to ask about that should help clear up what's going on.\n\nIs League installed on your SSD or HDD? What about your other games? If League is installed on a different drive than the other games you play, then you may be having an issue with the drive. Try installing it to the other drive to see if that helps.\n\nIf that's not the case, let me know and I'll offer a few other suggestions -- this is just my initial thought.","replies":[{"poster":"WAZOn","date":"2016-06-09T19:53:51.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only have my system on SSD, rest of the programs/games are on HDD.\nAnd like I said before, League is the only game that ever crashes. GTA5, Overwatch, World of Tanks, Assasins Creed, Hearthstone and other games are working without any problem.\nI have these crashes since I bought my brand new PC. On my old computer I had no problems. At the beginning I thought it might be because of NVIDIA drivers or something, but after quick research some people with Radeon cards also seem to have the same problem.\nBtw, I posted zippyshare link to my Logs, feel free to check them if there is anything wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"MarshmallowBob","date":"2016-06-09T21:02:40.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the additional insight into your configuration. I'm assuming that the OS upgrades didn't touch the other drive, so the location of the League installation didn't change throughout.\n\nJust in case the second drive is having issues on the sector where League is installed, I'd say try installing it to your SSD to see if you're still crashing. This will at least eliminate a few possibilities and help me focus on more accurate next steps to try.","replies":[{"poster":"WAZOn","date":"2016-06-09T21:38:24.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I changed my OS, I format both discs, HDD and SSD. \nI've already tried installing League on SSD and nothing has changed.

I looked through your logs, and I don't see anything irregular.\n\nI checked through your game logs and it looks like the correct graphics card is being used, and your framerate is generally stable. Generally with buzzing, black screens, and low level/weird errors, we're looking at a potential hardware problem. \n\nHave you run any stress tests on your graphics card (such as furmark) or a memory test on your RAM (built into Win 10, just type \"Memory\" into the start menu\") to eliminate all possible variables?\n\nI know this is a stretch, but if you have a spare graphics card handy, it might be worth trying to play on that and see if you have the same issue.","replies":[{"poster":"WAZOn","date":"2016-06-10T21:06:15.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you see the screenshot?
