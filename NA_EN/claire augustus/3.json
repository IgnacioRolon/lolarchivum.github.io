I can&#039;t get the chests for free because I was chat restricted in the past, but I&#039;ve bought the bundle stuff. I bought 32 crates so far, and I got one gem, a decent amount of skins, and like ~5 champions in my last batch after already owning them all. I decided to reroll 3 for the heck of it to see what would happen, and I just got a Hecarim shard. So, that sucks.\r\n\r\nAnyway, be careful people who have all of the champions.","replies":[]}
