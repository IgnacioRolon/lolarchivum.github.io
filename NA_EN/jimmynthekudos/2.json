I think he's a great caster and I hope they keep him around either in the EU or NA after this whole Deficio thing gets sorted out.  Chemistry between casters isn't made in an instant and if I remember right Deficio had a slow start to casting last season as well.  Krepo is incredibly knowledgeable and brings a lot to the table.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azmoran","date":"2015-06-05T03:25:34.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya, with Deficio out they are doing their best.","replies":[]}]}
