I knew ahead of time that Oathsworn is a permanent ability, but i could not anticipate the player to go AFK.  With {{champion:19}} AFK i basically lost an entire ability out of my kit.  \r\n\r\nMy question is, since the game is able to recognize AFK players (as indicated by the match results screen where the X appears over the player icon), is there any way to implement a minor fix to allow players to purchase a second {{item:3599}}  and reassign Oathsworn when the first player goes AFK?  (as an anti-abuse mechanic you could have it auto-reassign to the first Oathsworn if they ever reconnect)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-23T21:05:54.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea that's happened to me a couple times as well.

Also, what about when they go afk after the 3min mark?  Like when someone thinks the game is unwinnable and gives up halfway through.\n\np.s. i know this is a super late reply.  i don't get on the forums much.  sorry.","replies":[]}]}]}
