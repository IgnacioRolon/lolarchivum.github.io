Support has the least amount of gold to spare, harder to carry with them, and people always like to blame them all the time. Jungle is less forgiving now. Next is top lane because of how far away they are from everyone else, if you tp anywhere else you HAVE to get something out of it, otherwise you'll just be set behind. After top is Mid since they need to roam and start snowballing to get others snowballing. Last is ADC, let's be real here, ADC literally has a role specifically made to make sure they don't die. No one is watching the jungler's back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kirbyzama","date":"2015-01-04T06:53:01.656+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay Honestly this comes down to the type of player and what they are good at player. Lets go over each role:\n\nTop- This lane is really easy in terms of game knowledge needed and mechanics required but if you only play mid or adc you learn how to harass but not trade properly. This lane is the most important one to be a good laner in as you can't roam for your kills like mid nor do you have the help of a support. I would still say its the easiest lane to play but its the hardest to carry a game from. Honestly my worst role.\n\nMid- requires mechanical knowledge to play proficiently and game knowledge to snowball other lanes with roams. However its easy to carry from because of the impact mid has on map control. Win mid lane every game? You will win a lot of games. that isn't assured in top.\n\nJungle-Easily the most game knowledge based role. You act basically as the shot caller of the team. You dictate when to do drag, baron, and often when towers go down with ganks. However most junglers aren't mechanically intensive and requires little in the way one on one outplaying or even farming skills. I would still say this is the hardest role but very rewarding.\n\nADC- The exact opposite of the jungle the adc is all about mechanics. Pretty hard to carry from without them. Sure you can say all they do is right-click but if you tried to just right-click and let go you would die a lot. You get focused fed or not. You play the game with a target on your back and more often than not can't solo anyone or anything for most of the game. You also can't build defense to survive a losing lane or you will dig a deeper hole. If your team is behind and can't defend you can't split push like a top or mid  because you will die. However you have the damage so if you have one competent player to peel you will destroy towers dragons and teamfights and ultimately the nexus. Honestly this role is a variable difficulty it is the hardest to play with bad teammates or from behind but by far the easiest when things go well. \n\nSupports- Like the adc these guys have variable difficulty. A great support can make a bad adc a great one and a bad support can make a great adc terrible. This effect works for almost everyone in the game. The support more or less makes everything better. If your team has nothing going for it to begin with your thresh hook will just kill everyone. Now everybody doesn't have to win for a support to win but people need to at least understand how to work off you. Supports can also carry with the vision game which requires a lot of game knowledge to really get down as well. This however can be countered by the enemy pretty well. \n\nAlso adcs and supports both have to deal with the soloQ lottery in lane where they have to work together which can either make things easier or harder","replies":[]},{"poster":"DWT12345","date":"2015-01-04T02:29:42.745+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"depends.

And yes because your mechanics do have to be on point to be an ADC you do have some challenges but I'm sorry playing that role is not that hard.**\n\nSupports are typically people who like being helpful, so when they have to save their ADC's ass every 10 seconds they take that as part of their job and they assume their role is easy when it's actually very hard. You essentially have to control 2 enemy champions, take the skillshots so your ADC doesn't have to. And react to anything your ADC does.\n\n**Jungler's are really only there to have fun and or win. It's one of the two, either the jungler is a very serious player who will get very angry if they mess up a play, or if they get counter ganked. Sometimes they will just laugh shit off so it's a mix of a very very hard role due to having to manage all other lanes and your buffs. For some people it just doesn't seem that difficult as long as you can multi task.**\n\nMid's typically have any easy time. There's never really any stress involved unless they get ganked often. But it's usually a role for the more competitive players so they can get stressed if they start losing.\n\n**Top lane is easy or hard depending on how you play. If you play a \"solo\" top lane, which means not bothering to help your team at all and acting as if they don't exists whal you stomp your enemy Mundo into the floor going 21/0. Then it's really easy. But if you play top lane the \"team\" way. Then you're going to be teleporting all the time, roaming to mid lane for ganks and kills. And trying to manage your own lane at the same time to make sure you don't lose your turret.**\n\nThat's pretty much the rundown.\n\nIn my opinion, Support is typically the hardest role.

You need to not only keep up in farm you need to try to deny them as much farm as possible and take out the most important turret lane while defending the most important lane. The only time the enemy laner is absent from that is when they are dead or helping another lane. *As a mid laner*, you are just as responsible to help out your other lanes and the jungle when they need it as well as *winning your lane*. \n\nLikewise the jungle needs to ensure that they control the jungle, which while not as direct with the danger, they don't get allied minions to help them. They also need to gank all the lanes, and secure the most important buffs. They, along with the mid lane, need to be the biggest team player and the biggest warder outside of the support, but unlike the support, they have a more direct impact on which way the game swings, whereas the support gets 1 objective: help the ADC acheive lategame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sooko","date":"2015-02-28T22:34:17.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungle: There are nine retards in your game that will hate your guts no matter what you do. Jungle camps are on steroids and winning vs them is harder than beating a Mammoth as a Tosa in Tokyo Jungle. You have to ward, learn how to smite, change your upgrade depending on your situation (like old Viktor) and there is Shaco and Lee Sin to deal with.\n\nSupport: There is one retard in your team that will hate you for anything you miss, while all he does is either going too aggressively and dying, or farming while you go 1v2. Occasionally, said retard is actually a good player, so that might chill you out a bit. You have to ward, land skill-shots, protect a retard all day, mute said retard when he dashes offensively instead of defensively and blames you for dying, and you have to put up with Blitz/Leona/Thresh in lane.\n\nTop Lane: There is one retard on the enemy team. That's it. Match up is everything. Jungler won't give a damn about you due to how irrelevant top lane usually is compared to the other flashy lanes. If you go Tryndamere vs Teemo, you lose and that's it. If you go GP vs Panth, you lose. If you go anything melee vs Vayne or Kalista, you might as well just go support and help your jungler. You have to lane vs Fiora and Teemo, so I guess that is pretty annoying as well. Not to mention getting kited to death most of the times.\n\nMid Lane: Immobile mage: You have to deal with the broken mobility creep enforced in the meta. You are part of a weakened race that for some reason, still uses mana, while the enemy Yasuo/Zed spams his crap without any backlash. You are usually the first to get ganked due to your mobility, and if you are skill-shot reliant then my condolences because you are wasting mana in 6/10 of your skillshots at least. I guess it is difficult if you are against enemies with complete upper hand on you, plus relying on a scumbag Lee Sin that for some reason always keeps blue to himself in a few games also ruins it a little.\n\nMid Lane: Mobile assassin: You feel like you outplay nearly anything that moves, you are nearly impossible to gank, and you have some sort of toxic mobility that I, as a salty former Veigar main, completely despise (I don't see any 0.75 delay on blinks, Riot!). Nowadays, waveclear isn't your weakness anymore as you can do it like most mages, but point-and-click CC is, which is the reason why Riot is giving \"counterplay\" to so many champions. Lets hope Annie and Taric survive your genocides. I guess you have to deal with Zhonya's and disengage comps (and I hate those too). I don't give you bonus credits for match-ups because you are the most annoying thing to go against in mid lane.\n\nADC: According to you, there is another retard that doesn't ward, peel or CC anything, and so it is his fault that you are 0/4. You right click minions and pretend Vayne is the hardest champion in the game (yeah I know who you are). You might also think kiting an Udyr with Kalista is, for whatever illusion you have, a challenge. When you do decide to fight, first you have a snack, eating a Thresh hook in the face and getting a couple of Corki's auto-attacks in the face. In teamfights, your skill-cap is now highly increased (even I admit that), but taking in account tanks blow up so easily, I still think that lifestealing off the closest target is by no means the hardest thing in the game. Also, you are very likely to think every kill belongs to you and duo often and blame the jungler for not camping your lane and getting CS himself.\n\nJungle wins, Support comes in second, the rest is pretty much the same.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2015-02-28T22:17:38.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To learn: jungle.\n\nTo excel in mechanically: ADC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OhOkYeah","date":"2015-02-28T22:15:30.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungle because it's too hard on most jungle champs, and even the top jungle champs can get behind if they don't make big plays and get more kills early on. As support I can be behind on most support champs and do fine.\n\nMid is the easiest since you just have to not die. Your only job is to not die early. And you have team mates all around you for support. ADC is second easiest because you also just to not die, but there's more pressure to do more than hug the turret. Top is third since you have to make sure to help the team while not being away from top so long that you lose a tower. Hopefully they don't need you for dragon. At least you won't get blamed for anything unless you feed. Support is 4th easiest because unless you play a tanky support, the enemy team will see you as a free kill at all times if your ADC is sucking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Difu","date":"2015-02-28T22:06:48.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to say that both Support and Junglers are the toughest roles.
