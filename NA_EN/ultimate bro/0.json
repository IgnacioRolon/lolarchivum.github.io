However, this also did reset my settings for attack-moving. You can probably imagine how much of a pain in the *** this is for an adc main!\r\n\r\nThe problem is not that I am not able to attack move, but that when I attack move, I attack the target closest to me, and not the target the closest to where I clicked my cursor. It used to do that before the reset.\r\n\r\nWhen I am kiting in a fight, or last hitting minons, I often attack the wrong target when attack moving now. I will attach a screenshot of my key bindings, and I hope that someone can help me out here.\r\n\r\nBy the way, first post. Please be constructive if I did something wrong!\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/JNXPy","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-10T01:59:31.717+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's the option you're looking for!\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/abf22443326f6763054a7e140fba2183.png\n\nWith \"Attack Move on Cursor\" turned on like I have here, that will make you target the enemy closest to your mouse cursor when you click!","replies":[{"poster":"Ultimate Bro","date":"2017-10-10T10:18:32.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much, this was very helpful :)","replies":[]}]}]}
