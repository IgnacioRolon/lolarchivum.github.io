{"poster":"Righteous Savant","date":"2014-11-21T18:39:58.527+0000","title":"Kalista, Bane of Supports (Complaint)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":44,"down_votes":17,"body":"As a dedicated support player, the newest addition to the roster is proving troublesome.  There are three key points that I believe need to be fixed with Kalista.  I say \"fixed\" because these are indeed problems that need to be solved.  If anyone disagrees, then that's your choice.  For me, after the first evening playing with Kalista players, I am ready to dodge games when seeing her selected.  I never dodge games or did I even think I would want to.  Let's get to the list.\r\n\r\n**Problem #1:  Relic Shield currently cannot work well with Kalista.**\r\nSince Kalista has an ability that can allow their partners to kill minions and give her the credit, the Spoils of War Passive does not click here.  Yes, you could tell your Kalista not to hit the Cannon Minions, but honestly, \"get along better\" is never a solution.  It's an ideal, and I've gone on record never to run a business with them as policies.\r\n\r\n**Solution?:**\r\nThis one is easy.  Since the Spoils of War Passive has been adjusted in the past, such as for Zyra's sprouts, it needs to be adjusted here as well for when being that if a support with Relic Shield gets the kill Oathsworn to Kalista, the Spoils of War exhausts a charge.\r\n\r\n**Problem #2:  Anyone can be Oathsworn against their will.**\r\nI'm sorry, but forcing a player to have an ability that they don't want?  Where is that fun?  \r\n\r\n**Solution?:**\r\nI believe it is an easy one, but the developers and the community don't seem to be in sync on this.  I know this has been discussed before, but even the official description says the following about the Black Spear's Active Ability:\r\n\r\n*Kalista offers a pact to an allied champion, **should they agree**, the item is consumed and the pair are Soul-Bound for the remainder of the game. When accepted, the binding enables Soul-Marked, a passive on Sentinel, and allows Kalista to use Fateâ€™s Call when she unlocks it. *\r\n\r\nSo, where exactly did anyone agree?  It's forced, not voluntary.  This mechanic needs a revist, for players who do not wish to have Oathsworn forced upon them.  Also, to any players who don't think this is a problem, then you haven't found it out for yourself yet.  Also, read on.\r\n\r\n**Problem #3: Oathsworn can be used against players, not just your opponents.**\r\nI will give a horrible yet poignant example.  Last evening, I was in a game as a support Blitzcrank.  My Kalista partner recalled due to low health, but I was fine and kept pushing.  I came into a one-on-one with an opposing Alistar.  After a few moments, I had the advantage.  Right when I was getting ready to finish Alistar off with his remaining 100HP, Kalista had reappeared and used the Fate's Call, pulling me away from Alistar.  Afterward, she dashed over and killed Alistar.  Yes, this was a clear kill steal, and Kalista found I refused to lane with her further.\r\n\r\n**Solution?:**\r\nThis goes again upon Oathsworn's imposition against players.  You are essentially having strings attached to you.  I can accept when an opponent has forced crowd control upon me, but a teammate?  No.\r\n\r\nThe solution here is simple again:  Oathsworn needs to be reworked.  Habits like this will happen, and as a dedicated support, I have my own personal rules to play.  One of them is when a teammate decides they are more important than the team or their partner, I can no longer support them.\r\n\r\nPersonally, it has reached the point that when I see Kalista is selected, I have to accept the following:\r\n\r\n1.  I cannot use any of my tank supports, as Relic Shield is out.\r\n2.  I have no voice in being Oathsworn or not.\r\n3.  Kalista can become my ventriloquist, and I really don't appreciate where her hand is.\r\n4.  Queue dodging is becoming a rising urge that I must fight committing.\r\n\r\nIf this is not remedied and soon, then my desire to be a support is hindered.  It is often not fun to play with Kalista as a support for me.  I know that I am not alone in this.  Just so we are clear, Riot, when a game's fun factor lowers or disappears, guess where the players' time and dollars go?  Hint:  Not to you.\r\n\r\nGet these fixed.  You don't need more of a message than this.","replies":[{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2014-11-21T18:40:41.427+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Kalista... not for people who are playing with strangers","replies":[{"poster":"l Main Renekton","date":"2014-11-22T04:24:38.567+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"But people will spam solo queue as her with even more reason to blame supports now","replies":[]},{"poster":"2pudge1cup","date":"2014-11-22T17:02:34.963+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"not terribly fun to play against either","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fury and Emperor","date":"2014-11-22T23:26:47.111+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Question**\nWhy do you play your death animation when Kalista uses black spear on you?\n\n**Answer**\nSo you can get used to Kalista killing you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronChefBoyardee","date":"2014-11-21T19:11:30.822+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"Or you communicate how her ult works, ask the guy you bonded, \"Do you know how my ult works?

That should definitely be fixed.\n\nThe problem with being oathsworn against your will if Kalista's ult mechanics were different. Being oathsworn wouldn't be so bad if her ultimate wasn't so horrible to use.\n\nEven worse is that Kalista's ultimate visits a mechanic that Thresh also has with Thresh's Dark Passage. With that ability, Riot specifically wanted to make it so that Thresh's allies had the opportunity to choose whether or not to take the lantern, not that Thresh could pull his allies himself. Then Kalista went the opposite direction so that she could pull her allies to herself without her ally's consent.\n\nThe only way this ultimate could work is if Kalista did something like Thresh's lantern where you can right click something Kalista throws down, and the soulbound can click it to go to Kalista. Otherwise, Kalista's ult needs to be reworked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ULTRAF0RCE","date":"2014-11-21T21:16:08.605+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I have to agree it seems strange that you don't do an oath when being sworn in as the oathsworn","replies":[]},{"poster":"iainB85","date":"2014-11-21T20:01:17.585+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the misfortune of being support in a Kalista lane last night.

I played Alistar and she saved me from several fights by ulting me out when I was near death. I don't see a problem with the ult since you have to be close to her to get pulled in the first place (meaning OP was already tower diving) and you can just jump away about the same distance as she pulls you. Your ADC can try to blame you for misplaying but that's not champion specific. Besides, she couldn't use her ult if you weren't there in the first place, so she's not losing anything if you decide you don't want to engage.\n\nThe Targon's proc IS an issue though.

I pull him out of the ult just to have the ult directed at me.\n\nBasically, there's problems on both sides. People aren't used to her yet, she's barely had time to be played by most people.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2014-11-21T22:28:45.867+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her Ult seems way, WAY too trolly to me.

TBH I've only had 2 \"bad\" Kalistas, one bound the jungler instead of me as Braum, and the other thought Witz End/Hurricane/etc was going to do much for her.  Beyond that I've been able to work very well with the Kalista's I have played with...may have something to do with me telling them \"hey I want to start fights by having you throw me into them post 6\" many of whom are more than willing to work with me.  \n\nHell I've had a number of Kalista's save my ass with the ult when I get caught just for me to be able to turn with it and we completely wreck the enemy team for it.\n\nTalk to people, Kalista enforces team play and communication if you are thinking you can play with her like any other ADC and simply ping to set crap up it isn't going to happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2014-11-22T07:13:02.259+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"The point of Kalista is to play with a friend, someone you are communicating with or someone you have played with frequently enough to know their style. This teamwork is enhanced by Kalista's oathsworn and we can see what it truly means to be an ADC and Support.  \n\nWhat we get instead is a bunch of trolls who only pick Kalista because \"PASSIVE OP OMG SUCH MOBILITY I WIN GG KALISTA OP\" who then realize there is more to Kalista then just jumping around and throwing spears...  \n\n\"Of course Kalista must be OP because DUUUR PASSIVE OP DUUUR!!! and obviously its not my skill, so it must be the supports fault! The reason grabbing my support from safety and throwing him into 5 people then dashing after him didnt work was because the support is an idiot!! Yeah thats it!\"  \n---  \n\nThe message here is STOP PICKING KALISTA!!!
