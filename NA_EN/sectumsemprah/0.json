Which if you know the total war series you know they take up a good size of storage. Well I wouldn't think this would have affected me? But a day later I noticed something was very different...I hopped on to league with my pals, we entered a match but the game froze 10 mins into the game? So I turned off my laptop and rejoined the que only to freeze again a minute later? I repeated the process but went into a custom game and my fps was in the low 60s unwavering? A weird lag scratchy noise was being omitted from the in game noise and the frames were just garbage.  So I uninstalled league and re-installed it but it still happened? So I wiped my computer, wiped any files (barely any), re-installed windows 10, re installed league, and re installed steam (Warhammer as well), I go to log into league to see in a custom game if the fps is still down in the 60s and it is!? I've checked all my drivers, I have re-installed league, I have uninstalled steam and Warhammer off my cpu, what is going on? Another note my Warhammer was working fine this whole time so I don't know why league just jumps in the dumpster all of a sudden???? Any help would be much appreciated thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-08T23:19:23.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you install some windows 10 updates recently? We've been hearing from some players that the Windows 10 anniversary updates are causing these types of issues for League.
