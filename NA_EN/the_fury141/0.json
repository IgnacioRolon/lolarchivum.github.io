You are just drawing your own arbitrary line where you think the past shouldn't count.\n\nI donno how far it goes back but it seems pretty far. A while back I had a string of different things happen in about a 2 week period that caused me to leave 4 games and I expected to get my first low priority queue on both the 3rd and 4th leave but it never happened. I have no doubt I was reported in those games and the only reason I can see for not being punished is my history of thousands of games with very few leaves. I think before those 4 leaves I had about 5 leaves in 5000 games.\n\nYou can work off that history but you need to play significant amounts of games without leaving or disconnecting to prove that things have improved. It takes a significant amount of games, though. Think like 100+ games per leaverbuster punishment you have received.","replies":[{"poster":"The Fury141","date":"2016-10-08T19:00:48.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, that makes some sense.

The system only punishes you when it detects you were afk. This also goes with people trying to trick the system, like if you were sitting in base, or just dilly dally around/not playing the game.
