If you're sure you haven't received a ban after August 10th, and are still elidgible, [shoot a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4584) over to player support. They'll have able to take a look into your account and see why you haven't received your rewards.  If you should have received rewards, we'll be able to fix that for you. ^-^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Protoco","date":"2015-12-03T02:29:24.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no i never got ban","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2015-12-03T02:07:20.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you absolutely sure that you weren't made ineligible from receiving ranked rewards?
