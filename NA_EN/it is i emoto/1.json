He also has no crowd control unless he's channeling it. I think it's totally fair to give him high move speed for a ranged champion\r\n\r\nWhat do we know about Sona?\r\n\r\n* Her Auto-Attack range is as the same as Malzahars\r\n* She has like Malzahar, almost no reliable Crowd-Control (her E is a expection, because it needs to be charged) until level 6\r\n* Though, her ultimate has a higher cooldown than Malzahars and has a much higher Mana cost.\r\n\r\nI feel like that Riot begins to contradict themselfs with her nerfs, because she was at first a utility based champion, then the reworked turned her to a poke champion, and with the next nerfs, she becomes ultimate reliant, and will be at the pre-6 phase just a oversized minion that can steal the adcs cs.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2015-01-05T21:16:43.030+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":2,"body":"Being the most immobile support in the game and in the top 5 squishiest champions with the lowest sustain and damage amongst supports isn't good enough for Riot.
