Her stats for her Heal are much higher without any % scaling on allies health and it also heals multiple targets as well.\r\nAt least, if you're nerfing some parts of her late game, buff her a little too.

Soraka is a burst healer. She can keep a team alive much, much, much better than Sona can, while Sona has a sustained healing advantage because she doesn't lose health. I don't think their roles overlap much. I think people want Soraka to be a sustained healer and try to put her in that role and find her overlaping with Sona there.
