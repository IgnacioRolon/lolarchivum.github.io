Sona threads are usually full of salty-acting players who can't seem to get over the aura change thing. I for one damn love the updated gameplay and the aura interactions.\n\nI'm much more worried about balance issues as the meta takes a nosedive towards assassins. Between the addition of Duskblade giving free executes, the update to Maw making it a prime choice for assassins looking for MR, and the updated Mastery trees giving anyone who rocks Thunderlords basically free extra burst, I can't seem to be able to play her right in mid lane anymore (Sona Mid being about 80-90% of any and all of my games last year).\n\n(Please note that Sona cannot effectively use Thunderlords due to her enhanced autoattack counting for only one hit regardless of Powerchord or Q buffs. This means Sona either has to auto twice or use her ult for the Thunderlords to proc. I chose to go with Stormraider's because of the hit-and-run it offers.)\n\nI get outdamaged by champs like Azir and Leblanc that i could always beat before because regular and very, very easy Thunderlord hits whittle me down too fast. I get outbuilt by assassins like Zed who i could usually play against on an even level, because Hexdrinker and Serrated Dirk basically offer everything they could ever want early and build into great items. Let's not get any illusions here. Some mages can get away with building RoA or other items first, Sona has only two options early in mid lane; Sheen for the proc damage, and Frost Queen's Claim for the utility. Neither of which will ever save her from any/most assassin all-ins at level 6.\n\nAs an easy example; two days ago i laned against a Zed. The lane was even, I even forced him to back out of lane first. When he got back with Serrated Dirk he knew he had enough damage, as soon as he came back to lane he went all in and deleted me all in one combo. I used my barrier, I used my W, I got under my turret and ulted him, he shadowed out back to the middle of the lane and i died to his ultimate anyway. I was either full health or near to it.\n\nI feel like Riot forgets the impact of adding damage everywhere.
