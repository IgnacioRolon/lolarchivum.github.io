He&#039;s my most played champion this season. I have a 74% win-rate with him in ranked and I don&#039;t even play that much ranked. I have almost 6K normal games and I&#039;m pretty sure my normal game win-rate with Azir is even higher. I love the champ. I think he&#039;s one of the best designed, skill-oriented champions. \r\n\r\nHowever, he is extremely reliable and extremely powerful in the state he is right now. His early game punish is immense. He has incredible scaling. Tons of CC, especially if you get Rylai&#039;s. And so much mobility and teamfight presence. In the current meta, especially after the ADC item buffs, Azir is the only viable and reliable DPS mid-laner barring except MAYBE, maybe viktor. \r\n\r\nWhen playing Azir vs-\r\nZed/talon/yasuo- take exhaust, seeker&#039;s first item, win lane early due to range and poke, late game- outscale him\r\nFizz/leblanc/akali/ekko- Take barrier/exhaust, stinger in to abysal, win lane early, you&#039;ll outscale him \r\nori/syndra/lux/viktor/ryze/ziggs/xerath/zilean/vel&#039;koz/tf- Take tp or barrier- destroy them in lane with your range and their immobility, outscale them\r\nannie/veigar/liss- take cleanse to negate cc, win lane due to range, outscale late game\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons his winrate is low is he does require skill, and not just mechanical, people need to play to his strengths macro wise too. That&#039;s why in high elo and in the LCS he&#039;s so popular. Faker has had the champ banned in all the last few games. Every time it&#039;s open he goes for it. \r\n\r\nThe 6.11 changes did nothing. Yes its a nerf. But it did not address the core issues of his over-poweredness which are-\r\n\r\n- Mana- Early game yes he drains mana, but the later the game goes, he simply does not run out of mana even without having any mana or mana regen items, by nerfing his mana regen or mana pool you can make ROA or morello a core item or at least make you run mana regen runes which will reduce his incredible power\r\n- Arise dmg- I feel the biggest problem with him right now is that his W- Arise does way too much dmg, especially in the late game, there definitely needs to be some sort of nerf in the dmg (Scaling or base)\r\n\r\nI feel those 2 are the core issues regarding Azir&#039;s power right now. And not the 6.11 changes, which barely does anything to affect his overall gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-20T05:57:57.186+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think the purpose of the 6.11 changes was to remove extraneous power from his kit.

From my perspective, there are two facets to Azir having a high mastery. Strong mechanical skill and a high number of decisions/use cases. By removing discrete things from Azirs kit they remove some of the use cases. They could continue down this path and remove a) his shield b) his damage on ult (while his attack speed is a discrete thing that could be removed there aren't any decisions or use cases associated with it). Those two things reduce a fair number of use cases while retaining some of the 'core' features of his kit like the Shurima Shuffle.\n\nThe second way to alter his mastery discrepancy is by targeting. Either things that most effect the high skill are nerfed, or 'help' some things so the floor is raised. The former seems more likely to me. One of the big thins that separates high mechanical players is the temporality of things. If Riot chose to reduce his movement speed and or reduce his missile speed on his Q that would hit them the most. It doesn't change his damage or his range, but it does make his access to them a little bit more difficult and makes it easier for other to capitalise when he is caught. \n\nWere I Riot, I'd be tackling the gap through those first.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-06-20T15:31:57.604+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Except that is what Riot has been doing for many many months.\n\nLook what we got from this kind of balance philosohpy:\nOlaf'd\nEve'd\nKassadin'd\nSejuani'd\nKarma'd\n\nAnd then there if Fizz who was basically reworked twice with said balance philosohpy and wasn't weak for even one patch.\nQuite the opposite, he got even more frustrating to play aganist.","replies":[{"poster":"BloodyTompon","date":"2016-06-20T15:41:25.742+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"With what philosophy?

There are exceptions though. I'm with you that Azir has too many strengths relative to weaknesses.

The discrete ones that add extra decisions and use cases, yes. Consider it this way. Azir rarely needs his shield. But if he comes across a situation where it's useful in 1 in 20 games, it's going to take a long time before he can master that decision and use case. By removing that, we've not only nerfed him in those 1 and 20 games, but more importantly removed the decision mastery aspect as well. It's in the second part that the gap is reduced. \n\nSimilarly his ult. You don't think it will matter? 150-300+.6ap damage is a substantial nerf. Do I think it's used to do damage? Yes. I see it all the time in pro games. I've seen one or two games where they use it _specifically_ for the damage (they were trying to burst so used the extra deeps when they had no need of the wall).

Feels good when Rioters reach out to the community! XD\n\nThe problem I have with Azir right now is that he's just too good at everything. I don't play that much ranked games because I love exploiting the variety of champs we have available. But whenever I do play ranked and I get mid, its always Azir for me. As someone who's put in the time to learn him, I feel like he does everything that a midlaner can do better than anyone else in the game. His late game dmg can assassinate and I mean assassinate squishies. He has great utility, great mobility. And his early game dmg can really put down the enemy laner. He is incredibly easy to farm with, has no mana issues, has incredible range and can push towers better than any mage. \n\nHe's better at poking than xerath, ziggs, syndra cause its very easy to aim his soldiers.

So it got me thinking of ways to balance it, I was thinking that Azir mains would probably prefer that he doesn't lose his late game power. \n\nI came up with an idea that will keep him exactly the same as he is currently gameplay wise but delays his late game and making his early/mid not as oppressive. This tread is the perfect place to see what some Azir mains think about the change.\n\nAnyway what would you guys think if Azirs auto's with his soldiers cost mana instead of when you summoned them. \n\nSo it would read like this:\n\n> Arise!\n> \n> Cost: 0 Mana\n> Range: 450\n> \n> Azir summons a Sand Soldier to attack nearby targets for him, replacing his basic attack against targets within the soldier's range **but costing mana**. Their attacks deal magic damage to enemies in a line. Arise! also passively grants attack speed to Azir and his Sand Soldiers.\n> \n> **Mana cost per auto: 20/25/30/35/40 Mana._ (Cost remains the same regardless of how many soldiers attack)_**\n> Passive: Gains 20/30/40/50/60% attack speed.\n> Active: Azir summons a Sand Soldier for 9 seconds. When Azir attacks an enemy in a soldier's range, the soldier attacks instead of Azir, dealing 0 (+60% Ability Power) magic damage to enemies in a line. If multiple soldiers strike the same target, each soldier after the first deals 25% damage.Azir can store up to {{ maxammo }} Sand Soldiers at a time. A new soldier becomes available every 0 seconds.Sand Soldiers can attack targets outside of Azir's basic attack range.Sand Soldiers deactivate if they are too far away from Azir.Sand Soldiers expire twice as fast when near an enemy turret.\n\nNow the mana cost per auto could be a static 30 regardless of rank but either way I think this would mean you would have to choose between harassing or farming early or you go oom and probably have to build a {{item:3070}} / {{item:3027}}  to deal with the mana costs delaying the powerspike of {{item:3115}} / {{item:3116}}. This keeps is late game unchanged but weakens his early/mid.\n\nSo do you Azir mains think that this would work or completely wreck him?","replies":[{"poster":"RcGjWO640w","date":"2016-06-23T06:13:55.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir is a champion who 100% relies on his teammates to be effective. Regardless of what people say about his mobility, his glide combo puts all 3 of his spells on cooldown to do it. Azir is a champion who either has to all in you with soldiers or save ALL of his damage potential for his escapes. He's not nearly as mobile as some people like to think.\n\nThe thing is, though, that when an Azir is allowed to go uncontested in a teamfight, 5 or 6 seconds of raw DPS is enough to single handedly win the game. He is such a massive target, even with his ult. If he gets jumped on by any moderately fed assassin, he'll get deleted before he ever has a chance to even dream of hitting R.\n\nEven when he's going 9-1 in lane, building defensively doesn't lend him that much more survivability. When his team has a solid front line and good peel, an experienced Azir will lay down such absurd numbers of AoE DPS that you'll **WISH** that he were something easier to deal with like a fed Kogmaw, but that's only if you let him.\n\nRegardless of Azir's safe and oppressive early game, that's about the only phase of the game where he can handle himself in a solo situation. After the laning phase, Azir's a sitting duck 99% of the time. Even if you're super massive, you'll deal a lot of damage, but you're still unbelievably squishy. That 2-5-3 Katarina you stomped in lane will still be able to pick you up as a kill embarrassingly fast if you don't have the mechanics to stay alive and outplay her.\n\nAnd if he gets stomped in the laning phase, he's a 100% worthless champion. Period. Azir has almost no ability to get himself back into the game. He'll be useful for his ult and the 2k HP he brings to the teamfight. That's it. Unless the entire team works together to spoon feed Azir picks and kills so he can get back into the fight, he won't be useful. His good laning phase is all that makes up for his almost non-existent dueling potential. But again, you let him go free in a teamfight and he'll teabag the shit out of your entire team in a heartbeat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HighH1","date":"2016-06-20T18:02:45.663+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're punishing him for doing his main source of damage,at max rank a measly 10 autos will cost 400 mana on top of his constant Q's.How will he kite,he'll run out of mana for staying alive and being good at not feeding.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RcGjWO640w","date":"2016-06-22T13:24:12.826+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my personal experience as an Azir main, the trick to countering Azir is simply to abuse his cooldowns.

A lot of his early power relies on his aggressive early game, but if you can catch him out with his Q down, that's a ton of damage that he can't hit you with.

He has no hard all-ins and his damage output is shit. All he has is a Q and a thunderlords proc. From A to B. Granted he does'n spam his Q and drain out his mana (2-3 Qs would pretty much force him to recall or risk a gank or an all-in from an opponent)\n\n\nIt's the Yasuo/Zed dilemma all over again. People go into ranked/draft pick and they don't counterpick the enemy midlaner, get shit-over, too lazy to git gud, so they come here and clamor for nerfs. There are many champs that pose way more threats/force you to play their mini-game than Azir, Vel'koz, you know that if he hits you with more than 2 abilities can most likely lead to your death, Xerath, long range artillery, and a watered down karthus ult, Lissandra, a champ that is anti All-in with perfect all-ins in her kit. Syndra, hovering around your lane with 60% HP is the exact same as hovering around with that healthbar infront of a zed or a LeBlanc. And don't get me started on shit like Illaoi.\n\n\nCounterplay exists, people are too lazy to git gud. \nAnd if they find it difficult to actually counterplay, counterbuilding also exists.
