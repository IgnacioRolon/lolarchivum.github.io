Okay.\r\n\r\nPlayer 1: \"I'm going adc!\"\r\nPlayer 5: \"ADC\"\r\nPlayer 4: \"Support! Duo bot with player 5!!!\"\r\nPlayer 1: \"No, fck off. I'm adc. I don't care about duo pick. Duo pick players suck\"\r\n-player 1 goes adc-\r\nPlayer 4: \"Wow, play with my pu**y make me cum. Come on. Is this urf?? Omg, I'm gonna go teleport\"\r\nPlayer 5: \"Me too. I'm going tele\"\r\n---An ACTUAL quote from pre game: \"kill yourself lonely fuck\"---\r\n-sigh-\r\nThe game starts.\r\nPlayer 4 and 5 go straight into enemy jungle and stand in a bush for the first 5 minutes. Then give the enemy jungler first blood and a double kill.\r\nSpend the rest of the game trolling and feeding to \"teach everyone a lesson\" that apparently is...all duo queuers are 12 years old.\r\n\r\nSo I lose my qualifiers. -sigh- Okay, no big deal. I can get back in.\r\n\r\nNext game:\r\nPlayer 1 goes top, picks Gnar.\r\nGood so far.\r\nPlayer 3....picks Garen and locks in. \"Oooops!!!\"\r\nGnar: \"Well....I'll go mid I guess.\"\r\nGame starts.....Garen has 15 fricken farm at 20 minutes. Enough said. GG\r\n\r\nI quit ranked.\r\n\r\nBut for real. Not gonna act like I'm the best player out there or anything......but the people I get matched up with are just plain dumb. Why do I always feel like it's on my team? I've never seen anyone troll as bad as that game. And it had to be my team it happened on?! And I always get the player that plays like it's their first game ever.","replies":[]}
