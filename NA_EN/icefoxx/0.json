My friends said I was in champ select, shortly after, client crashes. Reloaded League and got an message saying \"**Group Disbanded**\" and \"A server error occured and your group has been disbanded\" this counted as a loss for me and took away one of my promo games. We all restarted computers and routers and tried again, same thing happened to my friend playing the next game, his resulted in LP loss. Are server issues occurring now?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-19T21:26:46.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to find any recorded service issues yesterday around the time you reported this.
