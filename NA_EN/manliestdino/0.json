Make no mistake, the boards (or general forums, as it was known back then) have ALWAYS complained about this game. There must ALWAYS be something to complain about, whether it be Lee Sin, Vayne, Tanks, Assassins, Mages, ADCs and Crit (a staple) or just hating on Riot in general.  I guarantee there has never been a time when the boards had a positive mentality or even neutral one for calmly discussing anything. The boards will always nostalgia goggle themselves and say that the past was always better. \n\nFor all intents, the boards serve for nothing more than an echo chamber and giant circlejerk for people to vent and complain about what they don't like.

If you start with that assertion, it's may be taken as trolling because it's grounded in strong emotion rather than reality. :( \n\n**Language on this stuff matters because we can only have productive conversations if we start with a reasonable basis.** The difference in language between 'I dislike Sona because of this aspect of her play' and 'I and the majority of players think Sona is unplayable' is absolutely massive.

Again, **that doesn't mean the opinions here are not valid** but you simply, cannot make the jump from Boards to 'majority'. If I see that jump, again, the discussion has moved into hyperbole. We have a few thousand players who read and post on Boards - that's a lot! But League is a global game. There are players in so many other countries & languages or posting on other social sites, etc. It's hard to see if you only read Boards, but there are a lot of players and, therefore, player opinions out there! **No one forum is or can be representative of the majority.**\n\nNot trying to be rude or defensive when I point these things out; I'm always hoping to shed a light on how we can foster better discussions together as a Boards community. :D\n\n**TL:DR** Hyperbole means we can't have a productive discussion together.

That's why the game needs to be balanced around at least a decently high level, bad players can at least theoretically learn to play around a champ who's OP in low levels, good players cannot make an unplayable champ work.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuga Terunori","date":"2017-12-30T23:22:57.451+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's an issue of whether champions should be balanced around their skill cap or skill floor.

Not in side threads. Not with Rioters hanging out in Memes&Games and ignoring the hard questions.\n\nWhether or not that's the intent, that is the message being received.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, Sona's changes *have* made her feel absolutely *awful* to play. It also sucks as a support main seeing Sona constantly targeted with the nerf bat again and again - which either means the balance team doesn't know what they're doing (not likely), or that her kit is unbalanceable and she needs to be VGU'd. If I want my team to win, I have no reason to pick her, since any other heal support does her job better. Nami has better heals, boosts, and CC.\n\nAh, but Sona has at least been addressed, albeit in a completely unsatisfying way.\n\nWhat isn't being addressed, at all, and I think this cuts to the core of the rage, is the overall game direction when it comes to game length, snowballing, botlane-wins-game, and so forth. Nobody knows what you guys want to do, and when people say it sucks for whatever reason, they don't even get a flippant response. Not even a dismissal. Not even disagreement.

Honestly, it appeared to me that all he did is canning more oil into the fire and split the community even more by taking sides. \n\nAlso: You might know well that reddit is heavily censored as basically anything can be called a \"rant\" and just get deleted otherwise league sub would look like destiny 2 sub. Not saying it is bad to filter out a lot of shitposts but i think on a scale from murica freedom to north korea freedom we should find some healthy middle ground on both forums. \n\nBesides i want to add that i appreciate every rioter who comes here to talk to us. I hope you don't find what i said to be too offensive or something i'm just being honest and rather blunt here and i can't deny i dislike cactopus.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"nice table","date":"2017-12-30T14:55:34.712+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"wanna know what the difference is between \"lee sin is op\", \"tanks are op\", \"assassins are op\" and what we have now with \"the whole game is shit\"? yeah there always has been and will be shit to complain about but now it's not the an isolated case of bullshit it's the whole game.","replies":[{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2017-12-30T16:54:07.706+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=nice table,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oTEAdIAv,comment-id=00010002,timestamp=2017-12-30T14:55:34.712+0000)\n>\n> wanna know what the difference is between &quot;lee sin is op&quot;, &quot;tanks are op&quot;, &quot;assassins are op&quot; and what we have now with &quot;the whole game is shit&quot;? yeah there always has been and will be shit to complain about but now it&#x27;s not the an isolated case of bullshit it&#x27;s the whole game.\n\nThis pretty much sums it up. Tank meta felt like shit unless you played the FotM high damage high soak tanks. The lethality meta felt like shit unless you were a member of team lethality. Adc meta felt like shit unless you were a ranked adc... However, this high damage just feels like shit all around because assassins are one shotting tanks, tanks are one shotting anything not tanks, adcs are one shotting anything that walks into range, bruisers/sustained damage dealers feel like shit because they aren't allowed to sustain fight.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2017-12-30T06:10:12.639+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd like to contend that the S5 Tank Meta was actually a pretty decent time on the Boards in terms of relative toxicity to basically any other time.\n\nI joined Preseason 3-4 btw.

Ignoring Sejuani's balance at the time, Jungle Tanks appearing invites slower early to mid game transitions, teamplay, and strategic balance. Laning Tanks slow down and isolate top lane, devalue or even reduce snowballs in either direction, all while not actually doing much to slow down the rest of the game if the rest of the game hyper accelerates without them.\n\nImo, we need more Wardens.
