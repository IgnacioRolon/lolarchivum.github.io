ThePartiestCat was the Main animator on Ryze, and he was also the main animator on Taric. I say \"Main\" animator because we usually have like 2-3 animators on a project towards the very end, and one main animator on the project for it's whole production cycle. \n\nThePartiestCat is currently planned to be the main animator on the Warwick Rework as well :)","replies":[{"poster":"IAintDarius","date":"2016-06-29T16:56:00.703+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plz tell him he did a good job and to put the same amount of emotion in Warwick that he did in Ryze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-06-30T14:15:40.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"However he is the animator, and doesn't develop the champs thematically. While tariq was a great update, the particles felt wishy washy. A little too low impact heal, and the ultimate is very hard to tell when it activates even for your teammates. \n\nI haven't seen ryze yet, so I'll save my judgement. \n\nI assume you're also going to be working on Warwick? Please consult with us about that. In my opinion you might've mucked up some classic champs (Shen, morde) with your updates. I love ww a lot and I don't want you guys to make the same mistake with him. \n\nAs usual thanks for sharing pal ðŸ˜ƒ.

Like making the model and rig. During that time animators usually jump onto other projects temporarily, which is why I mention above that we usually have 2-3 animators work on a project over its total duration. He will likely help out on Yorick for a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Garentheon","date":"2016-06-30T01:40:54.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah copy. Thanks for the reply.
