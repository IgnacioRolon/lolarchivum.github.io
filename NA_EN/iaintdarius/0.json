All  of them reflect a standard moba. Taking turrets, pushing waves, and killing the nexus. With the exception of arena which is a glorified teamfight simulator with minion waves. (It was basically the sandbox mode before they had a sandbox mode).\n\nDominion was like playing a different game. It had different objectives and didnt revolve around what league was about. People were gonna naturally flock to one side. That side was summoners rift as you can see today.  Keeping track of balance around the two different games would have been a good chunk of resources. While on the same note, keeping track of two different games when one obviously isn&#039;t that popular is just a dumb idea.\n\n\n\n\nAnd even say, they did keep it and put effort into it, that wouldn&#039;t stop the dominion community from complaining about it being an unbalanced mess or not enough attention etc. That&#039;s just by nature what you people do. \n\nInstead you guys should be pushing riot for a new map. Not keeping this outdated one you don&#039;t even play.","replies":[]}
