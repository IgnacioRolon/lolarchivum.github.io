Assuming you're getting a connection error, it sounds like something is blocking your network from reaching the game server after champion select.  Once you actually get in game, though, it sounds like everything is okay.  Even though your connection seems stable, you can have issues reaching specific servers like the game server.  \n\nI'd first recommend grabbing our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and run the firewall configuration to clear any possible blocks.  Then go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to rule out possibilities.  Test it in a custom game, and let me know how it goes!","replies":[{"poster":"Lightgaard","date":"2017-03-14T18:23:41.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The repair tool have done something, going through the connection guide has not helped anything whatsoever.\n\nThe connection instability in client seems to have vanished, however the passing from client to game still there, however that is manageable in comparrison to the not being able to set talents or swap champ.\n\nUpdate: .......
