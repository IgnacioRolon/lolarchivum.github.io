Everyone can build tank items and become tanky. A tank in MOBAs are meant to engage, disrupt and peel the enemy. That is their MAIN role, having high defenses is just a tool that tanks use to accomplish that goal and it's something they need since they need to be in the middle of everyone. Tanks aren't the only class of champions that can soak damage, Juggernauts also soak a lot of damage but they cannot engage, peel or disrupt anywhere near close to what a tank is capable of.\n\nYou can think all you want that Garen is a tank, doesn't change the fact that you are wrong","replies":[{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2018-08-04T17:08:38.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZephyrDrake,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NYzxO01z,comment-id=0000000000000002,timestamp=2018-08-04T17:02:15.053+0000)\n>\n> A tank in MOBAs are meant to engage, disrupt and peel the enemy\n\nAre you saying that Garen can't engage (Q movement buff), disrupt (Q silence and E AOE) and peel (Without damage he can one-shot squishy champions)?

His Q makes for a very shitty engage, it isn’t instant and gives your entire team time to prep for it, only provides a silence, one of the weakest forms of cc in the game and his E doesn’t disrupt anything if it does no damage, which it won’t especially if he is building full tank and also does less damage if they is more then one target in its range.","replies":[{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2018-08-04T17:26:06.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"I have never not done any damage as Garen while going full tank, so that entire argument is non-existent.

A little MS buff that goes away the instant you slow him since he gets no slow immunity just cleanses the slow he had when he activates it so you can just reapply the slow. He gets to hit one person with a silence that more than likely isn't even going to care about and his E does no damage at all if he has no damage items.
