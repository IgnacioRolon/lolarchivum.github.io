However, it wasn't showing any if the champion icons and i was just sitting there with a loading icon. Eventually the game closed and said that the game ended. I was pretty mad cause this has happened before and every time i have to fix the client, which seems to take my computer at least an hour or so. But i get to the post game stats and it announces to me that i have a leaver buster to being afk. That fricken pissed me off because it wasn't even my fault and i had no control of it. Fixing the client now seems to only temporarily solve the problem. I would really appreciate it if someone could tell me how to fix this so it doesn't happen again and i dont get a leaver buster again for that. I play the game on windows 10 if anybody has had the same problem like i have and knows the solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T21:41:02.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The [leaverbuster ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)penalty would only occur after multiple leaves and not just one game.  Even if you feel this was beyond your control, leaves are treated the same because of the negative experience they cause.  The best way to resolve this is by solving whatever is causing this issue. \n\nWith that, the issue you're experiencing is the result of a poor network connection that's unable to connect to the game server or download assets.  A repair wouldn't necessarily fix this if your game files are fine.
