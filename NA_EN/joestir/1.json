I tried opening it again and the same thing happened. my friend said  that i probably got a virus from downloading it and so i had to uninstall it.

It sounds like your PC may have just hung up on giving you a prompt that allowed you to grant or deny the HRT admin access. \n\nIf you can give me a bit more details on what issues you're having with League, I can suggest steps to take.","replies":[]}]}
