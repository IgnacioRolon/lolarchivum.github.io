Somewhere, I&#039;ve read that you will be adding czech language to the game if the you see, that czech people are going to purchase this. Majority of people in Czech republic loves board games, and especially those that has awesome looking board and figures. So I wanted to ask you, if czech language is still in your plans for MvM and if it is, when should we expect the game to be realeased with the czech translation.\r\n\r\nThank you for your anwers.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Catzpaw","date":"2017-05-13T16:03:02.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently the only translated versions we have committed to are German and Chinese, however we are evaluating a number of other languages (including Czech) for possible language pack upgrades in the near future. A language pack would essentially supplement an English copy of the game. Also, if you check the website right now, I believe you can download the rulebook and dossiers in Czech.","replies":[{"poster":"ImTaIonted","date":"2017-05-13T16:17:58.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As you said, the rulebook is avaiable in the czech language.

I haven't heard anything about Czech.","replies":[]}]}
