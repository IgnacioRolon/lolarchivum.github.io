I&#039;m really curious what they intend to do with his kit. He&#039;s always been the tanky brawly healy guy, but his numbers have been horribly neutered in almost every incarnation I&#039;ve witnessed, with the exception of when they slightly reworked his passive etc and he was an unstoppable monstrosity. The reason for this seems to be that they want to keep him out of top lane and the jungle, but when are they going to learn that a healy brawly tanky guy is always going to be desirable in top lane and jungle?\r\n\r\nPersonally I think they should just balance him to be a competitive but balanced top laner/jungler, and he will probably still function well as a support.\r\n\r\nI mean, support Sion totally works as well.

It's way easy right now for teams to choose all AD champions and totally still dominate with it.

I typically build 2 HP items (righteous glory, Sightstone) then MR and HP (merc treads and iron locket) while maxing W and with many armour runes. This does not make him as strong in combat, but his support traits are massive, and then one Frozen heart with the 20% CDR and he suddenly jumps in strength (from 140 to 250 armour minimum) stack a sunfire on top for even more hp and amour, plus dmg over time and he can just sit under turret while healing himself and smacking it down\n\nBut his flaws are not his builds, it's his kit, he has no MS, his stun wears off faster than it takes to land, leaving the window to utilise it stupidly low, (and i have twice stunned an adc attacking my turret, but the animation continues, then the stun wears off and its essentially like I didn't stun them, like a strange bug)\n\nTaric can skill an adc often as fast as they can kill his adc. Problem is, if they kill you adc, they often run away (run passed you, kill adc, walk away) and taric can barely do anything. He does more damage but can NEVER catch an enemy once they have decided to disengage. He's only really strong when the enemy is foolish enough to stay and fight (like a jynx I beat recently 1v1 because she thought she would out damage me - but with my build I still had half my hp by the time she realised she should run, and could ulti twice). \n\nWhen the enemy is low, its hard to catch them, unless you have long range cc adc like jynx, or speed buff from Sivir. If your adc gets ganked you can't stop the enemy, because you stun is so short lived and slow, that even if you deal more damage, they will escape before you can finish them, and you'll die if you chase.\n\nSometimes he wrecks, but sometimes he just stands around watching, unable to get involved. I spoke in another post about 3 changes (only one needed) to help him out.\n\nHe needs a speed buff ability\nA longer stun on E\nor his ultimate should be a mini-dash \n\nAlso considering his Ultimate being a knock-up (which would make sense) or it should radiate a slow. \n\nHe needs at least one more reliable CC, even if its an on hit slow from his passive (reduce the damage maybe), a slow with his W, or his R, but to be honest, his other skills are so balanced that it seems like it would break them. I think his weakness is his stun, it's slow moving and doesn't last very long. \n\nIf I was to suggest one buff, it'd be this:\n\nWhen taric Stuns a target he marks them with \"dazzle\" debuff\nwhile dazzle'd the enemy is made visible, and Taric gets a movement speed buff while moving towards them (something good like 25%)\n\nthis would give some chase potential, but not as strong as say Leona, but also give defence potential, by stunning a jungler who dives on your adc, you get a speed buff back to ally (a weaker concept for Braums dash) \n\nIf giving Taric a chase is too strong, and making support only is the idea, then giving him the ability to dash to allies in some way (utilising heal as well) would help him fulfil his role, cause right now, enemies just jump passed him, and if u stand behind adc, then you can't protect them from skillshots :/\n\nincreasing allied movement speed to targets hit by dazzle would fix tarics biggest weakness in my opinion, without breaking him like a knock-up ultimate or longer stun might","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastBaron88","date":"2015-04-20T15:22:13.028+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's essential to his strength that he not have mobility or escapes of his own, but it is absolutely imperative that if this is so, he has to be able to lock down enemies so that they cannot escape. \n\nWhat's difficult about him thematically is that he seems to be centered around being defensive and peeling for his carry, not diving, but this limits his usefulness in lane, when you need to be able to apply real threat, instead of just taking free poke.","replies":[{"poster":"Apollocliptic","date":"2015-04-20T15:32:27.856+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think his presence in lane is fine, because he poses a threat that the enemy often misses. His stun, armour shred and heal, can help an ally adc burst down the enemy even with critical hp, downside is, that his ability to peel is limited to dealing damage, because his CC is weak, and often his adc is retreating, outside of his heal range.\n\nI agree that he needs to either lock down his opponent, or have increased mobility, definitely not both. His mobility should be a support type, not combat type (like braum can dash to an ally) so increased movement speed to allied champ or something would help, or something more on his stun. \n\nTaric is actually dangerous diver, because he can tank turrets longer than most, but has to be careful because he can't dash out after (I often walk under turret, wait for adc to get into position, then stun their adc and start bursting them before retreating - with the heal as well, you can usually get the kill if the enemy doesnt abandon their turret but if you stay too long, you have no way out)\n\nSomeone mentioned if his on hit stun was like a slow mark, that is triggered into a stun by adc or time delay. I think that'd be a good fix. As a slow he can use it to chase or peel, then the stun acts as a second cc within the same skill.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-21T21:34:49.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taric Passive:\n\nGemcraft\t:\n> \n> At levels: 1 / 6 / 11 / 16\n> \n> ON-TARGET COOLDOWN: 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 \n> \t\n> Taric' basic attacks deal bonus magic damage equal to 20% of Taric's armor and slows his target for  0.75 / 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 seconds by 35%.\n\nThis effect cannot trigger on the same target more than once every few seconds.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2015-04-22T05:04:28.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But Taric's single-target CC and girlyman size makes the regret a little less.\nHardly bodyblocks and stops one person.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2015-04-20T17:11:19.727+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I prefer him on top/jungle because it makes him easier to balance.

And their heal is bad and not designed to heal others. They can only cure poison and debuff and give some buff to ally.

(remove AP buff and replace with AS (the ad buff is pointless if he only lands two hits, and he can't stay in range of his targets) if taric gave MS and AD, then teamed with Sivir, the burst kills would be OP. Alternatively, he could give ad and armour pen. I have found the AP buff is nice for exactly 1 heal, but even with all his skills, he doesn't get to land another heal until after the affect wears off, and it serves no other purpose on him. \n\nAnyway, I like the aura on W, but rather than damage increased (which armour shred does anyway) I think an aura slow would be better. Enemies moving near him move slower, so he can't chase once they get out of his range, but he can kite easier and stay in the fight once they engage on him\n\nImprove his attack animation, I find even with higher attack speed, he takes ages to land a single hit, which he needs to trigger passive.

If he could just \"reach\" the target once they are stunned, or the adc, it'd help greatly\n\na scary alternative is a mark, reveals champ, no stun, but every hit on that champ slows them until mark is gone. something more akin to lulu's petrify then just a straight stun that was nerfed so much that it's almost useless\n\n\nPS.\nthe armour buff from W is pretty weak, it sounds good on paper, but reduces damage by like 3% or something for allies, it'd be better for a flat damage reduction aura. Weaker than Maokai's with smaller range, and maybe only physical damage, though an increase to the armour shared would have same affect, +15 armour i think is near where it is mid game, 22 by late game, it has so little impact.

I'd like to play on his VO lines through his kit- namely making him a unique stance-based champ.\nHe has 4 lines referencing specific gems and qualities based on them, but 4 stances on one ability would be awkward- I'd like his stance to be unique in that it cycles through 3 stances on one ability, rather than a swap or having it on multiple abilities. It'd be the defining part of his kit, giving a single unique ability for each gem, and adding an effect for another spell.\n\nFor the most part, I'd keep his q and w similar to his current stuff- Q being a heal/ally targeted ability, and W being an aura attached to a burst effect. His E would be the biggest change due to the fact that it's a targeted stun, and would probably be phased out in a rework anyways. His ult would turn into his trio of stances, and each stance would take some time to charge up- gems are, after all, part of the earth, and the earth is known to work in slow ways. Probably a 10/8/6/4 second wind-up on his aura abilities/duration of an active on stance swap (Would provide the same bonuses, but would be over a shorter time for regen/&c. Offensive bonuses would scale up backwards through this progression.)\n\n* \"Opal for harmony\" could be a stance characterized by a distinct white opalescence on his gems, and could be a healer-esque stance. His q would stay the same in this stance with no extra effects, but a larger heal than other stances. His W would provide a slight(5-10%) Bonus to healing effects in a  radius, as well as a measure of regeneration. On using his W, it reduces enemy healing effects by 40% in the area (possible scaling), while  doubling/tripling the passive regen for a short duration. His E in Opal would be a blinding flash- a thin cone (think Aatrox's blades of torment backwards and filled in) flashes with white light, stunning or blinding enemies facing towards Taric (maybe dependent on distance?) When switching to this stance, Taric lets out a wave of harmony, restoring mana to all allies in the area and giving Taric additional mana regen depending on how many allies are affected.\n* \"Ruby for vigor\" would be a stance of deep reds in his gems, and would be focused on offensive movements- vigorous charging, initiation tactics, all that. His Q would provide a smaller heal than any other stance, but would enhance their damage-dealing with a buff; vigorous power- when a unit is hit with damage with this flag 5 times (within 3 seconds), any channels are interrupted and they are rooted for a short (.5 second, maybe) duration. His W during his Ruby stance could provide a small measure of AD and AP to allies in the area. When activated, it knocks enemies in the area up very shortly, and doubles the passive effects for a short while.(See a pattern?) His E could be a dynamic charge for the hammer-wielder, a short-ranged targeted dash that deals small damage and applies a slow in an AoE around where he lands. If he's already in melee range when he uses this ability, it stuns the target and gives a larger slow in the area. When switching to this stance, Taric gives ~~a warcry~~ off a wave of power, increasing the movespeed of allies in the area by a relatively large amount, and giving Taric additional movement based on how many allies it affects. (More patterns for cohesive gameplay!)\n* \"Sapphire for divinity\" would be his hardy defensive stance, boosting himself to divinity through his heroic defense of his comrades. His Q would grant its target a shield in addition to the heal (Probably just a little more total hp+shield than the Opal's heal, due to the temporary nature of the shield). His W would function very similarly to his current live W, giving an armor buff and smaller MR buff to allies, while shredding the defenses of enemies when used. It can also, like the others, double its own bonuses for a short time after it is popped. His E could hold in the defensive attitude, a massive stomp to create a bulwark in an arc in front of Taric- It lasts for some time, and the ability has a longer cooldown to reflect this- and it slows enemies who try to  pass through it as they must climb the smooth but shallow surface. It also causes hostile projectiles that travel over it to deal decreased damage or have decreased range (Hard on coding) or it could have a zone behind it that gives allies additional defenses vs. projectiles. When switching to this stance, Taric destroys projectiles in a small radius around him, granting him temporary extra defenses for each projectile destroyed (Like 1 armor/MR for every projectile destroyed, for every X additional defense, lasts a second longer but diminishes returns- I.E. if he destroys 10 projectiles he gains 10 armor/MR for 2 seconds, but if he destroys 20 projectiles he gains 15 armor/MR for 4 seconds. Those numbers would probably be very UP, but the concept is there).\n\nHis stances would cycle Opal-Ruby-Sapphire-Opal, which would provide a good progression- Opal to sustain his lane partner with regen and heals, transition to Ruby to engage/counter-engage on the enemy and buff his team's burst, Sapphire to keep a fight going by making his allies more durable, slowing the enemy's sustained damage output. Back to Opal to sustain back from the fight. I'd say probably put the stance change on some sort of charge cooldown to prevent him from just switching constantly to keep his mana pool infinite or some such thing- like he gets a charge every 30 seconds(2 charges max), the change itself has a 2 second CD, and he regains a charge on kill or assist. This would allow him to do a full 'proper' engage every minute, but they wouldn't be able to lick their wounds for a while unless they got a kill out of the engagement- this provides a point of vulnerability- the defenses aura is down for a little while, he can't regain his mana with a stance swap for a while, and he doesn't have improved heal/regen aura- a solid 15-20 second window of vulnerability for the lane after an unsuccessful engagement. *counterplay*\n\nTell me what you guys think!","replies":[{"poster":"Apollocliptic","date":"2015-04-21T10:38:30.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think your idea is WAY too complicated, Lulu is already a pretty sophisticated champ because her skills can be applied in so many different combinations, same with Jayce in some ways (i don't play him) and nida, this is like all 3 of them and then some. \n\nHOWEVER\n\nI really like where you're going with this. \n\nAn interesting alternative could like Karma's ultimate. If he uses his ulimate he can then power up one of his skills for a set time, but that skill has a passive\n\nFor example. R + Q Opal of harmony, Q now heals for more, W grants HP and mana regen, E gives a speed buff or removed negative buffs???\n\nR + W Sapphire of Harmony (W is his def skill after all)\nQ creates a an overshield like blood thurster \nW gets a buff + grants MR now (or flat damage resistance)\nE acts like Maokais Q, it knocks back if enemy is close, then creates a wall, or just just creates a wall in a cone. The cone is either a straight wall, or a slow zone which weakens projectiles like you suggested. Either could be applicable (personally I think this should be his new E anyway, regardless of update)\n\nR + E (Ruby of vigor - since this is his engage skill)\nQ not grants bonus AD and MAYBE AP, to stop him being too strong it might be best to limit him to being an anti-Ad / ADC support rather than super tank + super support\nW increases it's range and casts a slow (was thinking root, but too OP)\nE is a fissure, hurting (pushing asside) minions but only exploding on champions, dealing AOE knock up, making a path to reach target easier\n\nBetter for his kit, E being a charge that knocks minions aside and will knock up first champion hit (small range, not a dash that can go through walls) so he can combo it with W for the slow, and then Q for damage buff\n\nHis R should only enhance his other skills, so there should be consistency with their application. In my example E is a bit random\n\nSo if E typically is a short range pulse (smashes hammer into ground, acting like his W range) then in is a mini omni-directional knock back. It would mean he can't engage with it anymore (which was weak anyway) but has to apply it when peeling.\n\nThe with R+Q it has a buff on allies, imagine leona uses ultimate but you drop an R-Q-E, your adc is unfrozen and immune to cc for 1-2 seconds It'd really take skill because it's an advanced combo that's waste your passive, so there's still roam for counter play,\nR+W+E Would make a protective wall\nR+E+E would be the fissure, knocking enemy front liners to one side with default E, then the fissure would strike at back line targets (if they don't dodge)\n\nOf course, the rapid combo would be hard and limiting, but the R is an over time skill, like 10 seconds, So he has enough time to use each of his skills at least once.\n\nAlso, R would be cool if it created a shock-wave / pulse, that slowed time for like 1/2 a second, giving Taric time to use select another ability. If it was like Bard's ultimate, like a slow for all champs nearby, just long enough to kind of \"declare\" his intentions. When Taric drops his ultimate everyone should be like, \"we're about to get some buffs!\" the opposite of right now where his strengths often go unnoticed. \n\nAnyway, I like your idea, just giving my own variation, maybe something in the middle would work best","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Partholonian","date":"2015-04-20T23:47:30.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be afraid of the rework, if not for the fact that I hardly play him now in his current state.  He just doesn't feel like he has the impact on a fight that Leona or Braum have -- maybe that's because he's overnerfed, maybe it's because too much of his power is hidden, and maybe because his stun is so short range (well, not as short as Leona's, but she combos it with her gapcloser) and he doesn't have the mobility they do.\n\nOf course, they don't have heals, but in practice, his is so expensive it doesn't amount to much even if enemy damage is actually split between both players.  Or maybe it just feels that way because he's too busy building tank to build mana regen (although the flat mana on {{item:3110}} or {{item:3025}} helps some).  Maybe he should recover mana on basic attacks, or when he procs his passive?  That wouldn't be very safe, since he is melee, but taking a little damage isn't so bad anyway with the way his heal works (plus relic shield), so it might work out.\n\nAt least he's not going to turn the mana into long range poke like Jayce, or godlike mobility like Kassadin.\n\nHonestly, I feel like the only skill of his that isn't practically character-defining is his ult; if he doesn't have *reliable* peel and improve allies' armor, he isn't Taric.  Maybe his armor boost could become an active instead of always on (although his W already *has* an active, it's not nearly as character-defining as the armor buff IMO; \"the guy who has so much armor he shares it with everyone\" is just who he is, the shatter is just sort of there so he can have buttons to push).\n\nWhat if his aura was weaker most of the time, but he could activate it to double it (or even more, depending on the base strength) for a short window?  The armor shred on his current active W could be either eliminated, or moved to his passive (which requires landing AAs), and really who cares about the damage part.  That would make it feel more like a \"save allies\" button than a \"kill enemies\" button (and why does Taric need one of those anyway).  And man, would it ever feel awesome to have your ally barely survive something like a Draven ult because you timed it just right.  (Well, to people who enjoy saving their allies as much or more than they enjoy killing their enemies.  But that's the only kind who's ever going to play Taric anyway.)\n\nSome changes to his heal could be possible too, although I don't really feel like there's anything wrong with it as it is except its mana cost feels really, really high compared to his mana availability (even when hardly casting anything else ever).\n\nP.S. You outplay Taric by *not trying to assassinate the guy standing right next to Taric*.  His stun doesn't need to become unreliable just because assassins go in on Taric-protected targets and fail and then whine about it.  They deserve to fail, if they're doing that.  They should learn to pick their targets more effectively.","replies":[{"poster":"Apollocliptic","date":"2015-04-21T09:04:20.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taric's heal and shatter are his best two skills. Because his stun is so weak, to protect his allies, his W R combo is best, because a stunned jynx will \"ALMOST\" die to a burst combo, but survive thanks to a timely heal and armour buff, then shatter the enemies armour, burst Jynx's (or graves) damage with R, and they can burst the enemy instead. Removing the shatter would make Taric's active (or visual) presence even worse, since he will be even more reliant on his aura's, and unless the armour aura was significantly buffed (to like + 50) it wouldn't be a \"save ally\" skill. Right now it's a subtle, improve on trading, since Taric increases ally damage, and reduces incoming damage, while healing, I honestly think his stun is the worst part of his Kit, because it is so underpowered. \n\nAs for mana, don't build Iceborn, as great as it is in practice, it simply takes too long. As taric I don't even start Frozen heart until I have my first 3 items, and if enemy team has AP support/jungle, I start on Ages before I finish frozen heart anyway.\nI don't even build FotM anymore, I find it a waste, if you build straight into Righteous Glory (don't finish it, since you need to get a sightstone pretty early too) it completely compensates his sustain issues, and his heal scales with HP so his heal is much stronger early, and can be used more frequently thanks to the buff in mana and regen upon leveling. \n{{item:3010}} {{item:2049}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3800}} {{item:3082}} /{{item:3024}} {{item:3105}} \nBuild in that order and max out W, and you'll have a much smoother early game and sustain stops being an issue altogether. Final item being situational, Frozen mallet for more CC, HP, healing and peel (and dmg), iceborn then gives the extra 10% mana, more armour, aoe dmg and slow. spirit visage also gives him the extra cdr, makes him much tankier, but is better on very high ap teams (assuming you first picked Taric or something), Zereks Herold for crd more hp and even more ally damage and sustain. Thorn if you're the only tank and taking a lot of AD poke, you get my drift.\n\nI think his ulti could use tweaking, his stun needs something (on hit slow that can be triggered into a stun by subsequent skill, allied attack or timer is a popular one) or a defensive gap closer, something like when he heals an ally, he moves faster towards them or something. \n\nThe above build means that he can heal fine without it being changed. I often end a Taric game with +20K in healing, which is more than some champs did damage. And i find Iron locket plus his heals makes up for not haveing FoTM. You can still build it ofc, but I find that if you build it first, his sustain is much weaker because he needs that early mana item, and he heals more from his Q than from FotM anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Partholonian","date":"2015-04-22T00:26:37.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aren't you giving up a lot of gold by not having any support item though?
