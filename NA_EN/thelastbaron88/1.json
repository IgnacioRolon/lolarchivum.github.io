Garen&#039;s Judgement not interacting with Crit anymore makes Youmuu&#039;s a total waste of gold on him, as it has been for most champions who would build brutalizer in the top lane, while Brutalizer is an essential lane item for AD casters who want to actually snowball an advantage in lane. The whole reason Black Cleaver was reworked the first time was to address this problem and give AD Casters a good item to build their brutalizer into, and while I absolutely love the New Cleaver and its build path, it DOES present one of the major problems that the Previous Cleaver was meant to address. Maybe a new, damage-focused Stark's Fervor? Or something new and imaginative, that'd be cool too. Something more damage-dealing in nature.\n\nAlso I&#039;d like to say that even though I&#039;ve been pretty vocal about a lot of recent changes, RiotRepertoir is fast becoming my favorite Rioter just for being on these forums so much and being so upfront with people. And for actually caring about stuff, even stuff that no other Rioter even talks about, like Quinn. The Ashe rework is perhaps the SINGLE best example of a rework making a champion who was widely thought could never be viable and balanced, and making her a fair, top tier pick. I don&#039;t know if he&#039;s answered this question before, but I am really curious why he chose to take Crit off of Judgement for the upcoming Garen rework. The actual reasoning and thought process, I mean. At any rate, keep up the good work; I hope that other Rioters will follow your example and be more involved with the community directly in the future as well.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-10T21:17:39.813+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Though someone else in the thread already mentioned it, Garen's E will scale with crit on his update.\n\nWith that out of the way, Brutalizer does stick out like a sore thumb right now in that there's only one item that builds out of it, and that item has a pretty niche set of stats.

Liandry's isn't a bad item but it is hugely niche, that's why it's always picked up on the same champions and ignored by almost everyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-11T01:36:25.440+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I think the thing with Youmuu's is that although AD assissins/casters do buy it and get good use out of it, it's hard to argue it's actually optimal for them.

As someone who plays mages almost exclusively, I can tell you I'd be much happier to play people like Talon and Zed if their item choices didn't feel so incredibly bad. It's hard to find any item someone like Zed builds that doesn't feel suboptimal, because champions like that just have to pick and choose from items that quite honestly were intended for either ADCs or bruisers, Youmuu's being the only exception.\n\nAD casters are in desperate need of items catering specifically to them, imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-08-11T04:47:07.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, all assassins except Critgar (Rengar with Infinity Edge).

I think Youmuu's is most commonly built on casters due to Brutalizer not building into anything else (other than Warrior Enchant), and on ADCs for other reasons. \n\nYou've got a point about only certain champions building Liandry's. It's an item that should have seen a LOT of use during Tank Meta, if it were actually fulfilling its proper niche, I think. I guess it speaks volumes for it not to be popular on so many champions under the circumstances.\n\nSince it's mostly balanced around DoT mages, maybe something could be done that allows it to tankbust effectively on other types of mage? I don't really have any ideas on that one, but Item Team comes up with some really cool stuff sometimes. Maybe they have something in mind?\n\nActually one quick idea, the base stats on Liandry's don't seem all that great for dealing with tanks because tanks have higher MR and build MR, while Liandry's offers Flat MPen. What if Liandry's ticks could lower magic resist or something? Idk, prolly not a good idea but that's all I have atm.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-08-10T23:34:21.946+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"RR not only listening to the feedback, answering questions about nearly every balance/rework issue, but also sharing trivia about the behind the scene.\n\nHero of the Boards.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastBaron88","date":"2015-08-10T23:47:04.682+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do we have to do to get him a pay raise?

This wouldn't have been _game-changing_ or anything, but it would have been a nerf, as YG is extremely good on Garen.\n2. Infinity Edge. Crit Garen isn't exactly super optimal.
