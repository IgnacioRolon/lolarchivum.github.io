For some reason I assumed there was some heady philosophical statement being made. Actually on that subject, his quote about there being nothing else for him but killing... is this just a declaration of his fixation, or also a reference to the understanding that the people who released him would see him dead if he ever stopped doing their dirty work for them? I remember hearing a Rioter state that there would be more insight into why Jhin is the way he is in future lore releases, and I'm really looking forward to that.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-04-28T21:33:38.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what we know about Jhin,he actually seems to be highly depressive and killing is the only thing that brings him joy,so I'd say that statement is more focused on his fixation(I mean his lore even implies that jhin will likely betray his superiors eventually and start doing his own thing again)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheLastBaron88","date":"2016-04-28T20:16:02.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a pretty good one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OurLestrade","date":"2016-04-28T19:41:52.301+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably the 4 shots","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastBaron88","date":"2016-04-28T19:47:38.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you mean?

Japan and China make sense because Japan essentially jacked the Chinese alphabet. So much so that to this day, Kanji can be read in either the chinese or japanese interpretation, and context is crucial in determining which is appropriate when. Or at least, that's my understanding of the situation. Korea too though? I don't really know the extent to which their culture and history are interrelated with their neighbors.
