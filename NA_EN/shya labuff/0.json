I have a limited amount of data (10 gigs) I can use a month, for just playing 3 or 4 games a day this isn't an issue, but exceptionally large patches could get me cut off from internet or receive outrages overage fee's. I haven't seen anywhere in the patch notes that say how big the patches will be.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-26T21:41:29.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This one is a content patch so it's going to be fairly large; however, there's also the risk of it being even larger in case it finds any bad game files that it needs to repair.  The patch should be about 800mb, but some players have seen up to 3gb today.  \n\nMake sure you're running on a stable connection so your network doesn't need to backtrack while grabbing updates from the patching server.  Hope this helps, and good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Shya LaBuff","date":"2017-07-26T21:56:44.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ended up with it being nearly 3gig, luckily I went to a buddies house for the patch.
