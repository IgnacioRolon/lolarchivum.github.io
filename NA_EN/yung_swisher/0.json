This is a game where I was coming off of several bad defeats, and was extremely tilted. So when I get autofilled, get cheesed, and go 0/6/0 in like 15 minutes, who wouldn&#039;t be legitimately upset? Now let me give you some context of who I am. I have extreme anxiety and depression, and I&#039;m legitimately trying to clean up my attitude. I, however, have been honor 0 since **before the leveling rework came out.** That&#039;s what, since last June? Almost a year, and I&#039;ve played an estimated 400-500 matches since the time of being hit with level 0 honor. In what world is this fair?\n\nYes, the chat is negative, but it isn&#039;t aimed at anyone. This leads me to believe that honor 0 and 1 players are legitimately treated as second class citizens. If you notice on my report card, there is literally only **1 game** where there was an actual potentially infringing chat log, out of the hundred or so I played in the last week or two. If someone plays even slightly less than I do, based on that **10 month** time span of playing hundreds of clean games, it would take that person **at least two full seasons to achieve honor level 2, not including the time where your honor level is locked and you gain no progress, because that&#039;s a thing that happens. Your honor progress gets locked because you&#039;re &quot;too toxic to reform at the current time.&quot;** Why is this a thing? This is over punitive. I get that we want people to legitimately reform through this system, but it takes a literal fucking eternity and doesn&#039;t encourage people to reform their attitude, it encourages them to be a shithead because they know they&#039;re never getting rewards on their account ever again.\n\nNot to mention you can still buy keys, so the crafting system is pointless, ESPECIALLY when you own every champion and have 15+ rune pages. I&#039;ve got **38 chests and 2 key fragments from leveling capsules.** This system takes TOO LONG to recover from, and is too punitive.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/aojXSGS.png\nHooray, this is now locked for at least 30-40-50 games, because that makes sense. People, when punished, shouldn't be able to show reform immediately after being warned about their behavior.\n\n??????????","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2018-04-12T03:26:21.240+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It *is* super tilting to listen to your teammate talking like this, but of course that doesn't mean you need to receive a restriction. You can submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and discuss this with Player Support, I've seen them remove a ban or two for self-depracating chat.\n\nHowever, please still keep in mind that this still kills the mood for your team! It's alright to apologize and accept that you aren't doing well, or are doing downright horrible, but try and focus on the game so the team can too! You can definitely get some pointers on how to improve in the game and how to deal with the stress and frustration, so I hope you stick around and talk if you need to.","replies":[{"poster":"yung swisher","date":"2018-04-12T04:56:27.303+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, I'm doing better today. I just wanted feedback, because I know being NEGATIVE is reportable, but IDK **_how much_** negative is punishable. To me this isn't really punishable behavior because it didn't really last for longer than 10 minutes when it was clear the game was over, I didn't start antagonizing people, I was just in a really bad spot.\n\nI'm taking this opportunity to quit ADC, because it's a miserable role. Giving mid a try, and I'm watching a lot of coaching vids like LS's coaching vids, learning a lot about wave management and pressure, and priority. Thanks for the tip about support ticket, I think I'll give it a shot. I'm not hopeful, though.","replies":[{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2018-04-12T13:56:08.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically, constantly using chat when you really dont need to, and saying negative things, is negative.

His team would have been tilted and would have reported him anyway for inting because nobody,  who wasn't toxic in the first place,  would report someone who says \"I have no idea what I'm fucking doing\". Especially when it's jungle. I secondary jungle now, but before I learned, autofilling jungle in ranked would be a goddamned nightmare. This is a great example of why IFS is bad and if you talk to any reds maybe direct them to stuff like this instead of just working damage control as if the system isn't super-broken.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-12T03:16:55.981+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is probably the weirdest log i have seen recently..\n\nLogically it is not deserved, but the system does not take context into account, plus it looks like you also tilted off the face of the earth and annoyed your team..","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf43830737","date":"2018-04-12T04:39:06.149+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"the system is beyond fucked. hell i havent seen a single new thing to the ban/ Tribunal system since probably s3. fyi i was a victim of this too","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-12T20:21:18.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Faith Silver,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=QlVua5JT,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-04-12T04:39:06.149+0000)\n>\n> the system is beyond fucked. hell i havent seen a single new thing to the ban/ Tribunal system since probably s3. fyi i was a victim of this too\n\n* Instant feedback and actually telling people why they got punished\n\n* Far faster and more accurate processing of reports\n\n* Ability to see your account standing\n\n* Honor system and hextech crafting - _positive_ reasons to not be toxic.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Surefire23","date":"2018-04-12T05:24:15.145+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"RANKED is a competitive mode and should be treated as such. I understand that people who just want to relax and enjoy the game should be allowed to have their space, but that designated \"safe space\" should really be normals. Ranked games should have a bit more leeway in terms of what you are allowed to say to your teammates because at this point unless you are showering praise on your teammates, what you are saying is probably reportable over enough instances. Relaying the same information as the announcer is considered reportable btw. So if you are anything but honor 5 you might as well rip out your chat key because that thing is only useful for getting banned. The IFS definitions of what is considered \"negative behavior\" are way too vaguely defined and not clearly set forth anywhere. Nowdays chat restrictions can get handed out for simply saying a teammates score over and over again since that can be considered \"score-shaming\", whether you are counting a positive KDA climb or a negative one. yes, like I mentioned earlier, you can actually get chat restricted for simply relaying the same information as the scoreboard and announcer at the same pace  (not talking about spamming btw, but rather i.e. once per kill or death you type their KDA, or say \"an enemy/ally has been slain\"). So by your logic, please RIOT, ban the announcer, she is relentlessly offensive, death shaming me each death every game by announcing it to the entire game. Lolwhat? Those with the authority to make the decisions over the insane need to baby-proof this game are clearly imagining it being played in an ideal world by ideal people living ideal lives. Who knows, the community might actually grow and flourish overall if you let humans be human instead of trying to enforce a fourth-grade classroom's rules on the entire community.","replies":[{"poster":"yung swisher","date":"2018-04-12T05:31:14.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For some reason I feel like you were legitimately flaming someone by repeating their score over and over in chat every time they died.","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2018-04-12T16:52:24.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's funny how the banned people complain about context for awful chat \"BUT BUT THEY STARTED IT\", and then expect everyone else to ignore it and pretend that it can't be trolling under certain circumstances.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DonkeyBalls","date":"2018-04-12T04:46:48.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honor system is a travesty of justice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Surefire23","date":"2018-04-12T05:39:48.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"yep, don't deny it. I had an adc who was intentionally feeding because someone (not me) flamed him after his first death so he SAID IN CHAT that he was going to int. so once per death I would type his updated score, which was a steady climb from 0-2 to 0-12 at a fairly rapid pace. obviously he was upset and decided to report me and since that is technically a valid offense, chat restriction. my point is, performing the exact same function at the exact same pace as THE SCOREBOARD should maybe not be on the list of things to be considered bannable, or please, remove the announcer since it clearly enourages offensive behavior.","replies":[]}]}
