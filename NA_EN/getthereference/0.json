I&#039;m helping a friend get into league but I&#039;ve found that a lot of the champions who I used at the start (and that Riot lets you use at the start) are no longer as beginner friendly as they were when I first started playing... Trying to explain Ryze&#039;s passive and how to use him effectively was frustrating to say the least.. and the same goes for Ashe too. I can appreciate requiring more interactive gameplay in certain champs but not all of them. I feel we shouldn&#039;t alienate new players with starter champs that have hard to understand mechanics so I was thinking of replacing Ryze and Ashe with... I dunno... Annie and Caitlyn for the tutorial because their kits are easier to grasp at the start. Any thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2015-07-16T02:34:10.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something I've found is that if you don't outright say the champ's hard to use, you're better off than if you said they were. If they're new, they have no idea what a hard champion looks like, so it's all pretty much the same to them. You could easily put any champions in that list and they'd be fine because they have no clue if they were difficult from the start.\n\nAlso, Ashe has a fairly basic kit. I don't see the issue with her in the beginners list.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SH Azykan","date":"2015-07-15T09:23:09.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annie would be good, especially since her Q helps her last hit (emphasize that in the tutorial last hitting is important)\n\nI'd probably say Ashe is fine for the tutorial though. She has a pretty low skill floor still.","replies":[]}]}
