What I particularly like about them is that they are designed from the ground up to give agency to _both_ the player and their opponent. They are proof that agency and fun aren't this zero-sum game where one side's gain is the other's loss, and the tremendous power and versatility that get attached to these effects benefit everyone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Craft Zeppelin","date":"2017-12-18T07:14:07.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sole existence of Karthus is one.\nAnd it is extremely effective.","replies":[{"poster":"PokladnicaZla","date":"2017-12-18T08:17:34.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't Karthus just get a huge buff to his R?","replies":[{"poster":"Maple Crusader","date":"2017-12-21T18:56:36.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CoffeeMug,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=btEkviOq,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2017-12-18T08:17:34.439+0000)\n>\n> Didn&#x27;t Karthus just get a huge buff to his R?\n\nHe did, he got 75% AP ratio on his ult.

WE NEED MOAR WAYS TO TROLL. For example a new champ should get an ability like kalista ult except without the knockup and the user would have full control over the ally, even when deciding where they go hehehehehe.","replies":[{"poster":"i cant move wtf","date":"2017-12-18T17:01:08.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they're worth the \"danger.\"  A troll can ruin a game if they want to on most any champ just by intentionally feeding.  I think trolls are pretty rare though and the report system is good enough that it's not enough of a justification to limit how many of these abilities are in the game.  Just my opinion of course.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Asudurga","date":"2017-12-18T16:12:25.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Picking {{champion:157}} Kappa\n\nFor real though, I think {{champion:268}} ult can be good for either team as it's a situational ability.
