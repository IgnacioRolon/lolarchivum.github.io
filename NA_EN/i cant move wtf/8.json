If those properties are to still exist, you can't have a crazy strong buff too.","replies":[{"poster":"i cant move wtf","date":"2018-10-05T16:40:06.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I was thinking in place of the exp and large sum of gold.

This denies them gold, gives you gold, gives you objectives, and allows you to strategize and plot around your enemies. That's immensely powerful in a fog of war game, even if it's not easily quantifiable. Denying enemies those advantages that vision offers is STRONG, because vision is the #1 way to avoid death in this game.","replies":[{"poster":"i cant move wtf","date":"2018-10-05T21:17:21.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually in agreement with you that vision is very powerful.

This would mean at level 1, over the course of the 2 minute buff, you would regenerate 1 full warding totem charge (instead of half a charge), and a ward placed during the buff would last 104 seconds (instead of 90.)  If you have sweeper instead, you will regenerate 2.6 sweeps (instead of 1.3), with each sweep lasting 11.5 seconds (instead of 10).  If you had farsight alteration, you would regenerate 1.2 charges (instead of 0.6), and it would reveal an area for 5.75 seconds (instead of 5).\n\nMaybe those numbers are a bit high but that seems like another angle a vision buff could take.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CIayman","date":"2018-10-05T17:50:10.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=i cant move wtf,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kdZLKqHQ,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-10-05T16:40:06.453+0000)\n>\n> Vision is hard to quantify \n\nVision score exists, you know","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-05T15:47:36.333+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if there was a Pokemon Red, Blue, green, and now there is close to 150 champions....","replies":[{"poster":"Glaricion","date":"2018-10-06T18:37:39.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god, who is going to be Mew?\n\nWhat's that? 150 is going to be Zelos and 151 is going to be Kassadin's daughter?\n\nI COULD JUST TRACK YOU DOWN AND SMOOCH YOU RAYDY, COULD JUST TRACE YOUR IP TO GIVE YOU A SMOOCH\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux}}","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-08T00:32:10.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awe I am totally not creeped out at all <3","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rubberduckie666","date":"2018-10-05T17:44:58.792+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"how about we just reintroduce smite buffs back into the game? ya know, like how when smiting gromp you basically got a thornmail for a bit to help with tanky junglers clear and the such?","replies":[]},{"poster":"RookPusher","date":"2018-10-05T16:42:59.274+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should allow you to play your knife like a tin whistle and summon a dragon\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXm6aMtpGTo","replies":[{"poster":"WeaselRune","date":"2018-10-06T12:31:43.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normally...
