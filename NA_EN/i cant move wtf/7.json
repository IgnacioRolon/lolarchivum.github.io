Why?  Because I&#039;m a nerd and I find this stuff interesting.\n\nThe change would be the chess equivalent to introducing a new &quot;opening move&quot; into the game.  It would have very drastic and far-reaching consequences in both pre-game and in-game in my opinion.\n\nThe change is this:\n\n*Make jungle camp exp split evenly among all nearby teammates that have smite.*\n\nThe most notable and obvious thing I think would result from this is that &quot;double jg&quot; comps would become viable.  To what extent?  I&#039;m not sure.  But in a &quot;double jg&quot; comp I think top lane would remain mostly the same, as well as mid, and a duo bot would be replaced with any champ that can reliably farm under tower and is resistant to dives and all-ins (maybe swain or vlad?).  Then the two junglers could be any jungle champs really.\n\nI don&#039;t think this composition would replace the standard one, but instead would be competitive only when all the players on the team are competent at the new roles of &quot;2nd jg&quot; and &quot;solo bot.&quot;\n\nI imagine there might be some pretty crazy early dragon and rift secures possible with this.  As well as some really punishing double ganks or double invades.\n\nI could also see a comp that starts with 2 jungles and one later rejoins a lane after they get a certain level or do some invade/gank antics early.\n\nWhat do you think would happen?  Would it be good for the game?  Bad?  Would it not matter and no one would go double jungle even if exp could be shared among smiters?  Share your thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Ratpocalypse","date":"2018-02-21T22:19:38.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is the exp split evenly among all teammates that have the jungle item?\n\nUsually when I Double Jungle me and my partner don't share camps, unless we're invading to snag the camp quicker.\n\nLinked below is a video showcasing that Double Jungle is a very strong and fun strategy.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/n4-jZylsbRE","replies":[]},{"poster":"TwinkiePro","date":"2017-09-17T04:22:26.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exp used to split to nearby teammates. This actually caused more strife than anything as the XP was taken from the jungler, who would now be down a level.
