They&#039;re not dramatic, they&#039;re mandatory on any auto attacker and they don&#039;t change in any way what an auto attacker is already doing.  &quot;Oh, you like to auto attack a lot?  Let me give you this keystone that lets you auto attack better while you auto attack.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe concept of Lethal Tempo is kind of cool but again it&#039;s implemented in a way that requires no change in how the player will approach their engagements.  The player that takes Lethal Tempo doesn&#039;t need to manage when the keystone will activate because they&#039;re already going to try to get more auto attacks after 1.5 seconds of damaging an enemy.  They&#039;re again just getting rewarded for what they&#039;re already going to do.\r\n\r\nThe only keystones I think were successes are Unsealed Spellbook, Predator, Dark Harvest and Kleptomancy (except on Ezreal and Gp).  I&#039;m not saying they&#039;re perfect but they all cause the player that has them to change their mindset with how they&#039;re going to play that champion.  And isn&#039;t that the reason the rune system was reworked in the first place?","replies":[{"poster":"Kazekiba","date":"2017-12-11T15:25:46.898+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"No. \nMasteries were reworked to enable more game-to-game decision making, and not just \"take these runes all the time every time on every champ.\" \nOf course they're class-specific, that's why runes are in the 5 categories.  There's more thought to which one you take and when beyond \"what is the most powerful keystone right now?\" and that's what Riot was aiming for (as well as removing the IP sink so newbies could get into the game easier.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-12-11T15:18:50.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel that's the general attitude to runes despite players only willing to test those runes in a handful of games.

But does that really change the fact that enhancing something you'll already be doing doesn't make for an interesting choice? (not to mention it will be useless on champions outside that class)","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-12-12T14:17:45.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By all means it can be interesting, I simply think that we as players are still latched on to the simplicity of take X rune to get more damage.  This isn't entirely bad but it does misinform players as to what they should or should not take from game to game.  \n\nIn the end this is still preseason and balance still has plenty of time to make things more enticing for players if something isn't discovered in the coming months to shake things up.","replies":[{"poster":"i cant move wtf","date":"2017-12-12T15:44:51.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure, but does that change the fact that \"take X for more damage\" is a weak design for a rune to begin with, especially for a keystone?","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-12-12T17:49:38.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think weak is the correct word for it.
