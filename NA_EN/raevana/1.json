Throughout the games, and especially during the normal, I had multiple disconnects (no less than 10 on the normal), and a LOT of lag, but my latency is fine and holds stead in the 40s. I'm on a wired connection, and while playing the last game was on discord. They could hear me while I was dc'd, so I'm fairly certain the issue isn't my net. \r\n\r\nPlease help. Seriously. Game is almost unplayable like this. We lost the game because I got dc'd so much. I'll click to move, and nothing happens. Stuff around me continues to move, and then I'll get the 'attempting to reconnect' message. Oooor, I'll click to move, and my champ runs off in a random direction and I can't do anything about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Raevana","date":"2016-10-31T00:47:28.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems to have fixed itself without me doing anything.

It was completely fine then, no issues whatsoever. But now.. I don't know. I don't even want to play normals because it's not fair to the rest of my team if we lose because I dc and my champ walks into the enemy or just stops where it is and I reconnect to find myself back at the nexus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MiIf Fortune","date":"2016-10-22T23:30:00.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"happening to me, dont know what to do too :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Total Eclipse","date":"2016-10-22T22:26:55.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I've been getting really bad lag since I signed in on Saturday.

If anyone has any ideas that'd be great because lagging out or being dc'd and then watching your champ run right into the enemy is not fun at all, and I feel bad that this is occurring because it negatively impacts my teammates as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raevana","date":"2016-10-22T15:17:30.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.. so, I relogged and its still happening. -.-","replies":[]}]}
