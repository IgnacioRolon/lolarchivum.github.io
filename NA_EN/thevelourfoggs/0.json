For instance, my champion will die, and the screen will NOT grey out. Everything will keep moving, and so will my champion. I then get the death screen around 15 seconds in. Not only that, but that skip will cause me to jump from places. Minion deaths don't register until 5 seconds in, and neither will my attacks. It gets annoying whatever team I'm on bashes me and does not help at all when I ask. What's also weird is that both laptops I own run league better than my desktop, although they get FPS lag, but nothing as serious as my desktop.\r\n\r\nspecs:\r\nGTX nVidia 960\r\nIntel Core i5-4690k CPU @ 3.5 GHz\r\n8 GB RAM\r\n\r\nIn game specs:\r\nHIghest res (1900 x 1080 I think)\r\nFPS capped at 144\r\nGraphics on high (if any lower, skipping gets intense if any lower)\r\n\r\nIf you need more info on either of the specs, please let me know. Any help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-27T20:20:20.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure this is an FPS issue. Usually, when this happens, it's caused by the client not receiving packets from the server due to packet loss along the connection. Most of the time, local network settings are the cause of this, so I recommend working through our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step.\n\nLet me know if these issues persist through those changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dadron3","date":"2016-09-26T20:38:51.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had a similar problem not that long ago, check if there are any updates for your graphics drivers.\n\n If there aren't try checking which gpu your computer is using, in my case my computer was using my built in intel card instead of my nvidia. I found out by running \"device manager\" and then checking under display adapters. Update them regardless. \n\nDepending on your symptoms from there, perhaps it'd be easier to address. Also right click on your desktop open \"NVidia Control Panel\" --->3d Settings---> Manage 3d settings--->Make sure your preffered graphics card is your nvidia processor..\n\nHope this helps, best of luck!","replies":[]}]}
