The stories line up in content, sure, we don't know how common a town vanishing to the void is, nor do we know WHEN these events respectively took place. Specifically, if Kai'sa's father *had* been away, it would probably have been mentioned, and she would have know and been actively looking for him...likely for longer than those three days.\n\nMy suspicion is that they might be from the same town, certainly, but I'm not convinced they're related.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-10-30T22:17:01.255+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah.

Kass.
