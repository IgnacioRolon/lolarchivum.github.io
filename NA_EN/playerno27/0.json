When Runes Reforged was announced to us, I made [a thread](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/eEy1fPHn-predictions-regarding-runes-reforged) that said much of the above, explaining that the system would ultimately do nothing to fix the mistakes of previous mastery systems. Once the dust settled, we'd go back to having a solved game with little added gameplay or diversity for anyone, and the game would be just as difficult to balance as before, if not more difficult. I was not the only person to suggest this, either. Fast-forward to now, and to no-one's surprise, that's exactly what happened. One did not need several years' worth of game design experience to realize that repeating the exact same structural mistakes as before would lead to identical structural problems, though that certainly did not stop Riot from following through with an update that created huge disruptions in balance, for little to no positive long-term impact.\n\nAt this point, I think Riot needs to realize that any kind of generalized bonus system, no matter how refined or overly strong, will simply not be good for League. Any such system will fail to generate meaningful diversity, and will only continue to generate balance issues and design limitations, as champions will be forced to remain functional under those bonuses, often to the point of being balanced so hard around them that they become dysfunctional otherwise. This is why I think Runes Reforged needs to go completely, and beyond that Riot should also reevaluate what they want out of summoner spells and even items, both of which are systems I think have also aged poorly. Summoner Spells were once a selling point that distinguished League from the competition, along with its runes and masteries, but in the long run the system has ended up homogenizing the strengths and playstyles of many champions, as well as warping the game's balance in unsavory ways. Similarly, items were once intended to allow players to fully customize their champions' playstyles, but that fell apart very quickly when Riot realized that certain stats and effects were simply not healthy on certain kits. At this point, none of these systems generate real diversity, and frequently they fail to generate meaningful gameplay as well, with marksman items in particular still mostly acting as stat sticks. Additionally, all of these systems only complicate balance further, adding layers upon layers of conditionals that hamper the devs' ability to focus on what makes certain champions specifically imbalanced or unhealthy.\n\nAt this point, we have plenty of MOBAs that have shown greater diversity of gameplay, as well as stabler balancing overall, via entirely new customization systems that are tailored to individual champions, such as HotS's talent system. While League should probably not try to copy these systems, as Dota did, Riot could certainly take a page out of those games and try to streamline its own systems.

I think they should stay the same (+ bring back Clairvoyance and Clarity, it was fun to use in normals). The problem with runes and masteries is that Riot doesn't understand that adding more damage can't help game and balance, but can only make it worse. I would suggest completely reverting runes and masteries to what they were is Season 5 (just coppied) and making rune pages + all runes free.\n\nNow about the game core. I think that the game mechanich were fine before season 6. We didn't have ADC assassins most of the time and the game was generally more balanced and healthy. I would remove catch up xp completely, remove tower first blood (maybe), buff towers (and give nexus & inhib towers lasers because now they cant even kill a single inhib minion, also tanks can tank too much), change the jungle to it's S5/6 state and make tower give me shield again. I would rework ADC items (just make them the same as they were before Preseason 6), rework support items (the same as S5 items, no more broken {{item:3504}} ), rework assassins items (again the same as it was in Season 5, when the game was acutally balanced) + bring back armor pen and remove lethality. Okay, I would basicly rework almost every single item to what it used to be in S5 (probably the most balanced season) and bring back a lot (SotO, brutalizer, averica blade etc.) that were removed (sry DFG, you're not coming back, neither are you sated devourer). About champions, base stats would be changed and probably some abilities. It was a complete tank meta, but at least it was balanced and actually satisfying to win a game. Also, I would bring back IP and IP rewards after the game.\n\nThis is basicly how I would balance the game, revert assassins update, revert marksmen update, revert mage update, no more elemental dragons, old S5 runes and masteries, NEFT SUPPORTS. Cancerous tanky meta, but at least it works and is balanced. It probably wouldn't make most of the players quit the game because from what I've been seeing for the past 2.5 seasons (since Preseason 6), players can accept radical changes, even if they completely hate them and have no fun in the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Naranjo1","date":"2018-05-21T16:29:26.816+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We need Season 5 runes and masteries back (+ make all runes and pages free), not keystones.
