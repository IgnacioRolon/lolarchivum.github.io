Since then I do not have sound in client and it is getting pretty annoying since I do not get those sound notifications for game found or your turn in champ select (very useful to have them...). This provokes temporary bans of 6 and 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nEverything else with sound in the computer is working correctly, even in game. My only problem is the client.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T21:26:56.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm yea that is pretty strange. I'm not *entirely* sure how this happened, but it sounds like the audio portion of your config files might have went a little screwy. Double check that your sound settings are still enabled and turned up in the client options, but let me know if that's not helping at all and we may need to repair that client.","replies":[]}]}
