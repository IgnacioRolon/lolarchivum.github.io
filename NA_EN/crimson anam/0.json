That's more or less the standard difference between small g gods and big G Gods in most settings.  Very powerful (though finite) beings versus infinite beings.  I'm aware of the distinction, I'm just surprised Riot seems to be going that route after saying they weren't going that route.

(?)\n\nThat's possible, I suppose?  The question of why a God needs prayer or fetishes to accomplish something in the mortal world is always an interesting philosophical conundrum that says quite a bit about the being.  Mostly I'm sitting here wondering if Naga is actually Eternal or just another primordial being like Kindred.  Because once you step out of time things start getting interesting.  There's always going to be *something* that's Eternal, even if it's just impersonal Law.  But whatever that Eternal thing (or things) is goes a long way in defining the underlying basis of a setting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2016-11-03T15:35:51.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Inept Maverick,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=HHlgv9Jo,comment-id=000100020001,timestamp=2016-11-03T12:45:35.409+0000)\n>\n> Well, Naga is not a playable character (directly) and so therefore isn&#x27;t really breaking this rule.
