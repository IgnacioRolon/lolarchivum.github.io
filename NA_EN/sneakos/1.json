Right now, it only shows his current range as he is channeling and not his max range. This makes it difficult to judge how long you should channel, since you don&#039;t know what his total max range is.\r\n\r\nIs this intended or a bug?","replies":[{"poster":"LtRandolph","date":"2016-01-14T22:18:40.924+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bug.

Is it so important to meet these deadlines, that you'd allow so many bugs to slip through? Even the hotfix deadlines are ridiculous as hell. Why are you guys not aiming for quality deliverance? Whoever enforces these deadlines needs to be smacked upside the head and stop constraining you guys from giving your player base the best experience possible.\n\nNothing's perfect, of course, but when you guys catch something that's big or small but have to shrug your shoulders and wait for next patch because of a deadline is pretty crappy. Delay it if you need to. Waiting a month and a half for the next patch (because of Christmas/New Years) wasn't a big deal or a pain. What's the reason for these 2-3 week deadlines? What are you guys rushing/aiming for?","replies":[{"poster":"WalkingInACircle","date":"2016-01-15T05:50:19.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because there are a lot of teams working on different things, and if you hold up the whole sh'bang for one team's work, you put everything else on hold.

I've played Zac in basically 50% of my games the past couple months.  Then today pops up and my chromas are gone as well as my E is bugged to the point where I CAN'T play Zac.  It's not feasible.  The preview of his E length for ganks as well as the indicator showing you where your jump will max out at both being broken makes this champion unplayable.
