Per our [chroma FAQ](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/qX5pL8Ty-question-about-chromas?comment=00000000), chromas on sale would reappear every other IP sale.  We've had 2 so far that I can recall, so you might not see chromas from the last sale.  With the conversion of IP and change in the air, I highly recommend ramping up for the [blue essence shop](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012640908) during preseason for now.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
