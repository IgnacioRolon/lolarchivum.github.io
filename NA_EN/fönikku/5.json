We're still wanting to hear feedback from players on how we can improve the new runes system (that's kinda how we got the \"hide preset pages\" checkbox in the first place). Send us your feedback on the [gameplay board](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance) so our devs can get more awareness on this idea.","replies":[]}]}
