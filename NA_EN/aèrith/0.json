Even on a simple skill though I'd argue there's a lot of value in adding a bit of distinctiveness/ways to optimize things a bit more. Putting something there basically to enable a person that's played 200 games on Ahri to pull off the occasional cool play with Foxfire that a player with only 20 games might not be aware of or able to execute at the right time. Using Vayne's tumble directly into a piece of terrain to AA as soon as possible's a good example of that to my mind. A lot of the time it's not the right call, or not relevant, and new Vayne players won't do it deliberately. It does add an extra option to the skill, making it a bit richer though, without making the skill's core concept or tooltip more difficult to understand. Similarly Ezreal's Essence Flux being able to hit himself's often irrelevant or a poor idea to utilize.

Do we really need to add another level of complexity on a champion who, in all rights,has a fairly high skill cap already?\n\nIf this was Ryze, then yes, there's huge room for improvement/change, because as we've seen in worlds, when Ryze is strong, he's dominating. But this isn't Ryze. This is a champion who's not a pick up and play champion and is one you've got to learn all the little nuances in her kit to really bring out her strength. And that's one of my issues lately with a lot of league champs that there are a LOT of complicated mechanics, skills, and high capabilities of play. But veriety is the spice of life and for every Azir, Rek'sai and Gnar, we need our Annies and Garens.\n\nAlso, while Garen is a simplistic one note champion, he's at least PLAYABLE. The reason he's not 'viable' as you put it is because the Metagame competitively doesn't look towards tanky guys with no hard cc and some decent damage. They're looking at mostly mobility and assassin potential, because that's what's strongest right now. Mordekaiser doesn't even HAVE the ability to be playable. His Early game is such an uphill climb thanks to his ability cost, his lack of mobility, and the fact that his one defining feature outside of his ulti (being incredibly durable thanks to his shield) was not only nerfed hard in a far different era of League but was also indirectly nerfed thanks to the season changes to Armor/MR that made Assassins the power house they are today. The only time you see him at his old power level is when he's so stupidly fed.

Toning down the damage amp on her charm takes away from Ahri's power in lane and as a duelist overall at any point in the game. Yes being more of a Kite mage can be a good thing for Ahri making her better situated in poke comps in team fights a more mobile xerath if you will. However a mere movement speed buff isn't enough because that power has simply been taken away and not properly distributed. A  big part of that I believe has to do with the nature of her W and perhaps even the power of her R. If you want her Kiting to be more powerful why not significantly increase the power of those? \n\nWith Q being in the air and Ahri being given a movement speed buff she could theoretically reposition, W, R and or both and use that as a means of effective damage.  You'd also  have to adjust the nature of W's target at farther distances, allowing players to either chose to use it as a multi-target spell or a single target spell whether or not they specifically click a specific champion when the skill is used for all three fox fires to hit one enemy. That is in my opinion the only way to effectively shift her power without taking a crucial amount of it away and leaving Ahri players to simply have better mechanics or lane matchups to make up for the loss of not one but **TWO** damage sources.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-01-14T17:15:54.180+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any chance of you improving her sustain instead of more numbers for mage ahri?

When she lands a Charm, will she follow it up with Orb of Deception for additional damage, to optimize the effect of Charm-- or will she just run, maximizing her distance?\n\nI think that the *choice* made is better than the *unclear optimzation* made. It's a choice between distance and damage-- not damage and damage.\n\n>giving her a speed boost while her Q's in the air to allow more reposition plays and kiting while casting.\n\nWhy not \n\n1: Give her innate Furor on Fox-Fire / Foku-Fu as a passive? e.g. \"Ahri gains 6-10% Movement Speed that decays over 2.5 seconds whenever she damages an enemy with a single target effect (Her basic attacks, Fox-Fire, and Charm).\"\n2: Remove the penalty on Spirit Rush for spacing out the casts. Currently, the cooldown doesn't begin until you use the last charge, which means that Ahri is indirectly rewarded for unloading all of them quickly. Increasing the base cooldown by 10 seconds, then having the cooldown start when it is first cast, increases the know-ability of the cooldown. Plus, I'm pretty sure that most recast abilities go on CD when they're first activated-- though I could be completely wrong. :V\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uzXWWVZ9,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-14T05:36:09.890+0000)\n>\n> Ammo system Ahri always had a dash charge up to escape with, so was much harder for opponents to deal with and was disincentivized from trying to make cool multi dash plays.\n\n-\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uzXWWVZ9,comment-id=00000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-14T07:10:13.782+0000)\n>\n> I'd be more inclined to find ways to give her other mobility or access her ult a bit more often.

Reducing them incentivizes her to spam them to move quickly in a direction or get damage out as fast as possible.\n\nBecause of these, why not increase the duration of the recast availability? Then Ahri is able to use one to go out, but perhaps later decide she wants to go back in-- and then rush out again. It seems like an easy solution to bolstering her kiting patterns without affecting her assassin traits.\n[Also see the common idea which is basically \"Furor enchant naturally on Fox-Fire\" above]\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uzXWWVZ9,comment-id=00030005000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-14T08:14:19.341+0000)\n>\n> I'm with you there, both on the value of non champion defining skills sometimes being fairly simple (e.g. Rek'Sai's burrowed Q) and that Ahri's W's an example of such a skill.\n\n[I am responding to this whole post, I just thought I would clip the length.]\n\nIn my opinion, there aren't really cool plays to pull of with Fox-Fire past being intimately familiar with how it chooses targets and how much damage it does (getting kills on enemies that are running away is awesome :p).\nWhich I suppose are nuances that do make it have cool traits, but all of those traits could be done similarly by making the AI for it much more intelligent instead of by being a better gamer-- which sometimes makes me feel like I'm fighting the UI and not my opponents.\n\n...The number of times I've had Fox-Fires not target the correct minions and enemies to kill them is frustratingly high, so I'm likely biased in that regard.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AÃ¨rith","date":"2015-01-17T14:46:57.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just saw the PBE changes and I don't know.
