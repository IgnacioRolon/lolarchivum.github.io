Every one of his abilities summons an AI that can deal a lot of damage without Yorick risking going into combat and getting hurt\n2. Later in the game his ghouls are EXTREMELY spammable, just keep pressing Q, W, and E and you win.\n3. He has extremely fast movement speed with one of his abilities (I forget which one) and he can summon a ghoul that slows you, making him very hard to catch.\n\nI don't want to bother listing any more because I'm sure there is no way in the world to help someone see a different perspective now-a-days.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-09-29T01:03:30.456+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Considering how wrong all of this is, im just gonna assume you got shrecked by a Yorick, and you raged this thread into existence.

First of all, each ghoul only lasts 5 seconds at most, and his ultimate only lasts 10 seconds at most.  If you hit them with a few autoattacks or just let the minion wave kill them, they aren't a huge concern.  The same can't be said for his ultimate, but it's an ultimate, so it should be powerful.  On a side note, you get some gold for killing his ghouls, so if a Yorick is just throwing them at you, he's shooting himself in the foot.  Yorick isn't meant to be an artillery that just summons the ghouls, he's supposed to do some fighting himself.  That's why he's melee, has more brawler-like defense stats, etc.  So if a Yorick is just summoning ghouls, he's doing something wrong.  As for the last point, what about Lulu, Eve, Jayce, Nasus, Yi, Garen, Singed, etc.?  Having a large slow, large speed boost, or both isn't necessarily overpowered.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylvan Evergreen","date":"2014-09-29T02:46:21.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(At least there is one person that doesn't insult and harass me in threads like these.) While the gold for killing ghouls is better than no gold at all, killing the ghouls also denies you CS. So while you are killing the ghouls and only getting 5 gold per ghoul, you're being denied cs, which can give you ~20 gold per minion. Plus the ghouls will push you back in lane unless you want to be continuously poked down by them. Also yes, they do only last 5 seconds, but the cooldown on his q is almost instantly after the ghoul dies, and his w and e only have a 10 seconds cooldown that starts while the ghouls are still alive, making it very spammable if you have a lot of mana and mana regen. And the thing about the movement speed if mostly because he's far away from minions in the first place, so he has a ton of time to see that you're chasing hi and react, summoning a ghoul that does damage to you and speeds yorick up. It is also spammable especially with CDR, so it's very hard to chase a Yorick.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dicerson","date":"2014-09-29T03:27:35.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick's biggest problem, in my opinion, is that he has a few things he can do.\n\nIn lane phase he has an immense amount of pushing power, however this is countered by a good jungler\n\nIn the mid game, he can soak alot of damage and help an ally get revenge or turn a teamfight by reviving the carry, but he can be easily kited by a skilled ranged champ, i do it vs yorick's all the time.\n\nIn the late game he has very little actually going for him, his ult is the only useful thing he has. The ghouls die almost instantaneously to any AoE the enemy has, the effects and bonuses they give are primarily offensive, however yorick having mostly a tanky statline as well a low base MS and a melee attack range, cannot afford to effectively utilize these bonuses.\n\n\nIn essence, Yorick is 2 things.\n\nA Tanky mother fucker, and a lane pusher.\n\nWhat he is not?\n\nOP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeadCrusher","date":"2014-09-29T12:25:57.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His Q is countered by a blind or a block (like pantheons), and all his ghouls will stop chasing you if you step into the bush.
