First time I was able to buy items and as soon as I clicked to move it froze up on me. Second time it was frozen the second that I loaded into the game. I searched on google and didnt find any discussion about this so I thought I'd bring it up here. I uninstalled the game between attempts and am working on checking for updates and what not but I don't think it would have let me buy the first time if it was a driver issue right? Anyone have any ideas what it could be?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-08T16:30:54.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you recently updated Windows 10?
