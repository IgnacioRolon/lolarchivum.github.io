Very cool idea for a tank and theme.  Most of my concerns are purely on a balance side of things, as I think each ability is cool in its own way-\n\nPassive- This is straight up strong no matter how you slice it.  Simple but effective for a tank, but no counterplay here, so be careful.\n\nQ- The stacking component for a tank is smart but I'm not sure how practical it is... especially for a slow-moving tank.  Perhaps allow his other abilities to proc stacks?  Or maybe those effected by his passive aura will have stacks added to them naturally over a few seconds?\n\nW- A simple and thematic ability; the radius is probably too small, though.\n\nE- I recommend making this a skillshot or targeted AoE to add some counterplay.\n\nR- Really neat, but I think the duration is too short and I don't think it should deal damage over time (especially if it starts ticking instantly).  I think the slow and attack speed reduction, in addition to the sight limitations, for about 3 seconds instead, is ideal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-09T05:00:11.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"please leave a Comment or Review of Bolgerus down bellow =D","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-12T00:18:00.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hello everyone","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ANGUSdaGUY","date":"2015-01-07T11:03:07.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"12% is too damn high of a reduction","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-07T20:48:57.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"other than the Passive is there anything else you think needs tweaks, changes or rebalancing?","replies":[{"poster":"ANGUSdaGUY","date":"2015-01-10T06:34:05.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"4 strikes on cold strike. 5 is a bit much","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-11T21:43:47.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"anything else?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bayard","date":"2015-01-07T12:33:50.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^^ maybe it could scale, or attacking him made his reduction activate on them? just throwing around ideas.\n\nBut I think it'll be awesome for some new freljord people to come around.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-07T22:53:41.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which of the 3 Generals that once ruled under Bolgerus would you like to see next?\n\nAlisha, Tamer of the Drake.\n.an AD/AP Hybrid Ganking Jungle Fighter.\n\nCassandra, Phantom of Winter.\n.a AD Assassin with deceptive tricks.\n\nOrlon, then Fallen Hero.\n.a AD Combat Support/Fighter.","replies":[]}]}
