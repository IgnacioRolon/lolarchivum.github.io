Maybe a slight suggestion here, maybe might maybe even make a post about it\nI was hoping maybe Riot Should make a small team of users to just browse through the threads of champion ideas and concepts and give feed back to them and perhaps bring to light the ideas that get buried under lack of upvotes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-03-17T20:05:53.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your Feed Back i really appreciate it. as for Mulark's background & motive i don't really post my Champions Lore or back stories as people never give me feedback, they don't get the connections that i obviously spell out or they just simply hate it.\n\nBut for your sake i will make a brief summarize of Mulark's history:\nDuring the time of the Watchers people would often been \"sacrificed\" to these beings in exchange they will not bring harm to their villages, Mulark (real name forgotten) was 1 of these \"sacrifices\" that the Watchers used to amuse themselves with to kill a very VERY small portion of their boredom. as Mulark was amusing the Watchers they notice that he was capable of utilizing very minimal ice magic which kept him alive a lot longer then most of the other \"sacrificed\" ones but eventually he died. after years of being dead his soul still hungered for revenge not only against the Watchers but against those who made him the \"sacrifice\", now reunited with the remains of his body & using the cold powers of the Watchers he seeks vengeance.\n\nas for his R-Ability i'm thinking of changing it to something else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-17T18:39:04.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zero C00L,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=oEvXEoqd,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-17T18:32:41.307+0000)\n>\n> First time trawling the concept board and it's incredible to see the thought put into champion concepts! \n> \n> For Mulark in particular, it'd be helpful to understand what is the champion's motive.

The theme and mechanics are both present already, so it may just have to exist as-is.  I will say, though, that this almost feels like a self-cast only kind of ability.

This is another solid champion concept from you, as usual.  I do think Mulark plays it a little safe, though.  Most of his abilities are rehashed versions of existing ones, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but overall I think you could push him a bit further.\n\nPassive- Giving stacking resistances to a ranged magey support doesn't make much sense.  This would work better if he was melee, and would also synergize better with the magic damage on next auto component.\n\nQ- A slowing version of Fiddlesticks' crows.  I like it, especially because that's a neat mechanic that isn't used anywhere else right now.\n\nW- Having an infinite cast time tied to mana is very scary when you put it next to its interactions with towers.  I really like the theming here and the ability to dive.  What if instead, casting the storm on top of a tower reduced its target acquisition range?  Then you could harass near or even under a tower with someone like Vayne or Quinn without getting hit by the tower.  I'd also give it a designated cast time of 3-5 seconds.\n\nE- This seems like a pretty bland Nami E rehash.  Not too excited about this one and I don't really see how it interacts with the rest of the kit.\n\nR- A combination of Lissandra ult and Bard ult, yeah?  Pretty interesting concept and it could actually work decently well.  I'm just afraid that it's too similar to Lissandra in terms of both theme and mechanical execution.  Not sure if there's a way around this, though.\n\nBy the way, have you seen my [Mega Thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/uuQxluoH-lutzburgs-champion-concepts-mega-thread?show=flat) lately?  Last night I finished uploading the last one of my backlogged concepts- I'm finally finished!  I saved some really cool ones for last, including Rafa, Galahad and Doran.
