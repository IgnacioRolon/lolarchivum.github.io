Secondary: Assassin. Additional Roles: Jungler. \nStatistics: Attack Power: 5. Defense Power: 6. Ability Power: 2. Difficulty: 7.\n**Place of Origins:** Ionia.\n**Upon Selection:** *wondering through the cherry trees path* (eerie slowing singing).\n\n**Friends:** {{champion:30}}.\n**Enemies:** {{champion:43}}.\n\n**Appearance:** Gosuto is a 5’ft tall light grey-skinned spirit that is usually in a hunched posture, she has long black hair that covers the right side of her face & has green eyes & black lips. She wears a torn up dirt covered yukata that has lotus patterns on it with a white obi with the same design but it is also covered in dirt, both her hands & feet are black that reach up to her elbows & knees & she has a short blade sticking in the middle of her back. Her weapon is a 7’3ft long pronged spear (like a trident) with a rusty red fork head with a pair of bells tied bellow the prong with black ribbons.\n\n***Summoner Spells:***\n{{summoner:12}} & {{summoner:14}} \n\n***Item Builds:***\n***Starting Items:***\n{{item:2003}}/{{item:1055}}/{{item:3340}}.\n***Essential Items:***\n{{item:3153}}/{{item:3068}}/{{item:3272}}.\n***Offensive Items:***\n{{item:3078}}/{{item:3046}}/{{item:3022}}/{{item:3025}}.\n***Defensive Items:*** \n{{item:3075}}/{{item:3102}}/{{item:3026}}/{{item:3139}}. \n\nHealth: 449(+30). Health Regen.: 1.9(+0.40)\nMana: 327(+29). Mana Regen.: 1.8(+0.39)\nRange: 150(Melee). Attack Damage: 48(+3.0)\nArmor: 16(+2.1). Magic Res.: 30(+0)\nAttack Speed: 0.632(+2.2%). Move. Speed: 346.\n\n***Passive: Unrestful Spirit.***\nGosuto will have an old worn out cylinder paper lantern that hovers around her, each Basic Attack that Gosuto makes will have the lantern gain 1 ***Will-O-Wisp*** counter with the max being 3. When Gosuto has 3 stacks of ***Will-O-Wisp*** her 4th Basic Attack on an enemy Champion or Monster will have the lantern fire all 3 wisp at the target applying a D.O.T that will deal 3% of the targets Max HP as Magic Damage every 0.5 seconds for 1.5 seconds, after the lantern has shot the wisp it will go on a 8.5 second Cool Down before it can start gaining ***Will-O-Wisps***. If Gosuto has 3 stacks of ***Will-O-Wisp*** this Passive can be triggered by her Q or E Ability.\n> **Unrestful Spirit** is a Passive best used to help Gosuto to quickly burst down an enemy Champion or a Neutral, while the damage is not very overwhelming powerful is used in combos with her other Abilities then this Passive can help deal incredible damage.\n\n***Q-Ability: Lingering Specter.***\nRange: 450.\nCool Down: 13/12.5/12/11.5/11.\nCost: 60/70/80/90/100.\n**Passive:** when out of Combat Gosuto will gain 15% increased Movement Speed, but when she enters Combat she will lose her Movement Speed boost but her Attack Speed will be increased by 15%. After a 2.5 second delay after exiting Combat Gosuto will lose her Attack Speed boost but regains her Move Speed boost.\n**Activate Terrain:** after Gosuto has chosen a point within this Abilities Casting Range then upon its activation she will instantly teleport to that point, after Gosuto has teleported her next Basic Attack will deal 12% increased Damage. \n**Enemy Target:** if Rakia has chosen an enemy target within this Abilities Casting Range then upon its activation Gosuto will instantly teleport behind her target becoming attached to the targets back, after the teleport Gosuto will start Auto-Attacking the target dealing 3 Auto-Attacks every 0.25 seconds for 0.75 seconds dealing her current Attack Damage. During the 0.75 second D.O.T Gosuto will be untargetable & after the D.O.T she will pop out 100-range behind her target.\n> the **Lingering Specter** is a versatile Ability that allow Gosuto allow to keep up with her allies while also being able to quickly dish out Basic Attacks with its Passive, while the Activation can either Chase down targets & land an enhanced Basic Attack, use it as an Escape to create distance between her & her enemies or use it to close the distance on a target then deal 3 fast Auto-Attacks then pop of the target & land behind the target however I only recommend using this Ability on an enemy Champion when the target is alone & is no where near a Tower or other enemy Champions.\n\n***W-Ability: Haunting Presence.*** \nRange: 450. \nCool Down: 16/15.5/15/14.5/14.\nCost: 100.\nMagic Damage: 75/115/155/195/235(+20% bonus AP).\n**Passive:** when an enemy is within 235-radius of Gosuto they’re Movement Speed is reduced by 15%.\n**Activate:** after has chosen a single enemy target within this Abilities Casting Range then upon its activation Gosuto’s eyes glow green which places a hex on the target, after a 0.25 second delay after activation the hex will deal Magic Damage to the target while causing a 1 second Fear. If this Ability results in a kill then Gosuto will Heal herself by the amount of damage this Ability deals.\n>the passive effect of **Haunting Presence** will allow Gosuto to Slow the Movement Speed of enemy Champions just enough to allow her to keep up with weaken enemies, the activation gives Gosuto just enough CC to to interrupt her targets movements, attacks or any ability they try to use while also dealing very high nuke damage. while this Ability is able to Heal Gosuto it's not ideal to rely on it for that purpose in the early or mid game but it may be more usable as a decent Heal in the late game.\n\n***E-Ability: Creeping Horror.*** \nRange: 500. \nCool Down: 8.\nCost: 95.\nPhysical Damage: 85/105/125/145/165(+50% bonus AD).\n**Activate:** after Gosuto has chosen a point within this Abilities Casting Range then has a 350-range narrow path upon this Abilities activation Gosuto will disappear in a pool of shadow then reappears at the point, after appearing from a black hole on the ground at the chosen point Gosuto’s upper body will appear then she will thrust her pronged spear in the chosen path dealing Physical Damage to all enemies within the path while also lowering their Movement Speed by 35% for 1.75 seconds. After thrusting her pronged spear Gosuto will reaper at her original location which represented as the small pool of shadow. This Ability will count as an Auto-Attack that can trigger Item Effects & her Unrestful Spirit Passive.\n>**Creeping Horror** is Gosuto's main source of dealing decent minimal damage from a safe distance while also being able to trigger Item effects & a way to safely apply a fully stacked Unrestful Spirit, it can also be used to snipe enemies from the Fog of War or from a Bush.\n\n***R-Ability: Torturing Will.*** \nRange: 400.\nCool Down: 185/165/145.\nCost: 100.\nD.O.T: 80/100/120(+50% bonus AD). Total Damage: 240/300/360.\n**Activate:** after Gosuto has chosen a narrow path with this Ability then upon its activation she will then  thrust her pronged spear in the chosen direction, the 1st enemy Champion that the spear comes in contact with she will skewer her targets body applying a 1.5 second Suppression. For the duration of the Suppression Gosuto will send her own will into her target twisting the targets body dealing Physical Damage every 0.5 seconds.\n>for finishing off weaken enemies **Torturing Will** can secure easy kills or help set up easy kills for her allies, this Ability can also be combed into most of her other Abilities while also being a means of interrupting enemies.\n\n-\n\n> ***Gosuto’s Combos:***\n> **Combo 1 - All In.**\n> First buildup 1 stack of your Unrestful Spirit by Auto-Attacking an enemy Minion (or Monster if you’re in the Jungle) then uses your Q on the target of your choice to close the distance & 3 very fast “Basic Attacks” (2 too buildup the other 2 stacks of Unrestful Spirit then the 3rd one to activate Unrestful Spirit) to deal pretty big burst damage.\n> \n> **Combo 2 - Poke.**\n> Use your W to start this combo to deal minimal Magic Damage & land that Fear but before the Fear is triggered quickly use your E near where your target is then as the Fear is put into effect activate your E to nail the target with free Physical Damage while also applying the Slow.\n> \n> **Combo 3 - Harass.**\n> This Combo is basically your Poke but with your Unrestful Spirit, first fully stack your Passive then upon using the Poke Combo your E will trigger your Passive to apply more damage & really mess with your opponent.\n\n\nFor those of you who want to know what is Gosuto's LORE is i'm currently working on it but the short end is that when she was alive Rika *(her name when she was alive)* was a painter who loved doing landscape artwork, she loved living a peaceful life without a care in the world but she eventually married a wealthy land owner who turned out to be already married but is having an affair with Rika. eventually the land owners real wife found out about their affair & stab Rika in the back with a hidden blade after a very vicious argument & fight that took place in her house, well you kinda get the picture Rika was scorned in life so know she came back as a specter years later to get revenge on the land owner & his wife but they died when Noxus invaded Ionia so now she wonders around as a murderous spirit.","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-03-30T19:43:24.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-11T03:21:51.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, so more like a LeBlanc Distortion, but she can't choose whether or not she tethers back; she always does.

You've clearly been scared into a fit of insanity with this champion!

Mad with power, I say!!\n\nSeriously, though, her mobility is insane.  It's like she has two Kassadin's taped to her back.  I really like the passive (especially the visual) and the idea of a long range, semi global skillshot ult, but there's just too much mobility baked into this kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-03-11T03:13:04.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well her E is like {{champion:112}} Death Beam Ability, its not a teleport its like ummm where u slip behind someone then deliver a stealth attack then quickly pop back to your original location. i'm actually gonna change this ult to a close range Suppression where she physically tortures the targets body, i might also tweak her Q.\n\ni just poseted a new Champion, here is the link: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/MloZIZy7-champion-concept-hilda-the-curse-gunslinger.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-11T00:10:39.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will bump for now and check it out in detail tonight after work.  :)","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-03-11T00:21:20.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"k. i look forward to what you have to say =)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-03-09T05:05:53.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-03-10T20:35:24.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]}]}]}
