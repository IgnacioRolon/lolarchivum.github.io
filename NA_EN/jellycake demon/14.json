It doesn't seem overly thematic and I worry about the variance in how powerful it is based on nearby champions and whose AD values are being used.\n\nSpeaking of AD, everything about this champion screams AP.  I'd adjust all of his abilities to be AP and give him AP scaling as opposed to AD; especially if he's a support.\n\nHis visuals don't sound that different from Maokai's, though I'm also picturing a grungier Blackthorn Morgana, which is kind of neat.  His identity isn't quite unique enough from Mao's for my taste.\n\nThe sinkhole and passive are both really neat abilities.  I love that he roots himself to heal with his E but creates pitfalls for his enemies to thwart them from moving in on him to interrupt it.  Lots of counterplay there with blinks, dashes, etc. and choosing when the right time to root yourself is.\n\nRandom Ult Idea- Suolo summons a 'tree of life' at a target location, which quickly sprouts and blooms fruit over a few second duration.  After blooming, all allies within the massive radius of the tree have their health regeneration values drastically increased (like Janna's ult, only instead of Janna being the root of it, it's a tree).  The fruits on the tree will begin to vanish indicating how much effective health the tree has left to give to those underneath it.","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-02T08:28:11.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i changed his AD abilities to AP & i changed his ult, don't know if this is what you had in mind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-02T08:12:50.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i actually like your Ult idea much more, to be honost i was coming up blank on what his ult should really be. as for being part AD i was just throught that idea out but i geuss he should be a full AP Champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T08:14:43.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great, glad you liked it!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-01T22:14:33.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"any comments or reviews?","replies":[]}]}
