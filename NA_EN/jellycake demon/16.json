Vel&#039;Koz is interested in gathering information & learn about the living creatures of Runeterra, but Var&#039;Ure is more interested in studying the mind of other living beings in how they process information, how they function & how the human brain can allow the person to develop various \"special abilities\" or & how the human mental states (personality, there frame of mind).\nSo basically to me Vel&#039;Koz is sort of the mad scientist of the Void, while Var&#039;Ure is more on the lines of a psychiatrist...only more twisted in a way.\n\nPlease leave a Comment, Review any Feed Back or your Thoughts on my Concept please, I look forward to what you have to say.\n\nPrimary: Support.\nSecondary: Mage.\nAdditional Roles: Player Choice. \nStatistics: Attack Power: 2. Defense Power: 4. Ability Power: 7. Difficulty: 7.\n*Place of Origins:* ????.\n*Upon Selection:* Let&rsquo;s see what I can learn from these fresh minds.\n\nHealth: 388(+31). Health Regen.: 2.1(+0.38)\nMana: 279(+30). Mana Regen.: 2.0(+0.37)\nRange: 500(Range). Attack Damage: 24(+1.6)\nArmor: 14(+2.1). Magic Res.: 30(+0)\nAttack Speed: 0.630(+2.2%). Move. Speed: 342.\n\n**Friends:** {{champion:161}}.\n**Enemies:** None.\n\n**Appearance:** Var&rsquo;Ure is a 5&rsquo;4ft tall Void Being that is purplish in coloration with some pulsating blue marking on his tail, arms & head tentacles. All four of his eyes are black with a purple glowing iris. His chest, shoulders, back & mouth are encased in a form of bony exoskeleton that is some form of armor.\n\n***Summoner Spells:***\n{{summoner:4}} & {{summoner:7}}.\n\n***Item Builds:***\n***Starting Items:***\n{{item:2003}}/{{item:3303}}/{{item:3340}}.\n***Essential Items:***\n{{item:3092}}/{{item:2045}}/{{item:3174}}/{{item:3275}}.\n***Offensive Items:***\n{{item:3100}}/{{item:3027}}/{{item:3285}}/{{item:3089}}.\n***Defensive Items:***\n{{item:3065}}/{{item:3102}}/{{item:3025}}/{{item:3110}}.\n\n> **Gameplay - Pros:** Var&#039;Ure is a AP Support/Mage that excels at dealing quick burst damage with Ability Combos but his biggest strength is his Ability to hinder the enemy team by warping the enemy Champions minds from forcing an enemy to attack their allies, making an enemy be unable to fight back or severally weaken enemies either by making their offense weak or make them easier targets to kill.\n> \n> **Gameplay - Cons:** unfortunately Var'Ure has no form of escape for either himself or any of his allies, while he can disrupt enemies but if he uses his Abilities at the wrong moment he leaves himself wide open for attack, now while he dose have a small amount of sustainability with his main Passive it will fall short in Mid to Late Game as his enemies will eventually be able to pretty much make it pointless.\n\n***Passive: Cerebral Drain.***\nevery 1.85 seconds Var&rsquo;Ures next Basic Attack will drain the mental energy from his target Healing Var&rsquo;Ure by 3%(+5% bonus AP) of the damage he dealt.\n> **Cerebral Drain** is a good way for Var'Ure to keep himself in lane with its Heal, so using your Basic Attacks on Minions is a good way to quickly restore your health, if Var'Ure is pitted against an enemy Champion this will only help him stay in the fight long enough for him to keep helping his allies.\n\n***Q-Ability: Plagued Thoughts.***\nRange: 500.\nCool Down: 22/21/20/19/18.\nCost: 110.\nMagic Damage: 65/95/125/155/185(+40% bonus AP).\n**Activate:** after Var&rsquo;Ure has chosen a single enemy Champion within this Abilities Casting Range then upon its activation Var&rsquo;Ure will infect the targets mind, after the initial cast the target will be dealt Magic Damage & for the next 1.5 seconds after the initial activation the infected Champion will start Auto-Attacking a random enemy Champion within 200-radius of itself.\n>now **Plagued Thoughts** is gonna be Var'Ures main source of his disruption & CC while also contributing some extra damage by forcing the enemy Champion to Auto-Attack the other enemy Champions, however because it is his main CC Ability if Var'Ure uses this at the wrong time he will leave both himself  & his allies open for counter attacks.\n\n***W-Ability: False Image.***\nRange: 400.\nCool Down: 20/19/18/17/16.\nCost: 60/70/80/90/100.\nMagic Damage: 40/60/80/100/120(+60% bonus AP).\n**Activate:** after Var&rsquo;Ure has chosen a single enemy Champion within this Abilities Casting Range then upon its activation Var&rsquo;Ure will corrupt the targets mind, after the initial activation Var&rsquo;Ure will deal Magic Damage to the target as well as trick the targets mind in making all allied Champions beside Var&rsquo;Ure Invisible to the affected Champion for 2 seconds.\n>for **False Image** this Ability is meant for taking out a key player on the enemy team out of fight since Var'Ure practically makes his entire team Invisible to that 1 enemy Champion, but this dose make Var'Ure an instant target for that affected enemy since he is not affected by his own Ability so he will have to have a plan to capitalize on this.  \n\n***E-Ability: Mental Illness.***\nRange: 450.\nCool Down: 17/16/15/14/13.\nCost: 55/65/75/85/95.\nD.O.T: 30/40/50/60/70(+30% bonus AP).\n**Activate:** after Var&rsquo;Ure has chosen a single enemy target within this Abilities Casting Range then upon its activation Var&rsquo;Ure will twist the targets mind, after the initial activation the affected target will continue to be dealt Magic Damage every 0.5 seconds for 2 seconds & for the duration of this Ability the affected target will have their Attack & Movement Speed be Slowed by 30% & the target Attack Damage will deal 10% less damage.\n>the Activation **Mental Illness** allows Var'Ure to contribute to fights damage wise while also applying a minimal Debuff to the target, now this Ability is a good follow up for Var'Ure to use after casting any of his other Abilities.\n\n***R-Ability: Shattered Minds.***\nRange: 550.\nCool Down: 135/125/115.\nCost: 100.\nMagic Damage: 145/175/205(+50% bonus AP).\n**Activate:** after Var&rsquo;Ure has chosen a 200-radius location within this Abilities Casting Range then upon its activation Var&rsquo;Ure will have the 5 tentacles on his head fire a bolt of energy at each enemy Champion that&rsquo;s within the chosen radius, after a the initial cast the bolts of energy will travel towards each Champion & when they make contact they will deal Magic Damage by shattering the targets mind Stunning the Champion in place for 1.25 seconds while also taking 10% increase damage from Champions Basic Attacks for the duration of the Stun.\n>for small or large fights **Shattered Minds** is great for giving your team an edge in a fight as it not only deals minimal damage but it will cripple the enemy team if they are hit by this Ability by Stunning them & allowing Champions Basic Attacks to deal more damage wither its from allied or enemy Champions.\n\n-\n\n**Var'Ures Ability Combos:**\n**Combo #1 - Confused & Angry:** in small little fights either in Lane or in the Jungle when there are at least 2 enemy Champions this combo is great for causing confusing on them. first use your **W** on the champion that can deal the most damage so that your ally cannot be harmed from that target, then quickly after casting **W** cast your **Q** on the other enemy Champion to apply more pressure to the main target.\n\n**Combo #2 - Obey My Command:** this combo if for when you managed to land your **R** on multiple enemies, after your **R** manages to hit quickly cast your **Q** to neutralize the the Stun & force the enemy Champion to attack their vulnerable teammates.\n\n-\n\n**Var'Ures Interactions with Champions:**\n{{champion:3}} - Taunt & Joke Interaction.\nTaunt- \"This being is carved & fashioned from rock, yet it can think & convey emotion. Fascinating!\"\nTaunt - \"Interesting a non-living being able to have thoughts & emotions, i must study it.\"\nJoke - \"Rock's for brains....i fail to see the humor in that remark.\"\n\n{{champion:150}} - Taunt & Joke Interaction.\nTaunt - \"Although it is unable to communicate by verbal interactions the creature is able to convey its thoughts through physical gestures.\"\nJoke - \"I feel my mind being scrambled after reading its thoughts, give me a second to collect myself.\"\n\n{{champion:412}} - Taunt & Joke Interaction.\nTaunt - \"Such depraved thoughts, your mind is a vessel of madness...I find this interesting.\"\nJoke - \"Subject is immersed in thoughts that one would classify as twisted & cruel, my kind of mind.\"\n\n{{champion:236}} - Taunt & Joke Interaction.\nTaunt - \"So that is your driving force to pursue your foe.\"\nTaunt - \"Is this woman worth all of this mental stress & physical fatigue?\"\nTaunt - \"Will killing this person bring you the peace of mind you seek?\"\nJoke - \"Your anguish sustains me.\"\n\n{{champion:161}} - Taunt & Joke Interaction.\nTaunt - \"You & I have different views on these creatures Vel'Koz.\"\nTaunt - \"Interfere with my studies Vel'Koz & I will destroy you.\" \nJoke - \"Must be a pain having an eye that big.\"\nJoke - \"Don't you burn your eye with that laser of yours?\"\n\n{{champion:222}} - Taunt & Jokes Interaction.\nTaunt - \"Such chaotic thoughts, how do you live with this frame of mind?\"\nTaunt - \"There is no meaning in your brains inner-workings.\"\nJoke - \"Maybe it's a good thing that your a little crazy.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2016-01-05T06:15:51.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ello everyone =D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-10-08T19:23:14.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hello, please leave a comment =)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-04-10T02:46:55.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-04-11T19:56:24.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-04-13T23:08:01.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-05-01T20:55:38.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-05-12T21:42:34.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-05-30T21:24:15.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-09-03T19:27:39.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"reallifejedi","date":"2015-04-21T21:19:16.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you should do more concepts\nand tip put var'ure in the concept and they will apear under the search name","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-04-21T22:10:22.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you but i have A LOT more concepts.\n\naside from that do you have any Feed Back on Var'Ure?","replies":[{"poster":"reallifejedi","date":"2015-04-26T11:22:50.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also go through your concepts and put var'ure and it'll all show up under that communal name \nthat is how i look at mine all at once","replies":[]},{"poster":"reallifejedi","date":"2015-04-26T11:21:42.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's all really great \nmy first concept from half a year ago has only about what your concept has","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-07T21:45:27.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The W visuals make sense.

Specifically I think the targeted \"invisibility\" of allies is a really neat concept.  Not sure exactly how it might play out but it's a very interesting idea that's worth exploring.\n\nHowever, I have to give you the same criticism as your other concept that you shared with me today and say that Varoure is suffering from an identity crisis.  His passive and the passive of his E combine to make him pretty much a mega strong AP marksman.  If he builds attack speed, plus a little Nashor's Tooth action, the damage he'd be pumping out as a \"mage\" or \"support\" would be massive and super sustainable.  There's a big issue here.\n\nThe Ultimate sounds pretty neat but I can't help but feel it's too similar to Morgana's Ultimate, unless I didn't quite grasp how it works.","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-04-07T21:22:31.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> His passive and the passive of his E combine to make him pretty much a mega strong AP marksman.
