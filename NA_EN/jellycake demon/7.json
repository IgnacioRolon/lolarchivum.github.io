At the end of this Abilities duration this Ability will then go on its Cool Down.\n>**Corrosion Salvo is a small steroid that allows Geb'Vex to pump out steady flow of damage with his Auto-Attacks.\n\n**_W-Ability: Salivate._**\nRange: 500.\nCool Down: 19/18/17/16/15.\nCost: 60/70/80/90/100.\nDamage Reduction: 8/9/10/11/12%.\nSlow: 17/19/21/23/25%.\n**Activate:** after Geb&rsquo;Vex has chosen a single enemy target within this Abilities Casting Range then upon its activation Geb&rsquo;Vex will send 1 of its heads to hover over the target, for 5 seconds the head will not only Reveal the chosen target but will start drooling all over the target reducing the amount of damage the target deals with both Basic Attacks & Abilities while also having their Attack & Movement Speed Slow by a set percentage. For the duration of this Ability Geb'Vexs remaining head will be declaring all the Basic Attacks but if the Passive is about to be triggered it will still deal its full effect, at the end of this Abilities duration it will go on its Cool Down.\n>for 1 on 1 engagements **Salivate** allows Geb'Vex to have a better chance to out trade an enemy Champion while also keeping Vision on the target so they can't hide in the bush to stop Geb'Vexs assault.\n\n**_E-Ability: Bodily Possession._**\nRange: 450.\nCool Down: 17/16/15/14/13.\nCost: 40/60/80/100/120.\nPhysical Damage: 55/95/125/165/205(+50% bonus AD).\nAdditional Physical Damage: 15/35/55/75/95(+20% bonus AD).\n**Enemy Activate:** after Geb&rsquo;Vex has chosen a single enemy Champion within this Abilities Casting Range then upon its activation Geb&rsquo;Vex will instantly teleport its body to the chosen target, after a 0.25 second delay after the initial cast Geb&rsquo;Vexs body will constrict the target dealing Physical Damage & Rooting the target for 1.25 seconds. After the duration of the Root Geb&rsquo;Vexs will remain on the chosen target for 2 seconds & every 0.5 seconds the body will squeeze the target dealing Physical Damage. while Geb'Vex has its body wrapped on a target its body acts as an untargetable object & the enemy must attack Geb'Vexs skeletal armor plating.\n**Allied Activate:** after Geb&rsquo;Vex has chosen a single allied Champion within this Abilities Casting Range then upon its activation Geb&rsquo;Vex will instantly teleport its body to the chosen target, after the initial cast Geb&rsquo;Vexs body will strap itself to the targets body for 2 seconds. For the 2 second duration Geb&rsquo;Vex can recast this Ability to have Geb&rsquo;Vexs heads & small piece of its skeletal armor instantly Teleport to its body.\n>**Bodily Possession** is Geb'Vexs most versatile tool in their kit as it can be used either as a long-range Nuke & Root with an added effect of a D.O.T great for quickly take down targets especially in 1 on 1 fights, or Geb'Vex can use this Ability as an emergency escape tool as long as he has a teammate that is running away so Geb'Vex can quickly escape from a bad encounter.\n\n**_R-Ability: Toxic Cannon._**\nRange: 1750.\nCool Down: 185/165/145.\nCost: 110.\nPhysical Damage: 275/335/395(+40% bonus AD).\n**Activate:** after Geb&rsquo;Vex has activated this Ability both of Geb&rsquo;Vexs heads will be secreting toxic chemicals that will gather into a ball between them while their body has its limbs wrapped around them for 1.5 seconds, while this Ability is Channeling Geb&rsquo;Vex can aim the narrow path that the ball will travel down after the Channel. After the Channel Geb&rsquo;Vex will fire the ball of toxic chemicals in the chosen direction at the time, the first enemy that the ball comes in contact with will explode covering a 300-radius & dealing Physical Damage to all enemies within the radius while also applying a 65% Movement Speed Slow to all affected enemy Champions for 1.25 seconds.\n>mainly for large scale team fights **Toxic Cannon** allows Geb'Vex to not only nuke enemies in a large radius but also allows him to Slow enemies so that both him & his team can keep up with fleeing enemies.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-07T21:44:30.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thanks for clarifying.  That makes a bit more sense to me now.","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-04-07T22:00:17.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"np =)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-07T20:19:48.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are some cool ideas going on with this concept (especially the Ultimate) and I will say that calling Geb'Vex a \"support Kog'maw\" is a bit of an over-generalization.  However, the similarities are very pronounced and I feel like this kit is at odds with itself.  The Passive and Q are clearly ADC-oriented, but the W, R and especially the E are all heavily support-centric.  I can't imagine why a marksman would ever want to \"twisted advance\" themselves to their target and put themselves into melee range.  That just seems silly, except in a few 1v1 duel scenarios, which are pretty rare in League.\n\nThere are also some thematic inconsistencies here... If Salivate is used, then there's only one head, which means that most of the \"dual head\" abilities found in the rest of the kit won't work.  On top of that, the W ability just seems overloaded to me.  It does a TON; especially for a targeted, ranged ability.\n\nThe Ultimate is my favorite part and I love the idea of a toxic goop bowling ball that explodes on contact.  Kinda like a Nami ult with a Collateral Damage component at the end.  I love it; just not on an ADC... at least not if it has to retain the channeling effect.","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-04-07T21:14:33.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for your Feed Back Lutzburg, so it seems that i should change Geb'Vex to a AD Support/Marksmen instead of him being a AD Marksmen that is built to stick to 1 target, cripple it & take it down.\n\n> I can't imagine why a marksman would ever want to \"twisted advance\" themselves to their target and put themselves into melee range\n\nwell actually when Geb'Vex uses his E to wrap his body on the target he leaves behind his skeletal armor where the heads are that is what the enemy Team has to attack because the body that is wrapped around a target is a non-targetable object.\n\n> If Salivate is used, then there's only one head, which means that most of the \"dual head\" abilities found in the rest of the kit won't work.\n\nactually when Geb'Vex is not using Salivate the heads take turns auto-attack 1 will fire at the target then on the next Basic Attack the other head will declare the attack & then rinse & repeat, when Salivate is in use the remaining head will do all the auto-attacks & when the Passive is gonna be used both heads will steal use it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JLaww","date":"2015-04-07T03:57:37.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a mix between Singed, Twitch, and Kog'maw","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-04-07T18:54:33.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'll admit that Geb'Vex dose sound like a blend of Champions but i assure you that i made this AD Marksmen with no attentions to make him sound as such. Geb'Vex is a sadistic creature that loves to use its chemical abilities & mobile body parts seek out helpless victims & then torture the victim so he can feed on their pain & suffering.\n\nthe main gameplay style of Geb'Vex is to stick to 1 enemy Champion & use his W & E to cripple the target & apply massive pressure & then use its Main Passive & Q for its decent amount of damage output. the Ult is a way for Geb'Vex to weaken an entire team if he manages to land this Channeled Skill-Shot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Critanaro","date":"2015-04-07T13:16:13.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"support kog maw","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-04-07T18:49:24.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i kinda knew i get a reply like this cause they both use chemical based Abilities, but unlike Kog'Maw Geb'Vex is a AD Marksmen that is about sticking to 1 enemy & cripple them making them easier to kill. as for the desire factor to Geb'Vex he is on the lines of a sadistic creature that loves to use its chemical abilities to torture living creatures & feed on their pain & suffering.","replies":[]}]}]}
