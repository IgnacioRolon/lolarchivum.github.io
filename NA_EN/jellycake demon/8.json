The damage immunity from minions would give this guy a MASSIVE advantage in early lane fights.  Perhaps he takes reduced damage instead, that scales with level until he's immune to them at level 18?\n\nWhat is the purpose of his passive only being active when he's near a champion?  So that he can't jungle?\n\nThe every other attack component of his W also seems strong... maybe make it every 3-4 attacks instead?  Every other seems a bit excessive.","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-14T08:08:40.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lutzburg i luv u. you are the only 1 who actually gives me good feedback on my concepts & i totally agree with what you say on all the Concepts you have just reviewed. i will make the changes you have listed on Orath, Bolgerus & Gore-Bog.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-14T08:29:32.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JellyJackJak22,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=YxZfMEsa,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-01-14T08:08:40.456+0000)\n>\n> Lutzburg i luv u. you are the only 1 who actually gives me good feedback on my concepts & i totally agree with what you say on all the Concepts you have just reviewed. i will make the changes you have listed on Orath, Bolgerus & Gore-Bog.\n\nHappy to help!
