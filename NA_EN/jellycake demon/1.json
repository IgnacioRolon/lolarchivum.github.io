It's almost too much to even comment on!  The one thing I'll say is that, in competitive play, being forced to stand still for even .75 seconds after getting a kill, EVEN WHILE IMMUNE TO DAMAGE, absolutely breaks this guy.  Positioning is so important and it could mean the difference between getting out alive or letting an enemy get away.  Imagine Swain using Nevermove or Cait placing a trap right under this guy while he's showing off.  No bueno, amigo.","replies":[{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-02T08:09:58.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahahah i know i was kind joking on having it be that long, i meant to change so its an instant thing instead of a pose show-off.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-02T08:12:29.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it happened passively via audio cues or something extrasensory and freed up the player to not restrict their movements, then it'd be fine.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jellycake Demon","date":"2015-01-01T01:44:45.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so dose this guy seem like a luchador & will he be a good Champion to have & play? leave a comment bellow on your thoughts about Raphael","replies":[]}]}
