Some players in Egypt are able to lower their latency by a bit while using [**WTFast**](https://www.wtfast.com), however, this VPN only offers a 30-day trial, so it can be an expensive long-term solution. Other than that, just making sure your local network settings are configured according to our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) can help.\n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"LorChinChin","date":"2017-01-29T23:45:52.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"look man i'm gonna be super straight with you. all utopian thoughts aside, i know players are the same everywhere. but at least in NA, they can be reasoned with since i know their native language. i can't go back to eune..please.. give me ping plz b0ss ;_;","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-30T05:05:43.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you notice any changes in your latency after trying WTFast or the configurations I mentioned above?","replies":[{"poster":"LorChinChin","date":"2017-01-30T19:48:49.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I got a 30 ms reduction.. so now it's at 180 instead of 210.

As I mentioned before, your physical location will continue to be a bottleneck in this situation because your connection has to travel such a long distance and has to travel through certain pathways in order to reach our NA servers in the first place. Since you're a lot closer to our EUNE and EUW servers, you'll definitely see lower latency (ping) while playing on those regions than you will on NA.\n\n**TL;DR** Not even the holiest blessing from *Papa Franku* himself would have a huge effect on your latency. The NA Region is optimized to service players residing or playing from North America, therefore higher latency is pretty common when you're so far away from the servers. :(\n\nI hope that clears up the confusion.
