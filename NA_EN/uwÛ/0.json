Nothing more.\n\nDid you read the thread? It's asking for a refund on money spent on a permabanned account. If that were possible, then a permabanned player would simply get all their money back, start a new account, and repurchase everything. The only change would be the user/summoner names. Thus, such a thing would amount to a free name change.\n\nIf someone is unable to control themselves on an account they've dumped $1500 into, that's their problem. Literally, a problem. A big one. But it's theirs and no one else's. In cases of \"softcore insults,\" such players always get several punishments before losing the account, with a warning that the final punishment is a permaban and the player is on \"thin ice.\" You don't have to like the rules to follow them. If someone says \"no shoes in my house because of the carpets, or I'll kick you out,\" then you don't wear shoes in their house, even if you think it's a stupid rule because they don't have any carpets. Or you wear shoes and get kicked out.\n\nThe statistic isn't about how many players \"deserve\" a permaban. It's about how many actually get one. There are quite a few players I've seen over the years who should've been severely punished according to Riot's rules but got away with it, including one instance of someone screaming homophobic slurs to \"teach us a lesson\" while inting to the tune of 0/26 in 18 minutes. No suspension. The system is terrified of false positives (even though there still are false positives sometimes). This kind of behavior _is_ shameful - incredibly so. When someone gets fed off an inting leveling script or something and starts screaming \"how are you so bad, lol, ezezezezez\" in all chat, do you think that's nice? Do you think their parents would be proud? I think they should feel bad about it. What you call \"behavior shaming\" is also known as \"teaching.\" This is how people learn what behavior is acceptable and what isn't.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2020-01-28T12:10:13.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-28T13:09:03.085+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Illabethe,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=gBO6lHV8,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2020-01-28T12:10:13.061+0000)\n>\n> And your problem is that you have an ego and opinion about the development of someone else's temper/patience and believe that you're entitled to that opinion.\n> \n> Unless you are a \"Vulcan\" your standard is impossible to achieve, and you yourself most likely violate it yourself.

Shopping? \n> \n> Workplace: Everyone is on their phone every second they get completely unsocial to coworkers. They are neither maturing nor using social skills.\n> \n> School: Girls are malicious and try to assassinate each others' reputations because they often believe that's how you get ahead in society. Men perform class warfare, trying to use a skillset/talent to separate themselves. Neither are calm minded, or can often keep themselves in check for \"polite society.\"\n> \n> Shopping: People fight for parking, run into and bump into each other, and often lay claim to the same item for purchase.

You expect perfect composition in a game that can change in 10 seconds. Not only that; in a game where the result of a game can change in 10 seconds, and to where the final objective can take thousands of hours of individually separated micro games invested to achieve. Humans are emotional beings, and are driven by those emotions. There is no avoiding it. (Have you never watched pros stream? Many of them are far more toxic than the people you are condemning, but they get away with it because the culpability in pro play shifts from verbal behavior to actual behavior; In other words, in High elo, you're more likely to get banned for playing Teemo Mid support than you are for being the person who rages and abuses power to attack said Teemo Mid Support (Unless there's a massive social network response that calls BS on it and then Riot responds 2 weeks later to the other person)\n> \n> -------------------------------------------\n> \n> The statistic is not about who has actually been banned. It's a fictional number to behavior shame, much like you are doing.\n> \n> Furthermore, how do you KNOW your example wasn't banned? Riot is extremely strict on homophobia. You might not have received a message but I can assure you; if they did it more than once they were banned.\n> \n> The system is not terrified of false positives. It's an unthinking computer designed to pick up when people use common words associated with bans: You, \"Insert name,\" GG are included in that library. Here's how it works. Unless it picks up a report of \"Hate\" it simply counts the number of games where you received a report flag versus the number of times the system verified you used keywords.\n> \n> -After about 200 verbal flags that have confirmed keywords, you will receive a 5 game chat ban.\n> -After about 240 verbal flags that have confirmed keywords, you will receive a 10 game chat ban.\n> -Upon receiving and going through a 10 game chat ban, you will be flagged as an urgent account.\n> -If you receive another 10 verbal flags in a short period after a 10 game chat ban, you will receive a 2 week account ban.\n> -If you complete a 2 week chat ban and receive ANY flags, it will be reviewed by a behavior specialist who then will decide to impose a permanent ban.\n> \n> (In other words, you can be perma banned right after a 2 week ban if your first game back resulted in a tragic loss where player decisions cascaded into a loss in front of your eyes, and you react to it).\n> \n> ----------------------------------------------\n> \n> The reality about parents: Parents are not perfect, and have never been successful at behavior modeling. Otherwise, we'd be a nonwar utopia. They try. And, if they succeed, that does make their child a more productive adult. But that usually doesn't translate into not cussing, not having temper fits, and it certainly doesn't help with mental disorders.\n\nI read about half of that and then I noticed that I was only halfway through a long, impassioned defense of being a goddamn asshole.\n\nYou don't have to be perfect. You can get mad. You can even get mad in chat/gameplay sometimes and Riot will give you a pass. But some people are just so invested into being goddamn assholes all the time that Riot can't turn a blind eye to it anymore and they start slapping the shit out of that account until and unless the player finds some self-respect and behaves. If that doesn't happen, the account gets closed.

Why does bad sportsmanship happen?
