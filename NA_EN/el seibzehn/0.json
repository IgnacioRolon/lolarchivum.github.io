We *might* make a podcast episode on Jhin's music, in which I'd go about a bunch of things about him. We'll let you know if we're going through with this!","replies":[{"poster":"StigtriX","date":"2016-01-21T09:25:09.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply! :) That sounds interesting. I would love if you had more behind the scenes for different aspects of content creation. It would be especially cool if you did this whenever you have major releases, like you had with Bilgewater. If you have time to show some more of champion iteration and different stages, that would be awesome too! Keep up the good work!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2016-02-19T21:15:07.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I absolutely love how it's mostly violins and gunshots.

That touch of perfect imperfection, and the composition between the distant fantasies of Jhin and his reality. Especially the final parts of the music, seemingly swirling what the virtuoso had to go through in his past and his dream stage into one touch piece of music. Or maybe, the first part is but what Jhin wishes to be, and the later part depicts the urge of knowing to never reach, a perfection that he long longed to be. \n\nThis is such a great piece of artwork. It enables the audience to touch, to merge, to breathe as the meticulous killer. It's truly well done.","replies":[]},{"poster":"spavined","date":"2016-01-17T03:52:47.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"for anyone else wanting a link here ya go \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONFXU8V183k","replies":[]}]}
