I bought the RP to gift said accounts the 2 champions, but as I was gifting I realized that I sent both of the champions to one account instead of just one to each. Now, I have done research in to the way the refunds work, and I know you can't use tokens to refund gifts (I don't have anymore tokens anyway) but I feel like this deserves some kind of refund. I have been a member of this community for approximately 3 years, and I have bought RP multiple times. But I legitimately clicked on the wrong button, and I haven't used Aurelion Sol on that account at all, so I haven't taken advantage of this situation or anything, but the idea of getting another batch of RP because I bought a champion I'm not going to use on that account by accident is pretty troublesome.\n\nThis is a boards post, so I'll be lucky if a Riot Employee responds, but maybe if enough people respond we could get some attention. I might just be a spoiled brat in this situation, but I truly believe that there should be some sort of acception for things like these.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-14T02:59:44.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're correct, we normally don't do refunds for Gifts as per our [**Refund Policy**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ).
