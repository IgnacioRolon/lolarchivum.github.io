Rework the champs that needs reworks. Getting Ashe was basically like getting a new champion. It brought a lot of people to pbe and was and is a very popular pick now. Saw some lcs Play too. There are a ton of champs that need minor tweaks or complete reworks. Balancing what you have already presented us should be priotithere. There are a ton of champ options and diversity now. \r\n\r\n2. Learning champs is incredibly hard for new players. This game gets bigger every day. I started playing a year and half ago. Learning every champ and what they did toOK a very long time. I have only played probably about 25% of the roster. There are so many champs already and you have to master a few if you want to get anywhere in ranked. How can you expect all these champs you took time into making to get played by noobits when there is a new champ released every month and said players are trying to learn and findo already released players they may like. \r\n\r\n3. Why do I have to go on Lolking.net to figure out ratios and what not for champions? Why is the in game description of skills less descriptive then online? Why are certain things even left out in game description? Like the fact hecarim  can move through creeps and a bunch of others. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis game is great but I feel like it&#039;s time to start doing some fine tuning and it would make the game experience a lot more enjoyable. FixING champs and reworking them is like a new champ in itsself. We basically got two new champs back to back with Ashe and Ekko. Work on fixing poppy/Taric/Yorrik etc. Then those champs will get a bunch of play again.","replies":[{"poster":"Phoenix Kotori ","date":"2015-06-02T14:39:12.301+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":5,"body":"You act like riot hasn't already dropped the focus on new champions, we got like 25 champions a year before, now we get around 7, and I don't think that needs to drop lower.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-06-02T20:26:22.546+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well I think the official statement is \"quality over quantity\", though with the common complaint of overloading, I think a lot of people would like to see many of the recent champion kits split among a few different characters, lol","replies":[{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-06-02T21:57:58.492+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrBuffington,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iebsJXO1,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-06-02T20:26:22.546+0000)\n>\n> Well I think the official statement is \"quality over quantity\", though with the common complaint of overloading, I think a lot of people would like to see many of the recent champion kits split among a few different characters, lol\n\nThat would just make us go back to the terrible releases of S2.

I am content with how they released them last year, but I do believe they should put the focus into the other champions, looking at you Aatrox. I also believe they should update the way we can view champions, like when you click on them and read their bios and such. I would love to see ability scalings as well as possibly a skin preview?

I don't think there's a such thing as releasing too much because it after about a week people are already over any new champs or reworks (Ekko is cool, but is anyone super excited about him anymore at this point? Would you be mad if the laugh on the pbe was another new champ?)","replies":[]},{"poster":"XVI Jake IVX","date":"2015-06-03T00:38:12.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should of been here when riot was coming up with a champion every 1-2 weeks. Those were the days. They finally decided to listen to the community and cool down on it. I've been playing this game since 2010 and I think its amazing. They need to add more free to play champions! They have added like so many more champs. Now they need to add more free to play champions. Maybe 2 or 3. Also Kagami is right riot use to make tones of champions each year.","replies":[{"poster":"chipi99","date":"2015-06-03T20:06:58.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its extremely difficult  to balance that way","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2015-06-03T02:21:02.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry man, they just started teasing the next one on the beta.\n\nBubble sound effects and laugh\n\nProbably a swamp monster champ.\n\nMaybe a Zac skin, but I doubt they would put teasers in the actual map for that.","replies":[{"poster":"chipi99","date":"2015-06-03T20:05:06.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well they could of gotten the Kalista an Rek'sai problem, both teams finished close to each other.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gigablitz","date":"2015-06-03T18:40:05.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi! I think I agree to an extent, you raise legitimate concerns.

Arguably, some champions do need tweaks. Maybe not everyone needs a newly tooled kit, but some might need tweaks or re-works to abilities. However, these tweaks would still be limited to the champion and how Riot and the rest of the community envisioned/uses them. Changing a champion's kit doesn't change the champion. It's still the same assassin/tank/adc at the end of the day.\n\n2. New players can play new champions as well as any other champion. They are new players, after all. A new champion shouldn't have an effect because _everything_ is new. In fact, it's kind of a good thing for the new players because they're getting used to everything including the new champ. If anything, new champions affect the more experienced players as they need to build new habits or fix old ones in order to do well against the new champions.\n\n3. Statistics on champions doesn't improve a player's skill or understanding of a champ. It just tells you if everyone else is playing them, and how well they appear to be doing. The descriptions for abilities in-game is actually good. In fact, there are videos accompanying the abilities to show you what they do. Also, things aren't left out. If you've read Hecarim's passive ability description, you'd see that it tells you he ignores unit collision.\n\nMy thoughts? We've got a lot to work with right now in what champs we have, I agree. Although, new champions are necessary to bring something new to this game. Otherwise it just becomes stale with the same champs on the same maps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Swampmajikk","date":"2015-06-03T15:50:59.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've been saying this forever..\ngranted there is a lot more time between releases than there used to be, theres too many loose ends in this game as it is.\nadding new champs creates even more.\n\nalthough i have to say the balance differences between now and like S2 when i started are huge..","replies":[]}]}
