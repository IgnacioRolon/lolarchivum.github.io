We decided on leveling to 30 and then doing some ranked games together. Well, all of them have quit before even reaching level 20.\n\nWhy? I was talking to them last night and the main reason they all seemed to have quit was because of the new player experience as a whole and the way Riot is handling the extreme amount of \"toxicity\" in low level games. In almost every single game they played, they said that it was a flame-fest right from the start and I have had a similar experience. Just everyone insulting everyone and in each other&#039;s ass from the start of the game. They said that they encountered tons of \"smurfs\" the guys who went like 22-0 on expensive champs like Yasuo (they said they saw him a lot) and then proceeded to call everyone noobs/etc in all chat.\n\nThat is not even what they said bothered them the most. It&#039;s that it seems like the  system the riot team has in place favors these types of people and encourages this type of behavior. You see, it would actually be fine if everyone was flaming each other, thats just how people are on the internet and how the game is. But instead you have a system in place that punishes people for losing their cool after being trolled and insulted and pushed to the limits of their nerves. They&#039;ve said that they were reported numerous times and all of them had chat restrictions because in the games where literally every person on each team was flaming and trolling and BM&#039;ing each other, they actually displayed natural human emotions called irritation/frustration. But apparently that is against \"The summoners code\". So they were reported by the people who just got finished flaming the living hell out of them.\n\nOne of them said that the whole experience was akin to some kind of sick method of emotional torture where you were beaten and whipped and if you had any sort of reaction you would be punished in more grueling ways. \n\nSo I&#039;m not really sure what you guys are doing. Maybe it&#039;s just low level games which seems like that might be the case. Because when I watch streamers their games are much more laid back its like night and day compared to the games we&#039;ve played. The problem is that each opposite end of the spectrum share the same report system and honestly they should not. \n\nI really hope you guys will look into ways to improve the new player experience because I really highly doubt anyone who is legitimately new to this game will stick around long.","replies":[{"poster":"mack9112","date":"2015-08-19T17:15:46.777+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":50,"body":"There is a mute button hun","replies":[{"poster":"Bouffon dAnglais","date":"2015-08-19T17:34:48.598+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":3,"body":"but the mute button solves the symptom, not the problem itself. if you have cancer and you get a headache, you won't just take a pill to reduce the headache. maybe in the start, but after enough time, you'd realize that something is fundamentally wrong and you'd go to the doctor.","replies":[{"poster":"maikokk","date":"2015-08-20T05:15:24.480+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"this analogy is bad because /ignore all entirely removes the problem. the only way this problem can be solved is disabling in game chat. a ton of PVP gamers are horrible people and there is nothing you can do about it. low level games are always going to be more toxic than other games because some of the people in those games have been previously banned.

So it is like cancer, you can address the symptoms but bar cutting that player out completely he's going to continue to make everyone else sick.\n\nAs for low level games being the most toxic, I really think this is a newer phenomenon. When I leveled this account I really only started to experience massive toxicity after I hit 30. I made a new account recently because I wanted to learn how to adc\\jungle in a \"safe\" environment. Stupid naive me. Figured playing at level 5 I could learn to play these roles with out the toxicity of trying to learn them in level 30 games. \n\nI was so wrong. There are barely any new players.... it's mainly just people leveling smurfs and by the time the new players reach level 30 they have turned into the f*cktards from being exposed to so much venom themselves. \n\nMind you, I'm from OCE.

LOL has done an A+ job of keeping these types out of the general populace (thanks to the fact that you have to grind uber hard to become part of it... so making a new account takes too long when you have to start over all the time because you are a toxic prick)\n\nthe problem with that of course, is that the new players see a disproportionate amount of the sites toxicity... which sucks","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Diananmen Square","date":"2015-08-19T17:33:20.796+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":4,"body":"You shouldn't rely on a mute button to play the game.

I'm not a terrible player. Gold/Low Plat by rank, but when you are low level it irritates me to see players flame and rage at people who don't even have all the summoners yet. I've had people complain about not having a jungler when no one is lvl 10 to have smite unlocked. I've had players Rage at people for not knowing their champs or the enemy's champs. Complain when that Annie bursts out the Yi mid because the Yi doesn't know what he is doing and is still learning. \n\nPersonally I think there are a few things Riot can do to help out the new player experience:\n\n1) Don't have summoners be barred by level. I get being able to jump into a game and be a bit overwhelmed, but when you get some of the worst summoners and have to play against people that know what you are doing (since I can't say I've never played with another smurf). Its also gimping players who may come in from other games that know the basics, but are now gated. Yes this gives smurfs a bit of an upper hamd, but to me it helps learning seeing what is good and what isn't.\n\n2) Allow lvl 1-2 runes to be Free for everyone. I think this will make the new(er) player experience better and easier to transition into ranked as well. I've fine with gating the biggest power behind IP walls, but I think it shouldn't cost anything for tier 1-2 runes and just break them at the level difference. This will not only let them experiment with runes, but give them a better fighting chance.\n\n3) All-Chat shouldn't be a thing pre-10. You don't need to communicate with the enemy team as a new player and shouldn't. This option should be locked until you have time to learn the game and can at least survive the negative attitudes of your team before your opponent joins in.\n\nThese are just a few things that can help out new players that aren't directly handing out bans. You just have to be creative and think what makes it easier for a player to get use to the game without the negativity.

I'm playing on a lvl 6 account right now and not 1 person doesn't know what they are doing. I'm not playing with people who are new, but only smurfs. I'm sorry, but thats not a reason to play TTT or bots.\n\nIts about creating an environment for new players to actually succeed and not get dumbstered. Its about making sure you can actually learn the game without having people scream at you in any capacity for doing something wrong. I'm not seeing this even in my games and EU isn't any better and is actually worse. The NA players I\"m with just normally don't talk at all, but the EU players were straight toxic as hell. Take a 12 year old playing COD and double it. I did find 1 reasonable person and acted like a noobie and they gave decent advice, but i can only hold a charade for so long until its obvious I know what i'm doing. \n\nRiot needs to work on its new player experience and the increase in punishments is a double edged sword. For those toxic players they get hit sooner because you have less games and get flagged sooner, but its also bad for new players who don't know the punishment style and how retaliating is bad and can get you in trouble too.
