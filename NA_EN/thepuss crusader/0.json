I wouldn't be worried about this if it was consistent but it's only every few games, which leads me to believe it isn't my computer and it isn't my internet. I was wondering if could get some help with this problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-08T22:52:31.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your connection could be unstable, so your experience with the game could really just be a flip of the coin.  There could certainly be settings that are playing a part in degrading your connection to the game server but there could be other factors too.  I suggest going over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help troubleshoot and result any instability that could be caused with PC settings or network.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
