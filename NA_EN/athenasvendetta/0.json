Furthermore, Hellboy only has one stone fist, \"shaves\" his horns, doesn't have that much hair, his hair is the opposite color, he dresses far less provocatively, and does not have reddish orange eyes or white lips.\n\nIt's an obvious reference, and the stone fist is as close as you can get to a shout out without being a copy. But I say it's not a copy. Riot's artists could probably do a better job of avoiding controversy by making it look more unique.\n\n*The rest of my post is not in response to you*\n\nAlthough the blatant fanservice is strong with this image.\n\nTo the creator of this artwork: It's nice, it really is, but STOP TAKING THE VERY FEW CONSERVATIVELY DRESSED CHAMPIONS AND SKANKING UP THEIR OUTFITS SO THAT THEY LOOK JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHERS. You are diminishing what makes those champions unique.
