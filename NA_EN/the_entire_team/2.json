It can be fantastic to the point that it's even better for him than it is for the original champion (like Ashe's ult, with an AP ratio she doesn't use), or garbage (Udyr's, Kog's, etc.). Consistency is too important in a competitive PvP game like LoL.\n\nAnd someone who's been chained up and starved for 15 years doesn't pop out of prison looking like that.\n\nAlso, he has Kayn's face.","replies":[{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2019-02-12T07:08:56.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's already seeing pro play","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-12T07:56:41.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Infernape,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6BybYl9E,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2019-02-12T07:08:56.467+0000)\n>\n> He&#x27;s already seeing pro play\n\nGreat. So, he'll get nerfed when sales flatten, then buffs again, etc., as I said. He won't be picked when it matters unless his basic abilities are strong enough that he doesn't rely on stealing a good ult. Given that his basic abilities are overloaded as hell, he'll need some pretty heavy nerfs (patch notes will say he's \"a little too strong\" or has \"too many options\" or something).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CrazyMonkeyCZ","date":"2019-02-12T06:17:47.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"two posts above yours btw.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rester","date":"2019-02-12T04:53:35.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's not really broken per se, but he's just really boring as a champion I feel.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SSmotzer","date":"2019-02-12T04:50:33.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone's wondering how broken Kayle will be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2019-02-12T04:45:07.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EVERY.
