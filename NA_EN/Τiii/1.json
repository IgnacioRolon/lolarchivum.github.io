Recently my computer is having some problems then I moved on an old pc. I downloaded the game and I started a game vs bots to change some graphics setting. After I changed the settings (to low graphics and I reduced the resolutions) the game won't start (the screen just became black then the computer just blocked). I had to turn off and turn on the pc, then I started the client and the game and the problem just repeat. I can't start a game. \r\n\r\nI'm searching for a solution but I can't find nothing. What I can do? I need to change setting out the game but I can't.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-29T16:27:12.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have a black screen but can't hear any game sounds, this might not actually be a settings issue!  Instead, this can happen if your connection is struggling to reach the game server so it can't download any assets.   Instead of settings, run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help tune up your network.
