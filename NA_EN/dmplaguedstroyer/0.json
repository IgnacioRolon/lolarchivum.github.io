The OP's idea would create a less balanced ARAM, since there'd be no early/mid game and you can pick the champions with amazing late game. The meta would rarely change in that mode too, since it's rare for a champion to become better at late game without a drastic change to themselves or an item they rely on.\n\nIt would be fun for a little while, but it would get stale *very* fast.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2016-12-16T16:43:09.591+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So make it a rare RGM.\n\nPersonally this doesn't sound like something I'd EVER be interested in, but maybe the \"1v1 me noob\" tryhards might enjoy it?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PlanetWarwick","date":"2016-12-16T20:48:38.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Team fighting is for objectives\nYou wouldn't just teamfight without a goal\nNvm I'm in bronze so that isn't tru","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SmileInABox","date":"2016-12-16T16:45:33.707+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should make it in rounds starting with different gold to simulate different points in the game!
