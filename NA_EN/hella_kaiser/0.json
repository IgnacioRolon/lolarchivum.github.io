O_o...\n\nOutrange him, keep an eye on where the bastardboxes are, and never, ever get near brush.\nAny champion with an ability that can mess with his stealth or ult by marking, tethering or DoTing him has an advantage. Also keep in mind that the shaco autoattacking you is usually the clone, while the one that walks around like an idiot is the real one.\n\nHe has awful waveclear unless he builds full AD, abuse him by slamming him into his turret repeatedly. Also prevents box spam.\nIf he vanishes, just run away until you can see him.
