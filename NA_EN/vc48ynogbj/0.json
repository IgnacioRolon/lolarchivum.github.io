I read the notes that mentioned that it was felt that Azir should be a late game hyper carry, so will you test the original 400 range on soldiers with healthier early game nerfs?  \n\nAs someone who discovered Azir and fell in love with his gameplay only a few weeks prior to his nerf, I'm pretty nervous that you'll keep his soldier range low which will make him less dependent on his own positioning skill and more dependent on the lack of the enemy team's skill/knowledge/proper positioning. \n\nAs range of his soldiers decreases, dependence on the auto > Q > auto pattern increases. This changes him from a reliable sustained damage dealer to more of a typical burst mage, taking away his identity as auto attacker and makes his gameplay awkward, as if a mage rushed an early Lich Bane.\n\nEarly game nerfs to W or Q via mana costs, cooldowns, or making soldiers' range scale off of W skill level rather than taking away his range would make his laning phase much less intimidating (since Riot considered it as such)  while keeping his late game damage satisfying. \n\nDoes your team already have a list of changes in mind? Is it too early to share?\n\nThanks for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-02-25T08:32:30.907+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nothing certain yet, though we've got a couple of people testing possible changes this week to try and get them ready for 5.5.\n\nWe've been talking about increasing W range, potentially partially offset by reducing how far past a target the spears go (theory is that's a significant source of harass in lane, but much less relevant later on, so would allow us to return some range where it's most appropriate).

This is a very high potential champion one of which i believe is also a very complicated champion ( through programming and mechanics)\n\nI have a thread with some of his bugs listed. Please do look at them.\n\n\n**I think Azir is a great champ and fun to play but has a lot of bugs that put him at a dis advantage when you really play him in depth. You just need to take the time to put aside and play him to really notice there are really a *SHIT TON *   of bugs.**\n__________\n1. When using azir's E when he has a soldier stationed at a far distance, he cannot E to it all the time. I don't know of any conditions at the moment i just know its happened multiple times to me in multiple games. (IF this is intended can we get a range indicator?)\n\n2. Auto attacks (soldiers)that fail to hit their target before a target dies re-assign them selves to the nearest target(i dont think this is intended because its quite annoying)\n\n3. Azir auto attacks(soldiers) completely doing no damage and using up an animation time (attack animation) after directly using a summoner spell / ability within the champions kit, or being affected by other champions such as knock backs(ups), hooks, and stuns. \n\n4. Azir's auto attacks(soldiers) fail to hit champions moving at high speeds, such as yasuo when he is dashing through / next / beside a soldier. The auto attack animation goes off and no damage is dealt and azir is stuck there standing still auto attacking the air. (intended?)\n\n5. ........To be continued.\n__________\n**Please help me continue this list by adding anything you've seen / witnessed first or second hand. Or even spectated and saw.**\n__________\n\nI dont think you even need to buff azir if you just go through some of these bugs... No one seems to listen or look at a bug report thread so Hopefully it will grab your attention.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kilane","date":"2015-02-27T02:14:16.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know if they make W AP ratio scale per level like +0.4/0.45/0.5/0.55/0.6AP, they can just put his range back to 400.\n\nEven if you harass with the soldier at level 1-6, Azir will need alot of item and levels to do dmg with soldier in late game.\n\nAnd his harass doesn't really matter anyway because if the person bypass his soldiers, they will always out trade him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"No Fun Police","date":"2015-02-26T12:44:21.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think increasing base attack speed by significant amount would do enough. It'll leave current Azir power in direct 1v1 (especially in lane) basically intact, while increasing his power in teamfights by a large margin, also adding huge synergy with long-lasting immobilizes (Morganas' Dark Binding, Amumu's Curse of Sad Mummy etc.). Increasing his base AS from 0.6 to 0.8 would result in following:\n\n* Increase from 1.36 AS on Level 18 with 40% CDR, Nashor's Tooth and no AS masteriers/runes to 1.82. It means DPS increase by up to 34%, while not changing current ability of damage application (still requires keeping enemies in soldiers range).\n* Restore amount of possible attacks onto enemy before he's able to leave soldiers range after repositioning soldiers. Azir zone of control will still be smaller than pre-5.3, but will allow for same amount of active harass at cost of mana for Q early game.\n* Become huge QoL buff for Azir, allowing him to more easily last hit in lane and make his attacks more responsive.\n* Make more options for Azir build, like currently popular average CDR mage build, Rylai-AS-MPen build aiming at base damage focus, pure AP-AS-CDR build with Berseker Greaves for maximum teamfight damage and so on.\n\nSince such large buff to Azir attack speed would result in him gaining huge power and going back to be close to OP, it could be balanced with his passive AS from CDR apply only to soldiers autoattacks. It means, Azir would have two attack speed values: ordinary attack speed for his autoattacks and attack speed with CDR-into-AS bonus for soldiers attacks. It'll focus Azir more on using his soldiers as often as possible and keep his strength as teamfight-oriented lategame sustained damage dealer, while reducing his tower/inhibitor pushing power down to most mages level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Myrddin","date":"2015-02-26T04:17:58.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8aZ4QaqR,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-25T08:32:30.907+0000)\n>\n> Nothing certain yet, though we've got a couple of people testing possible changes this week to try and get them ready for 5.5.\n> \n> We've been talking about increasing W range, potentially partially offset by reducing how far past a target the spears go (theory is that's a significant source of harass in lane, but much less relevant later on, so would allow us to return some range where it's most appropriate).
