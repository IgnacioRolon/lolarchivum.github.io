Right now he seems more of a champion that either pokes with Q-Auto, or nukes with Q-E-AA-AA. I'd rather have him pushed into more of a sustained fighter than he is right now. Thinking more along the lines of Kayle. He's more related to zyra right now as he has short burst windows.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-04-28T05:13:52.377+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sustained damage is definitely the space we want him in.

While this build feels super nice to play, it's also hits an extreme dip in power since you delay your deathcap by 1250 gold as well as your void staff.  \n\nAzir feels acceptably strong immediately after buying his stinger.  The main issue I'm finding is that his power drops off *extremely* hard between building the stinger and finishing the death cap.  That seems to be around the time most frontliners and assassins are finishing up their second item and I simply don't do enough damage to deal with them.\n\nWith his limited kill pressure early game and this huge falling off of damage in the midgame, this makes it easy to fall behind on Azir and delay that late game that you picked him for in the first place. **I think if you guys were to change anything, improvements to his midgame would be the #1 approach to take.**  His early game seems fine, especially versus non bully lanes.\n\nIf you want my meager suggestion for improving his midgame without messing up the early game or late game, I would say give Azir incentive to skip the stinger so he can go directly into deathcap.  The 10% CDR and attack speed on stinger feel absolutely essential to Azir, but it's a huge expense that delays his strength heavily unless he picks up a lot of kills in teamfights.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GorillazNtheMyst","date":"2015-04-30T21:26:43.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is definitely something I think he needs. I think the ideal place for Azir is one where Nashor's Tooth is no longer a required item because his AS is sufficient without it. There's no point in building the full item, as you really only want the Stinger component. Just sort of wish he'd get more of a boon through his passive so that this item is no longer necessary. It takes up a needless place in your inventory that could be filled with an much more efficient item like Deathcap or Zhonya's.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2015-04-28T02:19:27.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would lowering the CD on his E be anything?

It's not often that Azir uses his Q twice to escape, so the main result of giving it a reduced cooldown if using it on the enemy is that he can use it to attack the enemy while also being safer should he be engaged on/ganked because the cooldown comes up quicker.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sinister Snail","date":"2015-04-28T03:53:10.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LankPants,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EoP4eoOZ,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-28T03:44:10.542+0000)\n>\n> If you're thinking about it in that way a better way to go might be increasing the CD with a refund when you hit a champ.
