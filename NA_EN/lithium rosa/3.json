We can't do anything about it until these guys finally did some harm. This makes me feel bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Samus72","date":"2015-12-07T04:10:18.001+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no rule against locking in on character choice.

But it can be difficult to tell in text, so a lot of people will take threats to feed seriously.\n\nAnd OP:  You got the names off in the chat screen shots, but you missed names under the champion portraits.  What you should do is send the unaltered pics to Riot in a support ticket.  The link it in the top right corner.  There's no \"Report a player\" option, but if you select \"I have a queston about League\" and then under category pick \"Gameplay and Features\" => \"General\" with comments on what happened and the pictures attached, it'll get forwarded to the Behavioral department.","replies":[]},{"poster":"buneter","date":"2015-12-09T12:26:53.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see nothing to report here.

And if they want a role, there's no rules stopping them from taking it.\n\nHOWEVER, I did just realized that I derpishly missed your second chat image. Although when you censor the names, and don't show the context, it's kinda hard to tell who's saying what to who for what reasons and in response to what. But w/e, I redact my first comment. Somebody calling other players \"trash\" IS always a problem.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lithium Rosa","date":"2015-12-06T07:15:31.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's like you know there is a bomb, but you are not allowed to throw it away until it explodes","replies":[]}]}
