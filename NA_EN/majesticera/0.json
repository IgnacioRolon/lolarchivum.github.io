Why should I be grouped with people who go 0-8 and dont even care? League match making and ranked system is fucked. MMR is shit and people shouldnt just be allowed to play ranked at lvl 30. It should be atleast 300 Normal wins. Also if you do well even in a loss, why should you be punished for your team mates bad play. I love to play league but the other players and community is absolute garbage.\r\nEND RANT","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2014-10-15T08:35:56.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just went 0/12 in ranked and have like 2000 total games played\n\n\ncome at me bro","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arrion","date":"2014-10-15T10:46:23.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, because there aren't enough skilled players to carry an excessively bad player to three hundred wins. Granted would take a good long while, but eventually it would happen, and OH HOLY FUCK! LOOK AT THAT! YOU HAVE YOUR BAD PLAYERS IN RANKED! News flash. Most of these fucking bads you come across used bot scripts to level 1-30, and probably programmed it to buy the cheapest fifteen champions in IP cost, so that when they hit thirty with no runes or masteries, and have fifteen champions never actually played a game in their life until that one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2014-10-15T08:08:11.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got sad news for you then","replies":[]}]}
