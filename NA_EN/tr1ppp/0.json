I can not wrap my head around what I&#039;m doing wrong and why my rank is dropping so fast. For the past 2 seasons I&#039;ve been hovering around gold 1 with a couple promos to plat 5 never following through. I took about a month long break and just recently got back into league, and I keep dropping, from gold 1, now im silver 1 about to be silver 2. I just dont understand what im doing wrong. I feel like if I get a few early game kills, I&#039;m only decently strong, where as if an enemy gets 1 kills, he&#039;s unstoppable. Am I just past my prime and no longer good at this game, or is there some weird behind the scenes number crunching going on that I haven&#039;t followed with.","replies":[]}
