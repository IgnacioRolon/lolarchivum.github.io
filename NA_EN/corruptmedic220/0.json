I went onto the main website to change my password and went through the procedure again, but it still claimed it was incorrect. That's when I decided to see if I had to restart my computer. When it booted back up, I tried it again, and still nothing. I tried changing my password again and it still told me I had the wrong password. Then I looked into tracking my username and when I put in both my emails for it to send the verification, neither of them have received the email. I am starting to get annoyed. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-26T18:50:33.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Incorrect login information can be caused by logging into the incorrect region, but can also suggest a change in your account.
