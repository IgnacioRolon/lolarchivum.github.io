It may have crashed and lingering in the background, so a pc restart may help.  If it's still not opening then a security setting may have changed and blocking the client from launching.  I suggest using the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to rule out any security option possibilities.
