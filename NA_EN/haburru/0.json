I decided to sit on it for a day, and I logged in today after decided I really wanted to get the Graves skin. Sadly, when I logged in, the two tiles for them had been reset. I sorta panicked when I saw that, and when I opened them back up, I got a Fiora and Graves skin in the same spots I had before, but it was Nightraven Fiora and Mafia Graves. Is there any chance of me getting that half priced Poolparty Graves without having to wait for it to go on sale sometime?

We don't want you to get a Lunar Revel sale only to see it in a regular sale over the next few days, so we have replaced those sales in the Lunar Revel Shop with different offers.\n\nFor reference, here are [the sales for February](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/february-sales-schedule).","replies":[{"poster":"Haburru","date":"2016-02-02T06:03:23.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, Khaos!
