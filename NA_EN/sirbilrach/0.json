Her chat consistently doesn't work on the client, and neither of us can access other people's profiles sometimes. When we queue up for ranked together, she is completely incapable of locking in a champion forcing her to dodge. We both have great computers, run other games perfectly together, best internet package we can get, and a great router. This kind of error is only happening to us on League of Legends. Repairing the client and reinstalling it has NOT worked so we don't know what the issue is. Has anyone had a similar problem or know of any idea to fix it? Also, if we are able to make it into a game, we both run it perfectly, low ping, zero lag. This is an issue purely with the client it seems.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-27T22:16:45.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suspect that given the context, there may be an issue with either the local network settings on your Wife's PC, or her network adapter is malfunctioning. I suggest working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure those settings are up to spec. If those steps cause no change, you may want to uninstall the current network driver and install the newest one available.\n\nLet me know how those steps played out.","replies":[]}]}
