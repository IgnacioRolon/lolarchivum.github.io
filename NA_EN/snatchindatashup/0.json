Sometimes I have to reconnect and it works fine other times I try to reconnect and by that time the game is remade and I get leaver buster. I am now on 10 minute wait for 5 games due to League of Legends connection to servers. Wouldn't it make sense if you turn off leaver buster until you fix your video game? This is the second time in two days I got a buster because I literally couldn't connect.....am I missing the logic here?","replies":[{"poster":"Ellamar","date":"2016-12-11T05:42:58.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"seriously though i got leaver bustered for 20 minutes 5 games. and after I finished those games it happened AGAIN and guess what was MY CONCEQUENCE","replies":[{"poster":"women ruined lol","date":"2016-12-11T08:18:41.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same exact thing happened to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ellamar","date":"2016-12-12T18:29:03.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I put a ticket in and they responded with a bot pretty fast.

This is a bug, it is **not** a server issue and will not cause continuous connection issues, which means any continuous issues are completely unrelated.\n\nSince you're seeing intermittent issues, I'm suspecting there are local issues on your network and I'd recommend taking a swing at the steps in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). Let me know if those steps caused any change for you.","replies":[]}]}
