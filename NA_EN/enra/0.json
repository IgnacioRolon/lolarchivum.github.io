I tried to reconnect as soon as it happened. But when I log back, my friend (he was duo with me) told me that I'm still in champ selection, which is not true. I just sit there can't do anything about it, my series ended with 2 wins and 2 defeated. I played all day to get there, now I feel so goddamn bad. Is there any solution to this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-30T17:46:41.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a bummer that happened, and I'd like to help find out what's causing the crash but we cannot alter game stats.  Are you using any third party programs like play.tv?  They've been known to cause issues like this during champion select.  Let me know if that's the case for you.","replies":[]}]}
