In another example from my discussion with Vyniadus, I pointed out that it IS technically possible to show a flat number; the trouble is accurately explaining in a concise way that the shown number is first mitigated by armor, and then by MR, because most damage in this game isn't affected by both armor and MR. Is there an easy, simple way to denote that information? I'm not sure. \n\nEssentially it works like this: the bonus magic damage is calculated by how much damage your attacks/abilities **actually do**, which means that number will be affected by armor; however, that resulting bonus magic damage number will THEN be affected by MR. For example: \n\nMax level W deals 270 physical damage without bonuses, so you would expect the max-level Shadow Assassin passive to add +119 magic damage. However, against someone with 100 armor (50% resist) Your level 5 W will only deal 135 damage, so it won't deal 135 + 119, even though 119 is 44% of 270. Instead, the bonus magic damage dealt is only 59 (44% of 135). This 59 magic damage is then subject to magic resistance, so against someone with 100 armor and also 100 MR, that's another 50% resistance, making the final number for the bonus magic damage a mere 29 (50% of 59). \n\nIn the end, I do think there is still benefit to seeing the flat bonus damage (119 in my example) even if it's going to be reduced by armor, and then MR. I don't suppose it would be too difficult to say: \"Shadow Assassin: Deal an additional (+119) damage, reduced first by armor and then by magic resist.\"","replies":[{"poster":"CleverIGN","date":"2019-02-28T19:20:36.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly even something like that would be helpful.

The wording of Shadow Kayn's passive makes it very clear that it's reduced by both armor and magic resistance. \"For the first 3 seconds of champion combat, deal X percent of all damage dealt to champions as bonus magic damage\". \"X percent of all damage dealt to champions\" is clearly reduced by armor, similar to how the Darkin's passive of \"Heal for X percent of spell damage dealt to champions\" is also reduced by armor. Since the passive deals bonus magic damage and not bonus true damage, it is further reduced by magic resistance. The length of this conversation proves nothing except your lack of common sense.\n\nI'm literally just going to quote the page you linked to make the point I was going to make anyways: \"Be very careful not to confuse \"deferring to an authority on the issue\" with the appeal to authority fallacy. Remember, a fallacy is an error in reasoning. Dismissing the council of legitimate experts and authorities turns good skepticism into denialism. The appeal to authority is a fallacy in argumentation, but deferring to an authority is a reliable heuristic that we all use virtually every day on issues of relatively little importance. There is always a chance that any authority can be wrong, thatâ€™s why the critical thinker accepts facts provisionally. It is not at all unreasonable (or an error in reasoning) to accept information as provisionally true by credible authorities. Of course, the reasonableness is moderated by the claim being made (i.e., how extraordinary, how important) and the authority (how credible, how relevant to the claim).\" I'm not just saying my authority on the topic and nothing else, that would be a fallacy.  I'm also giving reasons for my claim.\n\nBut you're right, it shouldn't take a Diamond Kayn main to understand how the Assassin passive works. Good thing it doesn't, since I've understood how it works ever since the champion was released.
