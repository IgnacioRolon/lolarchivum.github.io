But every other online game would run fine. I went to the board page and noticed a lot of people were posting about the same issue. For this reason I feel like the Leaver Buster I got for this should be excused for it was more of Riot's problem then me on purposely leaving games -.-","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-07T18:48:20.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks that you've been getting re-connection errors back to back and got a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) as a result.  I appreciate you trying to get back in-game, but leaverbuster treats all leaves equally because of the negative experiences it causes others.  Your best bet would be to run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot whatever is blocking you from reaching the game server.
