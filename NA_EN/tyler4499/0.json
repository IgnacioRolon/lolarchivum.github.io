The issue started with the Launcher starting without properly finishing the patch (1% to done for a big patch not likely), this was fixed with resetting winsock. Next issue was that the launch button would be stuck on grey indefinitely after pressing, never doing anything other than asking me to accept terms/conditions. This was fixed by the latest patch it appears or through updating my Nvidia driver to the most recent version it seems. However now whenever I click the Launch button it will go grey for a few moments before returning to orange and nothing happening. \n\nI need muh League, I dunno what else I can do since I've already reinstalled the game as well. Server status is 100% always green n online for me, and the delete S_OK and release manifest isnt working at all either.
