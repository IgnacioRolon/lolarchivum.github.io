I am Xenogenic, the Game Design Lead for the team that makes skins, events, and new content like Eternals.  After announcing Eternals a few weeks ago, we’ve been having ongoing conversations with players to gather feedback and make improvements while we continue working on them.  \n\nOne of our changes to the feature is to build sets of 3 Eternals that are unique to each champion, capturing things directly related to their specific abilities or gameplay patterns, and not include common stats like Kills, Damage Dealt, etc.\n\nWhat we’d like to do now is list our proposals for each champion for the first set so you can give us feedback on what you like or don’t like, as well as make suggestions for ideas for things we should track in the future!\n\nA couple of quick notes before the list:\n\n* Some players want very skill-expressive trackers, while others want trackers that are more accessible and will grow large over time.  So to that end, we’ve tried to include some of both for each champion and will likely continue that trend into the future.  Be sure to let us know which type of Eternal you prefer, though.\n*  This is a rough draft type list, so there is some level of short-hand.  \n* For example, sometimes we may say “enemies” which really means “enemy champions,” not minions or monsters.  \n* Multi-hits means 2+ (or more) targets hit in a single cast of a spell.\n* “Long range” casts of spells mean more than 75% of their max range, unless otherwise specified.\n* Damage dealt, damage absorbed, damage dealt to, etc. refer to damage to/from champions, unless otherwise specified.\n* We want Eternals that track high moments and successes without being gameplay warping, by which we mean: Eternals should not be asking you to do things that you don’t want to do or shouldn’t be doing (i.e. kills as support, casting spells specifically on yourself instead of allies or vice versa, etc.).  If any of these feel warping to you, please call them out and explain why!\n* When Eternals are fully “rekindled,” meaning all 5 milestones they track have been reached, they start tracking your personal best within each game.  Keep that in mind for stones that might seem basic on the surface.  Many of them become more interesting when tracking the highest/best amount you’ve done in a single game.\n\nHere are our proposals for Set 1:\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c8fLzByerZZrBPJmfRxZD8KgHO2Vn3UV/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c8fLzByerZZrBPJmfRxZD8KgHO2Vn3UV/view)\n\nUPDATES to set 1 based on feedback:\n[https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/MjrsLTba-eternals-feedback-thread-set-1-uniques?show=flat&amp;comment=00cb](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/MjrsLTba-eternals-feedback-thread-set-1-uniques?show=flat&amp;comment=00cb)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/6Cx09kR.png[/img]","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Xenogenic","date":"2019-09-07T01:37:47.595+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":5,"body":"Alright!

I know people have complained plenty about it so there's not a lot of point in rehashing it but I'd like to make something clear. (Not to mention, Riot seems insistent on pretending those numerous complaints do not exist.)  Bottom line, most of these are just stat trackers and relatively uninteresting ones at that.  It's not that I don't want to pay for them, it's that I simply will not do it.  Yeah, it'd probably be an interesting fact to know how much distance Orianna's ball has traveled but it's not something I **actively want to know**, or brag about in any fashion.  That's just one example of the massive amount that I can list out of the current Eternals you have listed.  I know you are trying a balancing act between people that want 'easy' counting stuff to seem skilled and people that want actual skill based stats and you will have people complain no matter what you pick, but realistically only way I would pay for this would be if it were something to actually be _proud _ to show off (and I think most people feel this way).\n\nA lot of people have made great suggestions/alterations to your current list and I don't think there's any reason to throw these away.  I simply believe you should make these available for Blue Essence for a multitude of reasons.  One, I (and a lot of long term players) have almost 200K sitting with **nothing **to work towards or spend it on.  Two, I don't believe what you're offering is worth RP even if it does take a lot of background stuff and you legit need to offset the cost.  Three, it would show that you are actually listening to a large portion of the community instead of \"listening\" by reducing the cost.  _We never said it was too much, we said it wasn't the right move._\n\nNow, I'm not above paying for bragging rights.  I like League and I will pay a great deal for stuff I like.  Not that it matters to the conversation, but I have spent a great deal of money on this free game.  Not really to be 'supportive' but because what ever it is I am buying, is something I actively want.\n\nYou know what I would pay RP for?  Achievements or Titles that make me feel like an actual badass.  I think the problem with main train of thought thus far is making them all champion specific.  To be completely honest, some champs can't shine based upon their own skill usage, but how they're used.  It's just too much to try and please everyone for each individual champ.  I think Riot would be much better off by having generalize categories.  By this, I don't mean how the Eternals are currently broken up (or was at one point).  I actually mean by Rift Role (ADC, Support, Mid, Jungle, Top) or by Champion Role (Tank, Fighter, Assassin, Marksmen, etc) and gearing both toward different play styles.  I also think that it's important to think of stats involving multiple champions - _**as if there is an ACTUAL FIGHT HAPPENING because that's really where the skill comes from one champion interacting with another champion**_.  I also believe you should have situational achievements.\n\nI'm going to provide some examples (I even named 'em, cuz why not), and I hope you keep in mind that my suggestions are very much based upon how and who I play.  Other players that have other player styles would probably have great suggestions for what makes them feel badass/what achievements would be best for them.  I'm a defensive player, I mostly play supports, assassins, or sometimes bursty mages (which really, I try to use like assassins anyway)(and yes I realize the irony of being a defensive assassin). (also, I hope you're still with me).\n\nSupport Achievement Examples:\n1. \"All the Credit\" - This achievement is designed around those clutch moments where the support actively saves someone either through healing/shielding (like Sona, Soraka, Taric, Karma) or through CC/Damage Reduction (Exhaust, Morgana, Leona, Braum).  This would take a lot of stat tracking, from multiple Champions and skills, namely being proximity of two champions and how much health the one being saved had recently lost (obviously more allotted for tanks/high HP champs).  This doesn't have to result in a kill on the enemy team, just saving someone on your own team.\n2.  \"Oopsie\" - This achievement... I don't even really want to call an achievement because I can already imagine the outcry of ADC everywhere about how it encourages KSing.  But realistically it's just something that happens as a support, even as a great support.  In efforts to save someone or mismanagement of Skills or auto's (or hell, even the mismanagement by the ADC), the Support gets the last tick and credit for the kill.  I just think it would be something fun to track, especially for support mains who do not intentionally steal kills)\n\nSituational Achievement Examples\n1. \"Thanks Tower\"  -  Surviving a Tower Dive (or on the flip side, you could have another achievement for successful tower diving).  This would have so many things to take in to account: how much health one player had versus the other (personally I love having little to no health and surviving a full health tower dive from an enemy (*cough cough*  Yas *cough cough*).  What Skills/items/summoner spells are used on both parties and various other things that would make this Skill based versus luck based (or perhaps stupidity based if the other player shouldn't have dived anyway).  I also think it's a good idea that this would be another achievement to take into account proximity (as in, ideally this would be one enemy champion diving one other champion).\n2. \"Whew\" -  Hopefully we've all done it, or at least have seen it.  That person surviving with 60 health, 20 health, just 5 little health points.  Sometimes it's luck, sometimes it's skill... sometimes the enemy auto's a minion but this is something more than WORTH bragging about.\n3. \"Don't Believe in Counters\" - There's a long list of champions who counter other champions.  I honestly don't know them well because I believe you can play any champion well against any other champion.  In that train of thought, I think it would be great to recognize players who do well with champions against their designated counters. I don't know how exactly to measure that, but I bet the community would have wonderful input on that account because this would be a great way to recognize specific skill level because a player can show they do well against a champion that specifically counters the one their using.\n4. \"Who needs Smite?\" - Stealing Baron/Dragon with a measly old skill or perhaps even without actual vision on the target?\n5. \"You're Welcome!\" - Taking a skill shot or targeted skill that would have killed another champion (the best examples I can think of is Cait or Jhin's Ult, or Morgana's Q, but I'm sure there are other skills easily added to the list).\n\nAnyway, I've made a massive wall of text.  If you made it this far, cool you get a high five (and my eternal gratitude)(haha, eternal).  I completely recognize how complicated the achievements I listed might be for Riot to pull off gracefully but, again... I would PAY for that type of record system.  I don't want to pay for a simple counter, I would rather pay for something that actually shows off how I play and what I've achieved... Maybe it's impossible, but oh well I put it out there anyway.  I really think if Riot went with this type of achievement system the Community would really get involved in describing their own play styles and what they think should be recognized.  I'm just one person, I mostly just play a few ways... there's so much potential and I would love to see this kind of achievement/skill based system come to life.\n\n(Edited because the bullets were making things weird and italic, also added 5th Situational Example)\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"ezelsior","date":"2019-09-04T20:29:10.520+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"How about making them cost blue essence or RP :) instead of making it exclusively RP :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Deer","date":"2019-09-04T20:51:36.294+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"In regards to {{champion:142}} coming from someone who mains her:\n\n* Enemy champions killed within 3 seconds of being slept by Sleepy Trouble Bubble (E) \n\n* Long-range Q hits\n\n* Distance traveled by Es that have put targets to sleep (direct hit or traps)\n\nIt would be super cool if that last one (Distance traveled by Es that have put targets to sleep (direct hit or traps) would be replaced with something pertaining to her W (Spell Thief) so she had one eternal per ability!\n\nIt would be great to see something like:\n\n* Number of spell shards stolen from enemy champions\n\nor\n\n* Number of spell shards picked up from minions\n\nor some sort of combination of the two\n\n* Number of spell shards used with W (actives and/or summoner spells alone)\n\nOther than that, I love these!

They seem nice for the most part, but that's really about it. They're just this nifty little thing it seems like. Tracking stats is kind of cool, and it's one of my favourite things to do, but if this is a premium system I would've expected a much more premium experience. I don't mind RP costs that much. But I do feel like these can be made better if these can be acquirable through Blue Essence all throughout the year. Riot Games isn't making many fans by locking this behind a paywall. Sadly, I can tell there is a lot of work being put into these, so I find it rather sad that they have to have such a negative backlash simply because of the pricing.\n\nI think people would happily sink BE into this for their favourite champions. But if you are going to lock this behind a paywall, I would suggest really going to the extreme with this. Making exclusive Eternal Chromas as rewards for hitting certain milestones, maybe being able to customize your TFT board, have a banner in the fountain that represents your eternal progress for you champion. A leaderboard for the various statistics provided with Eternals could also be fantastic. Maybe making the banners in the lobby customizable using your eternals. With a lot of these additions, you could have set eternals to be a really good premium option, with a Blue Essence/low RP alternative for other people.\n\nOverall, I like the changes Riot has made, but it isn't anywhere near enough. Chroma Packs were initially 590RP, and to me these seemed okay, but still a little on the pricey side. Valuing these as much as a recolour of your favourite champions is honestly really sad. If Eternals release in this current state, it will likely be a sad affair, although I do suspect Riot Games will still see profits from these. As someone who doesn't main any particular champion, and will play various champions on and off depending on meta, fun-factor and comfort, I don't get much value at all, and I don't see this being valuable to anyone except for maybe some of the community who does spend most of their time on singular champions. I love this idea, and you guys are doing a great job, but the implementation is going to be key to the success. I hope they're a lot better on release than I am seeing from videos and from reading various posts, and that maybe their release into the game isn't actually worthy of the outrage given by the community. I hope.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2019-09-05T01:11:48.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Garen one-trick, not a single of the Eternals for Garen sounds exciting.

You try to incorporate that by having \"Distance Traveled While Under the Effect of R.\"  However, this seems pretty boring.  Its merely a volume stat that just requires moving (which Singed constantly does) while ult is running.  I think a much better way to approach this concept is to play into his passive (movement speed boost near ally/enemy champ), especially because it can stack.\n\nSometimes in teamfights, Singed gets moving REALLY fast because he is drifting off many nearby allied and enemy champions (while R is running, as well).  So I think it would be cooler to have something like:\n\n**Seconds traveled while having at least X Movement Speed**\n\nI'm not sure what X should be but suppose you made it equal to: [345 (Base Movement Speed)] + [45 (for standard upgraded boots)] + [MS from Rank 2 Ult] + [MS from drifting off 3 allies/enemies] and of course then adjust for the the fact that MS scaling falls off at a certain point.  Basically, pick a number that would typically be reached when drifting off 3+ enemies/allies in the mid game.  Sure, it might be more easily reached in games where Ghost/Swifties are taken but I think that's OK as it is much cooler as a concept and slightly more difficult to achieve.\n\n**EDIT:** I'm not really a proxy Singed player but it might also be cool to have \"Seconds spent beyond Tier 1 Turret pre-15 minutes\" or something that would track his time spent proxying in the early game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Desaroll","date":"2019-09-04T20:21:11.770+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hayo! Visiting from LAS &lt;3\r\n\r\nA note for {{champion:117}}. Her E and W have two uses, depending if you cast them on an ally or an enemy.

Just, using it on enemies.\r\n\r\nMay I suggest changing it to hitting 2 different champions with each Q? The double Q launch (From Pix and from her) is something you have to learn to do, and do it correctly.\r\n\r\nThe E one is ok, even if it values only one type of cast, as even AP Lulu will use E more than once to shield themselves.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n{{champion:117}} \r\n\r\nPD: All said, I would like to remark that the first mastery update we get, and it's closed behind RP.

Everybody steps on Teemo's shrooms, where is the challenge on that? Instead, give me Eternal points for killing champions with the shrooms instead. An Eternal for using Teemo's W? That's the most boring of his abilities. Did you know that Teemo has an increased attack speed after his passive? Why not use that instead?\n\nI made a post on the Teemo Mains subreddit about better Eternals for the swift scout: https://www.reddit.com/r/TeemoTalk/comments/cqzgu5/teemos_eternals_suck_lets_make_them_better/\n\nHere are a couple of suggestions from there that I would like to share, hopefully you can take them into account:\n\n* **You're welcome:** _Kill a champion with your poison damage (the initial damage from E doesn't count)._ There is nothing better than killing someone by the last ticks of poison.\n\n* **Smell that? That's fear:** _Kill a champion where you have the \"Element of Surprise\" buff._ That's during the 3 seconds of increased Attack Speed after you used your passive.","replies":[]}]}
