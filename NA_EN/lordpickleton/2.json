I don't know if that's intentional to prevent tanks from getting beefy too fast, but it's just something I've noticed.\r\nI think an easy fix would be to just make it count both the gold you and your ally receives on the stack, so that way you're hitting the required amount in half the time.","replies":[{"poster":"NTrumpWeTrust","date":"2019-12-09T22:36:13.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They stack slower, because they're easier to stack (less risk).
