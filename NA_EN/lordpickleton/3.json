I know he got a minor tweak back before Sion's full rework and it was pretty nice (especially the mana back on last hitting with Q). Urgot works awesome as both an anti-carry and as a poke/caster adc. His kit gives him awesome dueling potential (passive to reduce damage, E to lower armor, W shield to .... shield). His Q works like Ezreal's, and when you land that E its damage and range become Kog'Maw-ult-level. The slow from the W shield gives good chase/flee potential, on top of the shield letting you survive those bursts that would 100% your average hypercarry. His ult is also great for suppressing a target for your team to jump on, trolling people trying to dive you or get too close to turret and for all that survivability (120 bonus armor/MR while it's channeling? Vayne pls, stop tickling me). But anyway, that's enough gushing.\r\n\r\nMy question isn't so much \"how would you change Urgot\" but \"what do you think Riot's eventual rework will be?\"  If Karma and Sion's treatment taught me anything, my prediction is thus:\r\n\r\n***Urgot v2***\r\n  No longer ranged! He now uses a claw hand to scratch enemies.\r\n  **Passive**: Weaker Malphite passive with shorter recharge time, while it's up increases movement speed slightly\r\n  **Q**: Thresh's Q but shorter windup time, shorter range and lower flat damage. Can also hit terrain like Naut's Q\r\n  **W**: Toggle: damage to surrounding enemies (like Dr. Mundo's W)  but also drops a slowing trail behind him.\r\n  **E**: Warwick's E but maybe increased damage instead of movespeed?\r\n  **R**: Sivir's ult or Gangplank's E but increases 1 or 2 of the following: Armor/MR/Lifesteal\r\n\r\nAgain this is not what I hope Urgot changes to (I love him as is), but what I imagine Riot will do to him based on previous reworks to Karma/Sion/Soraka. What are your predictions?","replies":[]}
