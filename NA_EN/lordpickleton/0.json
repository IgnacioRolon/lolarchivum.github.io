I&#039;mma buy an energy runepage for funnzies.&quot; I scrolled over to the store, entered &quot;energy&quot; into the search and ... they&#039;re useless. Even maxing out energy regen runes it&#039;s only about 3energy/sec (which on someone like Shen is not even a drop in the bucket) and the extra energy isn&#039;t even enough for an extra attack in rotation unless you use all of them. So I got to thinking: &quot;_THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY~~~~!_&quot; [canned audience laughter]\r\n\r\n**Idea #1:** _Energy Refund Runes_\r\n**Does:** Refunds 1.11% (3.33% per quint) of energy spent on abilities (max 20% with full yellows/quints)\r\n**Reasoning:** The problem with energy regeneration runes is that they either work too slow to be worth it (~3/sec at lvl18 with seals/quints) and if they were buffed even slightly they&#039;d be too OP for Q harass early game. By working it as a refund, it acts like how a tear does for your somewhat spammy mana users without being overly abuseful. And to achieve this 20% refund they&#039;d have to sacrifice their yellows/quints, so the trade-off is pretty important during laning phase.\r\n**tl:dr** - Akali would be able to use her Q easier for last hitting without being able to spam her E like a helicopter late game.\r\n\r\n**Idea #2:** _Energy Absorption Runes_\r\n**Does:** 2.78% (5.56% per quint) increase in yield of energy-generating effects (max 50% with full yellows/quints)\r\n**Reasoning:** This strategy stresses higher skill play in proc-ing your energy-makers. This will encourage Akalis to be more daring early on to proc her mark instead of passively using it to farm/harass, Zeds to have to hit both shurikens for that delicious refund, etc.\r\n**tl;dr** - Shen could could regain the full energy cost of his dash by hitting 3 enemies, and a healthy amount by hitting his Q.\r\n\r\nThoughts? I think it would be nice for some energy/rage runes love instead of everyone using the tired &quot;pen/leth reds/armor yellows/mr blues/flat ap/ad quints&quot; combo that everyone uses for energy champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Zane Zephyr","date":"2017-03-19T03:37:07.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every energy champ already has a refund mechanic.

Plus, 10/sec isn't really that much with some of the costs (180 for Shen taunt).","replies":[]}]}]}
