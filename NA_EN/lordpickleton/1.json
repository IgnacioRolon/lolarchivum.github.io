In it, one character on your team on a team is not an actual player, and it just runs straight at the enemy fountain until it dies to a player (executes don&#039;t count) and then deactivates and stays in base for the rest of the game. Or there&#039;s the bot version: It&#039;s basically just intermediate bots except 2 members of your team (selected randomly) are poorly made bots that just attack-move the enemy fountain over and over. You wont know who it is until after they give first blood, but you might be able to tell by their summoner spells and keystone!\r\n\r\nSeriously though, I don&#039;t know how you guys are handling bots but when I do guaranteed first daily win on Int Bots there&#039;s always one if not several bots using 3rd party programs. Please crack down on this, as it ruins the experience for everyone.","replies":[]}
