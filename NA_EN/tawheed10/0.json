I took the liberty of looking at your OP.GG and you really shouldn't be playing half of the champions you are. Zed, for example. He can be played in masters or challengers, but not in any other rank very well. Also, if i were you, i'd drop Leblanc. The problem with picking mechanically challenging champions like the ones you are is that your spending too much time focusing on that champions demands rather than the minimap, or how you can improve and such. Another problem is, a lot of the champions you've listed get picked or banned away from you often. I'm assuming your still in placements for ranked, correct? So stick to the more simple toplaners that will allow you room for error and let you improve. Heres a link to one of my favorite tier lists (it says patch 6.13 but it's still very much relevant). If you are interested in one of the top laners on this list, google thier pick and ban rate, and if it seems low enough, then it's a worthy pickup.

After all those nerfs, I'd say she's still good, but only if you play her well\nGP can be a bit difficult to play properly\nDarius is pretty easy to play, and will punish enemy for stepping too close. And his early game is really good. Riven type good\nEkko, I'm not sure, been a while since I played him","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2016-07-28T11:46:46.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius has a pretty high banrate right now, but he's pretty simple to play and can dumpster a team 1v5 if he's fed enough.\nA good gangplank is absolutely terrifying late game though. If you can farm well, have good barrel mechanics, and have good map awareness for when to use your ult, he's very very good. If you take champion.gg statistics to mean anything, they rank him 1st both mid and top.","replies":[]},{"poster":"D3m37r1","date":"2016-07-28T11:46:02.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GP can carry the hardest but he's also the hardest to play at an optimal level.","replies":[]}]}
