For What?","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Aside from the fact that there were indeed a few curse words (and yeah maybe that last line in game 3 was a bit much), I don't understand why the activity I did should produce a chat ban. On the way to becoming reformed, I was treated to 3 ridiculously harsh games:\r\n\r\n1. [Jungle] Mid &amp; top steal jungle out from under me, with mid chasing me around and taking camps, and finally bot joining in and harassing\r\n2. [Support] MF LITERALLY leaving and standing on plat from L1 for the first 10:00 after she died (she said don't go toxic if someone else plays poorly, but did it herself), then coming back to steal jg farm until L5 (never actually hit L6 by end of game)\r\n3. [Jungle] Top, mid, AND support all going at it all game (tbh, I don't really recall much of this one...)\r\n\r\nI really wanted to clean my act up, but it seems the only way to do it is to mute the community from the start, as all they do is report you. This is my first post ever and I really want to understand what the deal is, because from where I stand not only did these people deserve much worse, but they dished out much worse too.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of full transparency, I have pasted the logs Rito has supplied that were the cause of the chat ban.\r\n\r\nAnybody else have any incidents like this?

'Assisting enemy team' if you did (14 day suspension worthy thing btw), insults, rank shaming\n\nAnd in the third match log: report calling, negativity, insults (telling others suck/are kids). This was clearly the shortest log of the three and also the least negative. Maybe you should stop talking and focus on playing instead?\n\nImo all three logs had negative elements in them, and thus the punishment you got is appropriate. Like I said in the analysis of the third chat; I recommend that you stop talking and instead focus on your gameplay. That way you will avoid getting punished again and thus will at some point recover from this punishment. The opposite is also true; If you don't stop talking, you will get punished again and with the escalating punishment system you will \"soon enough\" find your account to be permanently suspended.","replies":[{"poster":"Anonysaurus Rex","date":"2019-04-07T00:14:22.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the objective feedback.\n\nre: The second game, I told them MF was in the jg because she was stealing our jg's camps.

You are extremely toxic and if you really, genuinely see nothing wrong with this I highly suggest you really do disable the chat or /mute all at the start of the game as your account is in danger.

This is pretty tame compared to what was shouted by other players during the games (and typically other players during the evening hours), so I just assumed that less than what was being said was considered _not_ toxic.\n\nSince that's not the case, I will try to reduce the toxicity.
