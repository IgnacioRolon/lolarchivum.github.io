Box scores would help me decide which games I should go back and watch.  I&#039;m generally ok with spoilers, so long as I can pick out the game that&#039;s worth watching.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nTeeHax","replies":[{"poster":"Tiza","date":"2016-07-19T20:43:32.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey TeeHax,\n\nWould an endgame scoreboard and match history page work?  Check out the schedule page for past weeks - I think you'll find what you're looking for there.  For example: http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/na-lcs/na_2016_summer/schedule/regular_season/7\n\nYou'll be able to see the match results on the schedule page.  Clicking through to an [individual match page](http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/na-lcs/na_2016_summer/matches/regular_season/IMT-vs-CLG) will show you the vod.  The big button at the bottom that says \"[View Player Builds & Game Analysis](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/TRLH1/1001780152?gameHash=ae360307684b4903&tab=overview)\" will show the Detailed Match History page, complete with endgame scoreboard.","replies":[]}]}
