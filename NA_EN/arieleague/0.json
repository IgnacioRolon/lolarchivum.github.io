Running as administrator won't always solve this, as there may be other factors involved.  As a first step, I recommend using our [Permissions ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)guide which will provide a series of instructions to allow the patcher access.

I usually just update on my laptop and copy the files over. Today I tried something that worked for me. Navigate your way to Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS. In that folder there are rads_user_kernel.log files and a rads_user_kernel.txt file. I deleted them all and when I opened the launcher again, it was able to update properly.\n\nI hope this works for you too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MONEYGREED","date":"2016-08-24T18:15:50.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright Here It is , If you guys still getting this problem and try'd everything and it's still not working .\nLocal Disk (C:)/Riot Games/League Of legends/Rads/Projects/LoL_Patcher/Releases/0.0.064/deploy in that map you will find a exe. called LoLPatcher Press that and its done .
