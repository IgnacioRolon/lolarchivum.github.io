On my headset (Logitech G930&#039;s), or even just a normal pair of headphones, I only have sound coming from one side of my headset on the client.  In-game there is no problems what so ever.  I have found some fixes but I&#039;m not making my headset into a non surround sound just for a fix. Just curious of I was alone here.","replies":[{"poster":"Chemicalseb","date":"2015-09-10T17:30:04.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same pair at home and have had the same problem on multiple games. Sometimes the problem goes away randomly. I haven't found a fix so far. :/\nI haven't had that problem on a normal pair though. By normal pair do you mean a non-usb headset?","replies":[{"poster":"Baby sitting ADC","date":"2015-09-12T21:40:40.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Logic Tech headphones/head set  have a habit of doing that to a lot of games for some reason. I mean I have a head set and its weird because the mic broke so people barely hear me and then the head phones broke in wiring on one side. Its a common problem from drivers to loose wiring or sometimes its just not compatible with certain programs. (Like WoW was another one of those common things with this head set issue on their forums.) So it just varries on the potion you leave your head set on the desk or if your drivers for it are updated blah blah blah. Plus Logic Tech headsets are mostly temporary apparently. On average from like 6 months to 3 years on usage from most people...Which is disappointing to me because you could spend up to like 200 dollars for a head set that would get a default wiring issue from the factory or shipping problems. \n\nIt all just depends.","replies":[]}]}]}
