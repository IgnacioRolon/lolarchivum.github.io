Instead, even small ones were able to kill accomplished trackers and beasts.\n\nAs for Rek'Sai herself?  Oh dear me no - if the Noxians can't even capture one of her children (small and weak and stupid in comparison) they have NO HOPE WHATSOEVER of capturing Rek'Sai.  The idea of being able to then use her as some kind of weapon... wow.  That's an ambitious thought.\n\nMaybe I should turn it around - what do _you_ think it would take to be able to face Rek'Sai her preferred territory, the Shuriman Desert (The Sai'Khaleek)?  How many soldiers do you think you'd need, or something like it.  I'm not asking about in-game.  Rek'Sai can burrow through sand and solid rock, travels [faster than most land-animals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZNuTgQ8WFA), and is many times bigger than a camel.\n\n(Felt I could also link her color story:[ Sai Kahleek](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/reksai-color-story/), which follows someone who ventures into the desert.)","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2017-12-06T03:23:53.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=BvL1vVzE,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-12-05T22:04:16.267+0000)\n>\n> Maybe I should turn it around - what do _you_ think it would take to be able to face Rek&#x27;Sai her preferred territory, the Shuriman Desert (The Sai&#x27;Khaleek)? \n\nPeople get rid of moles using poisonous gases, so, i guess that they could use the biochemicals of Singed on the tunnels of the XerSai in order to kill all of the XerSai with the venom, including RekSai.

Like maybe not Sona herself, but people like her with a magical connection to music.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Líthillya","date":"2017-12-05T22:14:27.557+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"All you need is a thumper and a pair of maker hooks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nik Nikerson","date":"2017-12-07T00:04:16.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obviously all you need is Kevin Bacon and a plan.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5e3qoREpuA","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2017-12-05T22:11:56.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just 1, force Sion to wrestle Rek'Sai into submission","replies":[{"poster":"Talos of Altmora","date":"2017-12-06T03:08:46.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fairly sure Rek'Sai will just eat him... but he'll give one hell of a case of indigestion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TeddySongbird1","date":"2017-12-29T01:16:50.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I read the Sai Kahleek thing and I have a general question, maybe this isn the place but, why is there no guardian of the sands Rek'Sai?
