Like handing her over swords, giving her advice, carrying her stuff?

Kinda like in medieval times where the sons of Noblemen would tend their fathers armor and weapons like stuarts, its the same thing here. If her brother had taken the throne (had fiora not rebelled against the forced marriage) the roles may have been reversed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-10-27T00:31:35.740+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I agree with MajorTugh.  Fiora's brother, Ammdar, isn't serving his sister, so much as he is serving the head of the family.  Who just happens to be his younger sister.  No big deal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-10-27T03:20:58.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Narrative conservation of detail. Technically a noble house should probably have a bunch of servants to do all that stuff, maybe overseen by the brother. \n\nBut who wants to learn the name of her brother, the high steward, the chamberlain, the master of steels, the high marshal, and her personal squire?\n\nItâ€™s easier to just role them all up into one person.","replies":[]}]}
