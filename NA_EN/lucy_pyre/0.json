These are three completely different abilities and, as such, should trigger the keystone every time it&#039;s off cooldown. Thunderlord&#039;s was always triggered by this exact combo of abilities and it had the same requirements to go off as Electrocute. So I&#039;m uncertain as to why this &#039;new&#039; Thunderlords isn&#039;t going off from the same thing, and it diminishes the value of an otherwise amazing keystone on Lux.\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Final Spark Lux","date":"2017-11-11T00:14:54.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a thread about this a little while ago.

Apparently the change is intentional, though they were unaware as to why the change took place. I'm gonna try to get a response from someone else. Hopefully someone can shed some light on the situation, because it doesn't make sense for riot to leave thunderlords interaction in place the entire time it was released, and randomly decide to remove it here.\n\n In the mean time, may I suggest Arcane Comet? It doesn't burst as hard as electrocute, but if you're missing electrocute for the poke like old thunderlords had, it's the route to go. It's basically a guaranteed hit off Lux's E. I just recently played a game with it and had 100% hit rate. I don't quite like anything else in the sorc tree, but if I have to pick between comet consistency or electrocute never activating, I'd personally go with comet (though I haven't given up on trying electrocute. Just can't rely on it for poke anymore.)","replies":[{"poster":"Lucy Pyre","date":"2017-11-12T21:49:37.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's intentional? Well that's rather disheartening. That was a good interaction with Lux's passive that Thunderlord's always had. Oh well. As for Comet; I've played around with and tried it but I'm not a fan. It does give her more poke in lane but, at least personally, I feel that raw burst is more important for Lux as she loves one shot blowing people up when it comes late game. So I'd just rather have a bit less lane poke and more one shot potential later on, though that's just my preference. And since Electrocute goes off in Lux's full combo when she all in's someone I still think Electrocute is her best keystone, even taking into consideration that it won't proc on her poke unless she throws a Q as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Final Spark Lux","date":"2017-11-12T22:02:25.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Comet just makes more sense for me because I only play her as support and I want the poke. Besides, if they're poked down low enough, your combo will kill the enemy with or without your keystone up. Yesterday I got a killing blow with comet on a kalista in the fog of war. Was pretty funny","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-11T00:39:19.958+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lux passive is not a unique ability.

So it should, by all rights, proc it. If it is intentional that the passive can't proc Electrocute then that does nothing but weaken her early game, and Lux herself isn't exactly amazing regardless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jcmarin","date":"2017-11-14T02:26:42.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"passives are considered abilities, it has been like that since season 1.

Sometimes W -> Q -> Auto will proc it, and sometimes it takes a second auto. Honestly it just seems like the keystone is bugged.

I just hope it is a bug because otherwise it's essentially a pseudo nerf to Thunderlord's, and that'd be lame.","replies":[]}]}]}
