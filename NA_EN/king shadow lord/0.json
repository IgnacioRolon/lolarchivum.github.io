My guess as to why this happens is because it seems that casting Q creates a hitbox on the ground that deals the damage, so when you cast it in the death realm, the damage hitbox is created in the death realm and not in the real world. This is probably not intended as casting Mordekaiser's E - Death's Grasp right before his R's duration still allows it to drag enemies properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Alby08","date":"2019-06-26T11:05:52.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i hope they fix this I have lost to many times to this","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-26T03:43:52.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It worked fine.\n\n...in the Death Realm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"King Shadow Lord","date":"2019-06-26T13:15:04.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To all the people who don't believe this to be a bug... When you cast an ability, it does something. A bugged ability is when it doesn't do what is supposed to do.\nSo when you use your ultimate on Neeko while she is casting her ultimate, her ultimate still does something, just only to Mordekaiser. It still applies the damage and root.\nThat is an intended part of his kit. \nBut when Mordekaiser casts his Q and it doesn't do anything, that is supposed to not be a bug? It makes no sense for it to be intended that Mordekaiser cannot use only one ability but the others right before his ultimate ending.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-06-26T02:47:14.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Anything cast outside of it doesnt transfer in, and anything inside it doesnt transfer out.","replies":[{"poster":"King Shadow Lord","date":"2019-06-26T02:59:56.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How does that make sense for that to only apply to one of his abilities then?\nBoth Q and E can be cast from inside the death realm and only E applies its effects when you use it as the death realm ends.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Senior Papi","date":"2019-06-26T03:24:19.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good, it works both ways, ulting as mord can completely negate someone els's ult.
