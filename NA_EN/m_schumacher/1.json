That means that against big targets (like Baron or Dragon) it will have the same effective range it currently does (they've got enormous models, other monsters like Blue/Red it's very slightly shorter against, think half a step's worth). Against champions by contrast it will have a noticeably lower range. One of the reasons behind that change is the belief that Chilling Smite is making skillshot/free targeted offensive dash junglers (such as Lee Sin, Jarvan, Amumu etc), more reliable in early ganks than they should be.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-02-14T00:15:34.373+0000","up_votes":100,"down_votes":6,"body":"So, junglers with great mobility to get into range (ward hop, EQ J4, Vi Q, ect...) don't see a difference.

The past few months have in my opinion, been the balance team at their worst.\n-----------------------------\nLet's start way back with mana champions getting screwed over. You have a situation where** Energy/Resourceless champions went toe-to-toe with mana-using champion**. Then you proceed to screw mana champions over by nerfing their items while the likes of Zed/Yasuo/Akali/etc. remains completely untouched. You go overboard on nerfing Chalice, but champions who relied on it like {{champion:34}}  get nothing.\n\n\nNow we get to the jungle changes. {{champion:19}}  was ludicrously OP with the new jungle items, so something has to be done. Rather than nerfing the item, or nerfing Warwick, your balance team **nerfs BOTH without** considering the consequence of such heavy-handed changes.\n\nAnd while we're on the topic of heavy-handedness. We all agree {{champion:268}} needed nerfs, and the analysis was logical, he was powerful late game, yet he also bullies early game in lane. You guys stated you wanted to give him some early game weaknesses...so you proceed to nerf both his early AND late game by hitting his range.\n-------------------\nAnd that's not including the massive to-do list that's accumulated all throughout the years. {{champion:86}} is still a joke champion, {{champion:60}} was nerfed repeatedly and then left to rot, not even being able to top lane, tank junglers...\n\n\n\n---------------------------\n**edit:** Whoa that was more negative than was intended! I'll end it on something more positive I guess. I like your decision to remove DFG because I 100% agree with the assessment that it pigeonholes a number of champion builds, with {{champion:103}}  being the exemplar champion who was ruined by it. I'm also happy that Ahri was REVERTED back to what she originally was. It gives {{champion:69}}  players hope that maybe someday, she can be FIXED again.\n\n\nOf course, with the removal of DFG, the number of Garen players just went down from 4 to 1.

You said before that you want to adjust the jungle but not the champions, but virtually every change to the jungle has had more of an impact on the weaker ones instead of the top ones. Honestly, what is Riot's hesitation in nerfing Lee and J4? I am legit confused. Do you believe that they are balanced? Why not buff the rest of the junglers instead of nerfing their items?","replies":[{"poster":"DarkenedSoul420","date":"2015-02-15T01:25:35.866+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My prediction for next patch:\n\n\"Well it looks like junglers are still too strong in the earlygame so all basic jungle camps now take two minutes to respawn...yeah..that should fix it.\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Learnding","date":"2015-02-14T03:38:51.838+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=w8soy2sE,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-02-13T23:52:13.418+0000)\n>\n> We're testing changing Smite to measure from edge to edge, rather than from center to center, and then reducing its range.

You're nerfing smite because of your ingenious idea to be able to smite champions, which then led to a few nerfs to a few champions, now inevitably you're nerfing smite itself.  I can't tell if your balance team is either, retarded or just flat out never played League before.  Everything you've done since 2013 has either completely failed, backfired, or has been reverted because you have no idea what you're doing.","replies":[{"poster":"SecretAgentHulk","date":"2015-02-14T16:33:01.687+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You have great points, and then couch it in hostile language.
