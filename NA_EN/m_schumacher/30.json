Just asked the question on each thread. Her issue isn't her support style. Yes, poke supports aren't as meta because tank supports are in at the moment, but poke supports have been in since Sona's rework, yet Sona has either been oppressive and nerfed hard, or weak in higher level play.\n\nHer issue is everything she does scales off AP. Before she had a utility floor that scaled off teammate purchases and stats, not her own gold. This created a floor that allowed her to vary her build based on what she needed in that specific instance. She could build aura items with some mitigation and act as a flag bearer almost, pushing her team on with useful easy to tune auras or build AP and be a burst mage with utility effects in her downtime. In the early game she would have to bounce auras slower, and manage her stances, and in frantic fights, she could cycle her auras, giving her teamates the full benefit of them all, while managing her power chord and getting the appropriate effect. \n\nCurrently she has to build AP, everything scales off of it. She has no utility floor, and her abilities are all balanced on the fact that she must build AP, because when they weren't, she could build pure AP and get massive damage and utility at the same time. There is no differentiation between her mage spell damage playstyle and her utility support playstyle as they both need the same stats, so building for one builds for both.\n\nIt's not a balanceable situation, so what you end up with is a champion that is easy to play because of the PBAoE auto targeting effects, that dramatically falls off based on opponent awareness of her abilities, and allies willingness or ability to stay close. \n\nWhen the enemy is aware of what Sona can do, Sona can't do anything, because her ratio's and bases were nerfed so they wouldn't be a problem with her new scaling identity. Issue is she's not strong enough without those items to face her opponent without them. When she get's them she isn't even a \"Hyper-support\" as her ratios and effects were made to scale appropriately with items rather than strongly to compensate for her weak early game.\n\nWhat Sona used to be, for me at least, was the ultimate buff support. And a surprisingly deep one that had a ton of little things you would pick up on as you got better. She had poke, but she brought more buffs to the team than any other support. I was able to work on proper positioning in teamfights, managing ability chains and decision making to decide which power chord I would want to use rather than just spamming QWEAAQWEAAQWEAA and wondering why my powerchord wasn't doing as much damage as I thought it should. \n\nNot unrelated, but undirected, if (nontargeted) you don't understand why Sona's powerchord wouldn't do a lot of damage in the described situation you're one of the players that thought she was just a depthless champion that took no thought.\n\nCurrent Sona's AoE's are 350 range IIRC, Soraka's W was 450 range and it was buffed as it was realized that her trying to get that close to the frontline to buff an ally wasn't a reasonable expectation. Additionally there is less ability management incentive to the new effects as the effects are so short lived. Because the new effects are one off consumable, or short duration, you don't incentivize intelligent usage, instead simply try to get the most effect on your team as possible as there is no penalty to not doing so.\n\nThis really is a situation where previous healthy gameplay that was enjoyed by many players, even if it isn't the type of mechanic that Riot likes, should transcend intention. This is a rework that should be reverted. It really feels like healthy gameplay was made unbalanceable, unique gameplay was lost, and a playstyle that was enjoyed by many was deleted because the rework crew didn't like it and got a chance to do so.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-15T06:20:43.161+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Currently she has to build AP, everything scales off of it.

Almost no one upgrades {{item:3303}} into {{item:3092}} and just rather swap it or leave it there until they need the slot for something else.\n\n{{item:3504}} this item has a lot of potential but once again, the AP it gives is too small and the passive, at least in my opinion, is lackluster. The passive either needs to be better or give slightly more AP or something but as of right now the item is too niche and not very useful even when the niche scenario is available.\n\n{{item:3050}} this on the other hand is a great item for supports (although ironically it's easier seen in solo laners than supports) since it gives decent stats all around and the active feels rewarding to use.\n\nSupport itemization is the main thing that is holding mage supports from being that useful the later the game goes since if they want to reach decent amounts of AP they either need to invest in lackluster items or go into the expensive items from solo laners which by the time they do manage to get them it could be too late.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2015-08-15T03:46:50.564+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YfqXUJKM,comment-id=0014,timestamp=2015-08-15T02:47:19.058+0000)\n>\n> I feel for all the people saying Sona needs some love at the moment, but I have to say I'm not convinced that she just needs more damage.

Sona is squishy and will give if caught, but that happens too often, and she has no reliable way to try and evade. \n\nBut as for why poke supports arn't viable at the moment, I feel like that's a problem that could be fixed with the frost queen's line.

My suggestion would be to change the active to \"sona AND her allies gain movement for 1.5 seconds\" and adding something to the passive part. Maybe it gives a temporary aura of 25% tenacity? \n\nAlso \"extends the duration of her aura for each ally she aids\" is on all her basic abilities.

If anything blame Thresh/Blitz for being so OP and being picked/banned in every LCS, Ranked, Normals game.\n\n\nLet's compare it to Taric then.  both champions have a heal that does them and 1 ally.  However Taric's heal does it for twice the amount.  Once you hit the late game Taric also has his passive to allow for ability spamming if he so desires.  Sona's shield might come into play if it didn't fall off so fast.  As both a bonus and an issue Sona can not choose who she heals, bonus is it will always attempt to heal the ally with the lowest health, downside if they are going to die anyway i might prefer to heal a different champion who isn't 2 seconds away from death regardless.\n\nLet's also point out that her utility floor is a deep dark dungeon.  The base numbers are fairly low, and she has a 20% AP ratio on her heal.  This means that even if you build a very AP heavy \"support\" build, let's say 400 AP you are still only healing for a bonus 80 health per cast.\n\nI personally would rather have a different ability for her E then the movement speed buff.  Even with max CDR you can only cast it once per 7.2 seconds and it only works for 1.5 seconds on your allies.  Even in long chases where it's most useful you end up having to pop it something like 3-5 times before the speed bonus adds up enough to have a real effect.  So you are using 195-325 mana over the course of 30-40 seconds to MAYBE catch or escape an enemy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SwordGrunt","date":"2015-08-15T16:17:24.534+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Holy shit there are actually people in this thread that want massive buffs to Sona\n\nWhat a fucking joke\n\nSona is literally the most anti-fun support to play against in the entire game\n\nSay whatever you want about Thresh, Leona, Blitzcrank, but if you dodge their skillshots they're fucking worthless outside of melee range\n\nThe fuck do you do against Sona?
