She only made it unfun for your mid laner during laning phase.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Nidalee is a jungle champ that has one of if not the best level 2 cheese in the game, makes every lane unfun when she ganks, and still fulfills the same purpose of Old Nidalee come late game, except she can actually execute targets then Zhonyas. Jungle Nidalee is WAY WORSE than any other iteration of Nidalee.\r\n\r\nSo in summary:\r\n\r\nOld Nid: Throw spears, do 80% of squishys HP force them to back\r\n\r\nNew Nid: Throw spears, do 60% of squishys HP, execute them and Zhonyas and autowin teamfight. Also makes life miserable from the very start of the game and has no weak point in the game. Also has top tier clear speeds and VERY FEW downsides.","replies":[{"poster":"DJ Di0","date":"2015-07-27T20:41:24.174+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pros:\n-Fast clear speed\n-Good Sustain\n-Low CD\n-High Damage\n\nCons:\n-Squishy\n-Mana item dependant (not building tear/RoA means you can't spam spears later on)\n-Feast or Famine in nature\n-Falls off lategame\n-No CC\n\nShe's definitely not weak atm, but that's mostly due to Runeglaive being really good.

What she lacks in CC she more than makes up for her in absolutely insane damage. If any of your lanes have CC that can gaurantee a spear hit its 100% kill.","replies":[{"poster":"DJ Di0","date":"2015-07-27T20:49:42.041+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=M Schumacher,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fQijUL7z,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-07-27T20:42:44.213+0000)\n>\n> What Nidalee doesn't build RoA or Seraphs?\n> \n> It's the second item you buy after Runeglaive.

That's not really Nidalee's fault if her team has a Maokai. It's the same case when people argue about Yasuo's ultimate and how it synergizes well with knockup champions {{champion:61}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:111}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-07-27T21:51:21.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually think Evelynn or Poppy have one of the best level 2 cheese ganks out of all of the Junglers. Pretty interesting to get first blood 3 minutes into the game.\n\nBut yeah I think Nidalee is a problem, since she's a high risk-high reward champion that also will either instakill you with 0 counterplay, or just simply die.  Didn't Riot mention something about her possibly being reworked though? She really needs one and I hope that they turn her into an overall less broken champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Morgy Morgy","date":"2015-07-27T21:11:54.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Am I the only person who doesnt play Nidalee like a yolo assassin?\nI just get tear of the goddess, 40% cdr and full ap with no lich bane, and spend the entire teamfight healing and spamming spears.
