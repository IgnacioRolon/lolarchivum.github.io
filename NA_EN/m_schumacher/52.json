You blame others for all your losses, and praise yourself for placing a ward, or blame your team when you get caught. Don't let anyone tell you you're not good at your job, because if you do its obvious that them being 10/0 while having 0 interaction with you for the duration of the game is definitely because you picked Sona support and rolled your face on your keyboard.. Some people have good games, and others have bad games, and when you have bad games its always your ADC and jungler's fault. You guys don't need praise for doing what you do. Stay salty Support Mains.","replies":[]}
