There was a time and place in the meta when Lee Sin was truly a terror in the jungle but unfortunately the current meta is not that place. Lee Sin falls off way easier than other jungle picks while also having a massive skill gap in Lee Sin players. Lee Sin is very inconsistent in the current meta of tanks and I&#039;d highly suggest not picking him unless you&#039;re Insec or Gripex or you like losing.\n\n\n\n\n&quot;tahm kench/hecarim main streamer&quot;\n\n\"muh rank 8 NA abusing freelo\"\n\n\"lcs teams offered me but i declined lel\"","replies":[]}
