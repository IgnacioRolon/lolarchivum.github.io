Always get Hextech Revolver first and upgrade it later after finishing your second item. After the change you can even consider not upgrading it until the enemy tanks got some MR. Rest should be built according to the situation. Good items are: Abyssal Scepter, Zhonyas, Rabadons, Void Staff, Ludens Echo is also somewhat okay and maybe an early Haunting Guise for the magic pen (sell it later though). I feel like the biggest noob traps are Spirit Visage (the thing offers no offensive stats and you're a mage after all, the 20% healing increase doesn't really make a difference, the 10% CDR isn't worth it, could be good if it was 20% and the HP > AP bonus from his passive is horrible while the AP > HP bonus is really good) and Liandrys (you don't even have real CC and that thing doesn't synergize as good with your kit as other things do, the only champs this item will ever be really good on are Rumble, Swain, Lissandra and maybe Zyra [tell me if i forgot someone]).

So, you get 88 AP 412 hp and 4% hp pen which with someone at 4k hp is an extra 160 dmg, that's pretty huge. Yes, not all teams have tanks so obviously this isn't a \"CORE FOREVER\" item. However, Vlad's items are pretty match-up based though.\n\nAlso, Spirit Visage as a \"bad item\"... really? So, you are trying to make a mage who has to get into the fights to do damage be completely a glass cannon with almost no tankiness. Really? So let's look at some numbers. Spirit Visage gives 400 hp, 10 ap (Vlad's passive) MR (we're looking at dmg here) 10% CDR and 20% increased healing from all sources. So, you now are healing for 18% of dmg dealt for all your spells instead of the normal 15% (because everyone grabs WotA). Ok, now let's look at the CDR portion. Your Q is a 4 second cd at max ranks, your W is 14 seconds, and E is 4.5 seconds. So, that 10% cdr is giving your Q a CD of 3.6, your W a cd of 12.6, and your E a cd of 4.05. Yes that's not insanely huge, however think about a team fight. You are able to get more rotations of your spells off due to the CDR and being able to SURVIVE through the dmg because you are more tanky. Also, you can HEAL for more so if you come out of that fight lower hp, you get more sustain off of minions through SV, AND you can have your pool up more to get out of sticky situations. Yes, you might get \"more dmg\" on each cast of your spells with your deathcap but with a .6 and .45 ap ratios are they worth it when your base damages are really good for a mage? I won't lie again, SV is a situational pick-up again, but by no means is it a noob-trap. It is a very good item on Vlad it's just there are so many other good items you have to build according to the team. \n\nSo, idk what type of glass cannon vlad build you do, but by nature for Vlad to do damage he has to get a bit close to his targets and is pron to being focused so although you might have a higher upfront dmg build, if you die then how are you going to be doing damage? Also, since vlad is a versatile champion with his builds, sometimes he does have to be a \"front-line\" for his team so he will have to be tankier. You are underplaying the strength of simply being alive and taking punishment for your team where you should be a threat, but by taking the focus, your ADC (who should be pumping out dps) should be able to delete people as they can sit back and just wreck.\n\ntl;dr: {{item:3151}}  and {{item:3065}}  are good items on Vlad and stating otherwise is stupid. However, they are situational  just like every other item that you pick up other than {{item:3152}}  due to the multiple ways to play vlad and to fit into a team comp correctly.","replies":[{"poster":"I Miss Cannon","date":"2015-07-11T17:32:40.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"With troll pool and Zhonyas you are able to get your rotations off and still stay close to the enemy without being bursted down. And i repeat myself, building more AP results in gaining extreme amounts of health due to his passive.

Capping CDR is honestly overrated by many people on Vladimir, being able to deal 60% of the health of the enemy ADC/any other squishy alone with his ult proc because you built full offensive expect the semi-defensive items like Abyssal and Zhonyas is far better.

The last time I have ever seen a Vlad build {{item:3083}}  is back in s2 when it gave you 1350 hp and then it was still not a great buy. Also, you fail to realize that Vlad is played in TOP LANE just as he is in mid. I mostly play him top, but when I do play him mid my build is different due to the lane matchups and different summoners I can take since I am not forced into {{summoner:12}}  to match my enemy. Also, you can't zhonyas/troll pool in stuns or silences. So, if you are going full ap and working simply on your \"hp from passive\" and \"OMG I HAVE LOTS OF RESISTS FROM 2 ITEMS!!!\" then you will simply be melted by any AD carry or mage. News flash, 100 armor is almost achievable for most champions simply with runes, masteries, and being lvl 18. It's not much and any AD carry with as many items as you will eat you alive for breakfast, and you have to get close enough to touch that AD carry with no dashes so you're probably going to be walking by Mr. Tank if the AD carry has any brains who will cc you and then you will be shreded because with normal pen your 100 armor is really only 65 armor (thanks LW+masteries). So, you might be able to \"kill\" an AD carry with 2 rotations but with your build that is 4 seconds to do. Even if you zhonyas or troll pool that's only half the time, so unless the AD carry is off in no man's land they'll be healing via lifesteal. So, maybe full AP vlad can work, but still you have to be adaptive with your play and builds and it seems like you have a cookie-cutter build for every team and that's how you lose games. If you want an example of cookie-cutter builds failing look at the TSM vs GV game. The shout casters kept commenting that TSM really needed to adapt their build paths to the game itself and stop going cookie-cutter builds because it wasn't going to work vs the enemy team and if that had made better decisions in items like AS boots over magic pen on Corki since he needed to AA more since the enemy team was stacking lots of MR they would have done a lot better. \n\ntl;dr: Vlad is amazing because of his adaptive build paths. If you refuse to realize that people play vlad top along with mid and sometimes you have carry tops (Riven) and refuse to adapt your build for each game then you will lose due to ignorance and stubbornness.","replies":[{"poster":"I Miss Cannon","date":"2015-07-12T14:05:48.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, keep up with insulting me, way to good discussions.

However, if you really want a good discussion trying to call me a \"stupid ignorant sliver player\" is not helping it at all. Also, if you're going to try and insult someone about their rank at least take like a minute and learn their rank. So, since you find calling people \"stupid ignorant silver players\" I actually took the minute to pull up your rank which is silver. Hmm, is it really an insult to me or your low self-esteem that you have to try and insult others. I am not going to state my rank because it does not matter within the discussion, but if you do want to take the minute to find out, you'll know that I'm not insulted when someone like you insults me because I know where I am and it's not in Silver V like you.\n\nHowever, if we want to get back to the true discussion and actually look at a \"high Elo Vlad\" player, idk... maybe a pro player in the LCS, because they probably know something right? you find this [](http://(http://na.lolesports.com/na-lcs/2015/summer/matches/week-1/team-liquid-vs-team-8)) So, a pro player built {{item:3065}}   and not {{item:3001}} . Hmm... yeah {{item:3065}} is never picked up by pro players or ever used. Ok, then why did T8's player grab it? As I looked through the NA LCS games, the ONLY player who grabbed {{item:3001}}  was Shiphtur. The other vlad builds consisted of going more of a mage build (mostly coming from Seraph, but to be fair they have only 1 win and that's because of their mid and AD carry not Seraph's build). So, when you state that \"any high Elo Vlad\" player will say that {{item:3001}}  is better than {{item:3065}}  then wouldn't the pros who play Vlad agree with that, but yet we see that's not true. Well maybe NA pros don't know anything! Ok let's look at other pros.\n\nWell, if we look at odoamne from Europe's H2k who are #3 in Europe atm, he built {{item:3065}} . But but but it's not an option and any high elo player will tell you not to build it! Huh, the top laner on the #3 team in Europe is wrong about his build? [(http://www.probuilds.net/guide/EUW/2197929780/21001130)]. Maybe even Europe doesn't know how to play so let's go to Korea where they are the best! \n\nWell KT Rolster's top laner Ssumday even built {{item:3065}} as an item over {{item:3001}}. [(http://www.probuilds.net/guide/KR/1964093981/1252130)] Even Koreans build {{item:3065}}  as an item, even though it's not an option. So, instead of making wild accusations about high elo people believing this, please look at high elo or pro player builds, because let's face it they know how to optimize champions better than you or me especially with their coaching staff theory-crafting for them and giving them input. So, unless you want to argue with the \"high elo Vlad\" players who are making a living by playing this game competitively, I'm pretty sure that {{item:3065}}  is actually an ok item on Vlad. \n\ntl;dr: When multiple pros from different regions (examples of Europe, NA, and Korea) build {{item:3065}}  on Vlad they might KNOW what they're doing over someone who isn't a \"high elo vlad\" player like you or me.","replies":[{"poster":"I Miss Cannon","date":"2015-07-12T16:33:50.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Flagrock,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=R1EdwEeX,comment-id=0003000000000001000100000000000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-12T16:17:29.240+0000)\n>\n> One, if I have insulted you that was not my intent.

You really have to understand the circumstances these items are built in and not only \"THESE PRO PLAYERS BOUGHT THIS IN THIS SINGLE MATCH\".  I don't want to repeat myself thousand times that Vladimirs passive also grants you more than enough HP by building AP while building Liandries gives you 8 AP lol. But yeah, keep being ignorant. Way to go.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"biomaster","date":"2015-07-11T15:33:14.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i find it hard to just pick 6 items on vlad.

He picks a person and drains blood from them.
