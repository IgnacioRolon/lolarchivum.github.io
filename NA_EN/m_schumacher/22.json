A) Your team fed the Rengar 15+ kills, B) Your carry is incredibly underleveled. Either scenario is working as intended. \r\n\r\n&gt; &quot;Rengar has no counterplay, you can&#039;t see him coming!&quot;\r\n&gt;\r\n\r\nIf this is the case then your team is failing to maintain ward control in the applicable side of map. Your team is likely so far behind that literally any other jungle champ could have accomplished the same thing. If you refuse to buy pink wards and are playing aggressively vs a Rengar you fully deserve to lose.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; &quot;Rengar is easy to play just facerolls and presses R then Q and 1 shots me!&quot;\r\n&gt;  \r\n\r\nRengar actually has the hardest combo of any assassin in the game next to Zed. Seeing a Rengar pull off a flawless combo is something special and should be observed with admiration for that players skill. It&#039;s also entirely likely you walked away from your minions/team and have bad reaction time so you ate a point blank empowered Bola. \r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\n\r\n**TIPS FOR PLAYING AGAINST A RENGAR**\r\n\r\n1. Group as 5. Rengar has an extremely difficult time assassinating someone when your team is grouped and is playing properly (protecting the carries, pink wards in inventory, etc). This is of course only true if your team hasn&#039;t already fed the opposing team.\r\n\r\n2. Don&#039;t split push as an ADC. This should be pretty obvious.\r\n\r\n3. Buy Zhonyas on any champion that can use it (e.g. EVERY MAGE IN THE GAME).\r\n\r\n4. Invade Rengars jungle early game. He has a hard time dealing with being cheesed. If Rengar is playing top don&#039;t pick something garbage top that loses to him.","replies":[]}
