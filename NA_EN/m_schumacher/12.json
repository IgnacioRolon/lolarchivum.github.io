His W not only counters every assassin/burst champion in the game, but it has a 6 second cooldown, yeah SIX SECONDS cooldown on an ability that counters EVERY assassin in the game. Not only that but it also has the luxury of dealing 32% of any enemys MAXIMUM HEALTH with no damage items at all. \r\n\r\nDid I mention his E gives him two health bars??\r\n\r\nOh and he gets free damage from building health on his autos and abilities, cuz you know, why the fuck not?\r\n\r\nHis W needs a massively increased cooldown.","replies":[]}
