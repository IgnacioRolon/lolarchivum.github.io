Cooldown looks rather short.\r\n\r\nQ: Lunge: Small skillshot looks to be about the size of Grave&#039;s E that prioritizes champions, applies on hit effects, and cooldown is lowered if she strikes an enemy.\r\n\r\nW: Line skillshot that blocks enemy basic attacks and hard cc for .5s, If she blocks enemy CC it stuns the target otherwise it slows them.\r\n\r\nE: Next two basic attacks have increased attack speed, the first attack slows but cannot crit but the second attack is a gauranteed crit.\r\n\r\nR: Targets enemy champion, attacking their &quot;vital spots&quot; dealing Max Percent Health TRUE DAMAGE. If she destroys all 4 weak spots before the target dies she creates an AoE heal that heals her and her allies.\r\n\r\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-update/champion-update-fiora","replies":[]}
