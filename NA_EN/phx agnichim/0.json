This whole situation has actually mentally screwed me up to be honest, riot says they care yet i am still perm banned even after putting a ticket in. For better clarification i have been playing this game since 2011 roughly and spent a ton of money on it (not the richest person but when i knew i had some money left over i went for this game because i love it more than i like to admit) after getting a 14 day ban i honestly started improving immediately because of that fear of getting perma banned and seeing all this time and money wasted would be too much for me to handle and to be frank it really is.","replies":[{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2019-08-28T21:27:41.280+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Damn, do you announce that youre gonna report someone every game?

It doesn't make any sense to tell the thief you're calling the police. You just prevent them from doing it to you again with the push of a button, report it to the police, and go on with your day. You don't stand outside screaming \"I'm calling the police! You hear me? The COPS! You're going downtown! It's prison for you!\" for 20 minutes while everyone around you wishes they'd stayed home today.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player):\n\n> Do not threaten or repeatedly tell a player you will report them. Doing so can encourage players who are already negative to continue their behavior. Whether they know they are being reported or not has no bearing to whether the system will act on them. But most importantly, repeatedly threatening or arguing with a negative player can end up derailing the game for everyone else and then open yourself up to reports and possible disciplinary action as well. Avoid negative thoughts and useless chatting with poor performing teammates! Focus on victory by muting the offending player and then reporting them at the end of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-08-30T02:59:49.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Riot is the only gaming company that bans for \"toxicity\",\n\n Ubisoft bans for toxicity as well. \n\nMicrosoft and Sony ban users on a case-by-case basis for toxic private messages.\n\n>never heard in the last 30 years of games that I have played\n\n You're 30+ yet you couldn't start a response without a sarcastic remark and an attempt to insult my character by calling me 10 even though, in actuality, I'm just an adult with a different opinion?\n\n>Of course, but does it work to effectively reduce the probability of you meeting someone mean online?
