I get it in theory, combined with a good few stacks of their passive and botrk, phantom strike must hurt, but it seems sort of trappy to me.  Kindreds early game is extremely important,  you need to get consistent  marks or you fall into mediocrity/uselessness.  Warrior is pretty much the early game power spike jungle item, while devourer(esp with its nerfs) delay their power spike until later into the mid game.","replies":[]}
