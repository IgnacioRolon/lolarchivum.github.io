Folks from the team Include User Experience, Engineering, Visual Design, and QA experts, so ask away and we'll do our best to answer as many as we can.\n\nThanks,\n-Chager\n\n\n==========================\n\n\nOk all, we're going to call it there for now. Some awesome questions and hopefully equally good answers from us all. We still want to keep the conversation going so we'll be visiting this and other threads while the HUD is on PBE. In the mean time keep the feedback coming and we look forward to some good conversations and making the HUD Update awesome for y'all.\n\nThanks,\n-Clarity Team","replies":[]}
