I can join the game, but then It disconnects me as soon as the cards load. This first happened when I was going to play a vs. AI game because I need 5 more EXP points to level up. Eventually, after trying twice, I was placed in a lower priority queue! I really need to get out of this, I don't think I can stand waiting 20 minutes before my next match ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-29T16:41:37.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system will treat all leaves equally because they cause negative experiences for others, so it's really important to resolve whatever is causing you to disconnect so much.  I recommend using the instructions found in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help with that.  Otherwise, let me know how I can help with any technical issues like that!","replies":[]}]}
