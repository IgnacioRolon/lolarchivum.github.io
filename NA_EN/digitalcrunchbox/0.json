I also have crashes where when the game start it would experience an critcial error and crash. What fixes it for me was when i uninstalled a windows update. yes for some reason a windows update causes the game to crash but it was only league of legends when starting a game. so it doesnt affect other games. Please also note that the computer i am using has a Ryzen 1600 cpu. Why is this important? well because i also have a gaming laptop from msi with an intel cpu which is also up to date windows. this laptop does not experience these crashes. idk about anyone else but this seems to show that the problem is the fault of riot or microsoft. please note that this is a temporary fix, as your computer will try to download the problomatic update without your consent and you will found yourself unable to play your match because of the crashes. there are ways to prevent windows from updating the specific  update. please note that its a specific update and you may have to unistall an update and see which one is causing the crashes. also note that not all new update will cause crashes as a newer update may not cause any issues as like an older one.","replies":[{"poster":"SilverRainy","date":"2020-01-12T04:04:54.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"go to update history and then go to uninstall update to uninstall specific updates. for me rn the problamatic update which causes my game to crash is Update for microsoft windows KB4530684","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Poisonous Darts","date":"2019-07-22T00:52:51.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"smh yall need to fix this game. this also happens to me. tried hextech repair tool, nothing. fix. this. game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Positivism","date":"2019-07-19T20:41:20.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Master","date":"2019-07-19T13:15:26.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has been happening to me since the release of the new patch 2 days ago.
