Since account transfers are not the same cash cow as skins and champions I get it. Riot is a business and they need to make money. People trying to transfer accounts are in the minority of the money pool that riot is worried about. \r\n\r\nStill doesn&#039;t make this whole situation any less ridiculous. The business model doesn&#039;t bother me, the way you treat your customers does. STOP FUCKING LYING AND JUST TELL US YOU DONT GIVE A SHIT. Don&#039;t spoon feed us bs to keep us quiet for a month or two so you can find the time to wrangle up a bunch of college interns to fix this issue for the least amount of money possible. Give us legitimate updates instead of one or two sentences that all equate to &quot;we don&#039;t know&quot;. That is pure laziness. Everything riot has done and said up to this point has been lazy but who am I to judge. I&#039;m just a single voice trying to point out how fucked up this company has become over the years.","replies":[{"poster":"053","date":"2017-12-01T13:56:50.206+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"A discount would be pretty nice. Free transfers would be awesome but I am not asking for that much unless it takes even longer than 5-6 weeks for transfers to come back... that would be twice they've delayed it.

What point would we have in lying to you?  Transfers are broken, it sucks.  This has nothing to do about money or trying to stick it to you.  Our devs found an issue with transfers, and they've been working on getting it resolved as soon as they can.  I'm not a psychic or have a magic wand, so trying to give you any specific date would be false and I'm not trying to have your pitchfork stuck into me.  :P  I know it's a crappy situation, just hang tight until it's been fixed.\n\n-- For players looking for updates, unfortunately transfers are taking longer than expected to come back up. \nOur devs found some technical problems with the system and have been working on a fix.  Updates are being posted in [this thread ](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/rlu6awv4-transfer-service-update)for the time being.  I know this isn't a lot of information, and I'll keep trying to get more.","replies":[{"poster":"Antoyex","date":"2017-12-03T09:07:12.019+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"I totally get you Porocles. Its hard to be a player support sometimes especially when players are frustrated about technical issues. This looks like far beyond simple but even though some of us has to be chilling. Also for the players who whine about having more than 200 ping and not being able to play hey you are not alone. This is screwing all of us but you cant be over reacting a technical issue on a support. Its not going to satisfy you or fix your problem but gonna be a nightmare for another human being. \n\nThanks for trying your best to updates us on news Porocles. Have a nice day pal. P.s: I agree on the free server transfer for one way to any server when they are fixed. That might cool down some players who are over reacting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Report Enlón","date":"2017-12-19T14:32:05.547+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"**I think you should stop commenting on this issue**. To fix this issue can't take 3 months for a big company dedicated to just 1 game.

That's fine, never-mind no other game I play does this. Riot has set a timeline for late November to resume transfers.   Late November arrives.... no dice. Turn of the month i decide to check it out and some NA player support is pulling an \"I'm not a psychic card\" as if its unreasonable for Riots customers to expect someone to have a timeline for them??? Then link a locked thread that hasn't been posted on in 2 weeks??? I'm not saying Riot is obligated to comp any services, but you would think they would be able to give some update beyond \"well I don't have a wand\". You work for the company troubleshooting the issue, no ones asking for magic, they are asking you provide an ETA based on Riots understanding of its own technical issue. We're definitely not asking to be treated like we're bullying you because people are frustrated about missing a timeline. Drop the victim nonsense and provide player support thanks.  ETA???","replies":[{"poster":"HmoobPandaTsab","date":"2017-12-05T23:27:20.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Trap7x","date":"2017-12-06T01:06:06.909+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't mind a company doing what is best for its bottom line, but if you're going to hire people as \"player support\" it would be nice for them to be able to provide some measure of information and not act like timelines are some weird mystical concept that no one could possibly provide.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"0racle0912","date":"2017-12-01T13:47:24.345+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm frustrated too, but I can understand that they didn't see this coming.

Its a lot easier for you to sit here and be mad but you gotta realize these are humans you are talking to/being mean at. Porocles is just informing you of whats happening so don't shoot the messenger. \n\nUntil you are in the workers position I don't think you should sit here and complain about what you think should be a reasonable time for the transfer to be fixed in. Go work for riot if you think its so easy to fix this in 1-2 weeks. Riot wouldn't randomly decide to just cause problems for no reason. They are a company and companies are always trying to make things convenient for their customers so it would be contradicting to \"rob\" your precious time and money.","replies":[{"poster":"Iholdmypoopin","date":"2017-12-03T01:02:28.251+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"Thats the thing, this isn't a 1-2 week ordeal, they have been \"working\" on this for over a month already.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HmoobPandaTsab","date":"2017-12-03T19:24:55.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Persy","date":"2017-12-03T22:55:25.333+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think the problem is you trying to speak out about this issue, but more about how you come off as. You bashed a support player for doing their job and then continued being disrespectful. Everyone agrees that this situation is bothersome and there should be some kind of discount for taking longer than expected. Just because there is a delay doesn't mean its okay for you to hurt others. Yes, you can speak your mind however you like! Just know that your words have consequences and not everyone is going to agree with what you have to say. \n\nI really do hope there is some sort of discount especially if it takes longer than the estimated 5-6 weeks. I know riot is trying their hardest though because transfers alone cost 20$ while skins can vary in price. I am sure they wouldn't want to lose that much money even if there aren't that many people who purchase transfers (though seeing how many people are mad over the delay I doubt its a small number.)\n\nAnyways, next time maybe its best to just talk about discounting the price and focusing on what should be done after transfer is back then to sit here and complain/bash others.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Setic","date":"2017-12-19T02:18:37.060+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should realise that Christmas is coming.\nPeople tend to buy stuff at a higher rate, like gifts and everyone at vacation especially students and to be more accurate kids, so money is spent.\nSo Basically Riot, is adding new content and event stuff to sell, so this is a selling season.\nThis time of year Riot will get to the sale Peak.\n\nAnd Riot’s full team will be busy With  this Massive event.\nAnd Fixing a Server transfer issue for like 300-500 people ( less than 1% of players ), is not as important.\n\n5 to 6 weeks to fix, is quite funny....\nThis is like after the Event ends.\nBasically Riot is not working with a fix at all, but sure they will after the event ends.\n\nI bet a company Like Riot, can build a full new server and get it up and running in less than 6 weeks if they want.\n\nI might be wrong, but this is what reasoning reflects.\nAnyway, This is a free game and they should make money out of it to keep it running and Make profit.\n\nBut we deserve free transfers after all that time we had to wait... and spare some time to fix it soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TNE Lowkey","date":"2017-12-18T10:36:59.366+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Why the hell cant we transfer When 4 weeks have already been wasted for your uselhets engineers to fix this thing together?
