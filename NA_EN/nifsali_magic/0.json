The Jax Tooltip.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When Jax kills you and you click on Death Re-Cap, the tooltip says that Jax is powerful up close meele, and to only engage him in short bursts so he can not attack you as much.\n\nNow I play Neeko. What does this tooltip mean when there is absolutly no way to &#039;not&#039; engage Jax and do short burts, since he has a move where he jumps at you, then instant kills you. When all is said and done, the whole thing Mimic&#039;s a 100% damage ranged attack.\n\nAm I doing something wrong with Neeko? Or is the tooltip absolutly pointless?\n\nI&#039;ve only been playing League of Legends for 8 weeks so the tooltips(when you die to champions) are very important to me for learning how to fight different champions.\n\nI just want to know if there is a way to use this tooltip or if it&#039;s absolutly pointless.","replies":[]}
