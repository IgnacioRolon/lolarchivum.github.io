I play on a daily basis, am not toxic, and always bring my team up with positive vibes. Played one game with my friend and he got level honor 3. Why I am saying this is because he has not played in over 3 months and plays 1 game and got honor level 3. I play anywhere from 3-8 games a day and get anywhere from 1-2 honors a game. Anyone with any knowledge of why this might happen?","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2017-09-26T09:37:37.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You gotta go for that sweet everyone earns an honor for honoring each other bonus, and not honor the friend/premade cause it gives little points but play cancer hard carry champs like {{champion:157}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:105}} being the scum of the earth as you are swimming in piles of honor for carrying, \"honor\" just isn't the same anymore as the old honor meaning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Killer3000189","date":"2017-09-25T00:06:29.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honoring, getting honored and just playing the game adds to you leveling up, Although if you are qued with someone you basically won't progress if you honor them or if they honor you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drugoth","date":"2017-09-25T00:04:36.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you give out your honors, who do you give them to?
