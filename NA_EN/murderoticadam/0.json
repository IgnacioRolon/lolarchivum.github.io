However there are some ADC's that are less reliant on their team, {{champion:15}} for example, who is able to block enemy abilities and use her ult to get out of danger. But ADC's generally have better items nowadays to cope with the pressures of being an ADC. As a support main, you know, there is nothing more annoying then an over-agressive ADC at the start of the game who doesn't know the champion you are playing very well and insists on trying to rush for kills and ends up feeding because you do not have the needed power to ensure they are successful yet. I think that is one of the reasons {{champion:43}} was become popular again (I picked her up way before her recent popularity spike). She provides power straight away and can get her shield at level two, instantly providing powerful poke and powerful utility with her ultimate.\n\nI just pray to the Riot lords that she does not get nerfed or even worse \"reworked\" because of her recent increase in popularity.

That said, I understand my champion, and most meta supports. Right now in the current meta, I can't think of a single support that can't properly support an early aggressive ADC. \n\nDuring champ select, AND at the start of the game I make sure to let my support know that I play very aggressive, because I know properly supporting that aggression requires starting with a different skill than if I were playing passive. The problem arises when, despite me saying that I'm going to be aggressive, the support only levels the passive skill.\n\nFor example: Soraka:W>Q>E for aggressive vs Q>W>E for passive. Morgana: Q or E for aggressive (depending on enemy bot lane) Q and W for passive lane. Janna? Please dont take W in the first 2 levels. Put a shield on me, and tornado peel if I get in trouble. \n\nI mean personally, I prefer a soraka played at her relatively low skill ceiling over a thresh played at a mediocre level. With raka staying out of danger while healing, slowing, and silencing enemies, I feel as though I'm in a 1v2 except with greatly increased health. With good ADC mechanics its stupid easy to get a double kill level 2 with a well played soraka.\n\nTLDR: Sorry, I kinda went off on a tangent, but my point is that supporting an adc that plays aggressive early on doesn't need a support with a lot of damage.

Trying to kite with Kalista after you hit 2.0 attack speed is kind of brutal on your CPS, and even the most minimal mistake means death. At least as a tank you can make a mistake and probably survive because you can take that amount of damage. \n\nPlus, ADCs always have champions like {{champion:238}}  and {{champion:7}}  and {{champion:64}}  and  {{champion:121}}  and  {{champion:107}}   who are looking to typically kill your first, so it's kind of stressful having that type of pressure when you know if they touch you, you die instantly, even if you don't necessarily do anything obviously wrong. Mistakes that lead to death could be just being slightly too far away from your support or being slightly too far forward where any other role would be fine being positioned.\n\nBased on damage output, ADC is usually among the top tier damage threats on a team, and if you die, you can singlehandedly concede any team fight because you're not there. That's a big amount of pressure to carry around. I've personally played very nervously in fights because I know if I die, my team will very likely lose the fight, and it'd be mostly my fault. \n\nNot justifying toxicity; that's not a valid reason to be toxic.

You pretty much rely on raw mechanics for most of the game which makes it the hardest mechanical role (tied with mid imo) while jungle is the hardest knowledge role (support close behind)","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2016-06-23T22:15:39.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's more like: mid is bursty mechanics and aiming. Most of the time you are freefarming, except when you get all in'ed or you are all in'ing. So you need alot of APM when you do fight, but most of the time you can sit back (on most mids). ADC requires continuously high mechanics and you are clicking around all the time, even just to farm.","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2016-07-07T23:51:17.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly i found this post pretty late but maybe u will read it: \nMid is by far the most stressful lane in the game. \nYou are in danger of getting ganked from basically every corner. Now with the vision changes you rely heavily on your teammates to ping and ward properly (roaming support for example). The whole laning phase is kinda like chess. You try to punish every mistake the enemy makes like overstepping, trying to harass you outpositioned, counter harass etc. \nJungler expects you to help him out or follow up all the time when something around u happens, teammates in general want you to roam especially on champs like LB or Zed.\nAlso if you lose your lane and fall behind your team is pretty much fucked.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2016-07-08T01:04:36.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mid and jungle are the hardest because you have to think the most.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
