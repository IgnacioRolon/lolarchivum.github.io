He's not asking for you to go around giving flowers and hugs, just to keep your derogatory comments to yourself and be respectful.\n\nIf you're going to be looking at this in a logical manner (since no one is perfect), raging at someone solves nothing, so if you want to win the game the whole team needs to be in sync and coordinated. Nothing wrecks that faster then a loss of self-confidence and a sense of dejection from your team.","replies":[{"poster":"Havoc and Chaos","date":"2014-10-01T00:14:59.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Living in a sea of toxicity?

Communication is a two-way street, and it can be tough to remember that you've only got the management of one end of it.\n\nI've personally found that, as early as champ select, it's fairly straightforward to switch the team's tone to a collaborative one rather than an antagonistic one by saying something strategic & team-ish, like \"oh nice, we have Amumu. If we get a few more AOE ults, teamfights could be super easy for us.\" You're giving your team some of your game knowledge in a way that doesn't feel like a lecture, and you're opening up one of the right things to talk about--ways for the team to win.","replies":[{"poster":"Flintfall","date":"2014-10-01T01:00:55.204+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's also nice to avoid negative terms like \"We'll lose the game if you keep splitting\", if you're going to assume the role of a 'team captain' you also have to be somewhat charismatic.

Also guides and analysis of games are generally well received, so there is clearly summoners that want to learn.\n\nIn your example were you typing while still in lane? Because the fact he said \"PLAY YOUR OWN FUCKING HERO\" seems like he was upset that you were typing in lane and not laning, but I could be wrong since I'm just guessing.\n\nJust a few personal tips for giving tips:\n\n1. Type when it is appropriate to do so (while you're dead or recalling in a safe location) or after game if you really want to go out of your way.\n\n2. Don't generalize e.g., telling your tank \"don't engage\" after he does a bad engage is bad advice. You could say something like \"I don't think that engage was good, we were out of position to follow up *or* we are too far behind in gold, let us farm up a bit more.\"\n\n3. Keep your thoughts personal e.g., I disagree with that or I don't think that was or I think we should is much better than saying that was bad or group pls. This game is very dynamic and what you might think is a good call might turn out very bad so when giving advice make sure you take a personal stance for your advice.\n\nThis is just what I have learned about giving tips over the years but at the end of the day it's just my opinion and I'm just trying to help.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DustStorm181","date":"2014-10-01T23:03:42.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"how bout no","replies":[{"poster":"KairosCrow","date":"2014-10-02T04:52:00.493+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We already live with 'no'.
