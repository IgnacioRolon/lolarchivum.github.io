Through and through. That’s how the triangle works: burst beats dps, dps beats tank, tank beats burst. This is assuming players of equal skill of course. \n\nYou saying “skill-less, overloaded adc” is also dishonest. Vast majority of adcs are not no skill. Maybe because the majority of their damage is all in autos, but they have to pay attention to the same postioning that you say Ornn has to pay attention to. \n\n> Q is delayed, and wall knocks are unreliably versus people who know his basic mechanics.\n\nThis is what made his E knockups so impactful and rewarding.\n\nAnyway, your Sion example leaves out a lot. How much farm had Jinx been fetting that she could all of a sudden purchase a Stormrazor, runaan’s, and IE after just a triple? What build were you running? All you said was you had 5500 health as sion with sibstantial tankiness and damage, what other items did you have? Any actual armor? Why not a Randuin’s to make her attack slower? \n\nThere’s no way an adc with no escapes 1v5’d your team. I don’t buy that one bit. But, she’s also a hypercarry, and the fact that she got that fed says something about how you played and how long you dragged out the match. An 0/9/2 Jinx should not be able to stop your sieges, so what happened that you couldn’t close?\n\nBut no, I’m defending that dps, when run by someone of equal skill to yourself should easily be able to handle Ornn unless massively immobile. An adc or other squishy champ that disrespects will take punishment, but in the end, dps wins, and tanks like Ornn should have less kill pressure when their power is in CC.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2018-11-08T00:24:04.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"1) you need to leave your triangle at the door.

You're arguing only adcs should ever win mid - late game.

I have never said tanks should not be viable mid - late. That is drastic misrepresentation. Listen, tanks are my best and main class. 80% of my time in top lane is tanks. Same with Support. Jungle lately has been J4, but in more of a tanky capacity, but Maokai jungle is one my favorite junglers. Don’t you dare insinuate that I don’t want tanks viable. **EVER**.\n\nI believe in balance, and the truth is that damage outscales defense, that’s how league was designed. Otherwise, tanks would rule with their defenses because dps would not be able to kill them. That triangle is the core of everything relating to tanks and damage dealers in almost every game. MMOs, tanks die more to consistent damage if they aren’t healed, and are set up in ways to take spike damage. You dare say I only want adcs to win, but in an ideal triangle system, adcs have to fear burst damage, aka assassins and burst mages. If they succeed, adcs can’t kill a tank. If burst can’t kill The adc, the adc will be anle to dps the tank and drop it between crits and %armor pen, should they be building it (which they should have to to deal with tanks).\n\nAs for your Kai’sa match. I found it, it’s also your only positive kda and win with her on op.gg, in a game that went to 60 Kills for both sides. That is ridiculous and way out of the norm for matches these days. That was a kill fest that lasted an hour. Matches don’t normally last that long these days, so I’m slightly curious as to why that couldn’t close out earlier, but at this point, not worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2018-11-08T02:18:23.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"1) Everything counters Tanks. it's not a triangle.

For Brand and Zyra, maybe even Ziggs and Xerath did you run {{item:3194}} ?\n\nJust because this sounds like you built 0 MR, I did a calculation or two. If you built only {{item:3194}} {{item:3001}} against them as a level 11 Ornn, you’d have 153.1 MR, reducing their magic damage dealth 60.4%. If {{item:3379}}, just going off the passive adjust on PBE, you’d have 188.1 MR, reducing their damage by 65%. Now, add in {{item:3135}}, which grants 35% magic penetration. This takes your MR down to where you’d reduce damage by 49.9% and 55%, respectively with the items and values above. At that point, they need to deal twice your health in magic damage to kill you (cause damage is halved so they have to deal double than what they normally would have to against 0 MR so double your health). For DoT mages like Brand, his damage is cut a bit more because of {{item:3194}}.\n\nSo for a level 11 Ornn, that’s 2055 health with Adaptive and Abyssal, and 2255 with Adaptive and Infernal, Ignoring rune bonuses. So, these mages and assassins have to deal 4000-4500 damage in a short soan based on the items above. Not possible, especially not for the assassins unless insanely fed.\n\nIf you’re even and they aren’t insanely fed, and if actually buying MR, there is no reason most of those should destroy a tank in their rotations. *Especially* not {{champion:28}}, {{champion:105}}, {{champion:142}}, {{champion:55}}, and {{champion:43}}","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2018-11-09T03:22:44.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"P.S.

Also, she, unlike other champs, has a Magic Penetration of 75%, so almost ALL of this damage goes through.

They enable killing moves.\n\n_**Ornn's W is NOT a killing move, slows his movement speed, doesn't displace him or cross distances.

Veigar's wall is extremely hard for Ornn to avoid, and even if you E it to destroy it, you'll still get stunned because of the rule \"anything that touches it.\" So, W with unstoppable made this tradeoff a bit more survivable. You could W through the wall, to keep active, get stunned slightly on the other side of it, depending on your Tenacity level. But you had a shield to soak whatever Veigar hit you with, and you weren't standing still for his W. Even with the shield, it's a 50/50 interaction.
