Most occasions of getting to a turret only gained her 1 shield plate. If it was top lane,  it was possible to get 2, if you had a sizeable minion wave.\n\nIn Contrast:\n\n{{champion:24}} kills a champion in lane, and can kill almost 3 plates, because of his passive attack speed activation.\n{{champion:22}} kills a champion, and still gets to use her rapid fire on turrets.\n{{champion:51}} kills a champion, and her 6th hit still does bonus damage to turrets.\n{{champion:131}} kills a champion, and gets to apply her passive to turrets.\n{{champion:81}} gets an enhanced W, which does a burst chunk to turrets.\n{{champion:3}} kills a champion, and has a MASSIVE passive on hit damage buff which affects turrets, that is exactly like Neeko and Diana&#039;s on hit bonuses.\n{{champion:86}} Q does bonus damage to turrets and has a pretty short cooldown. About the same time it takes Neeko to 3X auto attack.\n{{champion:240}} has a similar function to Jax. 4 hit skill that enhances damage and takes much less time to auto.\n{{champion:54}} has enhanced auto damage to turrets.\n{{champion:75}} Siphoning Strike applies to turrets and can almost 1 shot them.\n{{champion:20}} Boosts ally turret takedowns when he damages a turret.\n{{champion:33}} does aoe damage to turrets in addition to autos.\n{{champion:37}} Power Chord works.\n{{champion:44}} &#039;s Passive does bonus damage to turrets.\n{{champion:4}}  E enhance damage to turrets.\n{{champion:67}} Recently buffed, can Enhance damage to a turret every time she Q&#039;s (up to .1 sec per cast)\n{{champion:83}} Q does extra turret damage.\n{{champion:142}} Her Sparkles still hurt turrets.\n\n(This list doesn&#039;t even mention champs that have other mechanics to destroy turrets like Tristana, or Ziggs. Those kits are intentional. It also doesn&#039;t mention champs like Tryndamere who have mechanics who can make taking a turret quicker, champions like {{champion:36}} who can steroid their own AD).\n\nWhat I&#039;m getting at is...... this is unequal treatment. \n\nFor one: Neeko building ADC or APC dramatically reduces the per hit damage from an AP build. There&#039;s a major tradeoff to using W as a turret killer. And if you went AP, her Autos were too slow to abuse it. Catch 22. Although I used it myself, I never saw my Turret damage in a single game go over 8900 damage. Compare that to champions who still have their kits, like Diana. Diana can end a game with 13-14k Turret damage. Jax/Graves can do 16k. Tryn can get over 20k. This feature of her W was hardly broken!\n\nI&#039;ve tried to use on hit Neeko since then: It literally takes her 20-24 seconds LATE GAME to take down a turret now, even when full built. In terms of turret takedowns, that&#039;s a JOKE. In the same time, Nasus could have taken TWO turrets. That&#039;s how long that is.\n\n----------------------------\nSo I have a proposal Ladies and Gents (and Riot):\n\nIf you want to specifically nerf a 46% win champ in the one way she was remotely reliable:\n\n_**Nerf the others as well.**_\n\nThis would put a dent into a lot of the complaints players field at you:\n\n-Paper turrets (All turrets are still paper after you get past the first tier)\n-Short games (Turret passive skill abuse is a huge reason for shorter games. One lane gets carried away before the others can leave their lanes, and a base opens up. Beginning of the end of the game)\n- Some champions being uninteractive \n\nP.S : I&#039;m not against {{item:3057}}  procs mind you. If you want to keep those fine, But I want equal potential of SKILLS to abuse turrets.\n\nI&#039;m going to add a poll and try my best to stay out of the comments.","replies":[{"poster":"Sewer Side","date":"2019-01-14T06:00:34.105+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"The wordiness of this thread is a bit confusing.

On the other hand, Diana and Galio both have AMAZING hit rates, and either decomission a champ or kill them in 1-2 skills. You don't call that \"Bursty?\"\n\nNeeko hitting an ult is a Miracle, because her kit doesn't currently agency it without a Flash. Even then it gives people time to get out of the way. Unless she's sitting in an unwarded bush, even if disguised, she is almost certain to miss/die/ or sometimes succeed only on Zhonya's..... at which point she's still Zhonya'd while her stun is active so the opponents wake up to action the same time SHE does, meaning they can still kill her without dying. \n\nI know it's easy to say \"Burst Burst Burst\" But actually try hitting her ult without Flash in a High elo. You won't, unless the opposing team is already fighting someone else and is pre-cc'd, and you approached from behind.\n\nP.S. Both Diana and Galio are also AP. Galio's Passive can do 980 to a turret when his auto attack procs it.

Mechanically linear \"Overbuffed\" Champions do not carry 46% win rates. I play Zyra, and openly defend arguments that she is \"overbuffed.\" My Zyra play puts out 2-3 times the damage Neeko does. On ANY build. (I've recently stopped dicking around in Preseason Bronze; If you go look..... I've gained 4 consecutive ranks on Zyra in 2 weeks of only moderate play. Playing Zyra as Adc, Jungle, Support, Top. I win them ALL). Neeko's kit is like Zyra's: Oversimplified, Operates within its margins, but not outside of them, is extremely predictable, Except.... Neeko doesn't have a strong passive range that Zyra does, and takes about 20% more risk when skilling a champion. Her skills don't leave behind contingency plans or range extensions (I'm a pro at D III killing with Zyra at 1300 range. Her skills are only 975). Neeko is NOT a skill intensive champ, but at the same time has trouble anchoring and adjusting to opponents learning her kit. There's not much she can do once the community learns to dodge/minimize her E, detect and isolate her while she ults, and walks out of the very first pop of her Q. Once they learn to do all that.... she's pretty much stuck at that 46% until a significant buff comes along.\n\nIn contrast, I DO support Yasuo and Akali having a 46% Win rate, because they ARE skill curve intensive, and DO have huge deltas when mastered, that put their common players at 65-70% Win rates.","replies":[{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2019-01-15T04:22:00.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it's not Galio's job to take turrets, then why does he say \"I've got the big guy!\" or \"At last, a worthy opponent!\" when attacking them?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Monstermushmush","date":"2019-01-14T19:00:20.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they should just buff Neeko. much easier solution than nerfing a bunch of other champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-01-14T22:29:31.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm okay with either solution.
