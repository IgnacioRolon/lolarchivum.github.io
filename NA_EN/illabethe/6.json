Poor souls actually let me last pick a Nami Pre-Mage Capped.\r\n\r\n(Gotta say though..... the Shiv based Kog was kind of scary before the last 2-3 matches.

I was at like 1-3 health and the other guy was at 100 but I never lost once to him... So I got essentially like 5-7 extra rounds in there...","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2019-11-26T19:30:27.347+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a reason they set the abilities of the 3 star 5 costs to basically be auto win.
