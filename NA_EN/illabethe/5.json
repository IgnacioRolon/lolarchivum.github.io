An adc used as support.\r\n\r\nHowever, we've never EXPLICITLY been there before with the _intent._\r\n\r\nNow..... I have an opinion, and many readers aren't going to like it or want to agree with me..... but....\r\n\r\n#I think that the Senna Experiment is going to fail.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong. I like the concept. I like Senna's design a lot myself.\r\n\r\n#BUT\r\n\r\nRight now, bot lane meta is absolutely destroyed. Duo Mage bot lanes are often more successful than actual adc bot lanes. \r\nIn other words, ...... I'm concerned that the concept is dead in its tracks.... because even if we do duo ADC bot, they will be outranged, and outkitted by longer and longer range duo synergies.\r\n\r\nIt seems like right now...... every 500-600 range adc is hard capped in how much they can control their own lane. Kai Sa, Vayne, Lucian... all generally suffer one thing: Existing in a world where both support and the other adc outrange them. All three, on their own, are generally considered strong kits.... but have you ever noticed that the higher elo Lucian goes, the less he gets to poke, and the more he gets boxed under his own turret? Or, that Kai Sa's lane phase is generally slow, and the pace is controlled by how aggressive and how many gaps the other team gives her? Vayne has been a late game champion for at least 3 seasons now.\r\n\r\nIf Senna has any sensible range as an \"Adc Support,\" she too is going to be subject to these rules of how adcs work.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, (and this is a hypothesis) IF Senna actually has support capability, she's going to be broken out of the box, not necessarily favoring wins, _**but in the fact she will be difficult to balance.**_ In other words, she will be weighing any supporting abilities in her kit (like an ult that blocks and reflects a shield) against the fact she needs to compensate her adc identity with a support's ability to fight at range and help peel an opposing adc. That's a tall order to do correctly.\r\n\r\nLeague will have added a new romance to play and a new champion, but a whole new can of worms in the form of balancing nightmares. She very well could become the next Karma: Can't be allowed to be strong in any one feature, so left to suffer in general.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2019-10-16T09:09:55.733+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly every 'gimmick' for the past couple releases have all been balance nightmares or balance failures.\n\nKalista - Hopping = hard to balance\nYuumi - Attachment gimmick = hard to balance\nKayn - Transformation = hard to balance (at least initially)\nPyke - Hypercarry assassin support??? = hard to balance\nSylas - Ult stealing = hard to balance\nIvern - Support jungler = hard to balance\nYuumi again - Attachment gimmick again = my god Riot\n\nLike I get it, I do like Riot taking risks and trying out new stuff, but in all of these gimmicks, every time there's a broken aspect of it that needs fixing, instead of fixing it, they try to force buffing/nerfing it to be viable (or at least just barely viable)","replies":[{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2019-10-16T11:25:27.583+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"In most cases these issue are sorted by removing mechanics but they seem sometimes reluctant to do that as it would hurt the champs identity.

The dynamic of bot lane doesn't change much on paper but relative to the other lanes, you can't demolish the opponents turret and come out stronger than a mid or top laner and contest their objectives with relative ease once your \"stronger\" lane wins.\n\nThis means that Marksmen definitely outscale bot support mages given that they can't pocket as much gold with poke as they would being mid lane, getting kills and CS.\n\nIf you try to reduce \"bot mage\" damage, you inevitably end up cutting the legs off both Support and Marksman counterparts. Marksman mage counterparts would not have a reason to be played if their damage is lower and outscaled by a Marksman. Support mages would fade away if their damage gets outscaled from poke, only being reduced to being CC bots.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2019-10-16T11:57:22.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lauchmelder,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RZQPJsBq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-10-16T08:25:41.503+0000)\n>\n> I think preseason will fix that.
