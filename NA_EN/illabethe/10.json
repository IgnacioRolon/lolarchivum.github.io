Yesterday I was promos from BII to BI. Even if you are a 50% player, it's likely you can hit a promo every other day, and the teams at promos aren't as bad, because most people who are single classing are not there to compete with you.

As someone who's going to try and climb in multiple roles, this is good information to have.\n\nI do think it's a bit unfair to flex players, as you said, but the main question I have at the moment is this; how WOULD you implement having 100 LP = promos?\n\n* Would wins in other roles count as wins in the promo, or maybe winning a certain amount of games counts as a win in the promo? The flip side could be said about losses, too.\n\n* Seeing as LP splashing is a thing, would you drop from 100 LP if you lose in an off-role? If LP splashing is turned off once a role reaches promos, then that eliminates the incentive against people trolling when they get off roles. While I do agree that LP splashing isn't an entirely effective way against trolls, it's better than nothing. \n\n* Is there maybe a way you can avoid promos in an off-role? Of course, this alternative method would have to be a lot longer and harder work than the promo series itself, but maybe another form of promoting is needed in this case.\n\n* How many players actually play more than one role willingly in ranked? Is it worth making changes such as these to benefit them? I know that I'm one of those people but honestly, I'm not sure what percentage of the sample I fall into.\n\nThose are just some ideas I'm thinking of when it comes in terms with this issue, but I'd like to hear thoughts if you want to share.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-02-13T01:47:32.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Atm multiple roles works like this once you are in promotions:\n\nThe role that is in promotions neither loses nor gains LP when a game is played in another role. \n\nThe roles that are NOT in promotions lose/gain splash LP when you play a promotional game.\n\nIn other words, if you \"Fill\" and manage to get the role you are in promotions in, you can still gain 3-6 LP splash in other roles when you win.","replies":[{"poster":"LuxannaVeritas","date":"2019-02-13T14:25:29.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Illabethe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hiiATKj0,comment-id=000d0000,timestamp=2019-02-13T01:47:32.441+0000)\n>\n> Atm multiple roles works like this once you are in promotions:\n> \n> The role that is in promotions neither loses nor gains LP when a game is played in another role. \n> \n> The roles that are NOT in promotions lose/gain splash LP when you play a promotional game.\n> \n> In other words, if you \"Fill\" and manage to get the role you are in promotions in, you can still gain 3-6 LP splash in other roles when you win.\n\nThanks for going into more detail, but I was actually asking what YOU would do to change the system in this regard.

If its not what I think you mean then I just look stupid, but...\n\nI think I'm over the 7 maybe 8 thousand NORMAL games played, and only like 10 or so, maybe more, I forget, ranked games spread over seasons 2-5 maybe 6... maybe played couple last season... whatever.... \n\nBUT because the player who tries hard and does extremely well, like 230/4/170 (hypothetical) or something KDA, carries the team up until the last deciding baron or fight.... and they lose the fight... and then the game... but there is also a player on the team that was trying so hard to throw and lose the game for everyone and went like 0/500/0.... both of those players get the same punishment for the loss. (Unless I'm mistaken and stupid) I don't mean someone who is actually trying but has a bad game, I mean the guy purposely sabotaging the game.\n\nSince this season obviously so far seems worse than the others in terms of horrible matchmaking, I literally just don't see a reason to stress over ranked.  Normals can be stressful as it is with people who play blindfolded or cover up their minimap or play \"Iron Man\" mode where they seem to be playing with your fists and stuff... but at least afterwards you lose nothing and you can even still get rewarded if you did well with honor and mastery, although those 2 things don't matter as much as LP in ranked to most people.\n\nSo yeah I thought for sure I read something years ago about individualized LP maybe being a thing? Like if you put down 1000 wards, and went 0-0-100 as support with the most healing and CC,  that you'd lose less LP than the player running it down mid 100 times, but I guess not, which is my biggest turn off to ranked.  Not saying you should be rewarded per say, but at least not punished as bad as the troll. \n\nI don't know how that would work with this positional stuff but... yeah.  I see youtubers/steamers/posts/billboards/murals/bathroom walls/etc... with 4 players trying hard even with a troll, still trying hard to win being handicapped by the game ruiner, just for the troll to \"win\" and they all lose a bunch of LP, and even worse for people in promos. \n\nIf I'm wrong about all this, and they did change this and I didnt know, I wouldnt be surprised.
