Because I can get you literally ***HUNDREDS*** if not ***THOUSANDS*** of examples and ***not a single one*** gets stuck in low ELO. ***Not ONE.***\n\nGo ahead. Find me actual examples instead of just insisting these players exist. The ones who afk farm in silver games and wait. The ones who are losing. The ones who get stuck. I'll wait right here\n\nSo what is the difference between these players and people \"stuck in ELO hell\"? Do they get double base stats for having a Diamond+ alt? Do they get more starting gold? Do they get access to better champions? Do they get exclusive OP items? No, it's ***skill.*** Skill is the _**only**_ defining characteristic that allows them to rapidly climb amoungst lower ELO players.\n\nPlayers who are ***more SKILLED*** than the ELO they are playing in ***do not*** get stuck \"in ELO hell\". _The greater the difference in skill, the more impact you have in the game._ This is why when you approach your true MMR, your winrate started to flaten out. This is \"the *forced* 50% winrate*** that people think proves the existence of ELO hell. In reality, it's exactly what happens when you are playing with people of your skill level. You do not have any more skill discrepancy to influence more game in your favor. This is exactly how an ELO system is supposed to work. By the time your influence slows down significantly, you are already close to your true MMR. That is when a bit of grinding kicks in. There are 4 randoms on your team and 5 on the other.\n\nWhy is it that these players can consistently climb to Diamond on these accounts? Year after year? With hundreds of examples?\n\nWhats funny is that you bring up these \"unranked accounts\" that completely fucking warp the fabric of gold/silver when you've never  been in the ELO they actually get dropped in. I've climbed my accounts to Gold for 4 straight years and this is just bullshit. You ***occasionally*** get one of these accounts that is drastically out of place and fucks up a game. But people will play 500+ games hardstuck in their true ELO then point to a single example or two and pull this bullshit \"***THIS is the reason I can't climb\" nonsense while ignoring the other _**500+**_ games. Why is that? Well that brings us to...\n\n\nThe psychology of \"ELO hell\"\n\nThere are a multitude of well documented phenomenon that explain why the myth of ELO hell exists. \n\n# Self-Serving Bias \n\n Self-serving bias is an extremely common and well known phenomenon. It's so common that we many have extremely well known examples dating back multiple millennia. It is a cognitive bias that people concoct to enhance their self esteem and view themselves in a more favorable manner. It helps explain (at least partially) a lot of human behavior like blatant hypocrisy. People tend to credit success to their own abilities or skill but credit failure to external reasons. The classic \"I am good but my team is always shit\" ELO hell myth is such a picture perfect example of this. \n\nSelf servivng bias is also explains why when positive things happen (I.E. winning a match) they attribute it to their skill and attrition. However, when the inverse happens (I.E. losing a match) the same logic ***never*** applies. In fact, the ***exact opposites*** now magically applies. It's attributed to bad luck or deflected to an outside source. It wasnt the player's skill, it was \"bad luck\" or  \"shit team\" or \"Riot rigging my matches\"\n\n**Papers: **(Bradley, J Pers 1978; Miller and Ross, 1975; Snyder, Stephan, &amp; Rosenfileld, 1976; Ross., J Pers Soc Psychol, 1974; Brown &amp; Rogers, 1991; Mezulis et al., 2004\n\nDont want to read? \n\nYoutube: [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HVaJt3xicM), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRd-kFiVuGs), and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQpJC3zvpjE)\n\n# Dunning-Kruger Effect\n\nThe reasoning why incompetent people think they are competent. The Dunning-Kruger effect hypothesizes that people who are inadequate or bad at something lack the ability to see they are bad at it or the knowledge to see how much there is to learn on a subject and consequently grossly overestimate their ability.\n\nThis is the effect that explains why stupid people think they are smart.\n\nInversely, people who are good at something often underestimate their ability because they assume that because they find it easy, everyone else must find it easy. Or because they have the knowledge to see how much they still don't know.\n\nPapers: Justin Kruger &amp; David Dunning, 1999; Justin Kruger &amp; David Dunning, 2000; Bunay, Siguenza, Flores &amp; Andrade, 2018; Burson, Katherine A., Larrick, Richard P., Klayman, Joshua (2006)\n\nVideos: [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y50i1bI2uN4), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJz66wm95-M&amp;t=422s), and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7NdrkKD8Vk)\n\n# Egocentrism\n\nThe tendency of people to only see the world as it affects them. For example, the common myth that \"Riot forces me into a loss streak after a win streak. Throw back to self-serving bias as people always see the win streak as deserved because their ability and the loss streak is forced on them by an external factor. Aside from this, this is very evident in the blatant hypocrisy in how this supposedly works. \"Rito games gives me shit players and all the enemies get good player to force me into a loss streak\". Now think about this for more than 2 seconds and you can instantly see how much bullshit this is. The person is being \"forced\" to lose because they performed well, _**yet the \"good\" enemies with \"higher winrates\" and a \"good team\" are simultaneously being being \"forced\" to win.**_ See how bullshit this is now? It's an actual _**contradiction**_, but because of egocentrism people view themselves as being the center of everything. The recipient of this great injustice while everyone else magically gets the complete opposite treatment? Everyone else besides you gets free wins when they do well but you get punished? Yeah sure thing buddy.\n\nAlso, ever wonder why ELO hell is ***ALWAYS*** in the division the person making the claim happens to be in? Wonder no more! ***Egocentrism!*** Weird how the silver player says ELO hell is Silver. The Gold player says it's in Gold. The Plat player says its Plat. The Diamond player says Diamond. Wow really funny how every single ELO is ELO hell isn't it?\n\n**Papers:**  Mou et al., 2004; Sergio Moreno-ríos, Journal of Pragmatics, 2011; Ageev, B. C. (1990); William Looft &amp; Don C.

You are heavily disgracing and insulting \"everyone\" in a mixed bag elo where about half the population are either boosters, smurfs, ex-bannees, and generally systematically hold good objective, gold, and KDA scores game after game.\n\n2) Your Twitch/Youtube feeds set up their own games. Not only do they play champions who do not NEED mistakes to capitalize on, they usually duo another person of the same elo they are in to ENSURE they do not need to capitalize on. Furthermore, most don't post every game. Most have more losses than they'd like to admit.\n\n3) You have a biased opinion, being a fanboy who rarely even plays ranked. You almost entirely play ARAM and nothing else.\n\n4) You're comparing Challenger to Silver. Think a little lower. Plat cannot carry Silver. Gold cannot carry Silver. And even the challengers play champs who do not need mistakes to capitalize. They just smurf reset champs against people who can't react to .1 second executes.\n\n5) Dunning Kruger: Stop horribly abusing the theory as an internet Meme. The founders of the paper themselves have said publicly they do not endorse the way you use Dunning Kruger, as an excuse in any situation to suggest confidence is misplaced, and that at any given point, people are validating their own inadequacies.\n\nDunning Kruger was intended to be instrospective, and be an incentive for a person to seek education, peer evaluations. it wasn't designed to say you're an idiot or to confirm someone else's Bias. You, Yourself, by dismissing quantifiable testimony and good data, are more guilty of Dunning Kruger than I. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zGDNO1_ehg\n\n6) Elo Hell is generally agreed to be Silver or Below, which happens to be....... 50% of the community. I've never seen someone attempt greater specificity.\n\n7) I didn't arbitrarily decide anything. Anything I said about math vs abstracts is true. You cannot derive an accurate formula to stand in as a dummy that defines random players taking random roles on your team who play in random ways, with random choices for objective priorities, which constantly change based on how they interact with 9 other players, or in some cases 19 other players (remakes, previous game experience, etc) I dare you to try to quantify that math.\n\nI'm a BA. in economics with a background in Game Theory. \n\n8) Your newest article on Egocentrism is from 1971?\n\n9) Shopping algorithms are far simpler than than quantifying randomized encounters. For one thing, these companies extrapolating this data have over 20+ years of consumer data on said female, and a MUCH more robust set of her entire purchasing histories. Furthermore, it's all backed by dollar amounts, income data, addresses attached to them, bank transactions. If she shops at Walmart with a Credit Card for 19 years, has routinely on average had similar purchasing patterns, mailed to a certain location, and suddenly starts spending with a second credit card, the location of the bills change, and her purchasing habits switch to indigestion medicine and comfort cures for nausea, the credit card has a strong history that 1) She has moved due to a nausea discomfort, met abnormal financial difficulties, and it doesn't take much more research to predict a pregnancy.\n\nThere's also the fact she's facebooking, talking about a new relationship, and Facebook is selling that data.\n\n-----------\nIn contrast, you have no case history of a game player in interaction with 9 other players, other than their own primary tendencies. You have no data that tells you how they will interact with 9 aggressive players when they themselves are cautious.  You have no data telling you if they will become aggressive and adapt, or how their attitude in the game they played 20 minutes ago is going to affect THIS game. At best, you have an aggregate understanding of the COMMUNITY, and you assign that average label to that player.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2019-11-05T04:54:29.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"***THEY ARE SOLO QUE GAMES.

I carry my accounts to gold every season for 4 years and I'm not even plat like what? How tf can plat players not carry silver? How the fuck are you even attempting to say what is required to carry our of silver when you've never been out of it? How the hell would you know? Your opinion on what Gold and Plat can or cannot carry is 100% completely invalid because you've never ever been one. How tf are _you_ going to tell _me_ what _I_ am or am not capable of carrying? It takes me &lt;50 games to climb out of silver every season 90% of the time and ***NEVER more than 70 or 80. You have played more ranked games ***in this season alone*** than I ever have yet I can repetitively climb out of silver and you cant? Now why is this? Could it be...... I am I gold level player? Why is the result 100% for one person and 0% for the other? Why can one climb to gold over and over and over again and another cant do it once? Why do the majority of Diamond players climb back to Diamond? Why do the majority of players in general end up back in the same ELO? \n\nWell maybe, _just maybe_ because they are playing around the same general skill level so they end up around the same general ELO? I know, a real shocking concept\n\nWhy dont we ask? Let's find some plat players and ask them if they can carry silver lmao.\n\nThe authors of the the Dunning -Kruger effect do not dispute the conclusion of their data. They do not object citing the theory. They object to people using it as a literal meme as a synonym for stupidity because it is a far more diverse concept. It is being used in only one regard while the full scope of it is ignored. They object to people using it as a tool to insult. ***That*** is what they object to. \n\n> Elo Hell is generally agreed to be Silver or Below, which happens to be....... 50% of the community. I've never seen someone attempt greater specificity.\n\nWow what a shocker. \n\n> ever wonder why ELO hell is ALWAYS in the division the person making the claim happens to be in? Wonder no more! Egocentrism! Weird how the silver player says ELO hell is Silver. The Gold player says it's in Gold. The Plat player says its Plat. The Diamond player says Diamond. \n\nWow the place where the the most players is where the most people say it is! Wonder why that is?\n\n> Shopping algorithms are far simpler than than quantifying randomized encounters.\n\nDude. They have results of ***over 700*** games this season alone from you. What more data do they need? You actually, unironically believe that Rito has been holding you back for 700+ games? Completely serious?\n\n> Anything I said about math vs abstracts is true.\n\nYou make a valid argument by **_presenting information and evidence_**. Let me drop another term on you. What you are attempting to do is called an _argument from authority_. Congrats, you are using the exact same logic as people who cite the bible as proof. Instead of making a real argument, you insist that a BA in ***economics*** makes you an expert in ***machine learning***? No, your BA or Masters in a field should ***allow*** someone to make an actual argument. It's not an argument by itself. Imagine if you had a professor where when you asked them a question they said \"you're wrong because I have a Master degree\". When you ask them why they say \"because I have a master degree\". _**Thats not an actual argument**_. The Master degree will allow them to explain why it is wrong\n\nThe only thing that matters is destroying the nexus. This is the sole objective of the enitre game. If you cannot succeed in doing this because you are such a 1337 player who passively does absolutely fucking nothing all game, never takes calculated risks, can't adapt to anything, never pushes boundaries, never does anything but hope to be carried then you are not good at league of legends and therefore are going to be low ELO and it is 100% entirely your doing. Your playstyle is ***your*** choice that you make. If you consistently decide on a playstyle that cannot win games then it is ***your fault*** when you lose. If you can't adapt to a game, it is ***your fault***. If you are incapable of dealing with people with different playstyles it is ***your fault***. If you do not possess the skills to succeed in League of Legends it is ***your fault*** and not some made up ELO hell holding you back","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The thigh guy","date":"2019-11-05T05:14:07.176+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"They like to remove posts for being “low effort” when in reality they just like to push what they want. \n\nThere is one mod in particular, who I won’t name, who likes to remove any post that says anything negative about ad assassins.
