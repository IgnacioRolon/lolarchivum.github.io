You're usually dead before the knockup's even over. \r\n\r\nIt's not really healthy for a champ to be ...... nonexistent for 130 - 44 seconds and then WHAM! You're dead just because their ult came up. \r\n\r\n(And no; I'm not writing this because I'm a sourpuss. I'm writing this because..... whether Malph wins or loses, he's still getting these kills right now, without exception, and unlike someone like Pyke who generally has to do work for them and has some wriggle room to avoid, his have almost 0 play to work around, unless Morgana is in play)","replies":[{"poster":"Juice","date":"2019-09-18T15:29:33.078+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Build hexdrinker and the game becomes 4v5","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-09-18T19:19:05.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really doesn't.
