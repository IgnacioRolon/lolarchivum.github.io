He can't build to counter it\r\n\r\nFurthermore, these are the MAX numbers, so you need to consider: this is going to affect his HP growth at low levels too.\r\n\r\nAnd ofc, on top of that, the grey health recovery is going down too. By a LOT. Pyke is going to have to recall about 4 times as much because of the grey health nerf. If he's still able to.\r\n\r\n# Why is Riot doing this, instead of just taking away his double \"Your Cut\" or reverting his R buff?? That's what makes him feel strong now. 50% HP Executions. NOT his HP. Hell...... he can't even escape early game anymore because of mobility scaling to lethality he hasn't bought yet.\r\n\r\nOnce again: I haven't played him since they took away his aoes. So this isn't about me. This is about Riot buffing an abomination, and then nerfing him in the dumbest way possible.","replies":[{"poster":"ArtumisPrime","date":"2019-10-23T01:27:57.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pyke has the highest scaling armor in the game, and is number 4 for base armor.
