At the initial rework, Q was simpler, and healing Soraka for each enemy champion hit without any specific interaction with W. The only connection between the two was that W drained her health and Q replenished it. Given the strength of that Q heal on a bunched-up enemy team, it was understandably nerfed to no longer scale with the number of champions hit. The direct heal was also changed to a HoT, and she was further forced into using both Q and W by making W weak if it didn't shortly follow a Q. After the nerf, she'll still work this way, but with more of the benefit from that QW combo moved into the W portion. In a solo lane, Soraka has one utterly useless ability, and her other abilities were strong enough to allow her to succeed like that. Not even Blitz, with most of his power in his Q, leaves an ability with no points in it because it literally can't be used. With power moved to her W but still in a way that requires Q hits to make use of that power, Soraka will still need to trade, and it'll work better when near allies to heal.\n\nOkay, lowest base regen, great, because she's supposed to be hitting with Q and healing up a bunch. This still holds true. In fact, Q's heal not only compensates for that base regen, but also for the fact that she's supposed to be expending her health to heal allies. In a solo lane, she doesn't do that, so her Q has overtuned healing (not that she's super OP in that state; keep in mind the lack of a useful W in that situation, explained above).\n\nWhat do you think it means to support? To me, it means starting out in a duo lane with an ally who's vulnerable on their own but scales well and is thus worth protecting, followed by spreading that protection around to the rest of the team when possible (ganks, teamfights, etc.). Soraka's intended play pattern is to help allies by hitting an enemy with Q and then healing an ally. Rejuvenation mitigates the cost of that heal. With the incoming changes, it'll also _remove_ the cost, so Soraka players who actually heal teammates while still interacting with the enemy end up coming out ahead. Her passive allows her to hurry to those teammates so that she can Q an enemy and then heal the teammate.\n\nShe has two sources of self mobility: her passive and her Q. They're conditional, but those conditions are related to interactive play involving both her allies and her enemies. If an enemy is trying to kill her, they'll have to get through her team first. If her team is already dead, I don't see a problem with an enchanter support being unable to duel to any real degree. Her power comes from making sure her allies stay alive.\n\nI've been playing Soraka for years, throughout her various tweaks and the VGU.\n\nThis is an attempt not to make her an AFK support, but a support. Instead of getting a bunch of healing from Q and then having the option to spend health with W, she's getting less healing from Q but then eliminating the health cost from W. That means she'll have less sustain in a solo lane, but more health when she makes use of both Q and W.\n\nThere are two points with this change that I'm not sure you're getting:\n\n0. Soraka will still need to hit with Q.\n0. Support Soraka will have more available health due to the removed health cost on W during Rejuvenation.\n\nThe only part of these changes that isn't a straight-up _buff_ to _support_ Soraka is the reduced MS buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2020-02-07T05:11:56.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You really have no clue about Soraka Support.

Period.\n\nDid you read my explanation of how her numbers are changing? If Soraka uses W even once during Rejuvenation, she ends up with more health after this change, because 10% of her max health is more significant than the reduction in her Q heal. If she manages three W casts during Rejuvenation (late game), she ends up with more mana after this change.\n\nPutting health back is only part of survival. Not having to spend it is the other part.\n\nIf you're calculating Soraka's EH or effective anything with her Q alone and treating her W as if it doesn't exist, you're doing it wrong. She is a healer _of her allies_, not just herself.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2020-02-07T13:34:12.535+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> SHE GETS HER Heal CUT IN HALF?\nheal increased from 80/110/140/170/200 to 80/115/150/185/220\n\nExcuse me?\nOh, you mean SELF-heal cut in half?

It's gonna be a much more reactive playstyle where you wait for your opponent (or your adc) to do something and use it to land Q, it's usually easier to hit Q if your opponents are going for an obvious engage/trade or are already committed and then you get rewarded by being able heal without health cost.\nDepending on how often you can press W during one Rejuv. this is a huge buff to Sorakas sustain in a duo, because for every W cast she would lose 10% of her max health.... the health she doesn't have to spend anymore will be much more than the Q self heal nerf. This also means tankier builds especially with items that give bonus health will be much much more viable on Soraka.\n\nTbh this is much smarter than giving Soraka the incentive to poke constantly. We have to keep in mind that Riot wants to keep her interactive, but making her too interactive turns her into a lane bully as we can see. On the other hand all enchanters are lane bullies by proxy, because they support their adc who then gets to bully you, but tbh that's just how backline supports work, you can't expect them to \"fix\" that.\n\nGrievous Wound are still in the game so it's debatable if this will have any impact at all or if the damage nerf to Q is more impactful and make Soraka very weak.... it's really hard to tell because LoL players have this tendency of underestimating the levels of brokenness that Grievous Wounds items have been given by Riot and often they don't buy it because they don't care or whatever... idk.\n\nThe way Soraka is balanced is something like if you rush {{item:3123}} she is trash and if you don't she just stomps you, really bad balancing tbh and it's really sad that this is still in the game and that Riot just can't be arsed to find a more fine tuned way to balance healers, BECAUSE they are so FKIN LAZY.\nAlso whenever Soraka is perceived as strong people will pay more attention to their items and healing counters and if she is perceived as weak they might be less likely to do that.\n\nThis being said, the decision of your opponent to buy such an item is still 10 times more impactful than this change. At least Soraka can now W targets that are debuffed without losing health if she hits Q first. Using W on debuffed targets always felt really bad. 10% of your health for nothing. LOL\n\nOverall I think it's gonna remove Soraka top and be a powershift for Soraka bot but might also turn out to be a huge buff to Soraka bot especially in low elo and for inexperienced Soraka players that never tried to play aggressive to begin with.\n\nAlso one last thing: no matter how her winrate will develop if this goes life, it's gonna be meaningless unless we also get \"grievous wounds rates\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2020-02-07T13:17:05.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [New] Now notes \"if cast while affected with Rejuvenation, Soraka will incur no Max Health cost\"\n\nThat line is OP af.
