I left a ticket about this to technical support yesterday but no such luck for a reply yet and I have boost running and such so I'm unable to play. I have went through things looked through my firewall and one thing i never noticed was \"Riot\" \"league of legends\" anything with those types of words that were not checkmarked. This just started happening (that i noticed) yesterday however the day before everything was fine. I have looked at past issues but yet to figureout a fix for this. Any ideas?\n\nEdit: Checked firewall just to make sure and I do see \"Lol Launcher\" and it is marked as being able to by pass the firewall.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-29T02:04:35.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our techs might be running a little behind lately if they haven't responded yet, but that was a good first step double checking your firewalls!
