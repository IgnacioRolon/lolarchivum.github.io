Short answer - I'm OCD\nAnd no, my username is definitely not being used by someone else - it's unique and no one could've tought of it :)\nAny help why can't i create an account?\nAlso did u vote for Zed? xD","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-31T21:47:23.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are commonly two reasons why an account couldn't be registered on a server:  If the username or email is already taken.
