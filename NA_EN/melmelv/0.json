I have had several games where I quote other players in order to make them see their wrong in how they communicate. For example, telling racist people to stop being racist and yet I am the one to always get banned as a result. How is this fair in any way? I stand up for people in the community and I am the one to get banned instead of the other players. Also, why are they not considering the whole conversation when it comes to banning. I report the player for starting a toxic discussion that in turn makes my team engage in the toxic conversation and I end up getting banned. Can we please get an actual banning system that makes sense. That actually keeps toxic players, racists, misogynists from the game not people calling them out on their ways. Fix your game please and your banning system because it is unfair for players to get banned for simply trying to shut down toxic people. Currently uninstalling and never playing this game again until I see an improvement in that aspect.{{summoner:14}} {{item:3751}}","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2018-12-27T22:46:17.321+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"> where I quote other players in order to make them see their wrong in how they communicate\n\nYeah, don't do this.","replies":[{"poster":"Night M0nkey","date":"2018-12-28T02:10:04.021+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":"because the bots were written by an intern and can't discern the difference?","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-12-28T02:57:42.558+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If someone is flinging shit at you on the street, and you then go and fling shit back at them, or even worse, repeat their shit flinging at other people, that's not okay.","replies":[{"poster":"Night M0nkey","date":"2018-12-28T02:59:07.852+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"But if someone is bullying you and harrassing you, throwing punches, swinging back isn't ok either.\n\nI'll just ask someone politely to stop punching me next time.

But what happens when that toxic player goes around stealing my kills, stealing farm, taunting me constantly, and complains in all chat about how bad of a player I am? Muting them doesn't solve that problem. Leaving a game mid-match only opens me up to more bans. There's literally nothing you can do without incurring punishment myself is the problem. Riot, and your, advice is to sit there and take it for the next 40 mins. Even then, as the toxic player levies the enemy team to report me for feeding since I'm having a bad game, I'm unable to defend myself.\n\nI get that you shouldn't fight fire with fire. I do. I get what you are saying, but your system does nothing to discourage the toxic players that know how to play the system. A bot that auto-bans people is not going to solve your community issues, It's only making them worse.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-12-28T03:27:38.788+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"1. That player is **looking** for a reaction from you. They're either trying to troll you because they like seeing you suffer, or they're trying to troll you to get you to react so they can report you. You know what the biggest \"fuck you\" is to these trolls? To ignore them, coordinate with your team, and win the game regardless of the troll (it's completely doable - a troll is easier to win with than an AFK as they're almost always still levelling meaning your minions will continue to be just as strong as the enemy's).\n\n2. You're free to play the game out and report the troll, and you will not be punished. If their actions show that they were doing it **intentionally** beyond **any** reasonable doubt, they will be punished for their actions.\n\nYou are asking \"why can't I defend myself against a business being closed by going in and making myself a sandwich. It inconveniences me that it's closed and I don't like it so I don't think it should be trespassing and theft for me to take matters into my own hands instead of writing the company and asking they extend their hours\". It doesn't make sense. You don't always get a solution to things in life. Sometimes life sucks and you can't do anything about it yourself. That's society. You won't do everything.\n\nHave you considered that someone \"playing the system\" is literally indistinguishable from someone having a bad game, or playing off meta? Because that's what \"playing the system\" means. Humans review games. If they can't determine the player was trolling beyond a reasonable doubt, **nor can you**. It sounds like you rush to assume the worst - if someone's doing something you don't like, or that's non-standard, you instantly assume they're doing it to troll you and make your game unfun. News flash, they aren't all. Granted, some of them may be, but you can't distinguish the ones trolling from the ones having a bad game if they're \"playing the system\". And that will **never be something that can be fixed**, at least not until a crystal ball or mind reading machine exists.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FantomBandit","date":"2018-12-29T23:01:20.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If a toxic player does this, the best thing you can do is not validate their actions with a response.
