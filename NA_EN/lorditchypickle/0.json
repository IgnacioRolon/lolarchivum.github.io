My computer will occasionally randomly turn off during league of legends loading and during the que. Last night I was in a series I was in que, and poof the comp crashed. I had a 30 minute wait and lost my series. Today I went to go on and got a group, got mid and poof the computer died. I tried to reconnect and I got back into the game, the minions had not yet reached the tower, but the team had already forfeited. \n\nNow the reason why I bring this up, is my account is from 2010, I nearly have all the champions. If I get auto banned you can count on me going postal. I'd like to resolve this issue before it gets worse. What can we do about these crashes? Currently I am suffering a 5 game 20 minute delay as a result of these crashes.\n\nNow I know for a fact it's league of legends and the new patch as the computer doesn't have this issue with any other game. If this helps the os is windows 10.  Is this being patched, do you need more info?","replies":[{"poster":"LordItchyPickle","date":"2017-02-11T17:08:18.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has happened 3 more times since I posted it. It only occurs duing the initial load screen (where you see the people's borders) and it also happens during the que afk check. Like I just entered my b2 series after winning 5 games in a row. Then poof, it crashed during the que, now I am penalized 5 mins for \"dodging\" it also counted as a loss. Now it's bronze 2, so I am probably going to win both games anyway. \n\nOn the flip side, yesterday, I was dced during the load screen. I was able to turn back on my power, boot up league and get back into the game by 1 min 30 secs, but my team decided to forfeit becasue we had an ahari \"ADC\". Now I would have carried anyway, becasue it was bronze 3, but the issue was, not only did I lose lp, but I also was given 5 20 minute wait periods between matches. That's 1 hour and 20 minutes of pushups waiting for league. While It was great for my biceps, that's 2 more wins I could have had. This problem has been going on since the last patch, and is constantly causing me issues. 2-3 times a weekend day. I am 100% sure it is league I have the problem with no other game or program. My computer isn't the kind to casually run out of stuff. You've got a major error going on. I submitted logs yesterday.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-07T22:53:33.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These shut offs are usually safety precautions resulting from hardware failure or overheating.
