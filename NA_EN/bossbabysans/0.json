This is extremely frustrating and if anyone could give me insight as to what happened then it would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Credo","date":"2016-10-27T03:41:03.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It turns out we were accidentally allowing all players into the alpha even though they werent accepted into the alpha. Unfortunately, we arent ready at this time to do that so when we fixed it a lot of players were no longer able to log in. The public beta is coming soon though!","replies":[{"poster":"BossBabySans","date":"2016-10-28T08:49:25.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But I've had alpha access since one of it was first announced, and it's frustrating to no longer be able to access something that I've been able to freely use and test for so long, and I've still got my pbe LCU access, which makes this even more confusing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pharoh","date":"2016-10-27T16:10:58.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See now I had the same thing happen to me, but it was a little different. Maybe you can elaborate for me? \nI had Alpha access, for which I applied almost as soon as we were able to and I got the email saying that I was granted access, this being through my PBE account as far as I can remember. Then because of some life stuff I was forced to take a couple month long break from League altogether, coming back just a few weeks ago I was interested in all the new Alpha changes, so excitedly I downloaded the Clients again. When attempting to sign in I used my PBE account information, because I swear that's how I did it before, but I got a message saying that the credentials were invalid, so ok I'll just try my live info I must just be remembering wrong I thought. Sure enough, the info went through but I got a new message saying I did not have access to the Alpha test. So I was quite confused, thinking maybe because of my absence my access was revoked, I got in contact with support and all they told me was that my live account never had access to the Alpha, so I asked them to check if my PBE account ever had access, unfortunately, I never really got an answer on that one. I know I got the email saying I had been accepted it wasn't that I was just suddenly able to sign into the Alpha, so is this the same issue? Was I not supposed to receive Alpha access and thus it was revoked? Did I construct the whole thing in my imagination? \n\nI'm going a little crazy here, would love to hear from you on the subject\n\nI'm going to try and track down the email but I'm not sure I'll be able to.\n\nThanks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DurgerKungs","date":"2016-10-26T23:02:54.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its alright buddy, use your other client{{champion:143}}","replies":[]}]}
