If your FPS stays the same, that's a good indicator. \n\nPacket loss is a type of connection issue where you remain \"connected\" to the internet, but your connection is unstable because you are losing packets of data. This is most commonly presented as the \"everything stops then suddenly catches up\" feeling you get.\n\nTry unplugging and rebooting your modem and router. Unplug them for about a minute before you plug them back in. Also take a look at the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) page here.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-23T23:24:00.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Elduris with the assist! {{summoner:31}} \n\nThis hits the nail on the head pretty much, but we can take this a step further to confirm whether or not you're having packet loss.
