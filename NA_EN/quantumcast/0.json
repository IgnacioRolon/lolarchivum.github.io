Upon attempting to open the League of Legends client, i receive an error message stating \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\libcurl.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support.

It allows me to play, until i log off where upon attempting to open the client i again receive this message. I'm unsure what's causing it and have had to uninstall and reinstall the game multiple times. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"KinRights","date":"2017-09-21T01:44:52.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same exact problem... did you ever find a solution?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-20T22:57:21.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the time these bad images mean that some of the game files ended up missing or badly corrupted.
