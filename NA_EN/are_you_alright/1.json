(Riot please help!!!)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"At the game in its current state for NA players it is impossible for me to gain elo in a humanly way, possibly even at bronze even though I have 2 Plat accounts, and 2 gold accounts. The problem seems more prevalent in ranked as opposed to my many smurfs I level up, which is odd because I would think that better servers would be used for ranked.  I understand my ping will not go back to 80 how it was years ago, weather it be from netcode or your ISP issues you have been having, or the newer issues you have been having with servers and routes.\r\n\r\nAnyways There were so many things people did but I remember people were posting their tracerts and such but I thought I would just quit because of so many issues league was having at the time but I decided no other games really hold my interest and I would like to stay.  My question to you is what information do I have to send in order to fix my routes? \r\n\r\nI know my ISP Charter Communications and being on the east coast are two of the major issues for me but would be willing to give it a go, I get attempting to reconnect so many times it is just not viable to play ranked for me anymore and I have no interest in normals so I'm pleading for a knowledgeable Rioter to help me here, I feel like the issue would be far better addressed here than in support tickets who seemed oblivious to all previous (and sadly very recent) events on these forums and just linked me general help pages and gave bland, automated feeling responses. I also would prefer not to bring this issue up at reddit but will seek help there from the reddit community and Riot lurkers.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: Riot: 85 ping->90-110+ ping->Random loss of control of char+High Ping->Loss of control of char+High Ping +Attempting to reconnect, help.","replies":[]}
