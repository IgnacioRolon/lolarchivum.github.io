When I get in game and try to use abilities, trinkets, camera control, etc., they simply do not register most of the time. The only it works sometimes is me slamming the keys multiple times or just sliding my hands across the keys and like one response will happen. The only working keys are the tab and esc keys. Its really frustrating too because the only way I've seen to fix the issues is a client restart which is very annoying to do minutes in game when i realize that it's a problem. It's even happened multiple times even after a client restart when I think its fixed. Another problem that my friends and I have been having is a simple black screen the moment we get into champ select. We end up missing our picks and have a leaver buster unless someone else dc's. Just wondering if anyone else has had these problems and whether or not they can be addressed in any way. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-13T21:39:38.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're experiencing heavy packet buffering or packet loss.
