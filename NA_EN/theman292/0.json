Irelia is a hero and leader of the war, being praised for taking initiative. Zed and his followers have found success in their dark ways (whether to the benefit of Ionia or not). Karma herself has taken to a more aggressive stance (only if necessary albeit). Akali herself left the Kinkou order to become an assassin against future threats. Finally, Jhin has been unleashed to spread terror to Noxus.\n\nso what does this mean for the ideal of balance? throughout the new Ionia lore, Shen and Kennen remain the only 2 champs that fight for this ideal. even worse is that, while of course it should be biased in their own view, all these other champs seem to be clearly in the right tweaking, if not completely eschewing the ideal of balance in favor of being aggressive. will we see more ionian champs who still favor the old way, and more importantly, see these reasons justified?\n\nalso side question. Xayah wants all the magic of ionia to be free, and in her and Rakan's trailer targets a node guarded by a Zed shadow clone that's suppressing said magic. is it clear that letting all this magic free would also be bad?\n\nEDIT: I know I have no comments, but thanks for the upvotes guys. nice to know people have similar sentiments and are kind to my hastily typed post","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2019-06-26T03:29:00.498+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"balance of good an evil\" .    \n\nActually this is not exactly the balance they/we are talking about now.

But generally these characters are talking about: the Balance of elements; the Balance of emotions;  And esp the Balance between the magical and physical.    \n\n Ionia is a land blessed, and cursed by an abundance of spirit magic. Often we describe this as the borders between the material realm and spirit realm are weak here-- esp in the forests and highlands.   And magic is a dangerous thing.

Her very existence endangers the spiritual balance of Ionia, her magic is definitely not 'balanced', her emotions aren't either, except that in her case, it's not just a kid's problem, it's incredibly disruptive. There's probably a link to all this 'magic must be balanced' thing, I wonder what it is tho. Is she the price to pay for all these years of calm and relative peace (shout out to Taco who inspired that theory btw)?\n\nI do wonder what Shen would think of her in relation to that, actually. I'll probably never know, but it would love to. I know his nemesis is supposed to be Zed but well, I can't help but think he'd be very interested (or worried) by Syndra.

I think that's true, but not necessarily. While I definitely see Syndra as a threat to Ionian balance, I don't think she _has_ to be. I think she's more than just a threat to it, and that's why the Spirit of Ionia imprisoned her in The Dreaming Pool, to try and teach her to be less... Well \"threatening\" to the balance, in her behaviour. That's just my take on it tho!\n\nSyndra epithomize, in a way, that ideal of magic that Xayah and Rakan seek, that's so say wild, untamed, but dangerous magic, so I do believe she's somewhat here to \"upset the balance\", more than just for the sake of the story. Again, that's just a headcanon of mine, but there's a reason why Syndra has these incredible, disruptive powers - but it'll be up to her to decide what to do with them, imo!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zounet","date":"2019-06-26T07:06:40.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"please riot, I have a question.\nshen can go to the spiritual realm.\n\"Towards the end of the Rune Wars, desperate for victory, cabals of warrior-mages sought any advantage they could find over their foes.
