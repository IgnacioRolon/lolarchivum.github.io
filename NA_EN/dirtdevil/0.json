I have several ward skins (as I have an issue with spending money on League, thanks Rito :P) and I can only occasionally select a different one. The option is usually grey'd out, just like dirtdevil's. It isn't an every game thing, but during an all day session, it will stop me from choosing my ward skin by the end. I've even tried relogging to fix it, and that sometimes won't even fix it. Hope it can be fixed soon!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaveTheFuryhorns","date":"2016-04-19T21:14:41.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would just like to point out that this happens with me as well, and it's not with any particular ward skin.
