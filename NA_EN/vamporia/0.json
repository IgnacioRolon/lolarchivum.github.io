I am on a wired connection with fibreoptic broadband, with the modem right next to the PC and ping tests reading at around 19 when tested online. I have no idea what could be causing this issue, I have done all the basics, like re-set the modem, make league client high priority on task manager, and turn the graphics to low in-game, with no difference and the lag spikes continuing to happen. I game a lot, and have not experienced lag in any other game, other than league... \r\n\r\nCould anyone help with this issue...\r\n\r\nMany Thanks\r\n\r\nNika (Vamporia) EUW","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-06T16:15:55.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your might be experiencing some packet loss, which could be for a few reasons like your ISP's routing to the game server.
