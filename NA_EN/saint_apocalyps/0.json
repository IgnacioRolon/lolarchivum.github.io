New drivers, W7 > W10 upgrade, fresh league install, different router settings. All to no avail.\r\n\r\nI really don't know what to do anymore :( Any tips?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-24T21:14:43.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was an issue affecting certain countries in EUW yesterday, but given that your issue has been going on for weeks, it seems unrelated to this.

I'm pretty sure it's the game not us. Mostly because I used to disconnect all the time because I had a wireless card but I have wired internet now and I had no problem running other things like browsers and other games that run on internet. The only problem is League for me, just random annoying DCs that cause me and my team to flat out lose ranked games that we should have won.","replies":[]}]}
