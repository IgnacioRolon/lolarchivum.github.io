Since i play jungle this is a bit of a disadvantage, but since I can&#039;t record a video, it would be helpful if others could test/confirm this problem.\r\n\r\nBUG example:\r\n\r\nQ on Blue, goes through monsters and applies damage, on the return path (i don&#039;t move anywhere, so we are all on the same position) the Q returns, goes through the monsters and does no damage and no hit-on effects.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-29T16:05:19.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Mn3mic! \n\nThanks for the report!
