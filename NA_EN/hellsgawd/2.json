If you are still experiencing this, you can use our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to rule out possibilities that could be causing a slower speed.  It could also be the rate at which your drive is able to write these updates and files.\n\nAlso, I don't recommend doing this until after the patcher is finished.  Closing it out before it's done could cause your patcher to scan files for corruption, which may take a bit.  As long as you're not receiving errors, let it do its thing!  Hopefully, that will help strengthen things up!","replies":[]}]}
