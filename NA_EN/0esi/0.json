After watching SKT dismantle AHQ in 3 games like they did I don't see OG getting past them.  It would be awesome to see as I really like the EU teams ( I'm a C9 fan for life ) since my NA teams dropped the ball in groups.  \n\nIt's not impossible but the stars have to align for OG to get past SKT.  I predict an SKT vs FNC finals.","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2015-10-16T20:55:34.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SKT could play worse next week you never know.","replies":[{"poster":"Banuvan","date":"2015-10-17T10:17:05.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Stillname,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=3jrk7EGH,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-10-16T20:55:34.397+0000)\n>\n> SKT could play worse next week you never know.\n\n\nThey sure could!
