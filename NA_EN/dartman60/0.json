Today i log on to find that i no longer own these items, yet i had played with them multiple times already. Hopefully there is a solution to this as it is very disappointing to me and my friend because they paid for it. I will include pictures in hopes they help.

If a player purchases RP and gifts content with it, and subsequently issues a chargeback for the money spent on that RP, we will remove that content. \n\nBasically, if the purchase was refunded, you'd lose the content on your account because it wasn't paid for. BUT, if this isn't the case, please [shoot us a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and we'd be happy to see what's going on with your account. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"jmp231","date":"2017-01-17T22:36:46.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you still pick them in champ select?
