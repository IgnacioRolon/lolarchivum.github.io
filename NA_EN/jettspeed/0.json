It's not an issue with my connection or my computer as I have tested them both thoroughly. And now that I know it's not my fault I log in today to see that I have been placed in a lower que with LeaveBuster because of YOUR client crashes. This is not right and I've already been told I can't get my league points back so what are you guys doing to fix this???????","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T20:32:07.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Leaverbuster ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)or LP is not something we adjust, and these lower priority queues only occur after multiple leaves.

Do you receive an error messages and what do you see?  Let me know!","replies":[]}]}
