I know that it's possible since Kshawaay specifically asks for the .rofl files rather than the mp4s. I just don't know how to do it.\r\n\r\nWhat I've tried so far is recording it with plays.tv and sending it that way, but it's hard to do since I want to send entire games. I've also tried making a random replay and copying the filepath and name to the desired replay, but that doesn't work either.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows how, it'd be appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"Modi","date":"2017-11-07T05:06:23.233+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In windows 10 (and I assume 7 & 8 as well) the .rofl files are found under:\nC:\\Users\\[your-user-directory]\\Documents\\League of Legends\\Replays","replies":[{"poster":"2Toastie4u","date":"2017-11-07T12:08:41.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Modi,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=4XEN9vdt,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-07T05:06:23.233+0000)\n>\n> In windows 10 (and I assume 7 &amp; 8 as well) the .rofl files are found under:\n> C:\\Users\\[your-user-directory]\\Documents\\League of Legends\\Replays\n\nI know where to find them, my question was how to view it.
