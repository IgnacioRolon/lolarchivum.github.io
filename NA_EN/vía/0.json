I did, though, get them mastery 5 in the same game i got the mastery 6 token. So If I get them mastery 5 in a game, then I get an S, and I get a notification I got a mastery 6 token for that champ, do I not get it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-10T21:40:37.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In order to get a mastery 6 token, you need to have been mastery level 5 when the game starts.
