To me it looks the exact same as the enemy health bar at a glance, if i look hard enough i can start to tell the difference but i really struggle in the moment and always think he is on the enemy team.  In team fights the effect of this is that I have moments of weakness because i sometimes start to run or w/e happens happens, my point is it throws off the way i want to play the game optimally.  I would like to see the skarls health changed to a more brighter more vibrant color, it is just a suggestion i think would help the game. thanks for understandind my problem and why i think it would make the game better, does anybody else have this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Gucci Bear 9001","date":"2016-08-14T02:19:51.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-12T18:08:25.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your feedback on this!  I'm not part of development to change designs, but I'd like to help!  League of Legends actually has a colorblind mode that can change different aspects, including life bars, to be more clear.  While in game, tap Esc and select Video options.  Just below resolution, you will see a checkbox to enable Colorblind Mode.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Gucci Bear 9001","date":"2016-08-13T09:17:59.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually checked with my friend and turning the color blind mode on didnt even do anything to the color of skarls health bar, idk maybe its just me but it didnt look like it changed anything. maybe this is the wrong forum?","replies":[]}]}]}
