Every solution I've found online has been ineffective.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFixes I've tried:\r\n\r\nI've \r\n\r\n* Tried running LoL as an Administrator;\r\n* restarted my computer;\r\n* changed my screen resolution (somehow fixed the issue for others);\r\n* reinstalled league maybe 5-10 times;\r\n* run the Hextech Repair Tool;\r\n* reinstalled Adobe AIR;\r\n* *tried a variety of file deletions/modifications throughout the LoL folders (as recommended online, which have fixed the issue for many others but not for myself)*, \r\n* Restored my system to an earlier point, pre-patch, before the client stopped working, \r\n* Cleaned my registry, \r\n* Disabled my Windows Firewalls and UAC, and \r\n* Even tried to change the launcher compatibility to different versions of Windows.\r\n\r\nNOTHING helps.  It's extremely frustrating, and this wasn't a problem until the new patch was shipped yesterday.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nLastly: I've run the Fiddler Web debugging tool, and then attempted running LoL while it was open. Nothing appears at all during the brief second or so that the LoL icon is visible.  I've heard this suggests that my computer/client is not making contact with the NA servers at all.  But I'm at a loss as to what the solution could be.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-06T20:28:31.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you've tried a lot of troubleshooting so far, and we'd like to help.  Generally, the issue you're facing is usually caused by a setting with your OS or something else that is blocking the launcher from opening.  You were on the right track with the running as admin and other steps, and there's a few more things I don't see here that can be tested.  Go over each step of our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure every base is covered.

My entire comment to you disappeared when I switched pages.\n\nTl;dr I appreciate your PR smoothness, I felt like you genuinely cared about my issue and I felt that I was on the 'right track' but just needed to take a few steps more, which I didn't mind doing at all.  Helped me not to feel hopelessly screwed by this issue.  Thanks for that.\n\nI've updated Windows, I've disabled UAC, I've run the Installer as an administrator when re-installing _and_ run the client as an Administrator, and scanned my hard drive for errors (of which, there were none).\n\nRuning League of Legends as an Administrator once again, after the above changes, still produces the same result:\n\nThe League of Legends icon appears for a split second with an empty loading bar and vanishes almost instantly.  It never even exists as far as my Active Processes are concerned.\n\nEDIT: There are 16 'optional' updates for Windows that are not downloaded, and don't seem to progress beyond 0% when I attempt installing them.  Currently working on a fix.\nEDIT2: That's resolved...I think?  The fix I attempted left me with Windows saying there are no updates currently available.  I don't know if I actually got those optional updates or not.\n\nEither way, the League is behaving exactly the same way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-06T21:25:54.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update!  I'm not really trying to be smooth, but I do care so I'm glad we could connect.  :D  Also, I've totally lost posts by accidentally hitting back so I feel the pain and appreciate that you took the time to re-write a response!    Since the steps weren't able to resolve this, we'd like to help out with your issue individually through a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  Our tech team can dig into this with you and find out what's going wrong.\n\nI also suggest grabbing a set of logs from the hextech repair tool  to attach to your ticket.  This will give us some more context on the situation!  We'll respond to your ticket as soon as possible.
