Can we also make a phone number verification. This might sound a bit useless but let me set an example up.\r\n\r\nMain Account: here we have a highly ranked account tired of having to play ranked and decides he wants to have fun by ruining other peoples accounts. But doesent want to lose his primary account so he creates a smurf.\r\n\r\nSmurf account: After he has succesfully created his smurf account and gotten some levels he decides to play either ranked or draft. He then proceeds to troll in Champ select and feeds in game. and ruining the experience not only for his teammates but also the enemy team that really doesent feel the 5v5 clash that league should bring. And the smurf account then gets banned for 14 days. But he doesent care and starts playing on his main again. \r\n\r\nBut here is the thing. if we had Phone verification we might be able to lessen the amount of high elo smurfs trolling, without them having any real consequences. The smurf is then then needs to type in his phone number into both his smurf and main. If he then trolls his on his smurf his main will also get hit.\r\n\r\nNote: This idea might have &quot;some&quot; flaws but it still better than new players immediately getting hit by the smurf plague.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-08-26T15:00:15.869+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. Why should i have to buy phone service just to play this game because you don't like smurfs?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thimes","date":"2018-08-26T14:20:30.134+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"... or he carries you through your promos, then you honor him and say thank you dear smurf that you waste your time with bad players like us and help us to win this game.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"King Braum","date":"2018-08-26T15:07:01.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly just inconvenient.
