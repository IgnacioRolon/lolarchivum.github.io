Riot nerfed S3 spear chucking AP nid by capping her spear damage to about 1k or so and gave her an 700 range gap closer, but with ludens, all I do is throw a spear, cougar form hop around, until one lands which gets a nifty 205 bonus magic damage. Against tanks, it's not much, but with apc/adc, 200hp is a lot especially I can have the stacks back up by the time my spear's off CD. Not to mention I easily have 462ms as nidalee thanks to Luden ms boost + Lich bane ms boost. Man this item is amazing.\r\n\r\n/rant","replies":[]}
