I hope you have fun consistently getting a 0-6 bot lane by 6 minutes and a 1-18 botlane by 18 minutes. Just to make sure your win rate normalize I&#039;ll even throw in a 0-9 yasuo main for you. Make sure you buy more RP when you&#039;re finished the game to support my algorithm ;)\r\n\r\n-Sincerely matchmaking","replies":[{"poster":"Naymliss","date":"2018-09-24T15:44:04.576+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah yes I hate the riot matchmaking conspiracy. They recently also turned my pet frog gay. \n\nWhen riot says they try to get you to have a 50% winrate, they mean that if you go on a win streak your MMR will rise extremely quickly, and you will get to your deserved rank quickly, where you will have around a 50% winrate in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-09-24T15:44:40.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I screwed up my own MMR a month ago. I was plat 3 and got bored with my main so I played other roles (not great I might add), and well I was dropped to plat 5 with 0 LP. I was winning 12 LP per win and losing 20+ per loss lol. I had a 54% wr and dropped to below 50%. Now I am back in plat 3 after some hard work, but I will never do that again that is for sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaper4042","date":"2018-09-24T15:05:43.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get a win streak and get to s1, then lose about 7-10 games in a row, then climb back to s1, then lose 7-10 more games in a row.
