Also, put up the toilet seat before you urinate!ï»¿&quot;\r\n\r\nX Person: &quot;I am a senior officer with the National Security Agency, and I know you more than you know yourself, including that you are a pathological liar and a habitual thief, you illiterate little boy. You are being monitored through your stolen computer and every surveillance camera. Smile! You are on satellite! HEY! QUIT PLAYING WITH YOURSELF, YOU NASTY LITTLE GNAT!&quot;\r\n\r\nX Person: &quot;Y Person, you little effeminate spastic monkey, you are a case of microcephaly, meaning that you are severely mentally handicapped and have to be in a special needs care program.
