She doesn&#039;t need a reset for her identity as ADC. I remember back when she could be played as an AP assassin and the jump + knockback made sense to her identity, but not now as an ADC. At least with twitch is stealth mechanic makes him somewhat as an assassin, but not current trist. She has steroids, mobility, range, pushing power inherent in her champion already, she does not need to keep a reset.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-10-07T00:29:08.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because she's only like that thanks to the current meta, damn near every meta before this she was a bottom feeder who couldn't output enough damage.\n\nCept for that short spurt when stixxay brought rageblade trist.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2017-10-07T00:59:34.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP {{champion:18}} still works and is actually still good, but {{item:3031}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3094}} is just so strong that there is no reason to not go AD on her. I feel the same situation with AP {{champion:42}} though that isn't because of items holding AP Corki back but the fact that his passive is basically AP Corki when you build him AD lol.\n\nAlso {{champion:18}} isn't really broken, it's just those 3 crit items + Bloodlust + supports with {{item:3107}} {{item:3504}} that is making her insane. She had 1 buff in the past 2 seasons and that was the duration of her Q going up to 7 seconds from 5. While that is a good size of a buff, it's not enough alone for her to go from garbage tier ADC with one of the lowest win rates back in Season 5/6 to her very strong state she is in right now.\n\nIf the meta goes away from ADCs stacking those 3 items, or Bloodlust/Supports gets nerfed then she'll go back to bottom to mid tier ADC again. Which is why I don't want her to get nerfed, since I know that eventually Riot is going to nerf one of those and I don't want her to get {{champion:113}}'d.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Salron","date":"2017-10-07T00:30:56.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP Tristana is pretty irrelevant here, she wasn't intended to be an ap assassin so her having a reset has nothing to do with that","replies":[]}]}
