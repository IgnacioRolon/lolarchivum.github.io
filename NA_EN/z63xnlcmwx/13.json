Yes, she can be played against other characters and preform well enough, but true damage for a % of HP doesn't mean much to an assassin or ADC. The fact that she can overpower other ADCs within 2 autos without really investing into heavy damage items in favor of Attack speed defeats her purpose, her ratios are far too strong and potent, and crit with attack speed just increases her problematic state. Her ultimate is a pure stat boost with additional stealth, making the enemy ADC unable to target you for sets amounts of time, and kite your opponent thanks to being one of the few ADCs with a movement ability (see {{champion:429}} and {{champion:236}} for further details on how mobility ADCs can do a shit ton when they aren't nerfed). Her design is meant to be for ripping down heavy targets thanks to true damage which honestly should be what she's balanced around, not any other abilities, and even then, its problematic.\n\nWhat should be more valuable? Draven dealing nearly 1k-1.3k damage on a single auto with his full abilities and passive items up, or a Vayne popping you for about 2k with a single auto with an instant auto reset, mobility boost, AD bonus, passives on items, AND ability effects. She simply out-stats other ADCs even though her design is implied to be for more delayed and drawn out fights, ones where tanks EXCEL. Draven ends fights quickly. These shouldn't be swapped around.
