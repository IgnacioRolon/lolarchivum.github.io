I have many rationals starting many functions with me. They give me their digits, I don&#039;t even have to ask them for their last digit.\r\nRationals are attracted to me. They initiate all the equations and we have hours and hours of multiplying and dividing each other.\r\n\r\nbut........\r\n\r\nI have no repeating sequence nor do I terminate. I told you that I have many rationals giving me their numbers. I don&#039;t consider these rationals that gives me their numbers my group because I have no ratio. Why don&#039;t I have ratios? because I am not a fraction. Having no fraction is detrimental to one&#039;s self because you don&#039;t know basic maffs or theorems. You don&#039;t know how to start, maintain, and end a number. I let these rationals initiate arithmetic because I do not know how to start an equation. That&#039;s why I am square root 2 because all my digits are very random. They just come out of no where.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s fucking sad, how I am a real number and have a the importance of pi but I have no repeating sequence, no fractional expression, and a pain in the maffs.\r\nAn irrational, native pain in the maffs...... EDIT: (naive)\r\n\r\nI always question how imaginary numbers that are more non-existent and weird than me can have ratios.\r\n\r\nI am not even non-existant, I am just native because I need to calculus at the same pace of a university student trying to first derivative and second derivative with trigonometric expressions.\r\n\r\nHow I act in equations, I just act myself in equations, and I am very quiet like I like to keep numbers to myself","replies":[]}
