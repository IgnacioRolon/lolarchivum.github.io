That is a completely different gameplay mechanic.\n\nLee sin does have things in his Kit that remove agency, such as R the enemy to make them travel in a straight line while stunned so he can land Q->Q combo without them dodging.\n\nThe mobility is frustrating because it takes away the safety of other characters' mobility (and flash) because it is so much more than theirs. Ward hopping is a big part of that.\n\nMaybe I used too tight of a definition for unfun, but yours is still too loose.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"rework trundle","date":"2017-05-11T18:10:31.123+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct me if I'm wrong, but his Q has 6 secs cd and is up 3 secs (3 secs downtime).\nA good Rumble will stay in the 50-99 zone.\nHe's really annoying since he can just spam Q as soon as it's up cd, push you into tower then stay at max range and keep Q'ing you while you're getting the ranged creeps.\n\n*please don't bring the ask jungler for ganks argument they all suck kappa*","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-05-11T18:33:31.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a good point, I wish OP would present his arguments like this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Azureee","date":"2017-05-11T17:22:01.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:122}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-05-11T18:38:23.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would live to see someone pick rumble into my vlad","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-05-11T18:04:41.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are having trouble with Rumble in lane, you should work on your playstyle.
