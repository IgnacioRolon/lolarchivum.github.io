From their business model, their gaming updates, their game design, their artwork and their playerbase relations. I got to a point where even if I don&#039;t play the game they release, I&#039;d just buy it to support them. The degree of their work is reflected in steam reviews, and let&#039;s be honest a lot of steam users leave negative for the most ridiculous reasons but it&#039;s not so much with their games.\r\nOxygen not included, an early access game has a 93% total positive review of 15315 users with a 99% recent positive review of 2841 users. That&#039;s insane for an EA game that hasn&#039;t even been released yet. Unlike most EA games, Klei actually plans on finishing their game like how they did it with Don&#039;t starve together.\r\nNow Don&#039;t starve together has, 96% positive review of 63998 users and a 98% positive recent review of 5920 users.\r\nDon&#039;t starve single players without DLC has a 96% positive of 48472 users, and a 97% positive recent review of 2364 users.\r\n\r\nThe price? All three added together is less than what it cost to buy an AAA game. Their DLC isn&#039;t as expensive as other DLCs and yet still add meaty hours of content. This is what gaming companies should aspire to be. A sustainable business model which generates profit but not fucking over your playerbase with cash grabs while keeping an well updated and balanced game.","replies":[]}
