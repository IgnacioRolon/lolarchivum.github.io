Guess what, those assassins are balanced in this meta with the exception of {{champion:103}}  who is still broken and deserve to be gutted. What does this make Kassadin, Yorick tier?\n\nExample\nTalon, stronger than Kassadin, still balanced on the weak side.\nZed, stronger than Kassadin, balanced\nLe Blanc, stronger than Kassadin, balanced\nAkali, a tad bit stronger than Kassadin, underpowered\nKatarina, stronger than Kassadin, balanced on the stronger side, borderline broken but current broken champs outbroken her.\nShaco, &lt;3 different roles but does the job of an assassin better than Kassadin, balanced but I&#039;d love him to get buffs\nTu Strong, stronger than Kassadin, balanced on the stronger side\nTwitch, only &quot;assassin&quot; labeled by riot to be on par with him in a soloque setting, could use some tweaking\n{{champion:103}} , too strong. GUT NOW!\nDiana, way stronger than Kassadin, needs to be gutted.\nFizz, stronger than Kassadin, balanced on the strong side, in same situation as Katarina\n\nPretty much all assassins are stronger than Kassadin while still being healthy with some AP cancer excluded, he was created as an &quot;anti-mage&quot; but every other champion does a better job of being an &quot;anti mage&quot; than him. He&#039;s sitting at a 42.5% win rate top lane and 45.5% win rate bot lane for at least two years now. If Riot can&#039;t buff him, can they at least buff {{champion:76}} back to her AP days :^)","replies":[]}
