He had to do a clean windows install. He got LoL started installing but decided to close out of it mid download/install during the launcher screen. And after that anytime he attempted to open it, it would just have the logo flicker and nothing would appear. So he attempted a fresh install of LoL by deleting the folder and reinstalling it but he is still getting the same issue of anytime he trys to launch LoL, the logo will flicker but then the actual Launcher/Login Screen won't appear. Also, inside his LoL folder, he doesn't have the LeagueClient.exe","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-23T03:42:25.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AHhhh it sounds like your friend hasn't set up his permission settings for League yet after reinstalling Windows. Have them run through this [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide if he's unsure of how to get those settings configured, but after that they should be good to go.","replies":[{"poster":"A Drunk N1nja","date":"2017-08-23T20:43:31.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would this be the cause of it though? Like I said, he installed it and the Login Screen/Client was up and running according to him. But it was downloading/installing the game, but he decided he wanted to have Rocket League downloaded first, so he just closed out of the client. But then when he went to launch league, that's when he got the flickering logo and no client appearing. I'll have him try this. But it installed correctly and was working correctly at first, until he decided to be a dumb dumb and close it out instead of pause the installation.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-23T20:57:45.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That'll be the most likely fix yea, so be sure to go through all of those steps.
