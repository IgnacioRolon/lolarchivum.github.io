I recall calling my support blind and deaf after I pinged her to go back 5 times. It was not until after the game that I told my opponents to stop eating their own words. A lot was said on both sides that game, so I can&#039;t remember everything that was said on both parts. The only extreme things I remember me saying were &quot;kys&quot; and &quot;keep eating your own words&quot;, stuff like that. Nothing extreme (at least extreme enough for me NOT to remember).\r\nNonetheless, the reason why I said those things is because the enemy Lux and Galio were saying things like &quot;just ff&quot; and &quot;ez?&quot; before the game even ended. And when me and my team managed to turn the game around and end it, was when I started to say things like that. It was after the game (where you can still chat with everyone, commend, report players etc) that I started typing a lot. And even there was it barely anything personal. What I remember saying, though, was stuff like &quot;I am actually going to masturbate after this, you have no idea how good this win felt&quot; and I also told them not to eat their own words, as I had said before. It was never really anything personal. \r\nThe Lux on the enemy team added me, and I accepted. Although I never received a message from him, but I did get surprised by the pop-up on my client saying my account had been permanently suspended.\r\nSo what I am trying to say is, is it really fair to permanently suspend my account? Even though I have only gotten suspended (for two weeks) ONCE during all these years of playing? I have put in so much time, and money, that I hate disappearing just like that for not much at all. I believe the enemy Lux was the one who reported me in anger after losing that game in which she had said was easy.\r\nSo I am asking you, nay, begging you. Please. Suspend my account for a month or something. Just consider withdrawing the decision to permanently suspend my account.\r\n(Also if you read through the chat logs over the past couple of games, the ones where i played with a summoner named &quot;fulltimetrapper&quot;. He is a close friend of mine and we like to joke with eachother like that by &quot;flaming&quot; eachother in game, so there&#039;s no real flaming there going on!)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n//Dimet","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-22T16:55:16.462+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically, this thread is best fit for the[ Player Behavior ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation)boards.  The community and arbiters there could offer some solid info in regards to your suspension as well as reformation.  While technically this thread should be deleted and moved over to PB, there is some great advice offered here from your peers that I hope can help. \n\nI also took a look at your logs for this specific suspension, and it paints a completely different light than the context provided in your post.  Should you select to discuss this with the community over at the PB boards, it's important to be as honest as possible and post your logs (provided in the client) without leaving anything left out.\n\nIf you'd also prefer more individual context, you can also reach out to the PB Support team in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[]},{"poster":"DWlGHT K SCHRUTE","date":"2017-06-22T13:16:13.406+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's the thing Dimet.... Two wrongs don't make a right. If you are toxic, whether they are toxic and deserve it or not is irrelevant. Toxic players get reported and are punished. By being toxic to them you gave the bad guys the ammo to shoot you down.\n\nI know it felt good to turn the game around and make them eat their words, but you could have done it modestly and quietly instead. Trust me they felt foolish for making those comments once you started winning...\n\nPlease consider what I just said. Reform doesn't come from making excuses for your bad behavior, it comes from change within. I'm no angel myself I still have trouble from time to time but I'm trying to get a handle on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"catieplays","date":"2017-06-22T04:33:59.641+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry about your loss, especially since the enemy team sort of said worse things.","replies":[{"poster":"Dimet","date":"2017-06-22T05:09:30.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks\nExactly!
