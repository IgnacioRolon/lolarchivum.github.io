There's a reason the US has only had 20 years of peace during its entire existence and during that same time, France has only had 7.  \n\nWar is dangerous, but it is also the most efficient tool by states to spread influence.  At least until multi-state councils are created to keep warmongering in check.  Which, I believe the whole point of the grand lore rewrite was to get rid of that multi-state council to promote peace.\n\nThis leave Piltover in a precarious position, strategically.  \n\n> See also: why does no one just invade Piltover and claim the Sun Gates? Then they could control the sea access, and attack whoever they wanted...\n\nYes.  That's a good question.  It's also why the exact reason why I said Piltover is not in a position to remain neutral (apparently not in the post you responded to, somewhere else).  Panama survived by basically just caving to the US's desires.  And I don't even remember how many wars were fought over the Suez Canal before, wouldn't you know it, a multi-state council was formed to get people to stop fighting over it in 1880.  And it still didn't really work.  And was mostly an effort by France to screw over Britain.  But, you get the idea.\n\n> The answer is perhaps not what many people think. It&#x27;s super simple, actually.\n\nThen tell me.  Because how it looks to me, is every powerful war leader should be looking at Piltover and getting cartoony dollar signs over their eyes.\n\nAnd anyone with ambitious in Piltover should be looking at their frankly ridiculous tech advantage and thinking how neat it would be to have their own city.  Besides, even if they're making money through trade.  You know what makes more money?  Conquest, that knocks down trade taxes in foreign ports.  You know, like what Venice kept trying to do it's entire existence until it finally just got rolled up into Italy.  Despite being arguably the largest economic and trade power in Europe until the later Renaissance.  And it still kept trying to establish an empire in the Middle East to increase their profits.  \n\nThey didn't succeed (well, actually they did a few times but lost them), but they also didn't have mech suits, rocket launchers, sniper rifles, and fricken laser beams.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-12-10T20:53:47.362+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Warlord Dienekes,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=c0EG5ztG,comment-id=00140002,timestamp=2018-12-10T20:22:51.508+0000)\n>\n>  Really the major question is: How hasn&#x27;t Piltover conquered the surrounding territory by now?\n\n\nBecause they are a single city surrounded by the noxian empire.\n\nThey might have the technology,but they simply don't have the numbers to expand.\nWorst case scenario for Piltover would be trying to expand beyond their borders and then getting their technology stolen by Noxus.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2018-12-10T22:06:38.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It is one city true.

There was a conflict that had nothing to do with the League: The Solari and the Lunari.  And it had a pretty interesting base concept for it.\n\nLeona, representing the Solari, was a good person.  Her dialogue was filled with notes about protecting the weak, and her lore was about defying tradition to create a better world, even at the cost of her own life.  She was pretty close to LoL's paladin equivalent.  \n\nOpposite her was Diana, a vengeful and angry woman who backed the Lunari.  Decrying the Solari as a corrupt institution, and murdering people for her message.\n\nSo it seemed like a simple Good vs Evil debate.  But there was one hiccup.  Diana was right.  The Solari was a corrupt institution that suppressed and possibly committed genocide against the Lunari in ages past.  So this black/white conflict turned into an exploration of how a good person can be on the wrong side.  Or how an evil person could stand by truth.  And those who found this fascinating were ready to see this developed.\n\nThen there was Pantheon.  Pantheon was a soldier.  He needed some work, as a character.  There was something there, if you read into his interactions with Leona in her lore.  Showing Pantheon as being a traditionalist and Leona’s childhood friend.  But it needed to be developed.\n\nThen the lore hits and... it involved none of that.  Diana no longer sought out the truth about the moon on her own accord.  She just sort of stumbles upon it, because the Solari elders sent a child to go read books they didn't want her to read... because reasons.\n\nLeona, the paladin, swaps personality about 4 times throughout the course of her lore.  She starts out as a noble soul.  She stands up against the traditions of her people to do what she thinks as right.  And gets rewarded for it. So you'd think following through that line of reasoning she should become more caring.  Because that's how stories/people work.  You get rewarded for behavior you follow that behavior.  Instead when she's an adult and she sees Diana, and she is literally fantasizing about killing her.  So, the opposite happens. Despite Leona’s vindictive nature and desire to kill, Diana kills the Elders.  This should prove to the zealous Leona that Diana needs to be put down.  Then at the end of her lore in a few sentences she gets possessed by an alien and suddenly no longer wants to kill Diana.  She only wants to talk.  \n\nThis would lead the reader to think that the alien is making Leona nicer.  However, once we get Leona’s short story, we have Leona literally pushing against the alien to not smite the bandits with the full power of the Sun.\n\nSo Leona just flops back and forth from moral to immoral based basically on what the plot demands, in a way that makes her seem vindictive to her old fans.  It certainly reads like Leona was fully on board to slaughter innocents that disagreed with you, only for the space parasites to come take over her mind and make her do what they want.  \n\nMore annoying still, that old actually interesting conflict between Diana and Leona gets brought up, recognized and then entirely discarded.  Diana no longer wants to purge the Solari.  She just wants to go learn things and get supporters.  Leona doesn’t want to avenge the Elders.  She just wants to talk with Diana.  The conflict that people waited years for got resolved with a literal Deus es Machina.\n\nAnd then we get to Pantheon.  Pantheon needed the most work of the three original champions.  Well first off, what did Pantheon fans want from Pantheon lore?  Not much really.  We just wanted a Spartan.  That’s really it.  Give us a Spartan, make him badass.  And how did they do?  Well, it started out not too bad.  We see a young boy living up in basically the Agoge analogue.  We see a budding rivalry, and friendship.  It’s actually a pretty good story, culminating with Atreus screaming alone at the top of a mountain, his only friend dead in his hands.  This is, in my opinion, the single most powerful moment in the entire Targon lore.  \n\nThen they ruin it over the course of the next paragraph.  The skies open up.   Apparently, the gods were waiting for Pylas to die because they’re assholes.  They completely take over Atreus’s body, because they’re assholes.  It even has a whole two paragraphs describing how totally dead Atreus is now.  Because the gods are assholes.  Now, Atreus probably is going to come back, as Jaredan mentioned a few days after the lore was released.  Which just makes the whole situation an annoyance.\n\nNo one wanted to see Pantheon turned into a space parasite.  And a pathetic one at that.  The next lore update was Sol.  Where we learn that not only are the space parasites not gods, they are confirmed complete bastards.  Enslaving their friend in Sol, and Pantheon gets knocked a few pegs down further.  The great “God of War” just commands Sol to do her work for her, then gets blown up.  Woo.  \n\nThen we got Taric.  Taric was ok.\n\nAnd we get to Zoe.  Woo boy.  So, the one part of the Targon lore to demonstrate that the hosts of the space parasites is worthy is the ascent up the mountain.  Which Zoe doesn’t do.  She’s special.  The other hosts are mostly humans with some minor abilities granted by their parasite.  Except Zoe.  She’s an immortal 12 year old with the single most powerful ability presented in the game.  She’s special.  She bounces into a town scares the local population.  Has a group of guards try to defend themselves, which she then nukes from orbit.  Apparently scaring everyone and throwing a comet at a town is meant as a warning about a world rune by the town.  \n\nSure, she could just use her abilities of unrestricted teleportation to just move the rune.  Or she could just say “Hey, there’s a world rune down there.  Be careful with that.”  \n\nBut no.  Comets and murder.  That’s how you send a message.  And we’re supposed to be on her side in this.  She’s supposed to be an endearing character.  She’s special.\n\nSo that’s enough with the characters.  Let’s look at what the Lore has built.  First.  What are the Aspects?  No one knows.  I’m also convinced that Riot didn’t know when they released the new lore update.  Leona was presented as being possessed by a spirit of the Sun.  But Diana was instead possessed by the spirits of all the past Lunari people.  But Pantheon is presented as a constellation of stars, which is also war.  But in Sol’s lore they’re a race of formerly Runeterran creatures that Sol gave powers to and then betrayed him.  Then once the Darkin lore got retconned it turns out that they’re actual anthropomorphic versions of whatever they represent.  Twilight is apparently the personification of Change.  Pantheon is the personification of War itself.\n\nNone of that fits together, and doesn’t really make sense.  Because it was released with a big mystery that Riot hadn’t finished plotting yet.  And the lore ended up being worse for it.   \n\nThere’s also the problem of Targon’s power itself.  Put frankly, Zoe is the most powerful character in LoL by a wide margin.  Even Sol, the star dragon, there’s little if anything he can do that Zoe can’t replicate with her portals.  She doesn’t, because she’s an insane 12 year old mass murderer.  But if she wanted to, she could.  \n\nThis leads to problems whenever Targon gets involved in other people’s messes.  They seem to have the power to fix pretty much anything.  The last Aspect of Twilight slaughtered most of the Darkin with relative ease.  But because they’re so powerful these victories don’t feel fulfilling.  And it brings up the question: Why haven’t they fixed this problem, or that problem?  They’re so powerful they should be able to.  But if they do, the story will not have a satisfying conclusion.  We want to see Yorick deal with the Black Mist.  That’s his story.  How terrible would it be if Zoe or Taric popped in and used their incredibly vague magic powers to just heal or stop the spread?  It’d be boring.\n\nBut then again, why aren’t they?  The Black Mist is probably the most dangerous threat to the world of Runeterra after the Void.  The World Runes may be tied there.  But we know that the Aspects view of dealing with that problem is to just blow people up.  I’m not going to get into that again.\n\nAnd all these problems and headaches came from what could have been a very interesting and grounded story on right, wrong, religion, power, and war.  That those who were interested with the Old Targon lore will now never get.  Because everything revolves around the Space Parasites.\n\nAnd I hate them.","replies":[{"poster":"Camille Ferrøs","date":"2018-12-11T21:08:56.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Warlord Dienekes,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=c0EG5ztG,comment-id=000c0001000000000000,timestamp=2018-12-11T04:38:43.566+0000)\n>\n> Alright it all goes back to the pre-Great Rewrite days.  \n> \n> Back then, the Targon Lore was one of the lores that people thought needed the least amount to transition into a post-League world.  There was a conflict that had nothing to do with the League: The Solari and the Lunari.  And it had a pretty interesting base concept for it.\n> \n> Leona, representing the Solari, was a good person.  Her dialogue was filled with notes about protecting the weak, and her lore was about defying tradition to create a better world, even at the cost of her own life.  She was pretty close to LoL&#x27;s paladin equivalent.  \n> \n> Opposite her was Diana, a vengeful and angry woman who backed the Lunari.  Decrying the Solari as a corrupt institution, and murdering people for her message.\n> \n> So it seemed like a simple Good vs Evil debate.  But there was one hiccup.  Diana was right.  The Solari was a corrupt institution that suppressed and possibly committed genocide against the Lunari in ages past.  So this black/white conflict turned into an exploration of how a good person can be on the wrong side.  Or how an evil person could stand by truth.  And those who found this fascinating were ready to see this developed.\n> \n> Then there was Pantheon.  Pantheon was a soldier.  He needed some work, as a character.  There was something there, if you read into his interactions with Leona in her lore.  Showing Pantheon as being a traditionalist and Leona’s childhood friend.  But it needed to be developed.\n> \n> Then the lore hits and... it involved none of that.  Diana no longer sought out the truth about the moon on her own accord.  She just sort of stumbles upon it, because the Solari elders sent a child to go read books they didn&#x27;t want her to read... because reasons.\n> \n> Leona, the paladin, swaps personality about 4 times throughout the course of her lore.  She starts out as a noble soul.  She stands up against the traditions of her people to do what she thinks as right.  And gets rewarded for it. So you&#x27;d think following through that line of reasoning she should become more caring.  Because that&#x27;s how stories/people work.  You get rewarded for behavior you follow that behavior.  Instead when she&#x27;s an adult and she sees Diana, and she is literally fantasizing about killing her.  So, the opposite happens. Despite Leona’s vindictive nature and desire to kill, Diana kills the Elders.  This should prove to the zealous Leona that Diana needs to be put down.  Then at the end of her lore in a few sentences she gets possessed by an alien and suddenly no longer wants to kill Diana.  She only wants to talk.  \n> \n> This would lead the reader to think that the alien is making Leona nicer.  However, once we get Leona’s short story, we have Leona literally pushing against the alien to not smite the bandits with the full power of the Sun.\n> \n> So Leona just flops back and forth from moral to immoral based basically on what the plot demands, in a way that makes her seem vindictive to her old fans.  It certainly reads like Leona was fully on board to slaughter innocents that disagreed with you, only for the space parasites to come take over her mind and make her do what they want.  \n> \n> More annoying still, that old actually interesting conflict between Diana and Leona gets brought up, recognized and then entirely discarded.  Diana no longer wants to purge the Solari.  She just wants to go learn things and get supporters.  Leona doesn’t want to avenge the Elders.  She just wants to talk with Diana.  The conflict that people waited years for got resolved with a literal Deus es Machina.\n> \n> And then we get to Pantheon.  Pantheon needed the most work of the three original champions.

However, maybe it's simply because she decides to abuse the full extent of her power, rather than using it more modestly similar to Leona and Diana. Even then, the powers granted differ from Aspect to Aspect, which doesn't necessarily make one anymore powerful than the others. Leona can call down the full might of the sun in strikes, which is a powerful feat of it's own. We also have to realize that Zoe is far older than her appearance gives off, and has had centuries, possibly eons, to learn more about her abilities and powers, which explains as to why she's seemingly so much more powerful than Pantheon, Taric, Leona, and Diana. It isn't that she's inherently stronger, but that she's had far longer to posses and cultivate the powers granted to her by the Aspect of Twilight. Leona, Taric, Pantheon, and Diana have all received their Aspect abilties fairly recently in the lore, probably within the span of the last 5 years in the Universe, so of course they probably don't know the full extent of their powers. \n\nThe Aspects are cosmic beings, and the enemies of the Void, which is their role within the League Universe. At the end of the day, they are the ones that are truly trying to fight and stop the Void, not that this lessens the acts of Kai'Sa and Kassadin. However, the Aspects aren't a hive mind, sure they're grouped together, but they're still individuals, and individuals will have differing views. Different Aspects will have different ways of testing and selecting their vessel(s), Twilight wanted somebody who embodied fun, and Zoe simply did that. While yeah, that kind of made it a little to easy on her, that's simply how it works. Atreus's travel up the mountain was brutal, perhaps because he was going to be imbued by War, who is brutal. As we know from his comic, the path didn't open up for Taric until he committed an act of selflessness, and in the end, he imbued with the powers of one of the more selfless Aspects.\n\nWith Pantheon, the Aspect, not Atreus, we know that he/she/it possesses multiple vessels, not just Atreus, and that like the war it embodies, this particular Aspect is brutal, and merciless. It could stand to reason that all the Aspects could simply wipe away the memories and personalities of their vessels, some simply choose not to, either out of respect, or benevolent or altruistic intentions. War probably does it, not necessarily out of malice, but it makes it easier to control their vessel, which is probably something like a mental juggling act for it considering they have multiple vessels. \n\nLeona's shifting personality has been my only other issue, but I still don't think it's as bad as to the extent you view it. Leona did, and on some level, probably still does want to kill Diana, but after being imbued by the Aspect of the Sun, it sort of gifted her with enlightenment, for lack of a better word. As far as she knows, Diana is the only other person who's also been chosen as a vessel, and yeah, if I were her, I'd want answers to. Diana on the other hand, in my opinion, has better lore now than she did before.  \n\nCurrently, the Solari aren't a corrupt institution anymore, they now fully admit to purging the Lunari, and believe they were right to do so, on the grounds of their faith, like what happens incredibly often in the real world.

Literally the first thing Zoe does upon gaining her powers is the unrestricted warp teleporting across the galaxy. \n\nThat alone is the single most powerful thing any champion can pull off. Sure she can also now bend stars to her will and turn off freaking gravity. And while that’s also ridiculously powerful. Unrestricted teleportation has it beat. \n\n> The Aspects are cosmic beings, and the enemies of the Void, which is their role within the League Universe. \n\nThey are confirmed to be that now. Yes.

With their incredibly power. It was thought that maybe it’s because they can only interact with people at the top of the mountain. Thus why they would possess people to do their work for them. \n\n But. No. They can create portals ans possess people anywhere I guess. \n\n> With Pantheon, the Aspect, not Atreus, we know that he/she/it possesses multiple vessels, not just Atreus, and that like the war it embodies, this particular Aspect is brutal, and merciless.

For the Aspect of War. He’s really bad at war. Honestly, Zoe’s power set would be much more beneficial to running a campaign than anything Panth has been shown to be capable of. \n\n> Leona&#x27;s shifting personality has been my only other issue, but I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as bad as to the extent you view it.

I was way more interested in the character drama between Diana and Leona for the stakes of a corrupt institution. Where the story is about the people than I am in what we have now. Where the characters take a back step to musings about the space parasites. \n\nI don’t care about them. That is the crux of the entire issue. The Targon lore shifted to become a vague mystery of “What are these strange and enigmatic beings?” \n\nAnd I just don’t care enough to find out.
