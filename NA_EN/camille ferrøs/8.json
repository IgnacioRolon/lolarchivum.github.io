Completely different things, he hasn't been hinted anywhere to actually be able to interact with the celestial realm. Zoe, a real celestial (she merged with the aspect of twilight so unlike diana/panth/leo she actually became a celestial), literally makes fun of him and considers him to be HER DOG. Aurelion is HEAVILY overrated on the power scale and there's a ton of misinformation spread about him so I don't blame you for thinking this. Multiple characters from runeterra could easily beat aurelion with information actually provided and just doing simple oh aurelion can do this and x character can do this. Aurelion is overrated and if he was as strong as everyone thinks he is, runeterra never would've been made. If you want to know why you should read more lore, but like I'll give you a mini spoiler. the celestials only make runeterra to kill the void... so if aurelion could do it they would've just asked him. Instead that cosmic dog fell victim to targonians lmao. Kinda pathetic and very overrated character in terms of power. I feel like his cool design and personality make people have a major bias on his actual power level.","replies":[{"poster":"Zapzya","date":"2019-03-10T09:02:46.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you think the celestial realm is?

Aurelion can't enter the celestial realm, I feel like that's enough of an explanation. Not to mention one of the celestials, aka the aspect of twilight, considers him HER DOG. He's a considerabley overrated character in terms of actual strength (and size, some people actually think he's the size of galaxies).Also the aspects are full fledged celestial beings. The people they imbue their power with (leo/diana/panth) are not.

Someone asked if it was \"permanent\" and that triggered him to tell us she is infact fullly merged with Zoe, but then he went on a rant about how he never uses words like permanent. Aurelion would be slightly larger than the summoners rift. Someone took the measurement of his splashart and figured out how big he would be with math. Also yes, he can create stars with the flick of his finger, but based from his splash, they aren't that big. Someone posted an interesting idea on my thread earlier about the strength of Aurelion and said most likely it takes centuries to fully form a star... otherwise why would he be so heartbroken when his stars die? He spends a lot of time to craft an actual full sized star. If he could create literal full sized stars out of nothing, he probably wouldn't care when his stars died. Not to mention if stars are the only thing that he can do... Then congratulations Aurelion is about as strong as Veigar except Veigar is omnipotent. Veigar literally uses dark cosmic magic... except he can create black holes. In theory Aurelion can create black holes if he creates a sun big enough and then leave it to decay over time. but yeah veigar wins so like that space doggo weak.","replies":[{"poster":"Zapzya","date":"2019-03-11T01:40:33.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Veigar is omnipotent, how was he enslaved by Mordekaiser?

Veigar was enslaved by morde an extremely long time ago compared to current events. He was just a normal-ish yordle. Morde blocked out his spiritual magic so he couldn't escape and tortured him. Veigar felt dark and evil magic building up inside of him and instead of supressing it he embraced it. Mordekaiser MADE him who he is today. Morde is the REASON why. You're under the impression Aurelion sol made all stars, he didn't. Also the stars and the cosmic forces in general are all under Veigar's control. He creates black holes out of nothing, not out of stars. Veigar can probably make his own dark stars. Like read some more lore Aurelion Stan. You clearly missed the entire part where veigar broke out of Morde jail after developing these powers. You also don't understand that he can control his magic. Why tf would he make a black hole to swallow runeterra? You clearly again, didn't read all his lore. He acts evil, he isn't actually evil. He was tortured and is twisted af now, but the slight good inside of him prevents him from being malicious. He's just an insane good person that acts evil, why would he destroy runeterra? Also you really think the celestials who control runeterra would let him destroy it? Bard is still on a whole different level from veigar. Sol is one of my favorite characters in lore which is why I know so much about him. If anything you have the bias because you can't accept whats given to us on paper. He isn't close to as strong as you or other people speculate. Just because he's stronger than the majority of characters doesn't mean he's someone who can beat everyone on runeterra with no effort like you people suggest. He loses in a 1v1 to multiple characters and not to mention the characters on Runeterra have strength in numbers. Like y'all take something riot says and bend it and twist it to make Aurelion seem op when he's really not.  I would be maining Aurelion if riot didn't push him out of meta 24/7. He's easily one of the coolest things riot has ever made, I can just accept the truth.","replies":[{"poster":"Zapzya","date":"2019-03-11T05:40:04.063+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, so I'm pretty sure you're just trolling.
