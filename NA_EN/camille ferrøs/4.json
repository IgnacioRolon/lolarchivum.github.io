And he is going after powerful objects that maaaaybe are the key for a portal to there. Since he  is not after saving the world. If he wanted that he would have went after the runes.. He definitely isn&#039;t saving the world from powerful objects as we thought before. He isn&#039;t targonian being. And the portal thingies on the map really make me think that he definitely has something to do with Bandle city..","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-09-04T18:48:07.876+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"This thread just blew my mind.","replies":[{"poster":"Camille Ferrøs","date":"2018-09-04T18:58:52.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Al0AQ0yH,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-09-04T18:48:07.876+0000)\n>\n> This thread just blew my mind.\n\nRiot god saw my post.
