Just want to provide context why some of these characters remain out of date. We want to do it right, when it makes sense.\n\nHave you considered directly polling the players here on the forums, in client, and on reddit to get a feel for what we like in the characters when deciding on updating their VO? I personally believe that an updated, fully fleshed out VO is much better than an outdated, limited VO that's lingering in the past - and so long as someone like Miss Fortune doesn't become a chipper child like Zoe in pirate hooker boots, and keeps to her theme of a badass pirate, I don't understand why and how a new VO can be that controversial. And sometimes, for the sake of progress, you've got to cut off the baggage holding you down and move on, or else things will stagnate and never move forward. \n\nEven if you can't completely agree on how to do someone like Miss Fortune, you guys own her and her story, and YOU know how she's supposed to be in the lore, so at some point you've all got to man up and press forward with _something_ to improve her. I don't see why a limited VO with a few cheeky lines and outdated material can seriously define a character so rigidly that you find it impossible to reinvent their vocals to fit her current lore and the standards of the game. You talk constantly of risks, but it doesn't seem like you take any. After all, Riot _did_ ignore the opportunity to fully VGU Miss Fortune back during the Gangplank VGU event, so either improve her in parts or give her a full, real VGU. It's frustrating to hear you waffle over \"but it's risky to update a voice\" when so many other champions get fully remade voices in their VGUs like Irelia, Akali, and Swain, while champions like Sona and Miss Fortune still call you summoner.","replies":[{"poster":"Larriet","date":"2019-02-06T22:30:02.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Were you around when they asked the community about Nautilus before the Bilgewater update with Pyke's release?

However, that particular survey about Nautilus was them considering changing his bio because they were cannibalizing it for Pyke because wanted Pyke to be unique in his watery vengeance - a change I detest the concept of - and it's a little different than asking about a voice actor. I feel like a VO is a necessary improvement to a character, and I don't think it should ever be completely stopped by opinions one way or the other as long as it's hitting the core concepts of the character. They did well nailing the flirty badass when they did Gun Goddess, so I was a bit confused as to how that overall theme and idea couldn't translate to the pirate and exactly how controversial their new VO was if it couldn't hit \"flirty badass pirate.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Larriet","date":"2019-02-07T15:57:59.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was referring to threads on the Boards and on Reddit where they straight up asked players what aspects they feel are most important to his character; this was after they had already decided not to change his theme (I'm assuming through that survey, which I didn't take).

I can see people feeling cheated that they didn't just give them a full VO in those cases.  And if you HAVE the actor around and the champ needs VO update, doesn't it just make sense to do that?  Again, that was the case with Lux and MF (I'd assume a few other champs too, although pure VO updates are relatively rare).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Milan Takoyaki","date":"2019-04-24T19:46:41.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Interlocutioner,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=WE2YELd2,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-06T18:45:06.274+0000)\n>\n> We've done a bit of this in the past!
