The quanitity of power absorbed by the human varies depending on how much physically and psycologic they're attuned to that concept.\n> \n> Aspects are a tricky one, while I believe the concepts are still on the celestial realm even when they get a host, the \"conciousness\" of the concept gets inside the host's head and the host will gradually get more attuned to that concept. You could describe that as the concept \"planting a seed\" on their hosts. Thats also the reason why Ascended get new bodies and Aspect mantains their bodies, Ascended need a new body since their human bodies would desintregate with so much power in so few time, but Aspect hosts have time to \"adapt\" to that power.\n> What I believe that happened with Darkins is that their concept was teared off from the celestial realm and forcefully had to materialize into a human body and then said body was trapped into a weapon. I remember Taco talking sometime ago about how concepts are not able to materialize in the physical realm due to their abstract nature, how does war looks? How does changes looks? Therefore when the Ascended gets fused with the entirety of the concept, it means\n> \n> Every. Single. Interpretation. From. Every. Single. Sentient. Mind.\n> \n> Their bodies are simply not able to exists and when they get into a weapon, everything that the concept ever was is reduced, and human minds cant reach to it because it is trapped. I believe that the entirety of the concept power is trapped inside the weapons, even though I'm not sure if the Darkins can tap into it.\n\nI hope that clarifies it for you.
