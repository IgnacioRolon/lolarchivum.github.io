I contacted Riot support and I sent them screenshots of the side with the message wait until some date..And sadly that was not strong evidence...Few months later I asked again and nothing.....I really really hope I get a chance for my beloved Piltover Icon in this exploration of Runeterra missions ..\nPlease RIot.
