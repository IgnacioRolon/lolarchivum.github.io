Skins.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"How about you share some of those with champions who need em? Does Ahri need ANOTHER skin? Why not give one to oh I unno......anyone who has yet to get 4-5? Heck I think there&#039;s a champ or 2 still sitting on 3. I don&#039;t think Aurelion has one outside of his launch (just checked he has 1 more since his launch) or maybe give yorick a nicer skin because no offense to the art team but the ingame model was...disappointing. I loved the splash art tho. \r\n\r\nI get you guys need to make money but ignoring champions just because they aren&#039;t in the top 10 most played all the time is kinda....not a good feeling if you play one of said champions lol. Specially if the skin they get isn&#039;t particularly amazing whilst champions like Jinx, MF, Ahri are constantly getting new amazing skins. (especially ahri. heck ahri and all her skins)","replies":[]}
