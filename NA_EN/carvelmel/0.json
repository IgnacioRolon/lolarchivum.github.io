I can confirm that the issue is only for trinket wards. Though I'm sad to hear that it's how it is supposed to be. Is there any possibility on that being changed?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-16T21:04:19.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At this time, we don't have plans to modify the SFX for the wards.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
