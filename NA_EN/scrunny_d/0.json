If people start flaming/counterflaming under pressure instead of muting irritants and instigators, then the punishment is on them. They had the option to follow the rules, and unless it's some obvious case of a gullible person getting tricked into saying something zero-tolerance, then it's largely going to be on each player to not flame.\n\n> I mean the least I'm asking for is for phrases like \" kill yourself, fuck, shit, %%%%, noob, inter etc.\" to be censored, if riot actually doesnt want toxicity, why would they not censor these words?\n\nThe simplest answer is, even for the more egregious offenses (hate speech, encouragements of self-harm), there's so many ways a person can work around a censoring filter that it'd be pointless and a waste of effort to try and proactively censor every variation of the word.\n\nAs for swearing (fuck, shit, etc.), the Mature Language Filter (which is turned on by default, IIRC) already handles those, and insults (whether direct and intentioned like \"inter\" or context-sensitive like \"noob\") are much in the same boat as the former case. Too many variations to censor entirely.\n\n> why wait for someone to report someone and then allow a system to go yeah he said one of those words but he has lvl 5 honor so its chill, when you could just stop those words from being said.\n\nThis statement, particularly the inclusion of Honor Level 5, is telling of a lack of information/misinformation on the punishment system.\n\nIt legitimately doesn't matter what Honor Level you are. You could be Honor Level 5, and the IFS will still punish you. It makes no difference to the system if you're Honor Level 0 or just on the verge of Honor 5 - breaking the rules will incur a punishment.\n\nAs for \"just stopping the words from being said\" - and, to a similar degree, the argument against a reactive punishment system - Riot has another reason to use Reports instead of just trying to filter everything out before it can get said. And that is that Riot believes that every player should have a say in what they find acceptable in a given match, and that belief is exemplified in the application of the Report feature.\n\nDo you have a group of friends and play in a premade and tell off-color jokes? Well, your decision to not report those friends is your way of saying \"I'm okay with this type of humor.\". Likewise, if one such joke gets used in the company of a random player, that random player can report it, and in so doing, tell Riot \"I'm not okay with this.\"\n\nRiot would rather reactively punish behavior that players deemed worth reporting than try to go out of their way to preemptively police their game and make sure everything - even the external factors that they really can't control, IE, the players - is going according to their script.\n\n> Riot have done sweet FA about this issue and there are so many simple fixes.\n\nRiot has done sweet fuckall _that you've seen._ A tree falls in the forest, etc., etc.\n\nAnd \"simple\" does not mean \"good\", and it doesn't mean \"right\". It just means \"simple\".\n\n> If they can't be bothered to spend the time, just cut it all together.\n\nThis _is_ a simple solution, but it's neither a good solution nor the right solution. And again, it's ignorant of the fact that Riot is already actively working against the problem that the simple solution overshoots.\n\n> Pings are more than enough to communicate in the game...\n\nThis isn't true. I can't ask people to ward a specific area through pings. I can't tell people that I plan to push out bottom lane for pressure before heading to Baron through pings. I can't tell people that my lane opponent is starting to get fed through pings.\n\nThose are just three things I could think of right off-hand, but there's still a lot of stuff that pings don't cover. They're a tool, not a say-all, end-all, be-all.\n\n> ...if you wanna chat to someone add them after and communicate using 3rd party programs?\n\nAnd what if my only interest in chatting with them is in the match that I play with them? What if I want to commend my opponent for a good play, but would have easily forgotten it by the end of the match? What if I don't want to build up a pile of friends I don't actively talk to or give them an avenue to talk to me outside of League?\n\nI've said it once, and I'll say it again: _\"Simple\" does not mean \"good\"._ Your simple solution causes too much hassle and harm for it to be remotely viable, and, again; it completely overshoots the problem in hopes of trying to sweep it up with everything else.\n\nYou need to think about the ramifications and after-effects of your proposal. Sure, the natural response to the change might be intuitive for _you_, but there are millions upon millions of players out there who definitely would not do things the way you would. And I know for a fact that I'm one such player.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-01-08T23:38:23.093+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"There have been children killed by scissors.
