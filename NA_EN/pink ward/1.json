{"poster":"Pink Ward","date":"2015-02-07T01:36:10.780+0000","title":"Shaco and some well needed Quality of Life buffs/Kit updates.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":60,"down_votes":6,"body":"Shaco is a champion that has been over looked for a very long while. I am a veteran Shaco player with over 1000 games of Shaco played, mostly ap because I find it extremely fun outplaying people with box play and my mechanical usage of his clone. His kit fits what this needs to do, but there are many bugs and/or fixes that have been over looked in his abilities. \n\n1. Shaco boxes (JiB) allow for a split second skills that have little to no \"wind up\" animations to be done after the boxes activation. \n           Example : Katarina shunpo onto shaco, shaco is standing on top of a box, Katarina still is able to cast her Sinister Steel ability.\nThe fear should be instant, not allowing any skills to be applied or used when nearing the JiB.  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTLx_z55MAU\nGood representation of how this bug goes about. The fear hits Kassadin in this video and he is still able to get off Force pulse.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpIE4lAH4M#t=110\nThis video also may tie into #3 but the riven Q pushes straight through box and not away.\n\n2. Another ability that does not get interrupted by JiB is Warwick's Infinite Duress. \n           Example : Warwick ult's a unit on top or near a JiB, Warwick will not be feared but will activate the JiB, locking the unit in place for the full duration.\nThe fear should deny Warwick's Infinite Duress and allow the suppress to be broken.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3PhlJT-pRM#t=20\n\n3. The JiB has a chance of denying Jarvan IV's ult, interrupting the jump, damage and putting it on cooldown.\n           Example : Jarvan IV uses Cataclysm while near a JiB, Cataclysm's animation brings him slightly closer to the Unit and puts him into the animation of the Cataclysm's jump. While in this animation, the JiB will fear Jarvan IV and deny Cataclsym. \nThis is beneficial for Shaco, but may be a bug. Either way it is really unreliable if it is intended (Which I highly doubt it is). There are many other skills such as Jax's Leap Strike, Lee Sin's Resonating Strike, among other aerial abilities that have weird interactions that are very unreliable with the JiB's that react in a similar manner to this. Sometimes the JiB will cancel the aerial ability and they are pushed away from the box due to the fear, and others  they will continue on their target with the fear being useless. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKS1YlA_bWs&feature=youtu.be#t=20\nIn this video, Jax jumps onto me with 1 box activating but when there are multiple boxes, he gets feared out of his jump away from the boxes.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll-q1QVV4I0&feature=youtu.be#t=25\nThis video shows Jarvan's ult being cancelled.\n\n4. I feel a slight buff to a more ap oriented Shaco would be nice. Allowing for items such as Rylais and Liandry's Torment, to be applied on JiB attacks would help this. The argument arises that JiBs are similar to Heimerdinger's turrets is something I find to be false. I feel like boxes are a very big part of an ap Shaco's kit and to be more closely similar to Teemo's shrooms. The abilities are both invisible and activate when coming in contact with an enemy unit. Along with Zyra's plants applying item effects, i feel JiBs should also apply them. It would help those who want to play a more unique build with Shaco.                                                                                                                                       \nIf these are not to be updated, I think frostfang and Spellthief's Edge do not proc off of boxes OR shaco's clone and should be updated to do so.\n\n5. Shaco's ultimate, Hallucination, has no been updated in a very long while. The clone's movements do not feel as smooth as controlling Shaco generally. The clone can (sometimes) use the laugh/taunt/joke jesters, but most of the time will not, maybe because not in range? I feel an update to Shaco's clone viability would allow for some counterplay with Shaco since it is a huge part of the Shaco's \"Jestery\" Kit. I think allowing for the Clone to have backing animations when you yourself are backing, would be another helpful buff to help out play your opponent. \n\n6. Now one of the biggest flaws I find to Shaco's clone is that if you click on the clone, it will have no items and will not benefit from runes and masteries. Instantly someone who has complete common sense will recognize which Shaco is the real one if they click on it. Another easy thing to see is if Shaco is using a pot, or any other buff, it will be easily noticed and disallow Shaco the counterplay with his clone. Another part to this is something not usually recognized, but if Shaco uses his clone when in fog of war or while in a bush, and brings his clone out of the bush before him, the clone will have lost mana. It is not seen very much, but it does happen and I noticed when watching a stream. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKS1YlA_bWs#t=276\nVideo of Shaco's clone not having stats from runes/masteries or items.\n\n7. Found another buggy situation with Shaco's Hallucination. When moving with alt+right mouse click, if you ping the map the shaco clone with run back to the user instead of fully going to where I set the movement command. Just another bug with him. You never really notice all the things wrong with a champion until you Number them haha.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAaoIw-Imo4#t=20\nThis video shows 2 things. 1 the mana of the clone goes down when not in vision of enemies. 2, the pinging pulls the clone back to shaco.\n\n\n\n8. If shaco attacks immediately after using Deceive (Q), he will not get the Crit and it will just be a fizzled use that puts your Q on cooldown. I find this incredibly annoying when trying to assassinate someone or get off the free crit. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAaoIw-Imo4#t=55\nShaco does not crit after Qing.\n\n9. If you auto then Deceive (Q) then you will instantly come out of invis. They Q will go on cd, you won't get the crit, and most of the time when it happens I personally need it to get away Haha.. But so much unreliability found in every single skill besides shiv (Which to be honest the passive application is really RNG).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMnQmstTvvM\nThis is the bug I am pointing out. Not my video just could not replicate it easily.\n\n10. Shaco boxes are easily 1 shotted by most aoe moves by level 7-9 because they have a constant 150 hp throughout all levels. A health system like zyra plants or even scaling health per level would help a lot.\n\nShaco is in an 'ok' place where he's at, but just a few minor updates to his kit and quality of life buffs could help his play style change significantly for the better.\n\nJust to clarify, # 2 and 3 aren't buffs, they are bugs that shaco struggles with at the moment. The usage of his boxes are a bit unreliable because of them. Shaco is sort of an outdated champ and has not really been 'sandpapered' in a long while. With all the new abilities and synergy's of abilities that have been put into the game since shaco was released, he needs to have some kinks worked out his boxes and how the effect enemy's skills and animations.\n\nWith the questions about #1 I am not talking about the fade time when the box is placed, I am talking about while the box is already down and an enemy uses a gap closer onto a unit near the box, they will be feared but still have the chance of using an ability with no 'wind up' animation. One that is instant and has little to no animation to it. This allows for clearing of the box in the later game which makes the box completely useless (usually an aoe ability).  I pointed out Katarina's Sinister Steel, but there are others, Rek'Sai's Unborrow, Kassadin's Null Sphere and Force Pulse (usually when he uses Riftwalk to engage on top of a box), etc. There are plenty of different skills that have bad interactions with boxes.","replies":[{"poster":"Phife","date":"2015-02-07T01:39:21.638+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow, how are these not already applied in game?\n\n\n100% agree.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stonington","date":"2015-02-07T03:33:10.098+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"OH, the clone doesn't show items?

Tiamat/Hydra damage (+75) will crit and you have that nasty active and  a free wave clear. Lichbane can push towers, and only towers, but tiamat aoe will make your split pushing way better.\n\n3) Jib  won't deal her max damage on her own, since the fear already help the target get out of the range, and guess what, if you JiB in plain sight trying to close escape routes, the trigger area is so small that a sidestep will totally ignore your JiB. JiB wont prioritize champions over creeps, being totally unreliable. \nYou say your adc should use JiB to kite. In a TF there are way too many skill shots that WILL destroy your boxes even if they are stealthed, or a oracle lenses will disarm taht JiB in a all in. And JiB to protect dragon?

While in this animation, the JiB will fear Jarvan IV and deny Cataclsym.\nThis is beneficial for Shaco, but may be a bug. Either way it is really unreliable if it is intended (Which I highly doubt it is). There are many other skills such as Jax's Leap Strike, Lee Sin's Resonating Strike, among other aerial abilities that have weird interactions that are very unreliable with the JiB's that react in a similar manner to this. Sometimes the JiB will cancel the aerial ability and they are pushed away from the box due to the fear, and others they will continue on their target with the fear being useless.\" \n\ntranslation - GET DUN...AHH A SPOOKY BOX QUICK FEET BREAK THE LAWS OF PHYSICS AND REALITY AND LET ME RUN AWAY!!\" \n\n\"I feel like boxes are a very big part of an ap Shaco's kit and to be more closely similar to Teemo's shrooms\" teemo shrooms (ultimate with rather high mana cost) =/= invisible 60 second spooky trap available level 1 used mostly for jungle clears.\n\nfirst two are the only good ideas the rest are stupid because all that counter play you keep blabing about isn't adding it its taking it away from anyone who has to deal with him he was already buffed to hell at the start of season 4 since he can walk up to your lane from out of sight thanks to pink ward changes but those signs that you want removed are the only way to tell them apart if shaco's clone did no damage like leblancs did it might not matter but shaco's does damage and uses items like shiv","replies":[]}]}
