At the start I wanted to make quinn go mental boom that's why it's hard to understand her especially at the beginning, also I had intention to make it  harder to understand as she is just mumbling something on the path. you can tell by her behaviour trough out the episode  she is very impulsive yet tries to act like a leader even through out she does nothing much at all her rapters got stolen and Valor drops her XD. \nto be honest when I do my drawings the characters make up the story on their own it's fascinating how it worked out to be.\n\nAs for remixes I would loved if someone could make up for me perhaps I could re-upload one day the whole clip again with proper audio.  \nNote that Am lacking in self-exposer if only I found a way to be more successful artist I would upload and create new staff every week, but as for now It's hard to see a light in end of the tunnel if I keep making animated videos.
