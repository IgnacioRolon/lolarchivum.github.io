I used to have NOOO problem spectating games and now I am unable to watch a game for more than 30 seconds before it freezes, only to pick back up 30 seconds later, and then repeat this process twice more and then disconnect me. I am the network admin at my RV park and have done all the required port forwarding and still am unable to spectate. I can play just fine, no lag no disconnects, but this spectate game function is fubar. This is something on RIOT's end, not on mine as I can watch the packets loss as spectating, its as if your server drops and reconnects during spectating and after a certain amount of drops, automatically disconnects. Is this a known issue and is there any progress being made to correct this issue. I understand you are a huge company and you have tons of issues that come up but this is one that has been going on for a long time now. Can we please get a Red Update here? Anything that lets me know this problem is being addressed and working on being corrected, or if there is something else I need to do on my end I would love to hear that as well, although I am VERY certain its nothing with my end, as this is happening to all my friends from many other states and cities. Thank you for your time and I hope to hear something soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Eambo","date":"2015-01-09T03:23:46.805+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi StillwawterPlaya,\n\nCan you please do the following:\n\n- Press windows key + r to open up \"run\"\n- Type \"cmd\" and hit enter\n- In command prompt type \"ping 192.64.174.163 -t\" (note the spaces after ping and before -t)\n- Let this run for a few minutes\n- Press Ctrl+c after these few  minutes, and it should end\n- Upload a screenshot of what you can see on screen.
