He throws out bans for absolutely nothing, he's overly toxic, he smurfs in lower elos and calls people trash. Why anyone supports this guy, I've no idea. If you're in power, go view his channel on Twitch and see how toxic this guy is, and his mods aren't any better. The guy gets upset, people tell him to cheer up and he bans them over it. Sure you can do whatever you wish on Twitch for the most part, but being toxic in the game is no different from being toxic outside of the game. Everything carries over.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-03-05T14:02:11.933+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Is he typing in the game being toxic?
