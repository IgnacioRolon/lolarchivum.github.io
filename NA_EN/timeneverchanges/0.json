Lucians range is too short to justify the amount of dmg he does with abilities. Lucian seems to struggle in the early game against a meta of hyper adc in the bot lane. The amount of free sustain from the new runes really doesn&rsquo;t help Lucian bully them out of lane. \r\n\r\nOptions \r\n\r\n* re-work Lucian\r\n* buff Lucians early game and nerf the amount of sustain from new rune system that is offered to adc that get a free lane even if they take bad trades \r\n* make a mid game actually exist since hyper adc come online too early \r\n* nerf static shiv dmg on champions. \r\n* riot wants to push crit Lucian then increase his range to actually auto the enemy ADC\r\n\r\nRiot give Lucian his guns back because nerf guns don&rsquo;t do dmg and Lucian&rsquo;s identity isn&rsquo;t to be a hyper adc (riot pushing crit Lucian) but a lane bully who is suppose to be a early to mid game Adc\r\n\r\nLucian lost his wife and riot took everything else he had going for him in life.\r\n\r\n[](http://www.op.gg/champion/lucian/statistics/adc)\r\n[](https://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/platinum/plus/champion/Lucian/ADC/)\r\n\r\nAlso, one more thing to note why didn&rsquo;t riot take the same approach they did to Zoe when nerfing Lucian RIGHT THROUGH THE GARBAGE CAN? Riot updated their Zoe changes and shifted power in her kit from her Q while increasing AP Ratio in W and it&rsquo;s bonus movement speed early game scales the same late game and gave her Passive a higher AP Ratio for 8.4.","replies":[{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2018-02-20T02:44:23.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> suppose to be bully and dominate other adc who scaled for late game which now doesn’t even really exist\n\nI don't think this archetype works in a meta where botlane is forever being determined by other lanes. \n\nEndless ganks and counter-ganks ravaging bot lane after minute 4 matter much more than adc lane match-ups, esp early on.\n\nSupport typically has more early game lane influence than the adc as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2018-02-20T02:32:42.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot just needs to make hyper carries actual hyper carries and give them a shit laning phase.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RenekTonsOfDmg","date":"2018-02-20T01:41:57.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who main top and never ever play bot lane or even ranged champ.\nI have to admit Lucian is so bad Right now that I can feel it myself when I get a Lucian on my team or on the enemy team, cause, in this case, I always lose/win.\nDefinitely true that the buffs he received were incredibly minimal and he deserves more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-20T00:38:54.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least those maverics have the air restrictor removed, right? \n\nBest nerf gun.","replies":[]}]}
