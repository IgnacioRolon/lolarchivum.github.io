The change also means that the GW removal on the ult's potentially unnecessary at this point, since the only thing meaningful it contributes now is that Soraka's ult always heals herself for its max value. Might strip it off at some point as a result if she's looking too strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2015-11-06T20:16:08.529+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"But isn't it a problem if her own sustain, from W passive, is reduce by GW as her heal cost is balanced arround her ability to sustain herself with some good Q.\n\nI kinda understand grevious wound for tanky sustain guy (play a lot of 3v3, sustain tank are near unkillable atm) but the fact she is heath cost/sustain champ who is not a tank can lead her to a really bad spot.\n\nSo, as you are open to remove some of her power if she is strong, is the opposite true too?

Mages have to wait till 40% of the target health is left, but Marksmen get to apply it anytime without any limitation?","replies":[{"poster":"Zok72","date":"2015-11-09T22:51:24.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The difference is in the intended way mages and marksmen interact with other champions (outside of laning where grievous wounds won't usually come up). In general mages are built to burst down their targets while marksmen are built to deal a steady amount of damage until their target is dead. Thus, steady healing has a significant impact on a marksman's success in fighting a target but has a much smaller effect on a mage's success (if you deal %100 of your target's health at one moment, no amount of healing will save them, if you deal it over 10 seconds the amount they heal per second is very significant to the health they have at the end). With this in mind it makes sense for marksmen to apply grievous wounds at full health because if they don't healing will have a very significant effect. On the other hand, mages only need to apply grievous wounds when they have already bursted their target (IE their target is below %40) to prevent their work from being undone. This difference does have some awkward consequences such as making AD assassins (like zed, yasuo, and talon) somewhat better at harass and AP sustained damage carries (like ryze, azir, or kassadin) somewhat worse at dealing sustained damage, but overall the system makes sense.\n\nTLDR: Grievous wounds for mages keeps targets low after a burst combo, Grievous wounds for marksmen keeps targets from regenerating the steady damage they deal.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"L3nggao","date":"2015-11-13T22:32:23.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually feel like her heal's cooldown should go up by 1-2 second, her kit already offers so much already compare to majority of the other support unless Riot is thinking of reworking supports next than buff her all you want.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Penta Penguin","date":"2015-11-08T02:12:44.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can we know more about soraka story pls","replies":[]},{"poster":"Harrada","date":"2015-11-07T06:24:00.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that even if it shuts down only ONE champion, it should be looked into.
