In ARURF, every game is random and it&#039;s up to RNG who gets the cancer on their team, and if you don&#039;t well you have to sit through 30 minutes of getting killed by Fiora doing 2300 true damage in half a second while you play one of the heroes Riot hasn&#039;t given any cc yet. \n\nSeriously playing URF was one of the few fun things left about this game, and even after every new and reworked champ getting 2 years worth of CC for some reason you let the ones without CC get picked in urf. There&#039;s no bans either, nothing, it&#039;s a complete dice roll. Either you accept that you're going to get rolled and have a miserable 20 minutes, or you dodge and hope you get some of the OP champs after a 15 minute queue.","replies":[{"poster":"AmetDeCrypt","date":"2017-08-14T21:04:42.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"urf mode is so fast it starts to crack the game and the spaghetti really comes to bear.\n\nthat's about the only fun part about it, the rest is a festering dungheap of the worst of the community come out for this once a year spectacle.","replies":[]}]}
