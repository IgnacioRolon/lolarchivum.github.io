No fps issues, nothing. Haven't bugsplatted in months. But about an hour ago, I hopped into a game and there just seems to be an fps issue. I tried going into Twisted Treeline, Bot games, but nothing seems to be working. The best way I can describe it is that moving around the map in free-cam mode is choppy. I don't know how to get it to display fps next to my ping like it used to. Not sure if it's the new client or what, but it's driving me nuts and making gameplay unplayable. Any solutions/causes for the problem? I don't think there's an immediate drop in performance in my computer overnight. Atleast, I hope not, and I cant tell if there has been such a drastic one. Can anyone help? The game is essentially unplayable, and my fps just doesnt show up like it did a few patches ago despite me not changing any settings.\r\n\r\nEDIT: No, lowering the graphics options from max to minimum hasn't helped. And, if this is in the wrong section of the boards, I apologize, but my previous post just got removed for being in the wrong section.\r\n\r\nNo other game has the same problem, I launched the game from both clients but the problem persisted, I have made no change to the settings or downloaded any third part program, and my ping is fine as per usual. I can't for the life of me figure out what's wrong, but am desperate to fix it. Can anyone help?","replies":[]}
