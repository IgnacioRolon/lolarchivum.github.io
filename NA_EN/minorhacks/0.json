Is there anything I can do differently? Did my team label me a leaver or the game?\r\n\r\nThank you for any help","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-23T16:22:50.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, it sounds like you were gone from the match for long enough to be marked as a leaver.  The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system will not grant rewards or a win (even if your team won), if you get a leave.  \n\nIf this issue is still happening, stick to customs for now and run some troubleshooting steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to clear up any snags from reaching the game server.  Configuring DNS would be a solid step, but if you're on wifi you'll also want to look into going wired.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-23T16:19:49.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your teammates may have reported you, but the system is fairly good at catching people who leave, disconnect, or connect late. Unfortunately, this happens to many people; being disconnected while still having internet access, and still being unable to reconnect. If you ever get punished for something that you believe was unfair or unjustified, you can always argue your case and have someone review it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BoostedLibrarian","date":"2017-12-23T16:12:40.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well same here to be honest and I just raged over it in my last game which was like 10 minutes ago an decided not to play anymore, it disconnects me, refuses to let me back in be it by black screen instead of champ screen prior to the game starting or just 0 ms and disconnects over and over and over, I have contacted the support team and they told me to try a bunch of stuff and ended in \"talk with your ISP\" even though I have actually heard from many people that they have this bug and seen it in the latest KBTV video, where he even made fun of it by saying \"If you can play it.\" so I doubt it's just my problem and yours...\nThe video \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pPBoN_tsPM\" 00:15 it's the same problem I have and probably the same one you do!","replies":[]}]}
