RiotSupport asked him for information and he provided a ton of it. In fact, it was a insanely long list of screenshots that he had of him and I playing, screenshots of his MyShop, games we were in, details that only he and I would know about his account all in a long list, just to name a few of the many things that he sent back.\r\n\r\nHowever after he sent the email off to support it came back in less than a minute with 'we can't verify it is your account.'\r\n\r\nI'm sorry, but, i've had great interactions with Riot in the past, however this just blows my mind. It seemed to me that the support specialist didn't even look over the material that was sent. There is no way in that amount of time to look over all that he sent that he could have made a decision.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask someone who may be higher up in the chain or someone who has a lot more knowledge to possibly look over this situation and see what they can do. That is all I ask. My friend feels slighted by support, and he feels that they aren't taking him seriously. If there is someone who could help us out, please let us know. All he wants is his account back that was stolen. Or really any clarification at all what is going on.\r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-10T23:33:19.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If someone's account was hacked, screenshots of them playing the game on the account don't help since the hacker could just as easily send those as well.

We gave him some very specific information about the account only he would know. One is to do with messaging. I'm trying not to say too much to give too much away myself (it's in the support ticket he filed) but he and I would message a certain way. He included that. He also included specific times he got specific items pretty much only the account holder would know. He also included dated information that was on the account.\n\nI do appreciate your response and understand where support is coming from. It's just that some of it is VERY specific in that regard that he gave them. I think he is going to try again and see if he can answer those questions again.\n\nThe other thing that kind of took me back is the response in the ticket. He sent it and didn't even have a full minute before he got  a response back. It just seems like no matter what he answered, it wasn't looked over. That is what concerned me and why i'm asking myself. Like I said, he gave specific information. Not just screenshots which is why i'm asking.\n\nAgain,\nthank you. We do appreciate it!","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-01-11T00:34:50.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a Riot support agent (or an employee at all), but I'd like to clarify something:\n\nAny person with access to the account can access purchase history (limited), refund tokens and what they were used on, message history, champion masteries, etc. Specific times he got items can be interpreted in two ways - account content and in game items. If it's in game items, that's actually public info on match history. If it's account content, keep in mind that any hacker could have access to that information just by purchasing some items - \"look I purchased this skin at this time\".\n\nI'd recommend resubmitting a ticket but leave out screenshots or anything they don't ask for. They ask the questions they ask, and they likely don't care what other info you submit. Submit the answers in the format they give, and then wait for a response.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-11T01:07:44.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This pretty much sums it up. Most of the info you were giving is pretty available to anyone who has access to the account, which means we could be talking to the original creator or simply the hacker who currently has access.

There were in game, and post game screenshots. And showed some of the history of us playing, and gave them information only he would know. If they had actually investigated, then they would have seen what he was saying. There is actually 1 very specific thing I suggested he give them to show them it's his account. It's in every game he and I play together because it's something we do.","replies":[]}]}]}
