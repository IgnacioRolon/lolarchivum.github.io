If so, I'd suggest doing a client repair, something may be jumbled in your client. You can do so by: \n\n* Run League of Legends.\n* Click on the '?' button that is located in the top right corner of the window.\n* Click Repair.\n* Wait. The repair function can take anywhere from 5 minutes to over 30 depending on the number of corrupt files it has to repair.\n\nLemme know if you're still having this issue after repairing. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Masked Jhin","date":"2017-02-02T14:04:57.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/EhWqEdi.jpg\n\nSo the recall button is see through and trinket button is blank so its assigned to 1 instead. \n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-02-02T13:56:14.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Screenshot of it?","replies":[{"poster":"Masked Jhin","date":"2017-02-02T13:59:52.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making one now.
