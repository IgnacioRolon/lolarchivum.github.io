For the past few days i have troubles even getting into the client (unexpected error etc.), nothing happening after clicking \"find a game\", blacksreens while in champ select and so on. My internet connection is fine, even got that from my ISP. Yesterday i managed to get into a game, i had package loss the entire game, my ping was stable (around 40) and had 300fps, still it felt like playing at 10 fps. Any ideas what might be the reasoning behind this (did the \"repair\", re-installed lol etc.).","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-24T22:23:28.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know your connection is fine, but it can still have problems reaching specific servers.  These black screens are usually caused by connection issues downloading assets or reaching services.  You'll want to instead go over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot whatever is causing that for the fix.
