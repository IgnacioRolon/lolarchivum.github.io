Email associated with the account is the one I only use for my games so not much can be gotten from it, I just don't wanna have something happen to my account cause of whatever is going on there.\n\nEdit 1: Just did a lolking search of the summoner name and it appears to be a lvl 30 account that hasn't been played in about 7 months, none the less, its something that shouldn't be there and isnt mine....guess I'm gonna have to find a way to just get that entire part of the account deleted","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-23T17:24:27.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and our account team can take a look into this and find out what's going on.
