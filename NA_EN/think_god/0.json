You deal 136 damage.\n\nWhat if Caitlyin had 68 AD and 100% crit? She would also deal 136 damage. Only difference is that she has to invest in crit chance.\n\nCait attacks somebody with the 10% crit damage reduction mastery? Crits deal 190% damage.

Concept could be cool looking but new champs need to be that NEW, not let's take this ability and this one.\n\n\nHere are the skill comparisons:\n\nPassive: Nocturne- not every hit however the concept is very similair\n\nQ: Rend- Kalista, needs to be renamed, Next attack deals bonus damage= Gragas, Riven, Lux, Leona...you get the idea. Very overplayed and lacking creativity (bad when there is 130ish champs out)\n\nW- Renektons Slice and Dice, honestly sounds like the exact same skill.\n\nE- Garen, stop remaking Garen for the love of god.\n\nR- Useless, it is like Zilean's W but with a higher level to learn it and less benefits.\n\n\nOverall I would HIGHLY suggest redoing, nothing seems unique about the champ, nothing seems bad ass or overly impressive, it is just a \"Here have another champ with renamed (in some cases) abilities and a new look....\"","replies":[]}]}
