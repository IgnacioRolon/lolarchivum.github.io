Edge of Night in particular is a strict advantage AD assassins have not only compared to AP assassins, but *against* them as well because of the spellshield and the built-in magic resist.\n\nAP items on the other hand were conceived with mages in mind, so they don't offer the same midway power-spikes, and often have unneeded stats like mana, CDR, and DoT which energy assassins still have to pay for. \n\nAkali can get away with building AD to an extent but not really because most of her damage comes from Q which doesn't scale at all with AD, and now more than ever she can't afford to not be super-efficient with her damage.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-11-02T03:04:46.128+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Edge of Night is as broken as everyone is making it out to be.  It's a 10 second lasting spellshield on a 1.5 second channel delay that is interrupted if they take any damage.\nI don't remember if minion damage breaks the channel.  It might not but prob does.\n\nDuskblade I agree is pretty sweet due to the ward-blocking passive; I think 8 seconds of ward disable is too long though especially with all the ms items stacking.  An AP blackout item would be cool.\n\nMana on an item is never \"good\" for an energy champ, AD or AP, but the item is usually worth without it.  I'd argue CDR is super good on most energy champs ('cept Kat and even then) and if the DoT item you're talking about is Liandry's, it's just in a bad place all-around right now since Void almost always outclasses it.\n--------------------------------\nYo, lemme run something by you that I think is weird, I wanna see what you think:\n\nSo, new Akali E refunds 60% cd for killing a unit, so I thought there'd be an energy refund or something like for other last-hitting tools but it just flat-out costs like 1/4 of her energy pool.  I'm not sure why they shifted some of her power budget there.  Am I missing something that Akali players know but I don't?","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-02T04:24:36.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A 10 second spellshield is a huge thing, it's like you have your own Malz passive for 10 seconds. The channel delay isn't a big deal either because you can still move during it, and the damage taking part only means you can't use it reactively. But as an assassin you're not supposed to be caught out of position/out of guard in the first place, you're the one doing that to others. \n\nAnd take lichbane for instance, which is a good item for AP assassins. You'll want to start it with sheen of course, but if you don't have the 1050 for it yet you'll buy the mana crystal which is 100% useless on energy champions. Yes you could buy another component, but then you're delaying the sheen powerspike. And now think of how much access to armor penetration ADs have right from the early game. Meanwhile APs have to either rush voidstaff (which only provides the intended penetration when completed, unlike armor pen items), the upgraded boots (meaning you can't go mobis, so you'll have a worse roam) and haunting guise/lyandris, which isn't a very good item anyway like you said. Haunting guise is 1600 mind you, more than 2 poaching dirks.\n\nThe E refund thing is just a wave clearing aid so she can push the wave and roam quickly. It doesn't matter that it drains her energy pool because she's not supposed to spam it in combat anyway. It's not a bad thing but I really wish they made her E more useful in combat in the first place. It's one of my beefs with this rework, it's all over the  place. They want to shut down Tankali but then make it so that she has no choice but to go tanky. They give her a totally random dash when she already has 3 and tie it to her only defensive skill. And also make her sustain trigger right when she's most likely to be already at full HP. Nothing in her kit right now has any synergy with anything else.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-11-02T05:14:09.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough, but I'll bet you many will attempt the reactive activation for a while.\n\nSo it's the build-paths then, not the items.  Mmm i'd def buy the amp tome instead and sit on the rest of the gold tbh.  I'd never get the mana crystal X|  next back will have sheen 100% probs then.  Sheen delay isn't that bad, but I see where you're coming from in that they can stack longswords and daggers.\n\nPoaching dirk is actually pretty hard to stack, since you have to invade and poach a camp three separate times.  It has a cd on the poaching.  If the enemy mid has a poaching dirk just ward your raptors and you'll get a free kill once the camp spawns.  With increased jg respawn timers it's even harder to stack.\n\nThat's what I figured, but I wanted to ask anyways.  Yeah E does seem just like \"insert aoe here.\"  Too much for this work-scope, sad day.  At least she's still on the VGU list.^^\n\nOptimal engage would be R-->combo-->W out--->R back in--->combo then yeah?  'cause we need the shroud on the enemies for it to be useful.  I don't wanna walk back to it :3  *Laziness*\n\nC'mon, we both know that the reason for the second auto to be the damage one is to separate good and bad Akali players.

She used to be midgame-lategame but the changes gutted that part of her gameplay.\n\nTriforce has always been good on her. It just usually ended up in a bruiser build, and it became less common after it lost the AP. Do note that she has the best base attack speed in the game, so she benefits quite a bit as a bruiser from the 40% AS. I'm thinking something like gunblade, triforce/duskblade (pick one to get first depending on how the game is going, then get the other), spirit visage, deadman's plate, and a final tank item, heck, maybe titanic hydra to auto proc your passive, but the final item is sort of reliant on how the game's going.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-11-01T14:33:15.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, I don't consider that healthy either.
