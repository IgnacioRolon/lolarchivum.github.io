I feel like she’s really bad for most of the game until she gets level 3 against other level 3’s. \n\nSpeaking of true damage, what *does* need some sort of nerf is actually demons. The recent buff made them do crazy amounts of true damage. Doing 1/2/4 times the amount of mana burnt as true damage is insane considering some units get 150 mana, meaning demons can do up to 600 true damage on an auto while also stopping a spell from going through.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PenthouseMack","date":"2019-07-10T08:09:51.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completely being able to negate crit is absurd and PD most likely needs a nerf.

You raise some good points and I'm sure that item balance and abilities is something that Riot is looking into.\n\nYeah it really is crazy that being able to negate crit is absurd, buuuut\n\nLet me note that sword of the divine is actually rng based. Assuming the fight goes on for the full 30 seconds of a round, there’s a 21.4% chance it will not proc the whole round. Basically it’s a cherry on top item and not really a strong core item, and crits themselves don’t do that much more damage unless you have infinity/you are an assassin with synergy. \n\nI think that rapidfire cannon (or two recurve bows) building into the second best attack speed item while also making attacks undodgeable and giving ranged champions mapwide ranged while removing the intended weakness of melee champions is a liiiittle too much for one item.\n\nSomething that I am a big fan of after thinking on it is changing cursed blade (recurve+negatron) to have this passive instead. And instead of being passively on I think the undodgeable effect should be a debuff that procs off the cursed blade. Cursing them to be vulnerable.","replies":[]}]}]}
