And I feel like this might be a good way to do it. This way, he doesn&#039;t really have control over what stats he gains. So it wouldn&#039;t be utterly ridiculous.\n\nEdit: I have a better idea. What if, instead of gaining a small percentage, he instead gains something like 6-8% of all stats. Instead of automatically gaining said stats, the enemy's corpse becomes interactable for the next 5-15 seconds (based on level or ult level). Kha'zix can interact with each corpse once, channeling for 1-0.5 seconds to gain the stats.\n\nEDIT 2: Make it so he gains a glow similar to that of an elixir, getting more and more intense as he gains more stats.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-12-27T04:07:13.134+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"3% of all of the enemy champion's stats on kill\n\n:\")))))))))))))))))))))))))))))","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2015-12-27T04:47:56.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lane Cancer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kXXydEoa,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-12-27T04:07:13.134+0000)\n>\n> 3% of all of the enemy champion's stats on kill\n> \n> :\")))))))))))))))))))))))))))))\n\nI know it sounds crazy, but it could be toned down.\n\nLet's be honest, he falls down hardcore lategame, so even that might not save him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-12-27T04:29:18.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">After all, Kha'Zix consumes and adapts.

He's adapting, not just mimicking his opponents.\n\nIf we're talking about making him an assassin, he should gain damage based on the target he killed, like gaining added physical damage (notice I didn't say AD) to his abilities if the enemy has lower armor than magic resist. Consequently, if he dies to a target multiple times (like a fed Riven), he passively gains the appropriate resistance to their main damage type (but not health, though). \n\nI'm not sure about ratios, but I think changing his actual *damage* type could be something unique only to him. Some champions have been nerfed for being hard to itemize against, but I think Kha'Zix should be *the* champion you cannot 100% itemize against (without, of course, giving him %hp true damage) because if you stack too much of one thing, he'll adapt.","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2015-12-27T04:51:49.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=tombdragon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kXXydEoa,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-12-27T04:29:18.288+0000)\n>\n> Hm, I don't think he should gain the stats of who he kills, but rather gain what counters them.

Permanently gaining strength because of what should be a failure seems a bit counterintuitive.

And killing gains you stats so you don't just outright fall off when you're fed as hell. \n\nKha'zix's early game is sort of bad, and considering that he is all about getting stronger as he wins fights, I feel like it's fair for his late game to be better than his mid game, and for his mid game to be better than his early game, of course, if he consumes.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tavish","date":"2015-12-27T04:23:22.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this idea, it sounds cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2015-12-27T04:49:23.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KHAm at me bro,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kXXydEoa,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-12-27T04:23:22.288+0000)\n>\n> I like this idea, it sounds cool.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt would make it so that that 20/0 kha'zix doesn't suddenly become useless anymore.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-12-27T04:06:25.568+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Idk man..

How about something as simple as this.  Kha'zix gains bonus stats based on the role of a champion he's killed.  If they were a marksman he gains AD.  If they're a mage his abilities now do bonus magic damage.  If he kills a tank he gains Health.  If he kills a fighter he gains Armor.  If he kills a support he gains MR.  Make the buffs only achieveable once per game per champ and he's golden.  For instance, killing two different fighter champs would give him the armor buff twice, but killing the same top Pantheon 5 times would only get it once... you can only eat the guy and gain his power once, after all.  This would mean Kha would be encouraged to hunt the map and try to kill each enemy champ at least once to gain their buffs AND it would mean his build might slightly hinge on what the enemy team was like.

My goal was to make it so that he doesn't utterly fall off hard, because as he is he sucks before level six, and can't really do well when it reaches 20-25 minutes. Which, considering the idea behind kha'zix, and that a 20/0 Kha'zix being much less useful than a 5/0 riven, doesn't make sense. \n\nMy idea is aimed at making him require killing to gain his way into late game. Considering that he is an evolution based champion, he should be able to be strong late game if he's fed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-12-27T04:10:24.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WAKE ME UP INSIDE\n\n(CAN'T WAKE UP)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fjiordor","date":"2015-12-27T03:56:25.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be good if it would be a percentage of their **base** stats and not permanently but until he kills the next enemy/gets killed.","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2015-12-27T04:10:06.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fjiordor,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kXXydEoa,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-12-27T03:56:25.390+0000)\n>\n> It would be good if it would be a percentage of their **base** stats and not permanently but until he kills the next enemy/gets killed.\n\nWell then he really wouldn't be getting much of a bonus. Just a slight addition to his base stats in the case he gets a kill.\n\nAdding a very small percentage of all the stats of the enemy champion permanently would make it so that it's worthwhile to play extremely aggressively. 2% of 400 AD is 8 AD. Odds are most of your kills will be when champions have 100-200 AD. And the fact that he will be killing a lot of AP champions or supports will mean he's not gonna get much AD. He will basically be picking up some random stats from here and there as a bonus for successfully killing people.\n\nthis will enable him to be slightly stronger by just a little each time he kills a champion. So him being fed is actually eventful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Woodsy2575","date":"2015-12-27T04:03:53.251+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is a fantastic idea","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2015-12-27T04:52:39.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Woodsy2575,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kXXydEoa,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-12-27T04:03:53.251+0000)\n>\n> This is a fantastic idea\n\nI think so too :^)","replies":[]}]}]}
