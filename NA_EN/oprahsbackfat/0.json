It just randomly happens and just doesn't work for a while. I am able to watch Twitch on Source  ,1080P youtube, or play any game with my standard ping during this time but when it comes to League it randomly sucks at connecting.\n\nI dont know what it is, but it gives me a lot of unnecessary leaverbusters/afk check punishments. Also it ALWAYS happens during atleast one of my promo games which gives me an auto loss so I just play normals and no ranked usually.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-10T20:51:17.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since your primarily having issues with League and this has happened in the past, as you've stated, this is likely another issue with your routing to the server. I recommend running a traceroute log so we can take a look at where this issue is happening along your route. I recommend doing this with a network app called [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/). After starting up the program, plug in **104.160.131.1** for the host/focus address then start the trace. After it's run for 5 minutes, export the results as text and paste them here in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues with doing this.","replies":[{"poster":"OprahsBackfat","date":"2016-10-11T05:04:31.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Host                                                         % | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n10.0.0.1 -                                                      0 |  267 |  267 |    2 |    3 |   15 |    4 |\n tx-71-54-120-1.dhcp.embarqhsd.net -      0 |  265 |  265 |   15 |   72 | 1377 |   18 |\nklln-agw1.inet.qwest.net -                          0 |  266 |  266 |   16 |   73 | 1377 |   17 |\natx-edge-05.inet.qwest.net -                      0 |  265 |  265 |   44 |   99 | 1408 |   45 |\n65.124.97.62 -                                            0 |  265 |  265 |   43 |   99 | 1408 |   45 |\n104.160.135.35 -                                        0 |  265 |  265 |   43 |   98 | 1407 |   45 |\n ae32-br02.chi01.riotdirect.net -              0 |  265 |  265 |   57 |  112 | 1426 |   60 |\nae1-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -                  0 |  265 |  265 |   57 |  112 | 1424 |   58 |\n104.160.131.1 -                                          0 |  265 |  265 |   58 |  111 | 1423 |   59 |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is kind of an accurate representation,in a sense, that if I manage to get into a draft/ranked game of any sorts I usually cant do it again for a while. There is nothing going on in my network at this time and my internet is running at the speed I pay for which is more than enough for gaming. \n\nI've experienced the Ranked/Draft afk checker not appearing since the patch Ivern was released and I use to have 45-50 constant ms before the server move to Chicago, I think it was, and now get a block at 65 and cant go any lower since then. Ever since my MS changed from 45/50 to 65 I  have experienced more lag spikes and unreliable connections to league servers day to day. One day I will have 65 ms and play with my friends who have the same connection, rural area with only one ISP, and other days we will all be at a constant 120+ for ONLY league.\n\nBack when we dealing with this - [Forum Post on LoLBoards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/B2VFcQKX-stuck-at-logging-in-after-maintenance?show=flat) -\nI contacted my ISP about it and I spent some money on new hardware, powerline for my computer instead of using wireless, and I got any upgrades that were able to be offered at the time. Granted I now, shockingly, get what I actually pay for it has made no improvement between Centurylink and Riot Servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T20:53:10.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your traceroute show some huge latency spikes along your entire route before you hit the servers.
