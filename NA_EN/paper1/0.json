I made this because my technical issues were being ignored by the player support team, and I wanted to see if I got a response if I put something up that was completely pointless. Sadly, it seems like I can only get good responses like this one if I act completely childish and type in code. I feel sorry for anyone who like me who fails to find help because other people just want to ignore us and pay attention to the people who don't need any help at all. If any rioter is still looking at this, please don't take this as a criticism, especially the player support. I do hope however that you have learnt something from this experience.\n\nP.S I will continue to post my status on the boards about the issues I have been experiencing in hope of a response.
