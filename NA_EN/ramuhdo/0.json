Now, I updated the ticket four days ago, and I updated it a few times throughout to keep Riot Support updated on new developments. I'm completely understanding that, if you're investigating, you might need more than 8 days to respond. Still, I feel it's important I at least weed out developments that aren't important anymore, or add developments that are. (Like how someone was perma-banned and I'm worried every day I might log in to a perma-ban message.)\r\n\r\nI've tried reaching out on Twitter. I even submitted a question to Ask.FM, but predictably that was ignored. I don't blame them there. I tried posting on the forum here before, where a helpful non-Riot informed me the ticket was received and things were being investigated. I submitted a ticket to ask what was being investigated and if I could please get some kind of response (and the response I got was, \"Pls refer to original ticket, kthx\", basically).\r\n\r\nI don't subscribe to a mantra of toxicity. The only messages I'll post in chat are apologies for not doing well, encouragement for team mates to do their hardest, compliments for jobs well done and attempts to calm down situations when people get incredibly upset. In that regard, I like to think I'm a pretty positive person.\r\n\r\nLately, I've been having tremendous difficulty remaining a positive outlook on Riot as a company, if they fail to provide any kind of response to a ticket whatsoever. As a point of feedback, I think you should strive to always inform a player that you're investigating things, so that they don't need to crawl through multiple channels to find out after two weeks that you're actually Doing Things.\r\n\r\nI don't know what else I can do. I really want that ticket replied to. I'm not asking for a lot. I don't even know how it warrants investigation. I outlined that someone publicised their login credentials, and that I used those credentials to log in. I added that I wasn't convinced it was entirely legit, and didn't know of a way to return the account, so I requested Riot Support's assistance. After three weeks, they permanently banned the account in question. I submitted that I was worried whether there might be consequences for me (I worry I might be accused of \"hacking\" the account and stealing the credentials rather than being given them by the owner) and that I'd like clarifications.\r\n\r\nThus far, Riot Support has completely and utterly failed in every aspect of handling the ticket, from informing me that they were doing anything with it to replying to a very simple question that warrants hardly any investigation (the login credentials being posted could be found by simply checking the post history of the account in question on these very boards!). I'm at my {{item:3091}} and I don't know what else I can do.\r\n\r\nI just want my worries put to rest. That's all I'm asking for. Either a straight-up, \"You gon' git banned\" or a \"Don't worry, Summoner! You did nothing wrong!\" would be fine. I don't need detailed explanations of anything. I'm even OK with you foregoing the basic courtesy of telling me you're on the case. That's all fine.\r\n\r\nI just want to be treated like a person and be given a response. I don't know what else I can do to try and get your attention. \r\n\r\nPlease notice me, sempai.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Privately","date":"2015-08-08T07:35:30.542+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ramuhdo,\n\nYou're entirely right. \nThe contingencies in place to prevent requests from going unanswered; they fell through.\nBeyond that, you asked for help all over the place, and it didn't do you any good. \nThat's completely our fault.\n\nI don't have the expertise in this subject to work on your request personally, or to guarantee a specific outcome in your ticket.

Thanks for that. It doesn't look like my ticket was read, however, since they wanted to help me recover a permanently banned account that isn't mine. That's not even close to what I asked about. I admit that's rather aggravating, but I replied with a summary of events so I hope we can work through it.\n\nAgain, thanks for getting someone on the case.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Privately","date":"2015-08-08T14:39:05.441+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We ask those account questions in order to investigate the situation fully. I understand how that can look like we're heading toward account recovery, but I assure you we've been reading your case pretty carefully and want to get you a resolution asap.\n\nIn order to give you the best answer to your question, we will need to know the **server** and **username **this particular summoner name is associated with. Not Ramuhdo, _but the other one_, if you catch my drift. ;) \n\nThe email address linked to the account would also be helpful if you have it, but given these circumstances you probably don't, and that's ok.\n\nI won't be able to check boards as frequently this weekend, but I'll be monitoring your ticket remotely. If you have more questions or need clarification on anything you can direct it to the ticket and Rhojin or myself will follow up with you there. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ramuhdo","date":"2015-08-08T14:52:27.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All right, my bad then.
