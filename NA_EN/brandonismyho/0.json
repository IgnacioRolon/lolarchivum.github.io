They told me:\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear that you had to dodge. There isn't currently an in lobby report system. If you'd really like to see a reporting feature in the pre-game lobby, please share this feedback on the boards. We can't pass feedback reports directly to the development team, but I recommend posting to the Boards because the team is always looking at them to get a feel for things players think could be improved.\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous\"\n\nSo you are allowed to say horrific things to people in draft lobby, because as I'm sure they know (or they wouldn't do it) it is not punishable.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-20T20:56:39.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's iffy, because I've reported somebody once for something said on a lobby that was dodged and what they said was that they would be looking at it.
