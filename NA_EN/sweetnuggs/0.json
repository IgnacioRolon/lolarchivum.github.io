If I were to left click it would just ping. I cannot use any abilities in game as if my keyboard were disabled. When I press ESC the game will then tab me out. I have no idea what happens when this occurs but it requires me to sign in and sign out of windows. When I panic and mash QWER or if I spam an emote this most often happens. However, it does occur randomly at times. If anyone has a solution it would be greatly appreciated, this is incredibly frustrating when I'm in a game especially if it's late game and I cannot use any abilities. It's like having an afk at the most crucial point in the game where one person missing can mean definitive a win or loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T04:01:32.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something might have gone wrong with your configuration files for those hotkeys to stop functioning correctly.
