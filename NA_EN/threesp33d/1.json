Like really I get that trolls and jerks can be frustrating to deal with but there's no reason to stoop down to their level and get punished yourself.

Moderation is hilariously broken and anyone who thinks it does a good job are on drugs.\n\nThere's a difference between playing with the intent to win and playing with the intent to troll and be a jerk. There was [a case like this 4 months ago](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/FrILlWp7-14-day-ban-because-playing-nunu-support-with-smite-is-stealing-other-peoples-roles?comment=00f0) where a player was banned for constantly forcing their way to play on their team and refusing to effectively communicate and adapt to the needs of their teammates. This is a team game after all and not a single-player game, and even [The Summoner's Code](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/summoners-code) (before it got updated) says to \"Enjoy yourself, but not at anyone's expense.\" On today's SC, the most appropriate comparison there is as followed: \n\n>**Play as a team, win as a team!**\n\n>A coordinated team is extremely difficult to take down. No matter how hard you feel like you’re carrying individually, blaming others and refusing to co-operate with teammates gives your opponent an advantage.\n\nBasically to sum it up it's fine to want to try new and wacky things but you have to be respectful of your teams wishes too-this is a multi-player game after all. Yes teammates should be flexible as well, but if they're just not comfortable trying out your idea then maybe you should just suck it up and deal with it instead of causing a scene so-to-speak.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PlsTouchMeGently","date":"2017-07-10T13:21:35.924+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">I'm actually a very good player\n\nLol","replies":[{"poster":"AngryZookeeper12","date":"2017-07-10T15:10:52.384+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"For reference; OP has played ranked for four seasons on this particular account and is sitting at bronze 1 with a barely positive winrate in over 300 games.

I'm a very good jungle. I don't really try to force any style on my teammates and try to play with what my team has. But I get teammates that make no attempt to coordinate, like dumbass Yasuo's who have no interest in objectives or actually winning because they keep diving every enemy they see because they want kills. I lose games because my team literally refuses to group in the mid and late and get picked off over and over until the lead I gave them in laning phase is gone and they are behind because they screwed around.\n\nI gank very frequently. I almost always pick Volibear and tank because most bronze people are too stupid to pick anything but pure damage or champs way beyond their skill level. He can also push lanes easy and take down turrets if no one else will.  I control neutral objectives extremely well, and actually try to peel for my carries and give them good initiations for team fights. The only thing I ask for them to do is not feed early, group when necessary, and help take objectives. Instead I get three games in a row where we throw because my team is too stupid to group for an easy game winning push.\n\n\n Instead, Yasuo screws off to top lane and dies to a 3v1 because he keeps charging into CC without his team with him, mid lux decides to steal their blue and runs into the other two in their jungle without vision and gets insta killed. \nSuddenly it's a 5v3 and the other two idiots abandon the free turret we could take to go to where Yasuo died top and get killed themselves instead of taking a free turret and backing. All thus time, I'm  frantically pinging these morons and begging them to group because we have a huge minion wave pushed and we are so far up there is no way in hell we lose a full 5v5 and we can easily win the game pushing through mid. I'm a godly tank but lose the ensuing 5v1 at nexus turrets but take 2 with me. It doesn't matter because everyone is dead and we lose. \n\nThese people make no attempt to coordinate. They make the same mistake over and over even when people tell them exactly what they are doing wrong. Like the Yasuo who won't stop diving and chasing. And they completely ignore objectives and wander around like dumbasses looking for bad fights.  I'm not even that mechanically skilled, but I'm almost always A or S ranked in the jungle because I don't die much, I get lots of kills and assists and I always look for stuff my team can take. I try to make things as simple as possible for my laners but they aren't trying to win. This is what pisses me off about Bronze. People who play with their head up their ass have no where else to go and they delight in keeping people from escaping. Lots of people get stuck in bronze because they don't have the patience to wade through all the dumbasses and trolls and get stuck down here. \n\nObjectively, I play correctly most of the time and all my choices are geared toward helping my team win. I make mistakes occasionally but they result usually in just me dying once, not like my idiot teammates or the trolls going 1-8 with no CS,damage done, or objectives taken. The 1-8 troll that is still 1v5ing the other team doesn't care and is having more fun than the teammates he won't listen too that are begging him to stop because their lanes are going well and we can still win if he just farms under turret and plays safer. \n\nI might as well just start screwing around and jungling Urgot and Teemo because only 1 out of 5 teams I get gives any shit about trying to play well anyway. And then I can report the other tryhards who flame me because they recognize I just pissed away an easy win, after the 5th time it happened to them that day. They are frustrated because they know they don't belong in Bronze, they are hard carrying, but they have 2 dedicated anti-carries on their team that make everything they try to do pointless because they are either too stupid to watch the map or deliberately trolling because you ganked top first.\n\nThe asshats are having more fun and getting report feedback on someone you provoked is better than getting promoted. Riots reporting for ranked is laughably broken. They think the two deliberate feeding cases they get right are good when 99.9% of them don't get addressed. As long as you don't put shit in chat and you half a brain their is almost no chance you will get caught. The system is garbage and people should stop pretending it's anything but a pile of crap. I bet I could get 100 people punished before I got noticed if I felt like trolling.","replies":[]}]}
