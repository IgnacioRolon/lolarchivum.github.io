I was playing just as normal and 1 guy, quinn was doing awfull on top lane. I told him dont push so i can come but he just continued to push and die. He started flaming me and saying in all chat that i flamed her a lot, which i didnt. He continued to flame me and i just said your 2/17 stfu, i told you not to overextend. He continued to flame and he accidentally pressed shift while typing and typed everything on all chat and everyone reported him. THE SAME GUY IS IN MY NEXT GAME!!! I type at the start of the game that i wont gank in early game a lot, and i ganked top a lot and she didnt help me and still flamed me, i started going to farm. I farmed a lot my score on kha zix was 9/10 i thin and i had more than 200 farm. I started killing enemies and all but he just flamed. I said stfu and let me play you 3 year old. He flamed me more and i kept saying to him to stfu. I was saying thing like STFU you %%%%%%ed 3 year old not my fault you pushed and died on your own but he still flames me. I kill zed and he writes wtf how fast did you burst it and i just said BUM BICH MA Q. Quinn writes hes toxic lets report him and maybe we can get this unsportman get banned. I started having a breakdow and said STOP IT YOU IDIOT LET ME PLAY I DONT CARE WHY YOU FEED NOR DO I CARE ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS LET ME PLAY YOU %%%%%%. Apperentlly that gave me a ban somehow. He trolled mid, fed every lane again and had 20 deaths again. I say stfu and let me play i wont be toxic like you and I muted him. I finished the game and started the queue for third game. I find a match and it says i got a 14-day ban. I never got any chat restrictions, no warning nor other things just got a straght up ban. My school vacation isnt infinite so i will have to go to the dorms soon and i wont play the game at all so pleasse REMOVE THE BAN.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-12-24T19:07:20.967+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, minor nitpick, but a little formatting would go a long way. Creating breaks between paragraphs (hitting enter twice) can make it much easier to digest what it is you're saying - my advice is to create breaks in paragraphs about every third line/sentence.\n\n---\n\nThat out of the way...\n\n> My main account on NA Kaneto Kuruzaki got 14 day ban for litterally almost nothing.\n\nWell, let's take a look at that, shall we?\n\n> ...i just said your 2/17 stfu, i told you not to overextend.\n>\n> I said stfu and let me play you 3 year old. He flamed me more and i kept saying to him to stfu.\n\nFirst of all, you realize that you can literally just mute them, and you won't see a thing they say? Telling them to \"shut the fuck up\" does nothing but exacerbate the situation, and it puts you in just as bad a position as they are for flaming.\n\n> I was saying thing like STFU you **%%%%%%ed** 3 year old not my fault you pushed and died on your own...\n\nAnd this is where you really crossed the line. The bolded word is hate speech, and on top of your general flaming, using hate speech is a surefire way to get yourself banned.\n\n> I started having a breakdow and said STOP IT YOU IDIOT LET ME PLAY I DONT CARE WHY YOU FEED NOR DO I CARE ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS LET ME PLAY YOU %%%%%%.\n\nAnd then there's more flaming, accusations of intentionally feeding, and more hate speech. This is the _opposite_ of \"literally almost nothing\", this is plenty of reason to suspend your account.\n\n> I say stfu and let me play i wont be toxic like you and I muted him.\n\nMuting should've been your _first_ response, not your go-to after flaming and trying (and failing, might I add) to get someone to \"stfu\".\n\n> I find a match and it says i got a 14-day ban. I never got any chat restrictions, no warning nor other things just got a straght up ban.\n\nHate speech (the words that come up in percent signs) merits a 14-day suspension from the gate. You should know better than to use it, and consequently, Riot deems chat restrictions as too light of a punishment for such a severe offense.\n\n> My school vacation isnt infinite so i will have to go to the dorms soon and i wont play the game at all so pleasse REMOVE THE BAN.\n\nSorry to say, but, no. Riot will not remove the ban. If you wanted to play League during your school vacation, you should've played by the rules, and you definitely should've avoided using hate speech. You're in no position to demand that your account be unbanned.\n\nNext time, if someone starts flaming, _mute them, and do not address them, **period.**_ Don't tell them to \"stfu\", don't accuse them of feeding or whatever, _do not even give them the time of day._ To quote EvilDustMan;\n\n> Mute, report. Move on.\n\nAnd bear in mind, with your 14-day suspension, your account is on thin ice. Any misbehavior that gets reported and merits a punishment will result in a permanent ban, so after your 14-day suspension is over, you'll have to be on your best behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-12-25T01:03:03.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh hey .. you became blue.\n\nI figured it was coming soon through the way you talked.\n\nGrats.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-12-25T03:14:49.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.
