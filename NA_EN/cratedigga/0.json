I successfully switched my m2 with m1 buttons to move but some things are off. It's hard to cast certain abilities and when i want to look around the mini map the game moves me into the direction of where I'm looking. Any fixes to easily switch the functions of mouse 1 and mouse 2?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-12T18:58:57.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have a quick guide on how to swap M1 and M2 buttons, but keep in mind that **we don't officially support it.** If you run into issues after making the change, you'll need to revert the changes entirely.\n\n1) Log into the game, then navigate to these files and have them up in an explorer window ready to *delete*.\n\n**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\\input.ini\nC:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\\persistedsettings.json**\n\n2) Start a custom match alone. Once inside the match, go back to the files mentioned previously and delete the persistedsettings.json file. Open up the input.ini file and **delete everything in that file**.\n\n3) Paste these commands **precisely** into the file:\n\n> [GameEvents]\nevtPlayerSelectClick = [Button 2]\nevtPlayerMoveClick = [Button 1]\nevtPlayerAttackMoveClick = [Shift] [Button 1]\nevtPetMoveClick = [Alt] [Button 1]\nevtPetReturn = [Alt] [Button 2]\n[HUDEvents]\nevtOnUIMouse1 = [Button 2]\nevtOnUIMouse2 = [Button 1]\nevtOnUIMouse3 = [Button 3]\nevntHudMoveableSelect = [Button 2]\nevtOrbitCamera = [Ctrl][Button 2]\n\n*Save the file*, close out of the folders and head back into your game to leave it. Now hop into a new custom match to confirm the mouse settings have changed. That's it, you're done!","replies":[]}]}
