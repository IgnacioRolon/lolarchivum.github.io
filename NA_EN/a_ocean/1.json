This often results in an ult going in the opposite direction of where you wanted it to go, which basically means certain death and an ult on CD.\r\nTry this with a normal skillshot, it fires towards your cursor and not towards a point on the map. Only some global skillshots behave like this. Iirc not even Xerath&#039;s ult does. So why does Vel&#039;koz&#039; ult, which is so short it doesn&#039;t even show a range indicator on the map, still use this way of targeting although it&#039;s completely impractical and has no use apart from costing you some games?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-03-25T17:52:11.812+0000","up_votes":49,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, that does look pretty unhelpful, just tried it out in game and results in the occasional 'where's my ult going' if trying to track a target near the minimap.

If your map is champ-centered and you ult, you can't move the camera without adjusting the ult trajectory, and a lot of times I find myself guessing at where champs are going off my screen and trying to hit them with the tip. Even if my camera is off-center, a lot of times I throw down his whole combo in a short amount of time, and re-positioning the camera to accommodate his ult before I cast it is cumbersome, inconvenient, and sometimes impossible.\n\nIf you calibrated the zoom out so that Vel's position on the screen did not change as the zoom happened, then there would be no unintentional input from leaving your mouse in one spot while the screen zoomed out.","replies":[{"poster":"A Ocean","date":"2016-03-26T22:42:51.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To c/p what I wrote in my Reddit thread:\n>No. Just no. Learn to set your camera right. Took me very long to learn and even I (74k points on VK) occasionally screw it up, but a zoom-out would be the worst thing. It would really irritate me while trying to aim, but even if the zoom-out is centered on VK the main problem would be canceling it and kiting with your other spells as quickly as possible WHILE IT ZOOMS IN AGAIN.\n>Jhin's ult is meant to snipe enemies from afar, VK's is often part of a kiting combo while the opponents are trying to get into his face.\n\nHe needs to fluidly weave his ult into his regular spell barrage and often needs to immediately react before, after and even while ulting (cancelling).
