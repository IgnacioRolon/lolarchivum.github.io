So every one has their skill compared to the average player which is what determine if you are above or below average. Changing the starting point to represent iron with no impact on how the curve is built does not make the ladder any better. You just take the % of players who are roughly below the 50 percentile, then make them all into iron. That then sinks the rest of the ladder down. Less in gold less in plat less in diamond etc.   Its like going from KPH to MPH. Kilometers are larger numbers, but you don't change the actual speed of a car off what its measured with.  Your time to arrive is the same regardless of if you use KPH or MPH. If its a 20 min drive its a 20 min drive end of story. \n\nThe probability expectations do not change just because you shifted titles down.  Some one who buys a diamond account Does not magically become A diamond level of skill just because that title is on their account.\n\nThis change helps no one.  The speed that a new account moves on ladder in response to how positive or negative they impact teams is whats going to be important to having less Mismatched games.  If MM looks to protect players in a range as much as possible by trying to account for experience as it builds lobbys is gonna make far more impact on quality because it can be set to try to avoid potential mismatches back to back.

Perhaps we should move away from the MMR system, which measures relative skill difference to an absolute system like the one used by the [ICCUP ladder](https://iccup.com/). That system ranks you from D- to Olympic. It goes D-, D, D+, C- ,C........A-, A, A+, Olympic. You gain and lose points based on the difference of ranks. All new accounts start at the D rank on that ladder. I played a lot of StarCraft on that ladder before SC2 killed it off. That ranking system works a lot better than League's system.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-09-10T17:31:57.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://iccup.com/starcraft/sc_rating_system.html\n\nThis is just a rating system not a MM system thou.\nIts Gains are skewed + Gaps between Divisions disproportionate.\n\nSo you blaze thru lower ranks and feel good because you \"climbed\" half the ladder.  But your gains are 100 points vs a \"D\" Graded player and your losses are 50 vs a \"D\" graded player in D Grade.  So you need to have a 33% wr to be stuck. Anything over 33% = you play enough games you promote to C.\n\nThe C? Same thing. B? Same A? same. \nEdit. A slows down thou. It goes from -50 on a loss to -75.  But 10 out of 14 divisions can be climbed at 50%.\n\nIts not till you get to the Olympic Tier that you don't have higher gains for a win then points lost on a loss.\n\n\nThat's a much lower hard cap on # of games to do it too. Mouse to D+ is 1 - 2999 points. 50% = 50 points per 2 games. 120 games required to advance at 50%.  \n\nAnd you don't want to let any level of skill play and be pulled from the same MM system in league. You don't want to see D- in your B+ games.\n\nSo the high losses to far lower tier players shouldn't ever be a thing because for league having those players in your games is not gonna be positive.\n\nI don't know how you would add Bayesian updating to this system. Not saying its impossible, I just don't know how.\nHow exactly does it balance skill between teams if all that's needed is investing enough # of games = being the same rank as some one whos burning thru the competition?\n\nEnd goal is we want to make better MM. I don't see how Icup would accomplish that better or lend itself as stronger distribution model to be used over probability theory.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2019-09-10T19:06:08.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very nice analysis of ICCUP's system.\n\nHowever, if I'm understanding you correctly, you seemed to be concerned that it may be to easy to climb the ladder because of how forgiving the system when calculating point gains and losses which in turn you seem to suggest would place a lot of players where they don't belong. \n\nIn theory, yes. However, I've played thousands of games under that system back in the day and I assure you, it's no where near as easy as it would seem. Firstly, each player, whether playing 2v2 or the more competitive 1v1 mode, knew before the game starts the ranks of all players in the lobby so they could opt out of matches. So a D- player playing a B+ player wouldn't happen unless both players want it. The joining player could leave or the hosting player could kick. Secondly, like League in season 9, Starcraft is a very unforgiving game. You will NEVER win against a more skilled player and as simple as that rating system was, it was terrifyingly accurate at getting you to your correct rank. It may seem that needing to have above a 33% win-rate to climb is too forgiving but trust me when I tell you, you can get hard stuck very easily. That system was so accurate that if you placed a hard stuck D+ player against a hard stuck D- player, you can be 95% sure that the D+ player would win. In fact, I was hard stuck D and D+ for years and I made it to C- once by playing vs a bunch of D- players. I could do that because I can be 100% sure that a D- player is less skilled than I am and I would win. \n\nUnder League's MMR/ranking system, you can only be that sure if the there is a difference of 4 or 5 tiers which isn't very accurate. If you place a Bronze 1 team vs an Iron 1 team, the Iron 1 team still has a high chance of winning which means it's not very accurate at determining who belongs where. An Iron 1 team should have no chance vs a Bronze 1 team and under a system like ICCUP's rating system, this would be the case. I feel it in my bones, that system would work a lot better in League than what we have currently.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-09-10T20:32:35.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How in-depth of a response do you want? I can grab some graphs and charts if you like seeing visuals. Wont be able to do that till tomorrow thou as I am heading out to work after I post this.\n\nThe issue I have is that the starting point at the bottom makes it very difficult to build a curve that can be used for quality MM and the end goal should be a skill biased ladder not a time based leaderboard. If you cant sink, if you don't have uncertainty. An account with 9000 losses into a mix of wins and losses that resulted in +20 game balance looks exactly the same as a new account that won 20 games back to back. They would get used by MM as equivalent skill, show up in the dame range of \"skill\" Have the same rank.  Meanwhile in MMR that -9000 guy is at the very bottom of the ladder, and a new account with 20 Wins would be 20 games worth of MMR above the starting MMR.\n\nSo it impacts MM a great deal if you don't let folks sink and treat the lower 50% of players as equivalent in skill for MM usage.  Like if one day MM said all players under silver 1 are now treated exactly as the same skill as Silver 1.\n\nNow you do see Iccup sort skill, because skills a real thing. Its naturally occurring. The fundamental idea behind Elo, use naturally occurring averages to find a value to help represent skill expectations. His idea is hard to disagree with, In a game of skill by definition skill matters. Humans are inconsistent, good and bad performances, so use an average for their skill value.\n\nSo Higher skill vs lower skill results in better odds for the more skilled player to win. If this is consistently untrue then the assumption of who was more skilled at the game was wrong, correct their values in response because proof of skill is from results of a game. The more dramatic the gap in skill the more dramatic the impact on WR. Like beating the snot out of your friends in smashbrothers then getting your ass handed to you online.  100 wins vs some one your expected to beat 100% is not impressive.\n\n> Under League's MMR/ranking system, you can only be that sure if the there is a difference of 4 or 5 tiers which isn't very accurate.\n\nNah, we just see titles. They are a distraction. MMR has expectations built from the gap in values that's a consistent set.  Using Arpad Elo's then 1c=200 points. At any place on the ladder a 200 point gap = 756% to 24% odds in the Elo system.\n\n What Riots probability's are or the values they use to represent them are hidden, its why I say seeing the MMR number is pointless . If you don't have the context of what is used to build them and what the system thinks the odds between values are its pointless.  Gaining 50 points in 1 system could be worth 100 in another.  Some chess sites use a higher starting value for Elo to attract players,  Some one whos 1400 on site A is prefers to use site B because they are 1600 and thus feel better.... Yet they are still the same skill at chess.\n\nSo its not just 5 divisions. Its off the points.  equal points = 50% odds, usually with a few points of wiggle room. Then for every % break down you have a point range going from 49% to 51% all the way to 0.01% to 99.9%     So 1300 has the same % expectations to win or lose inverted by the gap.  1100 loses to 1300 the same amount that 1300 is expected to lose to 1500.  The entire thing measures you vs the average of the range your in for MMR. And as it gets smaller sample size as you move away from he center those averages represent less players.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-10T05:23:54.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I, as a past Gold, got placed in Iron IV.
