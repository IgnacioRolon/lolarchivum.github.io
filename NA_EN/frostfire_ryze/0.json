This wasn't because their posts were ok, it was just a mistake by moderation when yours was removed. Normally we'll **Lock** necro'd posts so that nobody else can continue posting, but when your post was removed the mod simply forgot to lock it! The remaining posts didn't belong there either, but it's kind of unnecessary to delete everyone's posts, it just needed to be locked when they realized the mistake.\n\nThere's no penalty against you or anything, just wanted to make sure you understand why we lock necro posts, and that this post was mistakenly overlooked after the deletion.","replies":[{"poster":"Frostfire Ryze","date":"2017-05-29T16:21:19.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deep Terror Nami,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=aMOsj3jf,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-05-15T01:55:31.243+0000)\n>\n> Hey Frostfire, I&#x27;m DTN and I&#x27;m one of the volunteer moderators on the Player Behavior boards with the [Arbiter program](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/opVBd7rZ-introducing-the-arbiters).

I could not but taken it a bit personally that mods must have had something against me - for unknown reason too, because I don't really use forums.

The discussion is often no longer relevant and may have inaccurate information. The best way to have a discussion with the community is to engage in new, active posts, or to create a new one where everyone has a chance to participate.\n\nAlso, it looks like that thread wasn't locked and the others weren't deleted either. I've reached out to the proper people about that, and rest assured it'll be taken care of ^_^!","replies":[]}]}
