It feels like it should work given that they are about 25 other champions who have auto attack enhancers that work on turrets regardless of doing physical or magic damage.  Would making Empower do damage to turrets and subsequently go on cooldown make Jax too good at taking turrets?  I don't think he would be able to push much faster than Camille, and both parts of her Q work on turrets.\r\n\r\nHistorically I remember Jax always being revered as \"the\" turret pushing champion, but with all these abilities and champions in the game now wouldn't it be safe to at least test if his Empower can work on turrets and bring him back into the meta?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-09-11T21:52:27.741+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Jax is already a splitpushing monster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ankoanko19","date":"2018-09-11T21:49:53.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you means as in deal bonus magic dmg?

Trundle and Mundo used to have their AA resets work on turrets, but that was removed to make them a little slower at eating towers.","replies":[{"poster":"Shriez","date":"2018-09-11T22:55:28.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They worked when I tried it in Practice Tool just now.

I think what’s going on is Trundle and Mundo have theirs consumed for no extra damage in order to start their cooldown sooner.  Any extra damage you noted was just from Mundo’s AD steroid attached to the auto reset, and Trundle’s Sheen proc since he typically builds one.  I could be wrong about Trundle - it’s possible I’m remembering incorrectly, and Chomp does apply the damage but doesn’t grant him AD.  As for Jax, Empower is not consumed on turrets.  This means he can still apply it if he Leaps to or autos another target, but he gets fewer resets when whomping down a turret because it has to expire before going on cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"Shriez","date":"2018-09-11T23:31:51.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same thought about Mundo so I tested in Practice tool with no items and no minions.  Mundo basic attack was dealing 7 damage each attack.  First attack after using his AA reset was 9 damage, but every attack afterwards was 10 damage.  Trundle was another 7 damage each attack but 10 damage with Chomp.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sebastit7d","date":"2018-09-12T00:13:02.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me answer your title question with another question: Why should it work on turrets when he's already a split pushing monster?","replies":[{"poster":"Shriez","date":"2018-09-12T00:17:12.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same reason that champions like Trundle, Wukong, Mundo, anybody with an attack enhancer can use it on turrets.
