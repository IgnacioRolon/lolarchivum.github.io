And why? \r\n\r\nStarting this little discussion Id have to say there are a multitude of characters that I like that Riot has made that I love the lore to and those champions are {{champion:18}}{{champion:78}}{{champion:161}}{{champion:92}}{{champion:245}}{{champion:222}}{{champion:254}}{{champion:86}}{{champion:99}}{{champion:103}}{{champion:223}} There are more but id rather not spam character icons on my first Forum post plus this is just to show a few that I personally like.\r\n\r\nWhen I am looking at a champions lore, their skins, when I am fighting a champion out there on the rift and the champion is played really well by another summoner, or  they like (Illaoi) are being released and I read what Riot writes about them and displays their move set I most of the time take an interest into getting to learn about that character. I believe that taking an interest into champions either new or old is what truly makes this game fun and interesting.","replies":[]}
