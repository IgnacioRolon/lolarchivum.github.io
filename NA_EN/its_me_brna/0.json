Often times in both of these match-ups the lane becomes a struggle if they harass you a lot at level 1 and having that push to reach level 2 and keep them under their tower for a little while helps prevent them from bullying you as much.\r\n\r\nWhen I have to leash for a jungler I find that these match-ups can become incredibly difficult as from my perspective my champion is already at a disadvantage laning vs them to begin with. Due to this I really feel frustrated when a jungler comes top-side and wants me to leash his camp for him. The above examples are two champions aren&#039;t even hard counters to Riven. In match-ups where the enemy laner counters it&#039;s even worse of a nightmare as a champion like Olaf or Renekton can zone or punish you very hard at level two and it becomes a little difficult to weasel CS without them beating on you or poking you out of lane.\r\n\r\nThis doesn&#039;t only apply to one single champion either, if a champion reaches level two power spike before you then there&#039;s good odds that they are also going to reach both their level three and their level six power spike before you as well. Often times especially in competitive play these become huge swingers for the game when you see an Alistar combo&#039;d with a high burst ADC come out to lane and instantly hit level two Flashing in Headbutt / Pulverize combo for the First Blood.\r\n\r\nI hope something can be done so that laners can&#039;t or don&#039;t have to leash for junglers. I don&#039;t have many ideas on how this could be worked on however I do think that it would be interesting if jungle mobs were only target-able by champions with Smite for the first five minutes of the game. Having something like this implemented would allow the mobs in the jungle to be nurfed slightly so that not only more champions would be viable in the jungle but also to allow for faster clear of the jungle so that junglers can have more influence with their team which would make up for the lack of a leash early on. Perhaps scaling the jungle mobs up to the time where the jungle mobs would become target-able by all champions.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-05-22T08:38:27.087+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not wanting to?

Basically in any harder match-up where you are forced to leash the jungler you are screwed if you leash and even more screwed if you do not.

Junglers get punished the majority of the time if they cannot get a leash, top lane has no advantage from leashing a jungler and bot lane potentially could have an advantage if they took the small krug which the other side doesn't even have. So yes, you are 100% correct however I feel it would just be more beneficial all around to rework the jungle in some way that prevents laners from even having to deal with the inconsistencies that are present right now in the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Drehirth","date":"2016-05-22T17:16:54.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If i'm jungling I don't ever want to put somebody in an awkward position like that and don't ask for a top leash.

Tank vs tank is less of an issue since there is little kill pressure, and they both should have some waveclear. In match ups likes riven vs Irelia the slightest advantage can snowball out of control. Slow pushing on your opponent is a big deal, and can lead to a lot of missed exp, and ranged cs. I hate it when I leash, and the jungler doesn't gank the over extended lane. I try to warn my jungler that I will lose lane pressure if I leash. Plus Nasus has one of the worst leashes in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Rand0mH3r0X","date":"2016-05-22T23:30:26.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have a jungle who normally starts on your side, you should adjust. The game is about who can outplay who, by whatever means, teamwork, skill, etc. A leash can be as simple as taking two hits-give two hits and leaving. The first wave of minion clear is important in deciding who is level 2 first. You need not worry if you get pushed back into your tower, you have a jungler nearby who will be arriving shortly.\n\nReaching level 2 on mid is a bit more important, especially since the lane requires very quick weaving to succeed, and can always be ganked early before the first recall. So if the jungle is near you, you should give consideration and just leash.
