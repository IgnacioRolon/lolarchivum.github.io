So I checked it out to see if it was true. Turns out it is and I&#039;m thouroughly confused as to the decision making that went into this. Vision is one of the key factors in what decides a game and the people that buy sighstone tend to do so early, As a Support main I shoot for it around 5 minutes. The new system does provide the uprgrade yes, but removing that decision of either getting an item buff that can help out your team or getting an extra ward seems like its narrowing down the role far too much and it can now take far too long to get it, I know personally I&#039;ve had some really bad games where I never got to finish the Relic Shield Quest and if I don&#039;t now I can&#039;t get any vision? Can someone please explain to me why this decision was made and what the thought process was?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-11T23:15:36.988+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It will be nice for mage and tank supports - having a real item early instead of being forced to be a walking ward-deployment tool with no stats, then uselessly behind unless they get fed.","replies":[{"poster":"That 0ne Shot","date":"2018-01-11T23:43:03.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm talking more in terms of, I cant get visions until WAY past the normal time which essentially will make bot lane gank central cause the \"ward bot\" doesn't have items, I feel suppors arent MEANT to do all that much in the early besides set up vision to get the picks along side keeping theyre carries safe, the vision game really determines who the better support is and this is just slowing down that part of the game along with leading to way more snowbally games, I.E. No wards till 10 minutes, enemy laners get ahead cause of some ganks by enemy team, now they have vision and you don't. From there the game snowballs out of control.","replies":[{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2018-01-12T00:03:01.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The current SS active will be given to gold gen items instead of the current quest rewards. The quest will also require a measly 500 gold earned for you to gain the active. The only prerequisite aside from that is upgrading the item from tier 1 to 2.\n\nSupports will be getting wards faster, and at a lower cost.","replies":[{"poster":"That 0ne Shot","date":"2018-01-12T02:22:34.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do have a valid point that it is at a lower cost, though the point of \"faster\" is debatable (see my above point about games snowballing uncontrollably) but that still doesn't address the issue of the fact that they have removed the OPTION of having an extra active OR an extra ward, It removes freedom from the role and feels like an unhealthy change.","replies":[{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2018-01-12T04:18:59.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look, i realize people are worried and likely Red Wards will become more important early, and more supports may well start with them. Aside from that careful warding, timing and game knowledge will do the rest.\n\nBut if you let the enemy botlaners get so far ahead your support cannot hit a measly *500* gold within 8-10 minutes, you pretty much deserve to lose. All you have to do is play safe and farm. If you're so absolutely terrified of the enemy jungle screwing you over, play safe and don't push until the ward active is up. Or have your own jungler stick close just in case, to countergank.\n\nAlternatively you can pay more heed to the enemy jungler's pathing and how they operate, so you have a good idea where he's going to be clearing his jungle at, and then ganking from.\n\nThe only ones this *might* truly hurt are overeager and careless Spellthief's users as they constantly expose themselves to gain gold. Relic shield users can wait for the opportunistic minions too far from it's buddies, and coin users can literally do nothing and still get the damn quest done quickly.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KirotheImmortal","date":"2018-01-11T23:23:03.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JamHXR7F,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-11T23:15:36.988+0000)\n>\n> It will be nice for mage and tank supports - having a real item early instead of being forced to be a walking ward-deployment tool with no stats, then uselessly behind unless they get fed.\n\nNot understanding the tank part.
