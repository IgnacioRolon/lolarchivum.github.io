So i play another game slightly tilted at this i lose that game then i get the \"you have not qualified for a promotion / series failed\" message and i lose another 23 lp. I understand for losing a series you lose lp at the end but why did I lose lp during it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-11T16:38:17.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even while in a series, you gain and lose LP.  You can stay at 100 as you win a series but losing a match can take some LP away like any ranked game.  I did look at your case to see what happened, and it looks like you had a [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging).  Dodging during your series will result in a loss as well as a loss of LP.  It's a bummer that happened, but hopefully that helps clear things up.  Good luck on your next promos!","replies":[]}]}
