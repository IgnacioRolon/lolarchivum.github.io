You know you're playing unranked, right?\r\nGood. Now that we've got that out of the way, I'd just like to apologize to each and every one of you from the bottom of, I hope, the community's collective hearts.\r\nI'm sorry.\r\nI'm sorry you're not good at anything in real life. I am. I can't imagine how much that must suck for you that you take such pride in your accomplishments in normal matches in a video game. I sincerely hope you find something you're good at soon, because a life without meaning like that has gotta be killer.\r\nMay I make some suggestions?\r\nGo outside and throw a football, try skateboarding, maybe ride a bike or go for a swim. If you're not good at any of those, maybe school is your path. If that doesn't work out, you could always just pump yourself full of steroids and lift things up for money.\r\nBut do yourself a favor man, do it soon. \r\n\r\nLove,\r\nEveryone (maybe)","replies":[]}
