Then when Wolf is placed, even in fog, under uncertain conditions it causes huge lag spikes for random people.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don&#039;t know the exact conditions, but after a good 30 minutes into the game every single time Wolf was placed it causes major net lag until Wolf was despawned. Perhaps Wolf&#039;s object is duplicating? Who knows.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-06-09T16:15:51.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess Wolf needed another friend?{{champion:203}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-09T16:07:18.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report! We're currently running some compat tests on this - it's possible it has to do with the wolf duplicating, or the other scenario is it's not playing nice with some set ups. Either way, we're looking into the issue and are hoping to resolve this ASAP. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"CNNfakenews2","date":"2016-05-30T23:02:34.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just noticed in game confirmed by other players in the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keiserr","date":"2016-05-29T05:21:00.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw this on the PBE, guess they never fixed it.
