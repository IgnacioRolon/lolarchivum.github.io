Is there is a difference between a power outage and someone unplugging their computer?  What about a loss of internet vs turning off your router?  The end affects are exactly the same, but there is no way to verify and prove what caused it.  Because of this, we have structured our penalties in a way that scale in harshness with consistency.  We know that frankly, shit happens, and try to accommodate for this.  However, if it happens more and more, the penalties get steeper.\n\nI hope this helps relieve some confusion.  Let me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[]}]}
