For the matter, i actually had the least deaths with my adc between both teams that game, and quite a bunch of kill participation. what is wrong with people when they see something different.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-10-24T21:32:04.263+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, it probably was your fault. AD Ryze is pretty awful (his kit gives nothing to it, his autos are slow).\n\nThe Kat probably took advantage of you being a useless non-threat to shove waves and free roam.\n\nThe reactions are a problem, but playing crap like that just proves them right.","replies":[{"poster":"ScatteredLeaves","date":"2018-10-24T21:42:15.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it wasnt my fault though, i actually had kat pushed in, killed her many times in the early game, and roamed bot a bunch of times, i was not a non-threat, i was one of the biggest threats in my team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SonicAF","date":"2018-10-24T21:29:32.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"it doesn't matter how you performed.

The midlander, top, and jungle are not supposed to be auto attack champs in the current meta... but there’s nothing wrong with being against the meta.\n\nYou, however, seem to have done so with the sole intention of being a jerk to your team.
