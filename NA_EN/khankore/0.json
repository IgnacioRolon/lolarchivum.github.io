I couldn't tell you how many times I've re-installed league but it's well over 20. If anyone's curios this problem has been around since 2013/2014 and riot hasn't even acknowledged it. In all honesty it's probably because there aren't many people with the problem so they don't really care enough to address it. I saw someone said to delete your S_OK file and I'm going to follow up if I keep getting it after this. It's located in Riot games > League of Legends > Projects >  lol_air_client > relases > 0.0.1.217 (This will probably be different depending on when you read this because that's the patch I'm on currently). IMPORTANT: It worked but it's basically just another way of re-installing league without re-installing everything. It's just faster way around the problem rather then fully fixing it, however I'm not sure if it won't work cause I just tried it but it's a start I guess.
