{"poster":"Nazera","date":"2016-09-23T22:24:13.174+0000","title":"S4-G1 Team LF Top, Jungle & Support","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Player Recruitment","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DiGiD (Digital Determination) is a new, serious Ranked 5v5 team that is forming &amp; is in need of Top, Jungle &amp; Support mains.\n\nOur recruitment is focusing on the Silver IV to Gold I range.\n\nTryouts will be at 7pm-3am EST today &amp; tomorrow again if needed. We will communicate to anyone who is selected to tryout, if there isn&#039;t enough time to do so &amp; reschedule. Fill out an app below &amp; if your app, match history, etc looks good, a member of the team will get with you sometime between 7 &amp; 9pm, to let you know, if we can try you out that day, or one of the following days.\n\nFuture practice times would be:\n- Fri &amp; Sat @ 7pm EST to whenever (Only the 1st 3 hours would be mandatory).\n- 1-2 more days a week, at the 7-10pm EST time slot. Days that would work with the majority&#039;s availability.\n\nKey points:\n\n1. ***< < < VERY STRICT ON THIS > > >***  If you often start/join a game less than 45 min before the start time for practices/meetings &amp; are stuck in a game when that time comes, it will come back to bite you. If you are still new, you very well may be replaced on the first offense.\n\n2. Age requirement is 16+. If you are under 18, you must first be sure your family will pose no hindrance, to your ability to practice.\n\n3. You must be able to see yourself being able to travel in the future if things go well after a year, or so. If you never see yourself traveling if the opportunity arrises, then you&#039;d just be wasting everyone&#039;s time, so please don&#039;t apply if you don&#039;t have ambition.\n\n4. Showing a little maturity, or being a good shot-caller are 2 things that can earn you some brownie points during tryouts.\n\n5. Any attempts to add in-game will be ignored, as who we will try out will be a team decision. If you haven&#039;t been communicated to by 10pm, or see a new post the following day, it would be safe to assume the worst. This is in part to avoid applicants being forgotten in the chaos of being bombarded with PMs.\n\n6. Applicants will play &amp; be judged on 2 games, which could be any combination  of Draft Normal, Ranked Dynamic Queue with a  team member, or Solo in Ranked Dynamic Queue. Some may be asked to play a 3rd game. Some games may be spectated, or even recorded to watch applicants more closely.\n\n7. Do not expect a decision the same day.\n\n8. If you've done any boosting recently, don't waste your, or our time, because if we notice it, we'll obviously just report you & ignore your app.\n\n9. Worry more about your current skill level & how you will perform, then about how big your current ranked champ pool is. Champ pool can be broadened later. We'd rather just know that you have talent.\n\nCopy, fill-out &amp; paste the application below into your reply:\n\n**IGN:**\n**Age:**\n**Current Rank:**\n**Previous Rank:** (Last Season)\n**Role 1:** (The open team role you are applying for &amp; will stick to, if accepted.)\n**Role 2:** (2nd role (if any) that you are proficient with in Ranked &amp; would play, if we really needed you to switch to during champ select. &quot;Fill&quot; is an option.)\n**Top 4-7 Champions - Role 1:** (Best to worst.
