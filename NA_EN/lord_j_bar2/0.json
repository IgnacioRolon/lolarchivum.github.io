It turns out my account had been compromised for some time, and that made things confusing for support.  I'll leave my original post below for informative purposes, but if you run into this issue, realize it's probably because someone stole your account and is mucking up your stats!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nI’m encountering a serious roadblock with Riot Support while trying to recover my account.  I last played two and a half years ago, so I assume my account was locked due to inactivity.  I went through the recovery process and tried to recall as many of the details as possible from the long list of items that Riot support requests.  However, my timeline was a bit off because I had started playing the game earlier than I had remembered.  Because of that, some of my initial information was wrong, and Riot Support decided not to give me access to my account after about a week of investigating.  That part I understand completely, and it’s not my complaint.\n\nMy problem began when I submitted a new ticket with my initial mistakes corrected, and I provided more detailed information while discarding some of my guesses.  By the next morning I had received a canned response from a support specialist saying he could not recover my account.  From the quick response time and the content of the response (which is the exact same wording I’ve seen from similar complaints on the forum), it’s obvious there was no further investigation conducted with my newly provided information.  I asked what specific information this support specialist would need, and I added dates to the Paypal transaction numbers I had provided.  I received another quick and canned response.  I continued to try and have a dialogue with the support specialist by asking what information he would need so I knew how to proceed.  Another canned response.  I asked for my ticket to be transferred to another support specialist.  His response was that no one else could help me, and I should consider this matter closed.  I asked again to be transferred.  Canned response.\n\nIf this is the case, then my original LoL account is now permanently closed because a lone customer support specialist will not entertain any inquires about my account even though I am trying to offer additional information.  It’s especially frustrating because I’ve been polite throughout, and I’m trying to have a dialogue with this support specialist to find a solution, but I’ve been completely ignored every step of the way through canned responses and a complete unwillingness provide any assistance whatsoever. I would love to elevate this to someone else, but the Riot ticket system makes that impossible, so here I am.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-09-17T22:03:17.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Lord J Bar,\n\nCan you let me know what your ticket number is?

It is clear that that from the information you provided that something is not right.  It is not necessarily a question about whether the information you provided is correct, but certain information is omitted that throws your ownership of the account into question.\n\nI am going to reach out to the specialist helping you with your request to be more specific about what specific information is not being provided.  You should hopefully get a response soon!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord J Bar2","date":"2014-09-18T02:28:59.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dArtagnan,\n\nThank you so much for your quick assistance!
