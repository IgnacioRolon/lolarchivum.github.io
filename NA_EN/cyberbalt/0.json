Not sure what's causing this -- tested on both old and new client, same result. This has never happened to me before. I tried reconnecting multiple times, with no luck.\r\n\r\nI'm not risking playing more games because I don't want to rack up penalties, and I would really appreciate some help on this. I'm not sure where to start.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-03T22:43:50.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At your side, friend!  It sounds like your network could be going into a dormant state after champion select.  This can happen when an unstable connection is failing to transition over to the game server.  Run through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide and test it in a custom game.  Let me know how it goes!","replies":[{"poster":"CyberBalt","date":"2017-02-04T00:54:47.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I used the hextech repair tool to reinstall League.
