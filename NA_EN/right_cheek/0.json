Even if a leaver returns to the game, it's still a period of time where others were down a player which causes a negative experience for them.  Your best bet would be to resolve whatever is causing you to have ping issues.  I suggest running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) to get an overview for that.
