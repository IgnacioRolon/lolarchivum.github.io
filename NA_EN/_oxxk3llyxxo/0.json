I have tried right clicking on the ROFL replay file and open with League Of Legends and it did not open nor did anything....Please help. \r\n\r\nThis replay is not old as I have just downloaded the replay yesterday. But since I play too many games today, it wasn't in my match history but it is in my documents folder.\r\n\r\nReason why I say \"URGENT\" is because I have heard that each new patch makes the replay unplayable.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-01T19:42:48.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, you'll want to use that file to create highlights.
