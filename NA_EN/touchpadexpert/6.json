I used the website na.op.gg and my hunch was confirmed. Their last 10 matches had all the identifying factors involved. Heal and ghost every single game. Double digit deaths and a creep score below 30 every game. An itemization that includes 6 pairs of boots, a build that consists of nothing but 5 catalyst of the aeons and other spam item builds that are profoundly stupid followed by a game where they buy nothing at all. They are programmed to act like newbie players but when an account reaches level 20+ there should be red flags going up. This has been going on for months now which is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nI've been told \"just report them after game\" and I do just that. Riot you rely on us to do your leg work on finding these things. I am an expert in identifying these bot accounts. I can pick one out just by spending 30 seconds with them in a lobby. And I have 100% accuracy in properly identifying a bot. Its not that hard to figure out when you have a bot in your game. I literally just told you some easy identifying factors already. They auto lock in lobby and say nothing. In game they say the same one word phrases so as to fool Riot's ban squad. \"WTF\" \"Push\" \"Frozen\" &amp; \"GJ\" are the most frequent phrases. They only go up mid lane. They will suicide under turret for no apparent reason.\r\n\r\nThese bot accounts are a plague that is infesting the system. Their presence ensures that new players never make it into the system. Riot you are being sabotaged. You need to step up your game on handling this. At least make a public statement about it. I need to know that you are aware about it. You can tell me \"we cannot divulge how we are handling this situation at this time\" and I won't be upset, but can I at least hear that you are aware of what is going on? Ignoring this issue will lead to more serious and harder to detect issues down the line so its in your best interest and the interest of the community that you publicly announce that it is a problem and then actively do something about it. \r\n\r\nAnd while you're at it allow us to flag a teammate before a game whom we suspect to be a botter. Give us the tools to help us help you.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-06-16T14:35:34.786+0000","up_votes":67,"down_votes":0,"body":"I support this suggestion for another reason.\n\nIf a real human is toxic in the lobby, I have 2 choices: dodge and let him continue while I'm punished, or play a bad game just to report him after the match.
