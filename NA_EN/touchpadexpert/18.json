Picked the \"Average MOBA player\" option. Played bots until I worked up enough IP to buy a 1350 champ. Immediately went into PvP after buying said champ. Carried hard the first game, didn&#039;t even die. Carried 2nd game, died once, took 4 towers from support role. Game 3 I actually get matched against a team full of smurfs on both sides. Won that one too. 4th game get placed against a team full of smurfs but I have some newbie players on my team (Master Yi rushes Phantom Dancer then Ravenous Hyrda and never buys boots until 30 minutes. Buys mobility boots. Game ends at 33:00.). Lost that one. Played 5th game, get placed against a player who claims to be Diamond IV, a bunch of plats and one lonely Gold III player. My team had all silvers. Lost. Game 6, starting to see people from previous games in my games. Won. Game 7 I have only 4 people in my game I haven&#039;t played with before. Won.\n\nWhatever you did here Riot, keep doing it. I made my smurf account to help some friends get into the game and to practice champions in PvP who I am not very good with. I&#039;m not that great but I have a better shot at beating that random ass Diamond ranked player in this game than the Master Yi you gave me from game 4. So whatever system you have in place it seems to be working properly. Can you get it to work quicker than 3 games though?","replies":[]}
