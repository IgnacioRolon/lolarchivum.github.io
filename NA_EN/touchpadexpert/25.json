I tried to submit my response but the \"ok\" button wouldn't let me press it and send in my report. So... here's my response. Technically I did type out I agree, but I put in a clause in there too.\n\nEdit: LeaverBuster activated for me on an AI game where I disconnected along with another teammate (so it's not just me). Upon kicking me out of the game I attempted to reconnect. It never did so I closed out the client and restarted it. Worked perfectly fine after I did that. Finished the game without a problem. Got leaverbuster warning upon completion of my game. Didn't type in \"I agree\" because I cannot promise you that your own servers will never disconnect on me in the future.","replies":[]}
