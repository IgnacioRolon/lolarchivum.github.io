Client works. Messenger works. Pick your champion lobby works. But when I go to start the match (a bot game) all of my teammates images are blacked out if the loading screen loads at all. Then I get bugsplatted. I have tried reloading a dozen times now and all the same result.\r\n\r\nAlso, this would be my 2nd game in a row where I have to leave. Last night I had a power outage. That time was not my fault and neither is this. If you can solve the cause of my issue that would be great. But most importantly can you override leaver buster from activating on me? I am not purposely leaving games. These are issues out of my control and infrequent issues at that. I do NOT want to be penalized for disconnects I did not foresee happening prior to loading my game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-04T17:58:57.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like League is having a particularly difficult time interacting with your hardware, specifically, your graphics card.

Still a plain black screen and some laggy sound effects like an echo of the backing animation and an echo on the announcer saying \"your team has destroyed an inhibitor.\" Maybe that will clarify what is wrong with my bug splats?","replies":[]}]}
