It looks like a black and white swirly version of a yin &amp; yang symbol and showed up very similar to how the champion mastery emote shows up. If it means anything I was playing Zed when this happened. Anyone know the meaning of this? The last time Riot pulled something like this it was the laughing at blue buff/river and that wound up being the laugh of Tahm Kench. Is this Riot&#039;s new hype generating scheme for a new champion?","replies":[]}
