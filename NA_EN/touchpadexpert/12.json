I planted some tomatoes, jalapenos, eggplant and other generic vegetables. The lady next door, who is an avid gardener, saw me outside watering the plants and gave me a sprig of mint to add to my garden. She was very informative on how to properly tend to it and since she&#039;s right next door I can always ask her later on what to do with it, so I am good there. \n\nBesides gum I never really knew what mint would be useful for in a cooking sense. I saw some recipes for a mint jelly you use on lamb (I rarely eat lamb) and some chocolate mint desserts. There really isn't much else out there from what I have seen. So if any of you know how to utilize it in cooking or if you know what mint leaves might actually be useful for outside of cooking please share some knowledge with me. I'd like to get some use out of this thing.","replies":[]}
