Harry is one of two aides on my bus, the other being Ashley. Harry is around 60 years old and Ashley is in her mid 20s. Harry and Ashley do not get along very well. Harry is not very good at his job, and part of it may have to do with his special needs. Harry is really only good at two things in this job: buckling seatbelts and remembering obscure birthdays. I believe Harry may be Autistic or have Aspergers syndrome but because my workplace is really big on confidentiality I do not know for certain. Harry is the veteran aide on my bus and so he has more responsibilities than Ashley does. But when Harry is asleep or too busy telling me how to do my job (I am attributing this to his autistic condition) Ashley has to pick up his slack. So when a student begins crying out loudly on my bus it is Ashley who consoles the student even though it is 100% Harry&#039;s responsibility.\n\nBecause of this Ashley hates Harry and makes many complaints about his behavior. Harry does other things that piss Ashley off like putting his ass in her face when he bends over to buckle a seatbelt. But when told to say excuse me, Harry&#039;s response is &quot;I can&#039;t help it though.&quot; Ashley loses her temper and tells him he can help it and tells him how to buckle the seatbelt without putting his ass in her face and he responds back to this with &quot;But its easier when I do it this way.&quot; Ashley wanted to say something really rude but looked at me and took a deep breath and told him to go sit down.\n\nHarry&#039;s rude behavior doesn&#039;t stop at that. Just today I had Ashley ask me to turn on the heat. I had it on maybe half a minute before getting to a bus stop where Ashley exited the bus to help a student board the bus. Harry yells from the back that he is hot and wants the heat off. Harry still has his raincoat on and there are multiple windows in the back of the bus letting all the hot air out anyway. Ashley gets back on the bus and tells him to take off his coat and that if he wants the heat off he has to close the windows. Harry says everything he can think of so that I turn the heat off and he gets to keep the windows open. He offers his jacket to Ashley, he tells me that he needs the cross breeze (????) so all the windows need to stay open, he tells us he is diabetic (which has nothing to do with body heat retention) and lastly he asks Ashley if she is anemic. Ashley declines his jacket, says she is not anemic and closes all the windows and I turn off the heat and explain to Harry the meaning of compromise. But even if Ashley is anemic he is not allowed to ask her because that is confidential and likewise we cannot ask Harry if he is autistic.\n\nBut my main complaint about the guy happened on Tuesday. On Tuesday I caught him sleeping on the bus yet again while students are on-board. This is an ongoing thing with Harry. Ever since my first week I notice that his head droops down into his chest and he falls asleep while students are on-board. Ashley points it out to me any time she spots it, which is usually every other morning and just before Easter break one of my students blurted out that him and Harry are &quot;nap bros&quot; because they both like to take naps in the back of the bus. Harry&#039;s response to this was to try and laugh it off. But back to this past Tuesday, once I dropped off all my students I decided I can not longer ignore this behavior and told Harry he cannot be asleep on the bus when students are on-board. Harry told me he was not asleep, he was on his phone. Needless to say my company states that the aides are not allowed to be on their phones while children are on board the bus either, so I told him this. His response was &quot;But I can because Johnny is not my responsibility he doesn&#039;t need an aide so I can be on my phone.&quot; Seeing the conversation was going nowhere I told him to go sit back down. Harry is silent for most of the bus ride back to his house except for his meager attempt at small talk where he tries to sell his lie by saying that he has to charge his phone since the battery is low from using it so much lately.\n\nBecause of Ashley&#039;s frequent complaints there was a motion to get Harry yanked off the run entirely. But some higher up person squashed it and we are stuck with him for the remainder of the year. So after reading a brief glimpse into his work ethic and how he responds to criticism, how much of his behaviors are part of his &quot;condition&quot; (again not sure if autistic or not) and how much of it is him just being a lazy asshole?","replies":[]}
