No problem. Took a 5 minute break and played an ARAM game with friends. I had curse voice activated. It immediately started blinking at the load in screen and proceeded to blink (and dim a bit) while in game. So what is the issue that I need to fix? Graphics card? Drivers? Something else? Clue me in on how to stop it from blinking like this.","replies":[{"poster":"TouchpadExpert","date":"2016-11-17T21:50:03.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So this is an ongoing problem for others then?

Which is very weird as it worked perfectly fine before I took a 2 month hiatus from league. I am looking to see if this is a common occurrence with other curse voice users.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TouchpadExpert","date":"2016-10-07T23:51:54.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=BThnFzeN,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-07T23:29:32.610+0000)\n>\n> Your issue sounds strange, and I&#x27;m thinking it might be caused by some other 3rd party program.

I do not even know what the Flux program is about.\n\nXbox game bar may be the cause. I did recently make an update and I did notice an Xbox logo pop up a few times on my task bar. I will fiddle around with this and try it out.\n\nBut first I will update drivers and get that taken care of two. Might as well kill two birds with one stone.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ouroborous HD","date":"2016-11-16T16:09:16.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"definitely isnt curse related.  a friend of mine is also having this issue, as am i, and he uninstalled curse to see if that would work and he is still having the problem occur","replies":[]}]}
