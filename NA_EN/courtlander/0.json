I don&#039;t blow it in people&#039;s faces, I don&#039;t vape where you can&#039;t smoke, and I&#039;m not like a vegan that has to go around telling everyone how much &quot;healthier&quot; it is. (It&#039;s not healthy, it&#039;s just not near as bad as cigarettes). \r\n\r\nWould people still have a problem with someone who vapes like me?  Or is it just some of the snobby people who come off as, &quot;We&#039;re soooo much better than you smokers?&quot;","replies":[]}
