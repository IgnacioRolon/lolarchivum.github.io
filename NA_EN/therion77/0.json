I&#039;ve only been playing League less than a year, but has this ever been something that Riot has considered adding into the game? And how about a Ranked system for people ages 18+? Maybe verify age through credit card purchases? Oh, I know it&#039;ll never happen, but I can always dream. You can't stop me from dreaming. \n\n{{summoner:3}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-09T11:55:50.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really hope they never implement a built in voice chat.
