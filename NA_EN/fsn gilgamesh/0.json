Ever since this update, anytime I begin to play a game my sound all across the computer stutters (on League, Discord, Skype, etc.) and after about 10-15 seconds of this, my computer freezes and I am forced to force shut down. My first game was ranked unfortunately, but since then I've been trying a bunch of different things in custom games, but to no avail. It appears my drivers are all up to date, and League worked perfectly fine last night. Therefore I am convinced it's not a problem with my computer, but not sure if it's a problem with my League or the new Windows update, since I can play any other game with no problems. Is anyone else having any of these problems? Or have any suggestions on how to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T17:48:04.797+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The windows update has caused some issues for a few players, but there are a few factors in general that could be causing you this issue.  As a first step, we've seen that the update to the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) has been causing problems, so disable it and give it another go.  Try it in a custom game mode so you don't have any penalties!  Let me know how that works for you and we'll go from there.","replies":[{"poster":"FSN Gilgamesh","date":"2016-08-19T19:08:22.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah thank you!
