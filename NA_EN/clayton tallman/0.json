Gnar especially.\n{{champion:92}}: Her sword could look pretty damn interesting (if not a little weird) as a light-saber.\n{{champion:86}}: I would actually Suggest him as a Forsaken but Chosen Garen is also pretty badass. GIANT LASER SWORD FOR DA WINS!\n\n**Forsaken**\n{{champion:62}} : Many People have suggested Wukong should be Darth Mal and I agree.\n{{champion:119}} : Someone suggested that {{champion:98}}  should be General Grevious, but naw dawg, Draven just NEEDS an excuse to be included here.\n{{champion:55}} : Though Kat fits that role pretty well too.\nLets play a game of WHO SHOULD BE PALPATINE? Staring {{champion:30}} , {{champion:127}} , {{champion:90}} , {{champion:13}} , {{champion:50}} , {{champion:45}} , {{champion:112}} , {{champion:8}} , {{champion:83}} , and {{champion:26}}!\nAssuming {{champion:112}} doesn&#039;t win, he can always compete with {{champion:38}}  for the consolation prize as Darth Vader.\n{{champion:114}}: Hylia feels that Fiora would look awesome as a Forsaken with some proper alternate particles.\n{{champion:161}}: How much cooler would the Deathstar have been if it had tentacles? And his death animation would of course be this: https://youtu.be/DOFgFAcGHQc?t=3m33s\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n{{champion:20}} : Little Hon Solo atop his buddy Chewie, blaster in hand and always the first to shoot (So he says).\n{{champion:61}} : 0-RNA and her companion B4-L1.\n{{champion:105}}, {{champion:35}}, or {{champion:29}}: Jarjar Binks? ... Maybe? ... You're right Jungleboy16, {{champion:48}} ain't NEARLY that annoying to fight.\n{{champion:17}}: Ewoks and Teemo, two of the worlds most despised fuzzy jungle dwellers all in one skin.\n{{champion:107}} or {{champion:106}} : There&#039;s no rule saying they&#039;re can&#039;t be THREE Wookies... nah, that&#039;s a stupid idea.\n{{champion:42}} : STAR FIGHTER!\n{{champion:222}} : Could make a pretty sweet Storm Trooper.\n{{champion:79}} : Gragas the Hutt.\n{{champion:51}} or {{champion:104}}: As Bobba Fett.\n{{champion:236}} or  {{champion:21}} : Cad bane?\n{{champion:14}} or {{champion:6}}: These guys can both evoke an AT-AT unit for two different reasons.\n\n\n\n\nGapybo (EUW) - about 9 hours ago\n\nYou are missing the point. Chosen and forsaken are not supposed to directly relate to SW characters. They are just inspired by themes: light/dark, jedi/sith.\n\nOh no, I quite understand that. It's just boring to list characters that would look good in Dark/Light colors. And who would have neat looking light weapons. Besides, it's less me wanting direct references to those specific SW characters and more me wanting to take design queues from them.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Gapybo","date":"2015-05-06T19:55:24.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are  missing the point.
