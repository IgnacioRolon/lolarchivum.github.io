At the same time, there's the NA complex that says the region sucks and can't compete on the world stage. Both are not quite true, but it's still in everyone's mind, including the players. Wolf said in multiple interview that they expected to go 6-0 in groups, that their performance had not been up to their expectations and standard despite going 5-1 and winning a game that was, by most anyone's standards, a sure loss against EDG.\nMeanwhile you have NA teams who have a hard time playing proactively because they feel/think that they're always a step behind their opponent. So they play reactively and hardly ever push the tempo of the game, just waiting for more mistakes from the enemy and playing passive otherwise.\n\ntldr: LCK plays to win and are certain they will, NA plays not to lose and aren't too sure if they can even do that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2017-10-16T18:58:53.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought i was aggressive putting C9 in semi finals with an upset win over WE.\n\nSSG could best LZ as Korea was a fairly competitive region this year,  but Longzhu is definitely the favorite. C9 should have a near 0 chance at winning that semifinal. If it's SSG they might have a non-zero chance but it's still quite low. \n\nIf they make the final,  SKT or RNG should both destroy them. There's no way fnatic or misfits makes the final...\n\nBasically i give C9 maybe 10% to beat WE.\nI give SSG maybe 25% to beat LZ, and C9 maybe 10% to beat SSG, 0 to beat Longzhu. \nI give fnatic and misfits near 0 to make the final,  and C9 near 0 to beat the other two potential finalists. I actually put RNG to beat SKT based on current play (even though SKT is almost certain to show up bigger in knockout rounds) but i don't see C9 standing a chance there even if they somehow beat SSG in semis. \n\nSo around 0.25% chance at C9 making finals. Maybe 1 in a billion that they win it all.","replies":[{"poster":"Gen Nakazora","date":"2017-10-16T23:06:58.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, that is higher than some may expect.  That is only 1 in 400 chance.  lol  But, I'm also a person that doesn't believe in 0% chances with things like this.  Sure, the odds are VERY low for Misfits or Fnatic to make it far, but sometimes it just takes one slip up.  So... 1 in 10,000 might be fair.  lol  That extra .01% is just to account for human error. : P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mazariamonti","date":"2017-10-16T18:52:39.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I'm going all in, try to stop me. \n\nhttp://pickem.lolesports.com/share/series/4/user/555574/my-picks\n\nC9, takin that final against RNG. \n\nSeriously though I think this scenario only has like a 1/100, chance and that's pushing it. \n\nWhat I really think will happen is RNG plays against and probably loses in five games to Longzhu. It will be very, very sad.","replies":[]}]}
