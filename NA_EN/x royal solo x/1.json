Why do you think mobility creep happened, OP?\n\nAll-skillshot design works in games like Battlerite because it has no gameplay aspects outside of teamfights (no laning, items, roaming etc whatsoever), and because mobility is also nowhere as spammed in that game as it is in League.

If you invited someone to play league, who would you tell them to pick up first Annie or Zoe? They're part of the game that fills a niche purpose, and while in the past riot relied too heavily on them, I feel the games at a good balance between PaC and SS.","replies":[]},{"poster":"datfatguy","date":"2018-02-11T05:41:09.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really just the point-click heavy cc abilities that are the problems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2018-02-11T04:07:49.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's wrong with the melee range ones?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-11T03:47:29.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe not *all* of them, but a lot do need to go..\n\nRiot is doing this, it just takes time due to the large balance considerations plus required kit reworks.","replies":[]}]}
