I reinstalled the game hoping it would help, but it didn't.\n\nMinions disappear, so do abilities. Other times the turrets disappear or there are holes in the map. One time the re spawn timers disappeared.\n\nIs there anything I can do on my end to fix it?\n\nIf not is this a known bug and being worked on?\n\nI'm on a 2012 Mac and using the latest version of High Sierra OS.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-17T03:52:05.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm if you're missing complete champion models and sometimes the map has holes in it, some of those game files might be missing or corrupted somehow. Try running a quick repair through the game client and test it in a custom or practice game. Let me know if that doesn't help though!","replies":[{"poster":"x Royal Solo x","date":"2017-11-17T04:31:24.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems to have fixed it, thanks for the help!","replies":[]},{"poster":"x Royal Solo x","date":"2017-11-17T04:03:29.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok cool, ill give it a shot, thx.","replies":[]}]}]}
