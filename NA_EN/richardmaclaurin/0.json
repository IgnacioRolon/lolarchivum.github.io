Was doing pretty well with it too, breezed through placements, 8-3 overall, account elo seems to be in low plat.\n\nI'm playing my 12th ranked game, and bot lane isn't going so well.  ADC dies to a level 2 all-in while he's still level 1, then a jungle gank goes bad, and there's not much we can do in lane afterward.  It happens, cant win em all.\n\nTeam is EXTREMELY toxic.  ADC is raging and me and jungle, our jungler seems chat restricted, but with the few messages he gets he's raging at me and ADC, top lane is raging in general.\n\nAs game progresses, top laner and jungler decide to focus their rage on me.  Both say that playing Maokai support is trolling and reportable.  But Mao support is pretty legit-- E does crazy damage without any items, all four abilities are crowd control, and again, at this point I'm 8-3 with it.  I wouldn't be playing it in ranked unless I thought it was something I would win with.\n\nI wasn't toxic in chat even as ADC and top spewed rage, and I never inted or AFK'd.  But after the game, they still insist that playing Maokai support is inherently reportable.\n\nI shrug it off, go into my next game, and it turns our they're right, and I'm chat restricted.\n\nI get the chat logs, and it's only that game.  Nothing else, no second game, just four angry teammates who decided that Maokai support was a troll pick and reported because of it.\n\nIs this the way it is?  Pick something even slightly off-meta and you can get banned?  Because if that's the policy these days then I'm happy to go play other games.  I'd really like to have a Riot member weigh in on this.\n\nEDIT: Chat Logs, since everyone wants them.\n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nRichardMaclaurin: nid mid, what is this 2012 &lt;--- this is all chat to enemy Nidalee\nRichardMaclaurin: we get ocean I think we win lane\nRichardMaclaurin: I thought ekko was a lot closer\nRichardMaclaurin: come to think of it, where was ekko\nRichardMaclaurin: I'm pretty sure ekko screwed us on the gank\nRichardMaclaurin: we engaged and he sat in river bush\nRichardMaclaurin: why me\nRichardMaclaurin: lol\nRichardMaclaurin: you the one getting hooked\nRichardMaclaurin: nothing?\nRichardMaclaurin: I poked off half of both their health\nRichardMaclaurin: you're the one who wasn't keeping track of the xp\nRichardMaclaurin: you didnt keep track of xp, let them hit level 2 first, then got hooked off the level 2\nRichardMaclaurin: then you got hooked a second time after you came back into lane\nRichardMaclaurin: you were 0-2 before I died once\nRichardMaclaurin: ?\nRichardMaclaurin: why you crying about me being level 5 rofl\nRichardMaclaurin: ez, watch replay, you dying level 1 was entirely you\nRichardMaclaurin: ez\nRichardMaclaurin: how am I gonna save you\nRichardMaclaurin: I literally poked off half their health before they all-inned you\nRichardMaclaurin: you just werent watching xp\nRichardMaclaurin: second time I died was ekko botching the gank\nRichardMaclaurin: he kept sitting in bush while we 2v2'd\nRichardMaclaurin: you're 0-5-0 and blaming other people\nRichardMaclaurin: goin for tower\nRichardMaclaurin: get us some gold\nRichardMaclaurin: how is taking tower giving up\nRichardMaclaurin: hey malz whatcha doing\nRichardMaclaurin: they taking inhib\nRichardMaclaurin: why you giving up\nRichardMaclaurin: malz dont give up\nRichardMaclaurin: ekko go tank pls\nRichardMaclaurin: how am I trolling\nRichardMaclaurin: that aint trolling\nRichardMaclaurin: how so\nRichardMaclaurin: I got to this elo playing AP Mao support\nRichardMaclaurin: it's OP\nRichardMaclaurin: and you?\nRichardMaclaurin: I mean, yeah, I admit to smurfing with something off meta\nRichardMaclaurin: but if you're here with me\nRichardMaclaurin: and you're playing actual builds\nRichardMaclaurin: then\nRichardMaclaurin: I'm better than you in raw skill, right?\nRichardMaclaurin: yeah, ez fed\nRichardMaclaurin: then jungle botched a gank and they been snowballing since\nRichardMaclaurin: what is he doing, he's the reason bot got stomped lol\nRichardMaclaurin: again, he was 0-2 when I was 0-0\nRichardMaclaurin: nah\nRichardMaclaurin: good luck with that\nRichardMaclaurin: riot aint gonna ban a man for playing AP mao support\nRichardMaclaurin: I've gotten 8 accounts to plat with it rofl\nRichardMaclaurin: watch the vod\nRichardMaclaurin: ez doesnt pay attention to the xp\nRichardMaclaurin: they get level 2 before him\nRichardMaclaurin: they all-in him\nRichardMaclaurin: it's how every booster wins their games-- kids who dont watch out for level 2\nRichardMaclaurin: why blame me\nRichardMaclaurin: I was only one at baron rofl\nRichardMaclaurin: I love the logic\nRichardMaclaurin: jungle blames me for not stealing baron\nRichardMaclaurin: still crying rofl\nRichardMaclaurin: jungler, we saw them start baron\nRichardMaclaurin: and you blame me when they take it and you're still derping around\nRichardMaclaurin: gg\nPost-Game\nRichardMaclaurin: man, what a toxic team\nRichardMaclaurin: renek claims that\nRichardMaclaurin: but he doesnt really know what he's talking about\nRichardMaclaurin: renek most toxic one of all\nRichardMaclaurin: no one gave up\nRichardMaclaurin: he just salty boy\nRichardMaclaurin: report ez though, stuff he said will be picked up by chat filter\nRichardMaclaurin: and your report score will go up\nRichardMaclaurin: renek avoided any of the no-no words, so reporting him probably wont do anything\n","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-09-22T09:02:41.324+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"You did not get punished for playing Maokai Support.

Gameplay offenses (trolling, intentional feeding, etc.) are punished with a 14-day suspension for the first confirmed offense. Since you got a Chat Restriction, that should be your biggest indication that it was not for your Support pick - regardless of what your teammates said they reported you for.\n\n---\n\nAs for your chat logs themselves, here's what I can point out;\n\n> RichardMaclaurin: I'm pretty sure ekko screwed us on the gank\n> RichardMaclaurin: we engaged and he sat in river bush\n\nMinor negativity, a little bit of blaming, but nothing much,\n\n> RichardMaclaurin: why me\nRichardMaclaurin: lol\nRichardMaclaurin: you the one getting hooked\nRichardMaclaurin: nothing?\nRichardMaclaurin: I poked off half of both their health\nRichardMaclaurin: you're the one who wasn't keeping track of the xp\nRichardMaclaurin: you didnt keep track of xp, let them hit level 2 first, then got hooked off the level 2\nRichardMaclaurin: then you got hooked a second time after you came back into lane\nRichardMaclaurin: you were 0-2 before I died once\nRichardMaclaurin: ?\nRichardMaclaurin: why you crying about me being level 5 rofl\nRichardMaclaurin: ez, watch replay, you dying level 1 was entirely you\nRichardMaclaurin: ez\nRichardMaclaurin: how am I gonna save you\nRichardMaclaurin: I literally poked off half their health before they all-inned you\nRichardMaclaurin: you just werent watching xp\nRichardMaclaurin: second time I died was ekko botching the gank\nRichardMaclaurin: he kept sitting in bush while we 2v2'd\nRichardMaclaurin: you're 0-5-0 and blaming other people\n\nThen immediately following, a fairly lengthy stretch of detrimental arguments. If your bottom laner is raging at you, you shouldn't respond to them - just mute them, report them, and move on.\n\nIt definitely doesn't help that the argument basically continued the blame-game, which almost certainly aggravated the situation.\n\n> RichardMaclaurin: how am I trolling\nRichardMaclaurin: that aint trolling\nRichardMaclaurin: how so\nRichardMaclaurin: I got to this elo playing AP Mao support\nRichardMaclaurin: it's OP\nRichardMaclaurin: and you?\nRichardMaclaurin: I mean, yeah, I admit to smurfing with something off meta\nRichardMaclaurin: but if you're here with me\nRichardMaclaurin: and you're playing actual builds\nRichardMaclaurin: then\nRichardMaclaurin: I'm better than you in raw skill, right?\nRichardMaclaurin: yeah, ez fed\nRichardMaclaurin: then jungle botched a gank and they been snowballing since\nRichardMaclaurin: what is he doing, he's the reason bot got stomped lol\nRichardMaclaurin: again, he was 0-2 when I was 0-0\n\nMore detrimental arguing, with a side of boasting as well as blaming. Again, if people are harassing you, flaming you, blaming you, or otherwise getting on your case, you should just mute them, report them, and don't bother trying to talk to them.\n\n> RichardMaclaurin: ez doesnt pay attention to the xp\nRichardMaclaurin: they get level 2 before him\nRichardMaclaurin: they all-in him\nRichardMaclaurin: it's how every booster wins their games-- kids who dont watch out for level 2\nRichardMaclaurin: why blame me\nRichardMaclaurin: I was only one at baron rofl\nRichardMaclaurin: I love the logic\nRichardMaclaurin: jungle blames me for not stealing baron\nRichardMaclaurin: still crying rofl\nRichardMaclaurin: jungler, we saw them start baron\nRichardMaclaurin: and you blame me when they take it and you're still derping around\n\nAnd further arguing with a side of harassment. There's zero benefit to continually harping on Ezreal not noticing the early level difference. You wouldn't like if you slipped up once and spent the rest of the game being given hell over that _one_ mistake, so why do it to someone else, even if they flamed you?\n\n> RichardMaclaurin: man, what a toxic team\nRichardMaclaurin: renek claims that\nRichardMaclaurin: but he doesnt really know what he's talking about\nRichardMaclaurin: renek most toxic one of all\nRichardMaclaurin: no one gave up\nRichardMaclaurin: he just salty boy\nRichardMaclaurin: report ez though, stuff he said will be picked up by chat filter\nRichardMaclaurin: and your report score will go up\nRichardMaclaurin: renek avoided any of the no-no words, so reporting him probably wont do anything\n\nThe negativity continued well into post-game chat, calling your teammates toxic and rallying to report Ezreal. Report rallying is harassment; you do not need to tell other people to report someone. If they break the rules and misbehave, your report will be enough.\n\nThe IFS only checks to see if any number of reports greater than zero has been filed - so it doesn't matter if only one person reports or if all nine players report someone, the outcome is still the same. All reports do is trigger a review, and they have no impact on whether or not the player gets punished.\n\nAdditionally, there are some misconceptions about how the report system works.\n\n> RichardMaclaurin: report ez though, stuff he said will be picked up by chat filter\n> RichardMaclaurin: and your report score will go up\n\nThere's no such thing as a report score. It doesn't matter if you report accurately or inaccurately, your reports do not gain or lose weight - because, as stated above, reports only trigger a review. The outcome of the review isn't affected in any way by the reports.\n\n> RichardMaclaurin: report ez though, stuff he said will be picked up by chat filter\n>\n> RichardMaclaurin: renek avoided any of the no-no words, so reporting him probably wont do anything\n\nThe IFS also does not strictly look for certain words to punish. It punishes for behavior that breaks the [Code of Conduct](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse#code-conduct) and the [Summoner's Code](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/summoners-code).\n\nYou don't need to say any set-specific words to get punished. There are a scant few that _will_ result in punishment, but overall, it's your behavior that the IFS looks at, not whether or not you said a specific word.\n\nAll told, your behavior in the match is needlessly argumentative, and you focus too much on other people's mistakes and behavior rather than your own. My advice is this; next time someone starts flaming you, _mute them_ in-game, and do not say a word to, at, or about them. Don't even give them the time of day. In the post-game lobby, _report them_; continue to not address them in any way, shape, or form. And while you're in game, _focus on your own play and performance instead of other people's._ You kept harping on the Ezreal not watching XP _once_, and I don't think at any point doing so improved your own gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"RichardMaclaurin","date":"2019-09-22T19:00:11.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Some questions:\n\n1) If ADC says \"You're fucking useless support trash.\"\n\nThen ANYTHING you respond with can be interpreted as \"detrimental arguing\" by the chat filter and is reportable/punishable?\n\nAnd if that's so, then it's also true that if ADC says \"I am a jelly donut\" and you respond with anything, the chat filter can detect it as \"detrimental arguing\" and you get punished if you get reported?\n\nThat seems really silly to me, and kinda defeats the point of staying chat un-restricted.  Your entire advice is \"don't talk.\"  If I'm not talking, I might as well be chat restricted, no?\n\n2) It's clear from a lot of your points that you lack the context behind the chat (saying I'm \"harping\" on something that is being brought up by other players, etc)  For example, at one point you say: \"You wouldn't like if you slipped up once and spent the rest of the game being given hell over that one mistake, so why do it to someone else, even if they flamed you?\"  But the context is Ezreal bringing up the subject.  There's no harping, and he isn't being \"given hell\" over anything-- I'm treating him exactly as I should be treated.\n\nI take it that the chat bot doesn't care about context either?\n\n3)  You're telling me that 1 report carries as much weight as 9?

Just tell them that you're doing your best.\n\nThere are other things, but that's just the best example.\n\n> And if that's so, then it's also true that if ADC says \"I am a jelly donut\" and you respond with anything, the chat filter can detect it as \"detrimental arguing\" and you get punished if you get reported?\n\nWell, let's put it this way. You will probably at least agree that you did argue over Ezreal's death(s). They called you useless trash, and you started insisting that their deaths were strictly their fault, that they got hooked, that they didn't pay attention to XP differences - and, that's fair, as long as you're not going HAM about it, you can generally point out how the trade/skirmish went down without much worry for issue.\n\nBut, there were a couple things that made it detrimental;\n\nFirstly, blaming. It's one thing to point out \"they hit two first and you got hooked\", but you weren't just pointing out - your phrasing came to be more blaming and accusatory. \"_you_ died because _you_ didn't pay attention and _you_ got hooked.\"\n\nSecond, reiteration. In general, if you're going to point something out, you need only do it once and move on. There's no benefit to trying to hammer in that one point over and over - and there is a point where it goes from excessive fixation to harassment.\n\nAnd thirdly, mocking/aggravating remarks. Specifically; \"why are you crying about me being level 5\", and \"you're 0-5-0 and blaming other people\". Those statements really only serve to attack and insult the other person, which definitely lends into making it a detrimental argument.\n\n> That seems really silly to me, and kinda defeats the point of staying chat un-restricted. Your entire advice is \"don't talk.\" If I'm not talking, I might as well be chat restricted, no?\n\nMy advice is \"don't try to talk to people who are already flaming you\". If they're flaming you, then the grand majority of the time, they're going to be irrational. They've already decided that they hate you and want to spew vitriol in your direction, and they'll more than likely take any attempt to talk them down or out of it as a challenge or an insult or a combination, and you'll just give them more reason to hate you and spew vitriol.\n\nOnce someone starts flaming, that's when communication breaks down. They clearly don't have anything beneficial to the game or constructive to say, so the best way to handle them is to mute them, report them, and move on.\n\nAnother thing to think about in regards to not talking is to remember the golden rule; \"_If you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything at all._\"\n\nYou're still perfectly allowed to talk and converse with other players, but you do have to bear your composure in mind.\n\n> 2) It's clear from a lot of your points that you lack the context behind the chat...\n>\n> ...\n>\n> I take it that the chat bot doesn't care about context either?\n\nI do generally err on ignoring extraneous context, largely because while it does inform the actions, it does not justify them. Although in this case, I did take into account that you were harassed basically on all sides. While I do understand the nature of the situation, though, I still reviewed your logs as they were.\n\nAnd, yes; the IFS does not take context into account. Your behavior is reviewed in isolation, and consequently you're only punished for what you say or do.\n\n> There's no harping, and he isn't being \"given hell\" over anything-- I'm treating him exactly as I should be treated.\n\nI would disagree about there not being harping. I see around six lines bringing up Ezreal having not watched for the level difference and getting all-inned, or otherwise bringing up him being 0-2 before you had died once. In the context of a full match and across the given chat log, it's certainly sparse, but it's still excessive.\n\nAnd as for you treating Ezreal like you should be treated, I disagree. I also don't imagine that you would like being blamed and accused of feeding the enemy, and in fact there are a few lines in there that suggest that that's the case, so I disagree that you were treating Ezreal the same way as you should be treated, or how you believe you should be treated.\n\n> 3) You're telling me that 1 report carries as much weight as 9?\n\nThis is correct. I can grab a link to Riot Tantram's quote if need be, but basically, the snippet of code he shared of the report system reads as follows;\n\n> if reports > 0:\n> review()\n\nSo, the IFS only needs at least one report to trigger the review() function, and any further reports against the same player in the match won't really do anything. While the reports variable will change, the outcome will still be the same; 1-9 resolve to True and trigger the review() function, while 0 (indicating no reports) resolves to False, and the review() function isn't called.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that there isn't any variables passed in the review() function call. If more reports had greater weight, for example, it would be something like review(reports).\n\n> And that effectively the system does not look for hate speech or insults, but will punish purely off of the volume of chat?\n\nThis is incorrect. The IFS _does_ very likely use a keyword search for hate speech cases (since it's pretty reliably easy to pass certain words/phrases through a filter and have the system punish if it finds them), the majority of behavioral cases are reviewed by a machine learning system.\n\nAnd, to my knowledge, the length/volume of a person's chat log has no real bearing on whether or not they get punished. I've seen plenty of people with lengthy chat logs and plenty of people with short chat logs; the only consistent thing is that those players misbehaved, showed poor sportsmanship, or otherwise broke the rules.\n\nSo it's probably safe to say that the IFS values quality over quantity.\n\n> And that I can report all nine players, every game, and the system will do a review every time?\n\nYes. The outcome of those reviews will be determined by the individual behavior of each reviewed player, but essentially, yes. You can report all nine players, every game, and the IFS will review all nine players to see whether or not they broke the rules.\n\n> I mean, if I understand you correctly, then I conclude the following:\n> \n> There's no benefit to remaining chat un-restricted, since talking + 1 report = punishment anyway\n\nThis much you misunderstand me on. Talking in and of itself isn't punishable - it's misbehavior in talking that results in a punishment, should you be reported for it.\n\nIt'd probably be a good idea to look through the Code of Conduct and Summoner's Code as I linked above, as those have the broad-strokes rules and behavioral standards that Riot sets for the community to follow. Other than that, though, it could also pay to more critically observe your chat logs with external comments (like my own) in-mind.\n\n> There's no reason not to auto-report all nine players in every game\n\nTo my knowledge, there is no good reason not to do so, no. That doesn't necessarily mean that there's any particularly good reason _to_ do so, but with report weighting not being a thing and the IFS being able to sort out false reports from accurate ones, I don't see any reason to advise you against doing so.\n\n> Am I missing anything?\n\nNot to my knowledge, but, who knows? Sometimes answers can spawn further questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-09-22T23:34:25.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the system punishes people based on consistency x severity.  Meaning that a player can be punished for 1 game of extreme toxicity or many games of mild toxicity.  \n\nThere are two parts to the verbal detection system; the Machine Learning part and a Zero Tolerance part. \n\nZero Tolerance (or ZT) is indeed a keyword search, but only searches the logs upon reported and the hate speech category selected. ZT system can easily be circumvented, but typically the report will be manually reviewed and new words will be added to the list. \n\nThose punished by the ZT system skips punishment tiers and straight to bans (no chat restrictions). \n\nMachine Learning (ML) reads your (and only yours) whole chat and analyzes the tone of voice used throughout the chat. It will determine whether you used your chat in a harassing/insulting/demeanor manner and assign a toxicity score (not to be confused with report score) based on how severe your chat was (0 is the score if no toxicity was found). That score will stay on your account and accumulate. If it passes a certain threshold,  you will get punished. \n\nML punishments follow 4 tier system; \n\n1. 10 game chat restriction \n2. 25 game chat restriction \n3. 14-day ban\n4. Permaban\n\nMultiple reports within the same game will not change the result of the score the ML system assigns. \n\nAs for punishing Ezreal or Renekton, it will all depend on what their behavioral history was before stating that game. \n\nIt is possible for playerA to get punished and playerB not to, even though playerB was waaayyyyy more toxic . Let's say playerA started the game with the toxicity meter at 95% and playerB's at 35%. Ingame, playerB said some pretty nasty shit and playerA responds with some shit as well. After the game, playerA gains 10% toxicity and playerB gains 50%. Now playerA is at 105% toxicity and gets punished, whereas playerB is at 85%, and not punished in that specific game, even though playerB was found to be 5x more toxic than playerA in that game. \n\n---\n---\n---\n\n\nWhile I'm here, let me answer other systemic questions you have from other posts;\n\n> [{quoted}](name=RichardMaclaurin,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=geFO26xG,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2019-09-22T19:17:50.521+0000)\n>\n> You claim that, but this was the only game they included in the chat logs, so I have to wonder where you're getting your information.  It seems very much a copout to say \"Well, we should assume you were crazy toxic in some OTHER game\" but also \"And that other game wasn't included as an example of toxicity because that wouldn't demonstrate toxicity as well\"\n\nSo the reform card only shows you 1-5 recent games as examples of unacceptable behavior, sorted by severity. Riot has found that giving out chatlogs for games that happened past the \"recent\" period  will just end up confusing their players, as they can't remember why they had such attitude, thus that extra information just served to confuse others or others just denied the chatlog claiming that wasn't them.\n\nIf you want, you can submit a ticket to Riot Support and ask them how many games you were recently validly reported. Tier1 support has the results for the past 20 games.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=RichardMaclaurin,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=geFO26xG,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2019-09-22T19:17:50.521+0000)\n> \n> You say that asking people to report someone is toxic, which is news to me, because I think 90% of the games I've played people have asked for a report on one person or another.\n\nAsking for reports (unless used in a playful manner like \"Report Ahri, no skin\") is essentially you saying \"haha say goodbye to your account and you can't do anything about it\" and no one wants their account punished, especially if they feel like they didn't do anything wrong. \n\nOf course,  you say that because you don't fully understand how the system works, as if you knew multiple and false reports don't do anything,  then you wouldn't say it in the first place. \n\nSo therefore, from a system's point of view, asking for reports is considered a harassment.  While mild in severity, it is still toxic and will get you punished if you did it over many games.

Fellow players can look through their logs and try to explain what - if anything - might have resulted in the punishment, and whether or not they might have a case for appeal, albeit that latter part is particularly rare.\n\n> Does anyone believe that they got chat restricted without being toxic?\n\nIt is possible; not all forms of misbehavior are inherently toxic. Detrimental arguing, defeatism, and excessive complaining are those sorts of misbehavior, and there are very frequently cases where players overstep in self defense and - accidentally or otherwise - wind up as retaliators.\n\nI'm personally willing to bet that the OP may have committed one of those more low-key infractions - probably detrimental arguing or overstepping in self defense - but I really can't say for certain without seeing the chat logs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RichardMaclaurin","date":"2019-09-22T17:17:11.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why even examine any evidence at all?

None of that is positive or neutral, none of that helps your team win. Announcing reports is specifically indicated as toxic. From [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player):\n\n> Do not threaten or repeatedly tell a player you will report them. Doing so can encourage players who are already negative to continue their behavior. Whether they know they are being reported or not has no bearing to whether the system will act on them. But most importantly, repeatedly threatening or arguing with a negative player can end up derailing the game for everyone else and then open yourself up to reports and possible disciplinary action as well. Avoid negative thoughts and useless chatting with poor performing teammates! Focus on victory by muting the offending player and then reporting them at the end of the game.\n> \n> Do not ask other players in the match to report the offending player. It only takes one report for our systems to review a game. Additional reports will not do anything for the offending player; however as mentioned above, it could open yourself up to a report of your own; especially if you are derailing the match by constantly demanding reports of other players.\n\nSorry, but you earned this chat restriction, and it wasn't by playing Mao support. It wasn't even just from this one game. You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the logs that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several logs. You might see three logs, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.","replies":[{"poster":"RichardMaclaurin","date":"2019-09-22T19:17:50.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> You spend the entire match arguing with your team, complaining about who should've done what in each fight, saying you're better than they are, telling them they're \"crying,\" insisting that they're toxic, and announcing that you intend to report them. \n\nThat's a rather gross mischaracterization of the chat.

I talk all the time in games and I've never been punished. If someone says something that bothers you, like the insult from an ADC you gave in an example above, mute them and report them. This limits your exposure to their unpleasant chat to the bare minimum, and brings that person closer to a chat restriction which will hopefully teach them to not send even one awful chat message like that.\n\nBut it won't necessarily teach them. Some people are simply incapable of admitting that their behavior is bad and taking responsibility for their actions. They applaud punishments applied to other people, but the same punishment applied to them for the exact same justification is decried as being incredibly arbitrary and unfair. But they'll eventually be permabanned, and no one will have to deal with them again (unless they're so unbalanced that they produce a string of permabanned accounts, but that's rare).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FOWSHOWBROW","date":"2019-09-22T13:43:01.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't get chat restricted for playing a champion.
