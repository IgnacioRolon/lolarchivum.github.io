I believe it is the lighting affect created by the model that flashes. \r\n\r\nThe conditions that caused the affect was for the player champion to be within one screen of a tunnel but did not seem to occur using the free camera. Another (friendly) player [Ashe] in the game confirmed that they had the same graphical glitch while the (friendly) Rek&#039;sai did not see the glitch. I am unable to replicate this myself as I don&#039;t own Rek&#039;sai. \r\n\r\nI believe the glitch will be to do with either hardware issues or more likely due to the graphics settings within the game, as the Ashe and I both had our games on the preset high settings while the Rek&#039;sai was on lower custom settings. \r\n\r\nWould appreciate someone having a look at this, it wasn&#039;t particularly distracting but all the same to patch a glitch. Thank you.\r\n\r\nN.B. The conditions that it occurred under where: Summoners Rift map, Rek&#039;sai tunnels on purple side mid lane outer turret; Preset high in-game graphics settings","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-16T00:42:34.984+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey starly135, \n\nThanks for the report!

I was blue side, had a tunnel by the wolf camp, and as i came back to it while it was in the fog of war i noticed it 'flickering' as if it was under a horror movie streetlight (highly scientific, i know), and the flickering didn't go away as it came into vision and i cleared the wolf camp. I started noticing the bug for other tunnels i placed as well ; i don't know if it was all of them, though.","replies":[]}]}
