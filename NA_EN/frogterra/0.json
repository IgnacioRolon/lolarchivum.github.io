Files may get a bit jumbled due to us patching so frequently. \n\nYou can do this by - \n\n* Run League of Legends\n* Click on the '?' button that is located in the top right corner of the window\n* Click Repair\n* Wait. The repair function can take anywhere from 5 minutes to over 30 depending on the number of corrupt files it has to repair\n\nLemme know if you're still having problems after this. :)","replies":[]}]}
