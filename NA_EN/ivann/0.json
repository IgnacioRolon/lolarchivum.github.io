How to get the screensaver to active is leaving your PC idle, for about a minute it took me, the animation will play, but make sure your screensaver is on League Display, typing screen saver into your search bar and you'll see \"Change Screensaver\" if it's not already choose League Display, number on the bottom is the time you need to wait. Now that you have changed screensaver to League Display, open League Display and select which ever one, it will look as if no changes were made but wait like a minute or so, and it should start playing. \nIf you got it to play great, if not sorry, just here to clear up the confusion about the display","replies":[]},{"poster":"kokuminiak","date":"2018-01-05T10:08:26.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why is this site in turkish and why hasnt riot support responded","replies":[]},{"poster":"xo Skittlez","date":"2017-12-17T08:48:07.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue my background goes completely black..{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrushingTek","date":"2017-12-17T00:07:06.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mine is doing the same thing.
