This is a bad thing for a few reasons, this buff highly incentives AD champs to build pure Crit builds aka nothing but Infinity Edge because of its stats. This buff also applies to AP champs that have abilities that can crit but that isnt much of an issue. The real issue is while playing URF you play Crit or you play Lethality and **IN MY OPINION** that really kills the core of what URF was. And what URF was, was a mode where you built the \"non-meta\" builds on a champ that other wise would not work on a champion in a Normal game of League.\n\nThe simple fix to this would be to just remove the Crit Damage buff, there maybe other solutions to this but the goal of this post was to just bring attention to this and maybe get some change to it as the moment this launches on the Live Servers more than 60% of the player base will be playing this mode.\n\n\nEdite: Just wanted to add that the objective here is for everyone to think of a change that would be more benifical for everyone in the mode. If the changes they have made at the current time are not enough this version of URF will be locked up again and may never return.\n","replies":[]}
