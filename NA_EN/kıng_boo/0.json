She&#039;s barely relevant in laning phase where you can only farm and pray you don&#039;t get ganked or die, because if you do, you might as well just leave the game and not weigh down your team. \n\nIf Cass doesn&#039;t get ahead, she&#039;s just a stun bot then fodder for the enemy team, especially with the gutting of her passive hampering her powerspikes. Her E is meant to be spammed sure, but you can only cast four or five Twin Fangs until you completely drain yourself of your mana and become an open target for retaliation.\n\nYou admitted yourselves that Cass is an extremely bad spot but...it just seems you&#039;re ignoring her presence entirely.\n\nI feel like something as small as gaining x amount of passive stacks upon assisting or killing an enemy champion (maybe less stacks if it&#039;s an assist). It&#039;d certainly be helpful, and allows her to hopefully gain back some relevance should she fall behind in a game.\n\nEdit:\n\nAs I thought about other possible changes, you could make Cass less reliant on E, and instead give more possible combinations. \n\nHere's what I'm thinking:\nCass' Q does poison damage over time. However, should she strike a poisoned enemy with her E, they will receive all of the DoT damage in one instance. Her Q's poison also no longer resets her E's cooldown.\n\nCass' W would allow her to do what she does now, if you're hit by Miasma, Cass can repeatedly cast E as long as you're in the Miasma field.\n\nOf course, there's dozens of other ideas, but I just thought these would also be interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Tiddles","date":"2015-11-02T16:06:29.154+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"Her current power level/viability is not my sticking point here. It's completely irrelevant to the major F*CK YOU Riot gave to Cass. This abomination is not Cassiopeia, it is Riot shoehorning her into some acid trip vision of a completely different champion. And then after she was mutilated from the champion I mained since day one, from the first champion I bought, from the first champion I loved enough to spend real dollars on for a skin -- after completely changing everything about her strengths and weaknesses and the REASONS why I loved her, Riot (ie, Stashu) dropped off the face of the f*cking planet and said screw you guys I don't give a crap about your favorite champion.\n\n1. The passive mini-game is not fun, and only serves to shackle her for the majority of most games, if not the entirety. Being a hyper carry means after 3 items no matter what you are doing some damage. Being Cass after 3 items means you still do shit until you have finished the 45 minute mini-game. And PS Riot, her win rate after 45 minutes is still not impressive. The passive must go. It doesn't fit into her theme at all. Now she is afk farm for 45 minutes because that is what Stashu thinks is fun. It isn't.\n2.  She was always a slippery, area control, manipulative chick who bided her time until the moment to strike was right. Until Stashu ruined her that is. Now she is a magic damage dealing marksman, without hyperscaling of crit and AS. She went from a champ that _felt_ sneaky and underhanded and manipulative with her playstyle, to a boring as sh*t machine-gun E-spammer. Q and W serve no purpose, and do not feel good to use... but hey, more Es AMIRITE???\n3. Nobody wanted this rework. There were threads with **literally hundreds of pages of angry posts** saying we did not want this, but they ignored the PBE feedback. They ignored the major sh*t-storm once it went live, and never commented on her again besides \"oh yeah, we remember some people didn't like some aspects\". When Morde's name was going to be changed to something without metal in it, there were some posts and Riot changed its mind. Why, after so long, has the Cass playerbase not been given the same courtesy? I have not seen a larger negative response to something in this game **EVER**. Why ignore this?\n4. The redone skins are horrible. I don't care much about the others, but the artwork for the redone Desperada skin is the most disgusting thing in this game. The old skin was more detailed and interesting, and actually had the markings of the deadly rattler it was supposed to be. There was a lot of negative feedback about this before it went live, and then after, and Riot steadfastly ignores it. I honestly want a refund of my skin because this one is not at all what I paid for. They didn't even give the courtesy of other champs and give a classic Desperada skin.\n5. Most tragically, and most offensively of all my gripes about this poop sandwich, is that Riot has remained silent. I don't even remember the last time I heard Stashu say anything, despite the company line of \"of course, if this rework turns out to not work out we are totally open to changing it\".\n\nI wish Riot would have done for Cass what they did for other champ reworks where they asked the players what they loved about the identity of the champ and the feeling of the champ. Nothing about this \"evolving power\" BS is Cass. Nothing about the shackles of a passive, or the machine gun only playstyle is Cass. But I guess this all stems from Riot hating the Cassiopeia playerbase. Well, Riot won. I can't play my favorite champ because this abomination is not her and playing it just makes me sad. _**And it has nothing at all to do with her current power level or viability**_","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-11-02T16:54:58.372+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not to mention that the rework didn't fix any of Cass problems or make her easier to balance... so in the end the rework didn't really accomplish much (other then her having too high numbers and gaining some popularity before being thrashed by nerfs)\n\nAlso as Cass currently is... there is pretty much no reason to play her... she is like an ADC however she has to pay mana for her \"auto attacks\" (E) and also need to land a skill shot before being able to \"auto attack\"...\nWhile yes in return she kind of starts of with 2 attack speed and have decent base damage on her \"auto attack\" even so her squishiness and lack of mobility and range just makes her seem not worth it\nShe just seems like a bad ADC which deals magic damage\n\nAnd why not just pick someone like Kalista who also kind of have a base damage on her auto attack (Rend has base damage) and stack attack speed... and Kalista can auto attack without landing a skill shot and have better mobility and her utility in the form of her ult is really strong (and she also has a slow and some vision with her sentinels)","replies":[{"poster":"Rysophage","date":"2015-11-02T17:27:33.867+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"Oh no the poor baby has to land AOE SKILLSHOTS WAAAAH.

Considering I typically hit 500 stacks around 30 minutes (give or take depending on the game), and the games being shortened to 25-30 minutes, the power spike will come at a point where it is not substantial to the game. \n\nAs for power, I typically do not see a huge issue right now with her power. Le Blanc is the only champion that I invariably do poorly against. Zed has gotten much easier after repeat exposure, to the point where he is hungry for kills around level 6-8, as most assassins are, and a simple stun (esp under turret) can easily get a kill. For most, trying to watch their moves and when they time their spells makes it so easy to poke for me. Landing a Q will allow me to dodge most any skill shot. I can zone my opponent to the direction I want them to go with W when a gank arrives. \n\nOf course, I do not build glass cannon Cassiopeia, going on my first back to get {{item:3070}}, followed by {{item:3240}}. After this, a defensive item is typically needed for maximum poke. {{item:1057}} into {{item:3001}} for AP and {{item:3191}} into {{item:3157}} for AD. {{item:3136}} into {{item:3151}}  and/or {{item:3116}} are next. {{item:3003}} when near 750 stacks. {{item:3135}} for maximum penetration (I see what I did there). Her passive gives the Rabadon buff, so it isn't truly needed. Overall, with these items and runes, I will get right around 100 armor and magic resist, 2,000-2,500 health depending on level, 42% penetration, 44 straight penetration after that, and another 20 reduced with Abyssal when I'm in range of my E. Those items make her tankier, and also will take 200 MR down to 52 MR. At 200 MR you are doing 33% of your damage after reduction. At 52 MR I am doing 65% damage after reductions. This effectively doubles my damage. Sure Rabadon's gives you insane AP, but considering her AP ratios are not that high, pure penetration works better. At 110 MR or less, you are dealing true damage on all abilities. The bonus poison damage after landing some E's will make a tank just shred health, especially with Liandry's, and your ult, Zhonya's, plus the added tankiness from items can save you from assassins.\n\nTLDR: If Riot is moving towards games that cap out around 30 minutes, reaching the 500 stack passive (including the average stacks per second on champions and over time) around the 20 minute mark would be ideal. \n\nShe's a snake: you need maximum penetration to hit her sweet spot.\n\nI feel her power is in a good spot, even if it doesn't truly capture the essence of poison for me. I don't feel her gameplay of *slowly increasing power* matches her identity as a character, but that doesn't make it under powered imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Tiddles","date":"2015-11-04T14:40:49.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rubber Jesus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=csFv87x7,comment-id=000e,timestamp=2015-11-03T00:21:17.116+0000)\n>\n> She's a snake: you need maximum penetration to hit her sweet spot.\n> \n\nYou know Abyssal reduction happens before % from Void right? There are other posts laying around with in-depth explanations and math, but it is never worth it to get both Abyssal and Void. You get more far more damage from a Deathcap instead of the Abyssal with a Void staff in play. Also it's kind of crazy to not have a Deathcap on a hyperscaling champ.\n\n> I feel her power is in a good spot, even if it doesn't truly capture the essence of poison for me.

Her gameplay not matching her identity and her historical strengths and weaknesses is the real issue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gooberp","date":"2015-11-02T23:17:28.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've wondered before if a way to help Cass would be to nerf her E reset. Make it scale down from, say, 0.8s to 0.4s as it ranks. This would further cement her role as a lategame carry, significantly hamper her trading power without gutting her lane phase, and give Riot the capacity to buff her elsewhere, like her mana pool/costs. \nDefinitely the least fun thing about playing Cassiopeia is running out of mana when you perform your duties properly in the mid-late game, EVEN WITH a Tear/AA.\n\nI know the old Cass mains liked her as a lane bully, but since Riot insists that they hate that, why does she still have a lane bully kit? Scale the E reset time and she has room to allow so much power to be put back into her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-11-02T20:30:57.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Imo, I would like Cass to be a little bit more of an assasin.
