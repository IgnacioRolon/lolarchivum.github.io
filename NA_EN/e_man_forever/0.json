A time when Dyrus just retired and Team Liquid were the ultimate underachievers and always finished 4th. Around this time, former NBA Lakers player Rick Fox noticed how much his son was into League of Legends. This sparked a dream he would do anything to achieve. Along the way he would also become a Lucian one-trick stuck in the doldrums of Elo-Hell.\r\n\r\nHe got his roster into the 2016 Spring Split. While there was promise, they lacked a true star besides Froggen. They went a below average 6-12 record, narrowly dodging relegations. \r\n\r\nSure they were stuck in mediocrity in Spring, but you have something to build off of for the summer right?\r\n0-1.  0-3.  1-5.  1-10.  1-17. \r\nI mean you at least survived relegation.\r\n\r\nThis pattern of underachieving and/or mediocrity was a constant for any iteration of the squad.\r\n\r\nFrom 2017 onwards, Echo Fox would show flashes of potential at the beginning of most split’s (mainly the spring) and then fall off a cliff.\r\n\r\nWith franchising in 2018 Echo Fox needed investors and shareholders to pay for the expensive entry fees. One of these shareholders would be the demise of this organization.\r\n\r\nDespite Froggen taking a hiatus for 2018. Fox was undeterred to achieve his dream. He revamped the roster with fresh talent and star power with Dardoch, Fenix, and Altec. The big prize however was Huni who, while volatile, gave Echo Fox a threat that needed to be kept in check or else he would take over games. This was the year the squad went all in.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the Spring Split this squad was performing as well as if not better than advertised dominating the likes of C9 and TSM. Towards the end of the split, cracks started to show in their foundations and had to settle for the consolation of a disappointing 3rd place.\r\n\r\nThis lead to an even more disappointing summer split with constant roster shuffles. Damonte was probably not experienced enough on the big stage and Lost was only a threat on Varus.\r\n\r\nTSM became their boogeymen as they ended both their summer playoff run and Worlds aspirations with painful defeats in both series. With each game you could see the life of Echo Fox die in real time as they went from being cocky to going into desperation mode faster than the average Immortals game length.\r\n\r\nHuni had enough of the situation and signed with Clutch Gaming leaving the 2019 squad to be much weaker.\r\n\r\nThis year’s Spring Split Echo Fox lost in the playoffs to you guessed it TSM. Not only did they punch you in the mouth, but they also broke your back, ripped your soul out, salted the Earth so nothing ever grows, and banished you to the shadow realm.\r\n\r\nWhat you thought I was being sarcastic, they’re 3-11 right now and represents the implosion that is going on inside Echo Fox itself right now.\r\n\r\nI recommend you play this for the tragedy you’re about to read.\r\n\r\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watchv=YAIb3lqWBIU&amp;list=PLoEIZ4ULmT4bDlL46WHIRt02cQLKzMSab&amp;index=29\r\n\r\nOn April 19th this year, one Echo Fox shareholder by the name of Amit Raizada sent racist remarks and threats to Rick Fox and his family via email.\r\n\r\nThe League responded to this event on May 15 by giving Echo Fox an ultimatum. Expunge your shareholder within 60 days or face disciplinary action. \r\n\r\nThe shareholder refused to budge and there was nothing Echo Fox can do. Rubbing salt in the wound wound be an understatement. This was spraying the wound with military pepper spray. Raizada was single handedly killing Echo Fox.\r\n\r\nRick Fox had enough of the situation and decided to pull the plug. He now has to look to sell the team before next Monday. Let’s see who’s interested. Stan Kroenke?!! Why him! Have you seen this man’s history. This was the guy who screwed over St. Louis and forced several homeowners in Texas to move out.\r\n\r\nYou know who I feel bad for the most. Both Rick Fox and the players. Fox because he got both racially attacked and is losing everything he built. For the players, nobody wanted this. All the imploding did was loom over the squad’s heads like a storm cloud. Who knows what will happen to them next season. This organization was built on a dream, a passion project, a vision of the future. And all the world did was snuff out that ember of hope with a tsunami of controversy with no hope to stop it.\r\n\r\nWe’ll always remember you Echo Fox.","replies":[{"poster":"ChompyWulf","date":"2019-07-25T17:19:42.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"An uninformed and shallow opinion. \n\nFirst, anyone with knowledge of the NFL knew that the Rams were not being supported by either a fanbase or government in St. Louis.

Secondly, Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences.   You won't go to jail for saying racist things, but corporations don't have to do business with you.  And nobody is going to do business with someone that gives them a poor image.    Riot had every right and every responsibility to step in.   Donald Sterling was forced to sell the clippers because of his outburst.  The NALCS, like the NBA, did the right thing.  Either he's gone from EF ownership or EF must sell their spot.  They elected to sell their spot.

If you want censorship, go back to Canada. \n> Finally, this whole staredown started because of his weak willed memo announcing him quitting. I wouldn't be surprised if he leaked it himself. \n\nThis is a bad take.  \n\nFirst off, the First Amendment does not protect threats as a general rule;  when Raizada said he would \"f___ [Rick Fox's] family\" in correspondence that arguably counted as official Echo Fox e-mail, that went past a number of lines.  It *may* be protected free speech under the Constitution - most speech is, and you need a lot to actually be in violation of the laws involving threats and/or libel - but those laws do exist, and such words are evidence of a dangerous personality.  No good person threatens to go after someone else's family in a business dispute;  that's mobster behavior.  And as something like cause for dismissal from an organization, private organizations are absolutely indeed justified in citing these things as evidence of mental unfitness for a position of high power, wealth, and responsibility. There is indeed a point past which it's really not okay morally or legally to just run your mouth off, even in America - it takes a lot to get there - but in my many years of experience moderating boards and judging these issues, Raizada is right on the edge of that line, or even over it.  \n\nSecond, Rick, for better or worse, has put a lot of heart and soul (and money) into the Echo Fox project over a number of years and really tried to prioritize being a hero for his players and their fans and to give eSports as much credibility as he could via his own long career in the NBA.  The image that comes to mind is of his wall-to-wall smiles when hugging his players after their victories.  You can love the man or hate him, but I believe he really has tried to be a positive force in this industry and a role model for the kids, and in this case it seems no good deed has gone unpunished.\n\nThird, Raizada's been accused by Rick of self-dealing -  a longstanding and well-known kind of business law abuse.  It's hard to know what has actually gone on without more details, but it basically would involve Raizada sabotaging his own organization in order to get frustrated partners ignorant of the sabotage to sell him interests in the organization more cheaply.  That would certainly explain a lot about Echo Fox's recent performance and overall downfall if true - these allegations need to be investigated, and if Raizada is genuinely found guilty of self-dealing he needs a lifetime ban from League, in my eyes.  \n\nThe good karma Rick tried to put into this project may be destroyed, but these scandals happen in sports - there are echoes of Donald Sterling and the Clippers.\n\nWhat matters is how we respond to it.\n\nThere is indeed a point at which \"mean words\" actually do become a crime - yes, even in America.  And there is a point far before that where mean words are not legally a crime, but absolutely aren't okay on League of Legends servers or in League of Legends boardrooms under current Riot policy.  When you send racist e-mails with threatening language against someone's family, that's way past the pale, possibly even on both counts.\n\nStop being jerks.  Seriously.   This game has so many problems with former players who don't want to play anymore because a lot of our current players are behaving in brutally and cruelly toxic ways.  \n\nI say \"GLHF\" in *lobby* sometimes - and people actually take offense because their social skills are so poor and they'd rather not have to talk to anybody, and so they start slurring and getting ready to run it down mid.  \n\nLeague's bullying/antisocial behavior problems are getting very, very bad and it's hurting the game in a lot of ways.  \n\nIf your only intent in your alleged activism regarding free speech is to protect this \"I do what I want, I can say any lousy thing I feel like at any time for any reason\" attitude that is wrecking vast great sections of the game right now, my feeling is that you are doing it very wrong.   \n\n\"No shirt, no shoes, no service\" is a thing in business too.","replies":[{"poster":"ChompyWulf","date":"2019-07-31T22:01:11.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let's break down your wall. \n\nYou point to threats. Threats that may or may not be considered criminal. It usually takes more than one angry business correspondence to legitimately accuse someone of criminal threats. \n\nMoving on to verbal abuse and harassment. Very often not illegal. Rude, bad, abhorrent, it sure can be. But Rick Fox's stance and quote I repeated above to someone else shows his mindset embraces thought policing. That's absolutely unacceptable and leads to abuse of authority by government. So no, screw Social Justice Rick and his attitude. I dont care if someone hurts your feelings with mean words, adult up and move on. Which leads to third...\n\nRick can't be trusted with business claims. When a guy sends a memo stating intent to sell his shares of his co-founded team, it \"mysteriously\" is leaked, and at the end of the line the team ownership group must sell for failing to oust Raizada, then this leads to Rick Fox's crybaby session about how he felt bent over when ownership sold his team.....no. You can't claim to want to sell out then cry when it eventually happens. Rick Rat had his schemes backfire and he's talking trash on Raizada because his cowardly plan didn't work how he intended. \n\nFinally, I don't care about celebrity representation and at the end of the day Rick Fox is just another guy. If he really cared about his dream and investment he would've protected it with basic work, like background checks and investigating prospective buyers to avoid shady businessmen or abusive persons.","replies":[{"poster":"CaliCoastReplay","date":"2019-08-01T00:19:00.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ChompyWulf,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=AzEX3M4w,comment-id=000300010000,timestamp=2019-07-31T22:01:11.217+0000)\n>\n> You point to threats.

That's such an entitled garbage attitude that I won't waste one iota of compassion on him.\n\nIndeed!  A quote by Evelyn Beatrice Hall, paraphrasing the beliefs of French philosopher Voltaire.  One of my favorite quotes about free speech and democracy. \n\nIt applies very deeply when it comes to government censorship of unpopular opinion, and I will fight, myself, possibly to the death to defend the principles Voltaire espoused, at least in the realm of civics.\n\nI do believe the context here matters, though.  The First Amendment, as has been noted, protects the rights of citizens against oppressive government policy in a public setting - not the right of corporate abusers to keep their positions without consequence from their boards and partners in a private setting. \n\nLet's check the record on Amit Raizada's actual quote:\n\n[\"NO DEAL ON ANYTHING AND IF RICK DOES NOT DO HIS DUITIES ILL PERSONALLY FUCK HIM AND HIS FAMILY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE.”\n](https://www.dexerto.com/esports/new-emails-show-amit-raizada-appeared-to-threaten-rick-foxs-family-614156)\n\nRevolutionary ideal is not on trial here, to put it mildly.  \n\nNone of us are trying to make League a place for \"thoughtcrime\" or \"thought police\", as you put it.  But Raizada's not out to protect the institutions of democracy here;  these are private Echo Fox e-mails, or were until the entire thing started getting investigated.    At issue is Raizada's alleged right to be a bully and a harasser in private corporate discussion without consequence.  It's probably protected free speech at a civics level, especially if Raizada were to claim that he meant it metaphorically - that line is pretty broad.  \n\nBut it's not speech I'm going to defend to the death his right to say without getting his butt kicked out of Riot's e-sports programs, though.  It's just not.  \n\nYour experience may vary.\n\nAgain, to me, it's really less a First Amendment issue in this case than a \"no shirt, no shoes, no service\" issue.   You just can't be in a place of business yelling and threatening people.    It's bad for business and bad for people.  Raizada's behavior has been a black eye for LCS generally.  You seem to feel Rick's behavior falls under the same category.  I can disagree.\n\nProtecting *that* part of the discussion is definitely more the kind of thing that does fall under the need for civics.  That we can disagree on this while having a conversation in line with the rules and principles of these boards and in respect is the kind of thing that free speech principles are indeed supposed to protect!","replies":[{"poster":"ChompyWulf","date":"2019-08-01T22:20:04.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're missing my point.\nI have no beef with Raizada being removed.

Of course there are all sorts of ways to do that and all sorts of other things that maybe needed as compensation. \n\n\nSo because they couldn't buyout the guy now they all have to sell and that means since they are forced to do so it more than likely means they will all take a major loss since the idea of buying low and selling high is all about timing and supply and demand. Basically anyone with the check book can come in now and offer these guys a lot less than the brand is worth and remember that 30mil number i used? that's the price/value you would use to say EF at it's max number, there can be litigation about that though when it comes to a buyout but now since they are basically having a Fire Sale that means someone could possibly come in and scoop that up for a lot less, like if someone offers 19mil, EF would be compelled to actually consider that offer even though the brand is technically worth 30 mil. \n\nI'm not sure who will get it but at the end of the Day Riot will still have the final say in who comes into the league.\n\nOh i saw something that is interesting, so the League of Legends Team sold for 30mil but that doesn't mean the Brand overall is worth just that; so when you talkl about buying out this guys shares it more than likely was a lot more than 9mil to buy him out because he wasn't just invested in League but the entire team of EF so his shares are worth more than the 9mil; it would be hypothetically a lot more but since I don't know how much the Brand is worth I'll just say that to buy that guy out would've prolly be a ridiculous amount since he was involved in the entire team and not just league; i'll say it could be possible it would've been around 15-25mil to actually buy these shares from this guy since he is a investor in the overall brand and when you look at a number like that and then the overall number the EF League division is worth it kinda wouldn't make a lot of sense to buy him out considering the league team is worth 30mil (which could be undervalued since it's a forced sale) but even if we say it was worth 40mil hypothetically that is still not really worth when you look at it; you'd be essentially buying another League team just to buy 1 person(s) shares. \n\nDifficult situation, but interesting business decisions from Riot and EF overall. Also this sets a pretty serious precedence overall, Riot don't play I mean this is something that probably could be talked about in one of those CNN Money / Investment Shows since the last time something like this happened (that I remember) revolved around the former LA Clippers owner who (similar to this Situation) the NBA forced him to sell out to someone else and it was a pretty big story for awhile. \n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"E Man forever","date":"2019-07-24T18:45:06.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think some of the problem has to do with the fact that shareholders own a portion of the company itself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"0megon","date":"2019-07-24T20:07:21.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MessyStuff,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=AzEX3M4w,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-07-24T18:34:49.173+0000)\n>\n> I mean I actually don't get how they can't expunge the shareholder, don't they hold the rights(I'm actually asking)?\n\nWell being shareholder basically means you own part of the company through owning the shares/stocks. So expunging shareholder basically means they need to sell their shares and it might be hard(and maybe even impossible) to force them in doing that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2019-07-24T18:54:55.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a tragedy just a business decision.  There will be more stories like this to come bc there are limited avenues for income for businesses like Echo Fox.  They can take cuts from streamers, youtube, apparell doesnt provide much, sponsors are there (sometimes) if you are extremely established, but the upfront cost is quite massive.  \n\nThe best thing mid-range groups like this can do for business is cut cost and help new games develop by getting stakes in them and lending their brands and expertise to give viability.  Therefore they would have a stake in a new esports game growing and would grow along with it which would be great for everyone.  RIght now it is just buy an extremely expensive LCS spot and hope something happens.  It would be better for teams to do thorough due diligence and buy a _X_% stakes in a new Esports games to help them prosper and then prosper a long with it.
