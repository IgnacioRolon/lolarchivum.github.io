I can resize it from there but it doesn't change the resolution so everything is pixelated, additionally most of the huds (the queue accept, runes and masteries, all hover text) stay at the smallest size and do not stretch with the client. This happens randomly and will sometimes not happen at all. I've been having this problem since patch 6.9. Things I've tried: running as administrator, reinstalling, repairing the installation, changing a file in the league of legends folder to resize=true, and running in compatibility mode, none worked.
