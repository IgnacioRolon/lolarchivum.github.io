Melee should be getting that tower damage buff, not ranged.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2016-01-28T08:10:22.532+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, I said I didn't know :(\n\nOP didn't ask _why_ red does damage to towers, he asked if it was a bug.

My intent wasn't to place anything on you.\n\nIt just seems that ADCs have enough going for them already with sieges. It should be melees that get the extra bump. Surprised this hasn't been adjusted so maybe a ranged ADC isn't absolutely 100% required in every game in the foreseeable future, even with them trying to change that, like with {{champion:82}}. Imagine if they made Tryndamere, Yi, GP, etc able to function bot lane. \n\nIt would put the meta in a much more prolific state where there isn't as much X champion is better than Y champion at Z thing, so X is always better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Illâoi Evê Siôn","date":"2016-01-28T08:01:17.882+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While sieging, you can often only get one or two hits from your ADC before you have to pull back again.
