Two to three Riot employees later, I finally came across one that was cooperative, even if the slightest. To make a long story short, I ended up getting my account reinstated, and would be able to play again.\n\nAfter I got my account back, however, I decided to stop playing league for awhile. That is, up until about a month ago. I've been playing anywhere from 1-5 games a night, and have been thoroughly enjoying it once again. I have noticed that I am back where I was where I first started playing league(toxicity wise), where I don't flame or badmouth anyone. In fact, not to toot my own horn, but I'm a very encouraging and sportsmanlike player once again.\n\nA few months before my account had been banned, I'd noticed myself getting gradually more toxic, possibly on account of me playing and surrounding myself with toxic players. Nonetheless, it was ultimately no one's fault but my own.\n\nI'm now at my last checkpoint before I hit honour level 1, after just a few weeks of playing, and I am genuinely proud of it, even if it's meaningless 1's and 0's on a video game client.\n\nI guess I'm making this post to just share my personal experience, and let everyone know that sometimes you just gotta step away, and get a new point of view on things. It's definitely refreshing to come back to a game that I've loved for the past half a decade with a new mindset, and becoming not only a better player, but also a better community member.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read, and good luck on the Rift, summoners!\n\n~Peace and Love, frens {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-06-09T08:19:20.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is dead may never die...is something no one ever said about old threads.
