The change is targeted toward as she puts it, AP tanks and AP bruisers, similar to how BC was targeted for AD tanks and bruisers. What do you guys think? Depending on the changes, who do you think will benefit the most from a better Abyssal Scepter?","replies":[{"poster":"420Templar","date":"2015-05-08T21:59:53.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I never want to play against a Rumble ever again.","replies":[{"poster":"IllumanatiObama","date":"2015-05-08T22:04:30.740+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiery Spirit of the Yordle Inferno!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hinro Honato","date":"2015-05-10T19:33:45.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You wanted to before?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LilxPaprika","date":"2015-05-08T21:55:30.130+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I posted this like 3 days ago: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Wu1ziN4k-ap-bruiser-equivalent-to-black-cleaver\nand got downvoted to oblivion. \nriot brings it up and no one bats an eye.\nactually I don't even mind.

Not at all. Abyssal is actually a fairly good item on several midlane mages. Currently it provides AP, MR against assassins, and magic pen (essentially) which is extremely useful against in the tank meta. I would argue these are three of the most important stats for an ap mid. Turning this into a tank item is not what a midlane mage wants at all. Why not create a new item for tanks and turn the abyssal scepter into a better mid item? We need more items anyway. Itemization is way to limited.","replies":[{"poster":"IllumanatiObama","date":"2015-05-09T00:23:47.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering the success of the BC changes, I'm confident Abyssal will be good.

It is a general item now that works well on many.\n\nMR alone isn't enough. They are stripping non-tank mages of a magic pen item at a time when the meta revolves around tanks. It may not be commonly used by midlaners for that purpose, but when it is it performs well. Their attempts to work on item diversity may very well backfire yet again.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-05-08T23:24:57.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could see this letting Vlad go more bruiser than he usually does.
