The only way for me bypass that was thru a VPN. They not only didn't help me with my connection issue but they've now banned my account... they think I am sharing my aco%%%% with someone else due to different IP log ins, I've already explained its the VPN. And I gave them ennough informations about my account. How ridiculous is this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-29T16:48:13.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, we don't punish players for using VPN so there may be something else going on like unauthorized access or not being the original owner.  You'll want to fill out our [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) so our account team can help, if that's the case.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-11-29T14:21:00.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It’s easy to determine if someone is using a VPN or sharing an account. Like, **very** easy. Especially with the amount of data Riot has access to. There are two possibilities here:\n\n1. You’re lying.\n\n2. A support agent, who does this day in and day out for a living, made a mistake.\n\nIf you truly aren’t lying, you should continue submitting support tickets and asking them to review the evidence again. I however, doubt this is the case.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dying Instinct","date":"2017-11-29T13:22:15.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Send a support ticket and give them a couple of days to respond. They will need some time to process it, but I am confident that they will fix it for you if you explain your situation in a calm and collected way without being mad at them. It's hard, but try to keep your feelings out of it and simply request an unban.","replies":[]}]}
