I've also run into the problem where my special ward skin doesn't even play it's special sound sometimes. Do you know which wards in particular you're having this problem with? I can go and look at the volume levels. It's also possible there is a bug where the base ward sound is playing on top of the special one as well. Any info you have will help in trying to look into this. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"SheiButterSquare","date":"2015-09-24T01:50:10.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for replying!\n\nI currently use the Lantern of the Serpent and Underworld Poro Wards. Though I've noticed it while using various ones on the PBE as well.\n\nIt's pretty noticeable on regular wards. Like, the 75g ones.   But it's worse on trinket wards. \n\nYou described the problem way better than I did.","replies":[{"poster":"N0TAR","date":"2015-09-26T22:05:39.916+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ishinokao,\n\nUnfortunately, on trinket wards the unique ward SFX will not play!  You'll only hear it on Vision and Sight wards. This was a call made by the game play folk a while back if I remember correctly.  \n\nTo answer Rocxidi's question, here's is a list of all the wards that have unique SFX:\n\n- Amumu\n- Ascension (Shurima)\n- All Stars\n- Astro Poro\n- Bat-O Lantern\n- Battlecast\n- Battlecast Poro\n- Bouquet\n- Candy Cane\n- Deadfall\n- Dragon Slayer\n- Dragon Slayer Poro\n- Draven\n- Futball\n- Golden Goal\n- Gong\n- Gentleman Poro\n- Gingerbread\n- Haunting\n- HeartSeaker\n- Lunar Dragon\n- Mecha\n- Poro\n- Rammus\n- Riot\n- Season 4 Conquering\n- Season 4 Triumphant\n- Season 4 Victorious \n- Slaughter Fleet (Bilgewater)\n- Snowdown (2012)\n- Starcall\n- Underworld Poro (Shadow Isles)\n- Urf Triumphant\n- Widow\n\nSome wards have more recognizable sounds than others.  If you wanted to hear a ward with new SFX that \"sticks out\", I'd take a look at any of these:\n\n- Astro Poro (personal favorite): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW8WMUorw9A&t=0m30s\n- Heartseaker: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91OpytS3Zdc&t=0m5s\n- Urf Triumphant: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhQ45taKt_g&t=0m4s\n\nHope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"SheiButterSquare","date":"2015-09-27T01:34:52.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for for answering,\n\nThough, the volume of some wards is still disappointing.\n\nEdit:  Is there any possibility of wards with less noticeable sfx to be turned up?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rocxidi","date":"2015-09-23T05:54:44.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Outta curiosity, which ward skins should  have special sounds?
