I'd understand if Riot couldn't do anything about it seeing as no email can be provided, and he pretty much lost his account because he's an idiot, but he's 12. We feel bad for him, and now he's not allowed to play league ever again.\r\n\r\nI'd like to at least get his account removed so the jerk that stole it doesn't have a free ranked account. \r\n\r\nIf someone from riot reads this, any info would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Slanted23","date":"2016-09-08T22:57:00.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen similar posts that are nearly a year old with no responses, so i won't be surprised if no one reads this.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-08T23:10:20.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can definitely help you out if you write in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with as much info as you have on the account.
