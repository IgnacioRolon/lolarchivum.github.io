My ping showed 40-70 ms and I lagged out and it attempted to reconnect. After that failed for several minutes, I exited the game in hopes to reconnect......and now I cant connect to the server. The game is likely over by now and we likely lost, but is this someone cheating by spiking my lag? Or is it just a weird internet issue. I tested my connection using my Speedtest app and it had &lt;20 ping....pls help.{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-02T01:53:27.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes your network can just have issues getting a clean connection to specific servers, mostly it's caused by packet loss or some weird issues in the route your ISP is sending your data. \n\nThis specific instance almost sounds like the game might have crashed server side tbh. Did you see the reconnect button and it never worked, or did you just never actually have the reconnect option at all?","replies":[{"poster":"ThatDamnedYordle","date":"2017-11-02T02:04:39.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw the reconnect button after exiting the game, albeit a few seconds later than what I would've expected. Once I hit it, it tried to reconnect and popped up a message stating that it could not connect to the server. It asked me to check my network and retry, so I did and it continued to refuse connection.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-02T02:06:17.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alrighty, in that case I'd suggest that you check out this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for the steps on **Port Forwarding and DNS settings**. Those tend to be pretty successful in getting players a bit of a cleaner link with our servers.
