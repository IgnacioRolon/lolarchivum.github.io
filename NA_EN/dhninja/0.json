I love active discussion, after seeing these two things back to back I felt the need to make this topic, mostly because Fiora&#039;s my favorite champion. \r\n\r\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/NEHFEwmw-project-fiora-skin-hair-change?comment=000c\r\n\r\n&gt; [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=hV7ypmBn,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-21T23:16:50.694+0000)\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Hey Rhyak,\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; None of the PROJECt skins will have a toggle feature. (Sorry!) That said, PROJECT: Yi&#039;s voice processing does change when he is using Highlander.\r\n\r\nI can&#039;t help but see a whole bunch of other people throwing in their two cents involving color schemes changes for Project Lucian and the like. \r\n\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/2BbAZvck-can-we-fix-the-new-lucian-skin-without-getting-a-stupid-chroma-pack\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw anything involving a model get reworked there was a rather massive community consensus to see things changed and to an extent it was. But I&#039;ve also seen smaller things changed based off a single thread with a few up votes in other areas. \r\n\r\nAs far as I&#039;ve seen, I get the impression that if one comes across as too similar to another already in circulation or if the community out cry is loud enough a change takes place but other times it seems to be the aesthetic choices between the Rioters who created the skin versus the communities reception of it.  \r\n\r\nWhat kind of criticism brings about a change?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-28T17:13:58.914+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DHNinja,\n\nChanges are made on a case by case basis. Changes don't need to make it to the front page of the boards/Reddit to be considered. In fact, a lot of changes that are made come from suggestions made on the PBE boards. \n\nFor each skin, we gather feedback from several platforms. It's then compiled into a digestible e-mail for the group working on the skin to go over. We'll get together and discuss the feedback and make calls on what we'd like to change and what we're okay with keeping.  (If it's a bug, we'll fix it, so those aren't really discussed here.)\n\nIf there is something gameplay impacting - players think a particle isn't clear enough, we'll make changes. That's actionable feedback that we're more than happy to take and act upon to improve the skin.\n\nOther feedback is more subjective, and that's where we begin making calls on if we should change something. \n\nFor example, when we worked on Firecracker Jinx, there were some PBE comments about giving her a jade dragon tattoo. We hadn't thought of it, and we didn't realize players felt her tattoos were a huge part of who she was. We'd also removed her tattoos on Mafia Jinx, so this would have meant another skin without her tattoos. Based on that information, we were happy to make the change because we felt it was a great addition to the skin that enhanced the thematic in a meaningful way. \n\nIn regards to PROJECT: Fiora's hair, I gathered a ton of feedback about how players felt about her hair, and it was a pretty even 50/50 split. Some players really liked the different hair, since her other skins are similar in style. They also felt it with with the PROJECT: thematic. the other half of players didn't like the hair, and wanted it similar to the base. At the end of the day, we made the call to keep it the same because the consensus of players was 50/50, and we agreed that it fit in with the PROJECT: thematic.\n\nHope this explains things a bit more clearly. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to ask!","replies":[{"poster":"DHNinja","date":"2015-08-29T03:12:37.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=Eu2HwPhR,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-28T17:13:58.914+0000)\n>\n> Hey DHNinja,\n> \n> Changes are made on a case by case basis.
