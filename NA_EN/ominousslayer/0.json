And the part that I really don&#039;t understand what the game designer thinking is the part that losing games and get demoted. This is a team game and it was real that teammates keep feeding and being negative during the beginning of the game caused the game lost. I personally think that I don&#039;t deserve the demotion because I did really well throughout the past few games... yet demoted again by those players who disconnected or intentionally feeding. It is really unfair.\r\n\r\nNot to mentioned... there was a time in a promotion I got a bugged that kicked me out of champ selection. Riot didn&#039;t give me back my win, nor give me a promotion... This system is really unfair... please!","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-18T20:30:13.557+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you get promoted because the enemy team fed or got a DC, you wouldn't get the promotion annulled. That's why it's fair, because it happens to everyone and affects everyone equaly at one point or another.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-04-18T21:00:32.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then the system thinks that is about the area you settle in. It is possible to lose 7 matches at 0 lp and not be demoted. It just depends what the system thinks based on your stuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-04-18T20:24:34.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you have a few options to solve your problems. First off is being a more team oriented player. If you are consistently getting early leads then you can help snowball them into gold gains for your teammates. Usually the \"feeders\" are just slightly less skilled than their opponents, that can be fixed with a bit of gold. Gank their lane and help them get some kills, or even assists.\n\n Second you can get a premade. If you are queuing up with your team then the only one that you can blame is yourself if you have bad teammates. \n\nLastly, you can get so good that it doesn't matter how your team performs. Just get good enough to carry all of your games, sounds easy, right? Champion choice can be a key here, as some champions are more geared towards carrying while other champions are geared towards making up for deficits in your team when behind.\n\nIf you say that all of your losses are because of your team then you are saying that you don't have enough of an impact to change the outcome of your matches. You need to change the question from \"Why do my teams keep causing me to lose?\" to \"What can I do to help my team win?\".","replies":[]}]}
