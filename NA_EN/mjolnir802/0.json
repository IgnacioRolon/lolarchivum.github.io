Everybody says \"Make his minions targetable\"\n\nAnd I say \"If you can target them, then they will need health\"\n\nAnd if you give them health, then they will scale either off of his AP or his current Health.\n\nWhich means, instead of you just needing to wait 9 seconds for them to disappear, you'll have to wait until you KILL THEM.  And if you are a melee fighter, then you are stuck fighting Azir's soldiers until you kill them.  And he can summon another right after in 2-3 seconds if he has enough cooldown.\n\nSo, tell me. What's more broken? An untargetable minion who can't move on its own that lasts only 9 seconds?\nOr a minion that can get up to over 1k in health and lasts indefinitely until killed.  Because at that point, instead of 3, he can have 5 and more if you don't kill them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HexTechBomber","date":"2014-10-06T15:35:22.267+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually have to agree with you because (while it is considered like a turret) it does cause some bit of confusion when you hear it and I often find myself looking around and remembering that I just look up and see the logo Icon for the passive ability of his.

It's probably because I am noob, but I constantly attempt to summon soldiers outside of my W range. With most abilities, if u cast outside the range, your champ will move to a position where their range can reach where u clicked. I would like very much if Azir did this, instead of having to manually move him to within range and then clicking the ability.

Sometimes Azir will attack an enemy in range of his soldier or vice versa\n2. Sometimes Soldiers will not attack enemies in both azir's command range and their own\n3. Sometimes Soldiers will fail to hit targets they have completed an attack animation for (I don't understand this one)\n4. Sometimes Soldiers WILL NOT RESPOND TO command Q this is vital, it loses kills, it fails escapes and it misses cs (Seems to happen most often if you tell them to charge right after summoning them, if you do it to fast they seem to be dead to that command, just speculation)\n5. Many Champions seem to be able to pass through the wall that shouldn't, while others can't pass through that probably should\nI.E. Riven/fizz/tristana seem to regularly pass through the wall, esp riven i think because the units are displaced slightly when they rebound a champion, so sometimes enemies get caught between the soldiers and basically drive a wedge inbetween them pingponging until the wall is made useless. Also why does it rebound zeds shadow? Also why doesn't it push vlad in pool mode (because unit ignore?) That doesn't make sense because fizz/janna/kassadin can't walk through.\n6.) Azir's soldiers attack uncontrollably when azir is in a warded brush\n7.) Azir will summon tower bomb soldiers if you click anywhere within about 200units of a tower\n8.) Added onto the wall problems, just the act of the wall pushing an opponent backwards can cause ANY champ to pingpong enough to pass through the wall, and any champion with a hook will also fail more that half the time to be successfully rebounded away (often resulting in a broken wall as well)\n9.) Azir's turrets do not increase in damage as normal\n\nAlso, when I say the wall is broken, I mean the rebounding of a champion has scattered the soldiers in a formation such as\n\n--- _ ¯¯-- -- with dashes being soldier position, each vertical gap easily clearing or even projecting enemies through the cracks (I've had threshes get launched toward myself and my carry in a support role, this does not help anything)","replies":[{"poster":"Blancmark","date":"2014-10-08T15:06:23.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Many Champions seem to be able to pass through the wall that shouldn't, while others can't pass through that probably should\n>  I.E.

They aren't units. Kassadin (and Ezreal) can teleport over the wall, though.\nFizz's ability is a jump. I doubt it matters if he's untargetable or not. While he can jump over regular game walls, Azir's might bounce him off (something other walls in the game, regular and champ-created, aren't programmed to do).\nVlad sinks into a pool and basically flows through the ground underneath the soldier wall, and comes up on the other side. When considering what the wall is supposed to do, that actually makes sense.\n\nWhat about Gnar, though? Can he E over the wall? Can he use E to bounce off a sand soldier or the soldier wall? Does his R stun enemies knocked into Azir's soldier wall? Does Vayne's E stun enemies knocked into Azir's soldier wall?","replies":[{"poster":"OwlMechanic","date":"2014-10-08T19:41:12.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea with riven/trist/fizz the game actually tries to rebound them, but when it is in the pushing portion of the spell enemies traveling forward at highspeed (IE enemies in a dash) wind up being rebounded several times in quick succession (you'll notice multiple spark animations on the wall and the enemy champ will appear to fly higher and higher, during this process one of the soldiers will not move forward as much as the rest (the one doing the rebounds) and it will cause the wall to form a broken line, and sometimes will also cause the enemy champ to rebound between the displaced soldier and the regular soldier until they seem to simply appear on one side or the other (about 50% of the time they just wind up right next to you on your side).\n\n*Also Additional bug edit.\n\nSomeone in one of my games pointed out a very enlightening bit about azir bugs which actually seems to explain a whole lot.\n\n**Azir cannot order Q/E when under the effects of a SLOW** I haven't had a chance to test it much but that would explain why the escape always seems to fail when you are getting ganked... when you need it to work, because many champs employ slows to assist a gank.
