For some reason I got only the 1,000 IP but no skin, I think this might be because I advertised my refer a friend link, because I forgot I was not allowed too &gt;.&lt; and ended up getting my post deleted, I&#039;m not sure if this affected anything if Riot maybe thought I was getting ppl on this even though it was up for only a short time and had no comments yet. It has also been 2 days since I did this so I think it might be a bug, pls help- DeathlyMonkey","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-13T16:34:23.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nFor us to take a better look at your account and your referrals, please submit a [ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to Player Support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Espadara","date":"2015-08-13T05:30:16.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Send a ticket to Riot Support.
