I tried so hard but I&#039;m still in silver. But I never gave up trying to do better in every single game. And yes, I made it to S-I from S-III during preseason and hoping I can make it to Gold or maybe better in season 6. But the nightmare comes then.\r\n\r\nI just finished my placement matches, 7 wins, not that bad. But when I see the result where I am. %@#$@%@$#^%!!!!!!!! HOW CAN YOU PUT  ME INTO SILVER-V. WHY? WHY? WHY? That means I need to prom 4 times to go back to where I been fought for a whole month. And for me it&#039;s gonna take me another 2 month because I don&#039;t have that much time as in winter break.\r\n\r\nCan anyone explain how on earth dose the placement matches works and why you put me way behind where I belong. I mean, if I lost 5 or more matches, it&#039;s reasonable to put me behind, but when I playing placement matches, lots of my teammates was gold last season.(really easy to recognize thanks to the rim) and even 3 platinum players. I was glad that maybe I&#039;m qualified to play with this players. but when I saw the result, that huge sense of gap is driving me crazy!\r\n\r\nI just want an explanation how placement works in season 6, Did you guys changed some mechanisms? I had 6 wins last season ( back in china) and I was placed in the same rank level. This time I did better but the result is really unacceptable!","replies":[]}
