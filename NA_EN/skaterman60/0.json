Yesterday, I learned that someone hacked my account while I was taking a break from League and used 3rd party applications, resulting in a permanent ban. I submitted a ticket to Riot, but they aren't willing to lift the ban. This still seems surreal to me and I'll definitely miss playing. I know it's just a game but I met a lot of great friends and people through League that I'm extremely grateful for. I really wish I wouldn't have took a break that way I would've known someone hacked my account. Hopefully this will give some of you guys a laugh. Two years ago I was short 8 RP for Mecha Kha'Zix when it came on sale and Riot would grant me the missing RP if I drew something League of Legends related. Farewell everyone. \r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}} \r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4c0nb1U.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"XinCrin","date":"2016-11-03T02:59:07.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can always make a smurf","replies":[{"poster":"Skaterman60","date":"2016-11-03T05:21:41.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do have a second account but I don't have much time to grind out the IP for champs and runes anymore. I wouldn't feel like it's fun anymore either. The whole situation has been pretty draining, especially with the feeling of being helpless, getting the maximum punishment for something I didn't do and then it being nearly impossible to prove that it wasn't me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-11-03T02:54:30.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"this happened to a friend of mine not too long ago, if you ask them to take a closer look at it and give them the dates of when you started your haitus they will see that the 3rd party use happened during the break.  my friend got his penalties removed cuz his record was that he only played at certain times during the year and it showed his account was compromised out of his normal play period","replies":[{"poster":"Skaterman60","date":"2016-11-03T05:15:22.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried that but they said there was no evidence of my account being compromised and that it's my responsibility to manage my account. I said I started my break in July and the last match I played was Nexus Siege with a friend of mine. On the match history, the person who hacked my account started playing in September 25th all the way up to October 30th. I even asked about cross checking IP addresses to show that it was not me. I wasn't playing because of being busy with work and family and mentioned that in the ticket but I guess it didn't do me much good. I'm assuming you have to have very credible and obvious evidence that the account was compromised. Really sucks because I was really looking forward to the assassin update.","replies":[]}]}]}
