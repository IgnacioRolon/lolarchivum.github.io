Although I think it can be considered different when all of a sudden you start lag spiking for no reason. No one else uses the same wifi as me, I have a ping boosting software, and the settings for League are appropriately adjusted to ensure smooth gameplay. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted, reset the modem, everything. However I still get really bad ping spikes and they most often happen when around enemy players. Someone please explain what is causing this and how to fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"ECE","date":"2017-06-11T00:40:06.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can also check your ping before starting the game at http://deepfocus.io/lol_ping.php","replies":[]},{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-05-14T04:00:02.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem like you're on top of things trying to troubleshoot with this, so good work taking those steps!\n\nI don't think that your network is the problem here; more likely something is interfering with LoL's connection to our servers. Just to be safe, I want you to try using a hard wire connection if possible. It's **_ALWAYS_** better to use ethernet over wifi. Often, packets get lost a lot more often when players use wireless connections, which can result in lag spikes like you were describing.\n\nIf you still get them after that though, definitely try out the rest of our troubleshooting steps in our [**Connection Guide**](http://riot.com/12B7oac), and get back to me if you need any help after that. I'll be here on standby. ^_^","replies":[]}]}
