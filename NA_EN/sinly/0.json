Not sure if it's still okay here, let me know if I should remove it!**\n\nHeeeellloo Everyone\n\nLong time no see, hope everyone is well \n\nI'm writing on behalf of my partner today, we've noticed some unusual activity on his account. \nOver the last few days, someone has been logging into the account when we were online, subsequently signing out my boyfreind. \nHe sent in a support ticket, but so far he doesn't \"have enough info\" to verify that the account is his. The account was created in season 1 (6/7 YEARS ago) and so, understandably, he doesn't have much recollection about the 1st few champions hes purchased or the exact date the account was created. He lost access to his original sign up email and also the current email that a password reset link would go to. \nWe've also spent a LOT of money on this account, but our credit card details apparently don't match up or do match up but is insufficient. Most of it would have been gifts from myself or my roommate. \n\nI'm not sure what more evidence is required to prove it is his account? He doesn't want to risk playing ranked games, and is worried about potentially having his entire account stolen and sold. \n\nThe person using the account hadn't played any games but then last night, they logged in and spent around 10,000 IP on champions before logging out. This was not my partner purchasing, and he's mad that ARAMs will be even worse now (lol) \n\nHe can send his photo ID and evidence of being able to access the account if that helps? \nAny information about what else we could do is appreciated.\n\n\nThanks heaps! \nSinly ~","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-21T21:32:28.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you've already been assigned an account specialist, I recommend continuing to work with them on this. I know for older accounts, it can be hard to remember certain information, but a best guess is far better than leaving the question without an answer. A photo ID may or may not help, you'll want to consult the agent that's working on the ticket with you.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
