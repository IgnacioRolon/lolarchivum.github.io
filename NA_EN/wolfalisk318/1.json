But if he doesn't run in at some point, he doesn't deal damage. So it's not per-say \"mechanical\" skill, but it requires more skill than some other champs on knowing the optimal time to run in, the optimal time to zhonya during fights, which enemies to run after if they split up, which target to pull in if chasing several people who split up, etc.\n\nNow, played at MAX potential, sure maybe a yas requires some high skill, but to play an average yasuo actually takes probably less skill than to play some other champions.

Being right? Please tell me what you do when Lee invades you? You have to run away. You cant duel him and post 6 he can and WILL do 80% of your health with a full combo because you are one of the squishiest junglers in the game. Nidalee is literally only good if she&#x27;s a better early game jungler than her competition and as it stands after all the nerfs she&#x27;s gotten her early game isn&#x27;t THAT much better than Nocturnes.\n\nI main Nidalee, I would know if he would be a threat or not.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2018-07-01T21:58:15.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yas is one of the few \"high skill cap champs\" that gets worst the higher elo he is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GodlyBane","date":"2018-07-01T17:42:51.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You said it yourself they need to be played effectively, but in bronze/silver zed and yasuo dont exactly NEED to be played effectively and so, they do good in low elo","replies":[]},{"poster":"EkyonKun","date":"2018-07-01T11:48:19.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried out Zed to see if this high skill requirement held true. And I have to say his E can drain his energy like he just ran a goddamn marathon. But other than that, he's kinda face-rolly in lane. \n\nOutside of lane I found it kinda pointless to dive into team fights because I'd see GAs and Zhonya's/Stopwatches and just kept getting cockblocked while trying to do my job of bursting squishies. I also realized that Zhonya's/GA doesn't mean a whole lot to him in a 1v1. It's only in a team fight where it's really a pain to deal with. In a 1v1, he can just wait out the untargetability and burst them a second time. So I just kinda split pushed and hoped a lone squishy would come to try and stop me. Though without attack speed or auto attack steroids, he's a lot slower at taking towers than say {{champion:24}} or {{champion:75}} .\n\nZed in team fights DOES have a high skill floor because you have to deal with CC, being burst immediately after ulting, using your shadows to dodge skillshots, making sure your ult actually manages to kill a carry, making sure you have enough energy to do what you need to do. And a lot of the times when I tried using my ult to teleport back to safety, I found someone waiting for me to either kill me or lock me down after I used up all my energy trying to kill someone else. So I eventually stopped feeling as safe as I thought I would be.\n\nSo, from experience, Zed vs most standard mid laners requires very little skill to play at an adequate level, while mid-late game you kinda have to think about what you're doing. Just my 2 cents though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tykenn","date":"2018-07-01T10:16:46.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to keep in mind that being good at a champion, and being good at league.

I believe they are all pretty strong at the moment though bc low elo players do about as much easier to play champions with better stats.
