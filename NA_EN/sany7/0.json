There's also Co-op vs. AI, not to mention that your mmr would fairly quickly adjust and match you with similarly skilled players.

Those things are much more difficult to detect and prove intent for than simple chat offenses. From [Riot Tantram:](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/wsObUaFj-if-tyler1?comment=00010001000000000000) \n\n> It really breaks down into two categories.\n> \n> 1.) Helping players reform\n> 2.) Shielding others from the behavior, at a cost.\n> \n> We used to issue chat restrictions that essentially scaled indefinitely. \n> \n> We were able to determine that after a certain point the penalty no longer helped with reform. The 10-game and 25-game counts for chat restrictions are based on data that they were both light enough, and felt strict enough to encourage people to understand their behavior is unacceptable in game and change it.\n> \n> We also saw that the players in this 'large restriction' category defaulted to gameplay altering means of harassing their team. It caused an increase in feeding and trolling.\n> \n> The sample size of this population and time frame is huge. Essentially the time spanning from the introduction of chat restrictions to the introduction of IFS.\n> \n> So my question for you is, would you rather have more feeders and less negative chat?\n\nIf someone isn't gonna behave properly despite being given multiple chances to do so then why shouldn't they be removed from the game?\n\nAlso, toxic customers drive business away from the game much like they do irl. To quote [Kei143](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/mmh6PidR-the-dreaded-downvoteers-in-this-discussion-board?comment=0001000100000000000100000004): \n\n>When Riot permabans someone, their philosophy is \"the chances of this guy reforming isn't a whole lot, we'd rather not have him in the game\". Thus in their eyes, they have already written off the toxic player as a paying client.\n\n>From a business standpoint, do they want to remove the toxic guy who has spent $500 but is causing a negative environment for 4-9 other players in every game? Those non-toxics are also spending $500 and probably will spend more, promote the game more when they are enjoying the game AND they won't cause a negative environment.\n\n>I personally think it is a fine argument to protect the ones that are paying money and aren't toxic rather than protecting the ones that may pay the same amount but are toxic.\n\nFinally you may dislike playing bots but I personally find it enjoyable, but again if you don't want to make a new account then that's your choice not mine.\n\nP.S. On a side note judging by your tone in your most recent comment and how you say toxic players shouldn't be punished it makes me think you're not truly reformed and are just acting like you are to avoid taking responsibility for your actions. If that's truly the case then that's even more reason not to unban you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-20T02:04:55.497+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"If the ban was justified, they don't lift it.
