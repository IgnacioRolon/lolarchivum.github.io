Support is a great example. A lot of supports end up being heal bots, and spam healing allies that aren't dealing a whole lot of damage isn't going to amount to much. If instead you take a champion that can be powerful on a support's gold and exp budget, you're going to have a major impact on the game. \n\nPersonally, this is one thing I really enjoy about playing Pantheon as a support. Get two or three kills / assists on him, buy some Mobility Boots and a Serrated Dirk, hit level 6, and you're a global threat. \n\nSimilarly with Bard. Learn the pattern for when is the proper time to leave your carry bot so you can roam to collect chimes. This gives you great mobility, mana sustain, and supplemental experience. When you accumulate enough chimes you can deal about as much damage as your carry, and the mobility allows you to keep side lanes pushed and get back to your team for fights. Remember, that pushing minion waves basically work as an extra champion on your team. While you're fighting with your team over lane control or objectives, your minions will work their way to the enemy tower, or the enemy team needs to send someone to deal with them, giving your team the numbers advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2020-02-03T15:24:57.440+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nope, sorry.

It is also probably the most popular and most competitive role. Mid-meta champions also tend to have the steepest level of difficulty. Further, the best mid carries require the ability to influence the rest of the map through roaming. \n\nBottom might be the next most familiar role to someone that plays support, but it is also one of the easiest roles to get tilted off the face of Runeterra from. With as much priority on Dragon, Bottom has the most pressure to establish lane presence, and there is the most punishment for misplaying. \n\nLastly, Top ... Pretty feast or famine. One top laner bullies the other into the fetal position, or you go even until team fights start.

Your team will lose some times because of the individuals on it making god awful decisions far outside of your control.
