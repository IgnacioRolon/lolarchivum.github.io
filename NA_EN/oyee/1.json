Getting demoted out is 1 thing but that means your mmr has dropped big time and your lp gains compared to loss are going to be fucked.... \n\nMaybe play flex queue for awhile if you want to play ranked? It's kind of like ranked normals lol. \n\nAll I know is in season 6 when I first finally got gold I decided to play on multiple accounts to play different roles. Well actually it was dynamic queue season which was just basically flex queue for everyone there was no solo/duo that seaosn. So I ranked 1 account up to likd gold 3 then started playing with friends on it and it slowly deranked to gold 5 0 lp lol. Then I kept playing different shit on it and losing and eventually I even started playing my main champs and couldn't win. And this was when I had 2 other accounts in gold with over 50% win rates 1 with 57% lol.... And holy fuck I mean I kept it in gold during season cuz I stopped playing ranked on it for the rewards but played during preseason and I instantly dropped back to silver 1 then... I just kept losing. I would lose like 22 or more lp a game and win like 14...15.... it was hell. So yea that account was fucked until next season reset.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RadeticDraws","date":"2019-08-26T17:07:48.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if gold is your desired elo that you think you belong in for this season then feel free to play normals\nthat red shield means nothing since you are not in diamond and there is no decay","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pxerkza","date":"2019-08-26T15:24:04.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you enjoy playing ranked? \n> Yes?\n- keep playing\n> No?\n-Stop playing","replies":[{"poster":"Oyee","date":"2019-08-26T15:28:03.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pxerkza,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4k61w10G,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-08-26T15:24:04.804+0000)\n>\n> do you enjoy playing ranked? \n> - keep playing\n> -Stop playing\n\nI mean i like playing rankeds but i get stressed i love the competitive scenario tbh","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-26T15:17:17.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that suppose to be a notice that your rank will decay?
