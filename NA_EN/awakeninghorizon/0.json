The current account i'm posting from was made 6 years ago, the original summoner name is FallenSkyress but now its AwakeningHorizon. I haven't changed the summoner name since the first one I bought and that was years ago. \r\n\r\nI know for a fact that I made this summoner name AwakeningHorizon was last year. I have emails showing this account that I log in with was made 6 years ago. If Riot wants to give the account a check from the changes they can go right ahead that would help me out. \r\n\r\nI know that I didn't write this very well but i'm just lost right now, I tried every username possible that I can remember with every password I've ever used and still have no luck trying to log into it. Hopefully this isn't confusing..(Even though it is)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-16T22:27:29.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ouch, that's definitely not good!

I'm really stressing at the moment because I absolutely have no idea whats going on.\n\nAlso, i'm sending a \"forgot username\" to a different email and i'm not receiving an email.. I don't think this should be happening\n","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-19T22:58:22.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there may be issues reaching the right account, then.
