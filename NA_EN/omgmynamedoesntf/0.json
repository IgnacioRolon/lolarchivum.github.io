And I found out something very confusing. First, I chose \"Quick + Self-cast\", because I thought \"Quick\" means \"Smart-cast\". But it doesnt. The difference between \"Self-cast\" and \"Quick + Self-cast\" is:\r\n\r\nWith \"Self-cast\", whenever you press the hotkey, spell is casted on you no matter what. It is also a smart-cast.\r\n\r\nAnd if you're using \"Quck + Self-cast\", your spells will be casted on you **BUT** if you have your cursor on top of an ally, spell will be casted on him. I find that a little bit confusing, especially the \"Quick\" part.\r\n\r\nRiot Games talked about clarity in the game. And I don't see how \"Quick\" means that you still can cast spells on allies even when pressing a special button(hotkey), if your cursor is on top of them. \r\n\r\nIt is a very little thing, however, it is a bit confusing for the new players, and even the old ones like me. Using the \"Quick + Self-cast\" option, ruined at least 2 games and about 10 kills/death for me. Because I casted my spells on allies instead of myself. \r\n\r\nSorry for grammar mistakes, english is not my first language.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-07-12T01:31:48.392+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are four ways to cast spells:\n\n1.

I mean as a tip, like the one you get on loading screen. Or make it a message that appears when your cursor is on top of that setting. Because, to be fair, word \"Quick\" still doesnt provide enough information for what it actually does and can cause confusion.","replies":[]}]}]}
