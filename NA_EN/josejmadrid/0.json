But I've also had this not happen, frequently as have others here in the forum. So there's an issue here. It's anecdotal evidence and if you could keep a sheet of reports to punishment notifications it would be more helpful.\n\n>Sigh...even my 4 year old cousin understands what that short term means.\n\nBeen online for 13 years, have talked to people all over the world and have never heard this term.
