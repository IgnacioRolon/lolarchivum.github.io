I told my friend to download it so him and I could start playing together. All of a sudden when it was downloading it said league crashed. He tried opening it again, but it didn&#039;t work. He told me he was going to eat lunch, then 5 minutes later he contacts me and he said that it broke his hard drive. Help please, I don&#039;t know what happened. I read some forums and people said that the pc is probably bad and drive is busted. Some soultions were for hp pcs, but my friend has a dell. Please Help.{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-08-14T23:23:12.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The drive was probably already on its way out, installing a game just involved using the drive when it needed to not be strained. I highly doubt the game would do anything to the hard drive other than take up space like any other game would.\n\nSucks that the drive broke though, I feel for your amigo and I hope he had a backup drive with all his important files stored.","replies":[]},{"poster":"COBRA C0MM4NDER","date":"2018-08-14T23:08:43.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"League wouldn't break  a drive.

Sometimes HDDs just die, especially cheap ones. They are rather fragile devices compared to non-mechanical drives.\n\nHP and Dell are just brands, the stuff inside has nothing to do with that. A hard drive is a hard drive, they are more or less all the same.\n\nThat said, you cant fix a dead drive without special equipment and knowledge. drive-restoration by professionals often costs hundreds of dollars per drive, at the least.\n\nI am quite experienced with hardware and software, i can provide assistance if you can provide as much information as possible, mainly:\n\n* Exact model or list of parts in the computer\n\n* What happens when the computer is turned on, in detail - how far does it get, what errors does it display, does it make any sounds?\n\n* What OS and software is installed, have there been any previous issues with malware?\n\n* Has the drive been making any grinding, chirping or clicking noises during operation?","replies":[]}]}
