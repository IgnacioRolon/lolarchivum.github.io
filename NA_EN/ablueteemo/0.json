The ticket is one in which I am trying to gain access to my account which for some reason I cannot login to. I made the mistake of adding more comments bumping my ticket, not knowing that it would cause my ticket to be sent to the back of the queue, my fault no excuses there. So on the advice of others on a previous post I made about this issue on the boards, I sent a second ticket in hopes of getting a faster response. Whilst Its true I got a response all I got from it was no help and that I would have to wait on a response on the now week old ticket, I'm getting beyond frustrated with this issue, I just want some help PLEASE riot.\n\nP.S. this is an alt account and I made years ago incase anyones wondering\n\nEdit: I know this post may come across rude and whiny and I'm sorry for the passive-aggression but I feel like I'm being messed around at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-13T15:38:28.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have a lot of visibility on EU queues, but NA has had a higher volume this week as we draw closer to the end of the season.
