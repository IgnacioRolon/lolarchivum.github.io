So I was playing a game in normals, then after my support and add died ONE TIME. They afked. LeBlanc on the other team asked where out bot lane was. I said they were both afk. I then asked if they could report them please. She said no Ill honor them. I got so mad. So of course I started to say that's soon wrong. Later she got her teammates to ALL report me for racism (What??? I didn't say anything racist) and harassment. Im done. The sad part is I probably will get chat restricted cause Riot doesn't look at the reports.","replies":[{"poster":"balbraaksel","date":"2015-01-01T02:55:43.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Asking others to report someone is toxic behaviour on it's own and will get you banned if it's reported.\nYou should just decide for yourself who for what you report and keep it at that.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-01-01T02:58:45.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It depends on the situation. If you use reporting to coerce people to do/not do something, that is harassment and a bannable offense; just telling people to report someone who actually needs reporting is not (again, depending on the situation).","replies":[{"poster":"balbraaksel","date":"2015-01-01T03:04:48.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I'm pretty sure it's all together considered toxic behaviour, especially since 1 report or 4 reports doesn't really matter making it more a form of needless harrassment to ask others to report someone.\n\nUnless everything's changed.","replies":[{"poster":"fwL7umeoQe","date":"2015-01-01T03:16:17.290+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you'd be very happy if you had two people sitting in base the entire game.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-01-01T02:56:35.168+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then make a support ticket and leave it alone.
