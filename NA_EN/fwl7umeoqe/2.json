Either way, you kinda cannot really ruin NA's reputation when we are considered the worst region to attend worlds essentially. And we also have bad games too. Does Fnatic's loss to C9 mean that they officially ruined EU's reputation? No, they messed up. Maybe there is a better team in that group in particular. CLG probably just had a few bad games. I saw some errors they did those games that I have not seen in some time. They lost once and it was downhill from there. \n\nOverall, if I have gained anything from this, it is that you are a jerk. All the banwagoners (not assuming you are) ditch so fast on the forums....","replies":[]}]}
