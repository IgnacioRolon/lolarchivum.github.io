No no no no no... Darius isn't that OP, especially in pro level play. (He's even being nerfed more). He did so well because they build an entire team around Darius. If it wasn't for their strategies and careful play none of those picks would've mattered.

The only thing that keeps me from supporting them is their boring playstyle. Tower siege for 30 mins, don't do teamfights and maybe push an inhib without the enemy team being able to react to it. Yes, it brings them wins, but it's boring as hell to watch.","replies":[{"poster":"Mat7itan","date":"2015-10-04T17:56:46.703+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why shouldn't a team be built around a top laner?

Thats what all the other teams made wrong. \nYou build a strong 4 man team, then you pick Darius.\nWith only 5 Champions, the enemy team can either stop Darius OR stop the 4 man team, but not both.","replies":[{"poster":"HexaDecimel","date":"2015-10-05T15:00:22.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that if worlds has shown us anything it is that building a team around Darius is one of the only ways you can get Darius to work on the pro level. Its obvious that Darius, despite how often he has been picked, has so far not been the best pick at Worlds. He has been on the losing side for a lot of the matches and even when his team wins he still hasn't made a huge impact.\n\nThe mistake that the teams first picking Darius made, and the casters mentioned this constantly, was that once they picked him they gave him no priority in the match. Nothing was done to ensure that the top laner could succeed. A lot of players have been able to shut him down. So it seems odd to bash the team that finally showed why Darius keeps getting first picked.  And who is saying that C9 didn't build a strong four man team? They got Azir, Lee Sin, Tristana, and Morgana, all of those picks look pretty good if you ask me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Solaxo","date":"2015-10-04T22:24:25.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MadKnife IV,realm=EUW,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=i4mr1O6t,comment-id=000000020000,timestamp=2015-10-04T17:04:32.501+0000)\n>\n> Don't act like you guys aren't doing that either.
