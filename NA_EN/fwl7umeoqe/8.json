He was repeating over and over &quot;we are trash&quot; &quot;Lmao Twitch is the worst Gold player I&#039;ve seen&quot; &quot;Wow you guys suck&quot; and other crap like that. Now, the funniest part was, _HE ADMITTED TO TROLLING MULTIPLE TIMES._\n\nWas I getting upset and mad at him? Of course. How can I sit their and let him bash all of us for playing the game. I&#039;m not going to take that trash talk like a bitch. I&#039;m fighting back for me and my friends dude. Was it really bannable for what I was saying. Honestly no. I know people that literally scream at people and call them the N word. \n\nI REALLY wanted to change as a person this new season, but HOLY MOLY that guy set me off. The fact that I got banned trying to defend myself and the Talon that admitted to trolling didn&#039;t is unacceptable. I wouldn&#039;t say anything unless he spoke first. And boy did he have a lot to tell us.\n\nHe even tried to act like he was an innocent little nice guy in post game chat. Fucking disgusting man.","replies":[{"poster":"Kao Atlantis","date":"2015-11-12T23:19:35.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dealing wth people who are toxic is rough. I have had to deal with it before, and it's never any fun. Sorry you had to go through that. \n\nHowever, I would remind you that [retaliation is not okay](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/IBLxXQz9-wrongful-ban?comment=0016) in League of Legends. The reason for this is that it punishes the rest of the people who aren't being toxic on your team, and generally just breeds even more toxic behaviour. It's counter-productive because the people who are raging or trolling want you to get mad. If you respond to them you are just letting them win.\n\nIn the end, if you realiate you will both get punished. The best thing to do when someone starts exhibiting this kind of behaviour toward you or any of your friends is to mute them, and report them at the end of the game. I know it makes your angry, and it can be hard to ignore, but responding to them will just cause you **both** to get punished. So mute them then report them, and let the person who deserves to be punished get dealth with.\n\nIf you follow the [Summoner's Code](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/), and keep exhibiting the [Behaviour Worthy of a Champion](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751874-Behavior-Worthy-of-a-Champion), you will never risk getting punished.\n\nHope your future games go better.","replies":[{"poster":"fwL7umeoQe","date":"2015-11-12T23:26:07.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that but the worst part about it is that he escapes with no consequences and started to act like an angel post game so he could manipulate the enemy team and turn them against me.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2015-11-13T00:20:14.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Catch This,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=4dHU6Elq,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-11-12T23:26:07.865+0000)\n>\n> I understand that but the worst part about it is that he escapes with no consequences and started to act like an angel post game so he could manipulate the enemy team and turn them against me.\n\nno, you reported him and he'll get his due course.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kao Atlantis","date":"2015-11-13T00:05:58.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People who act like that get caught eventually.

It is well established that retaliation is not acceptable in league. Muting is defending yourself, encouraging your friends to mute is defending them. Most other things are just striking back.\n\nMute/ignore and report at the end. There is no reason to lower yourself to their level. You are also giving them exactly what they want by responding, they are trying to get a rise out of you.","replies":[{"poster":"fwL7umeoQe","date":"2015-11-12T22:49:22.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The dude literally started calling me trash for being 2/4/3 at the start, and then called both friends trash because they didn't suicide to help him.

This makes me think of the many times I did Not report someone who said sorry after the game...after spending sometimes on this board I realized that Not matter what if I feel like someone deserved a report I report from now on. \n\nHere is the thing though, your one away from a perma-ban and I'm hoping that some of us here can help you understand and Not get that.

That would piss me off also,,,but the difference is I don't feel like a 'bitch' when this happens and I ask 1 time nicely for them to stop then I play the game supporting the picked on player as much as I can and still play to win. \n\nThe difference is I don't feel like I need to ask more then once, I then have made my point after the game I can choice to report and then I Know that I won't be the one getting a punishment. That in itself is a satisfying feeling. \n\n Please mute/ and report after the game, complaining back only makes it worse it never makes it funner for anyone except maybe the person who started it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2015-11-12T22:46:10.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"You're not allowed to defend yourself.
