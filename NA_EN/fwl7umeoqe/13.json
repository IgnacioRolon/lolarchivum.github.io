Add to this that the championship skin is an adc as well (in what has been described as the least adc focused season in history) and it really feels lackluster.\n\nTo elaborate a bit on what I mean by uniqueness and meta changing I feel that Viktor serves as a pretty good example, while he was disabled (due to bugs) in competitive play for quite a while, Viktor showed in this season that immobile mages are viable (while mobility was/is all the rage), he also showed the success of the \"new\" mini reworks that are done more frequently now to champions. Last but not least I also can't help but feel that this season was as good as a season we'll ever see where there was a chance of Victorious (or Viktorious) Viktor while Sivir will be just as much of an impact next season and likely the next after that, just like the seasons before.\n\nJust my 2cents on the situation, I'm sure lots of other players have their champ to exchange for Viktor, but who it could be isn't really the point just that the one that was chosen is so bland and not season defining (as it could be for any season).","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-10-02T20:48:44.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If i can respond to a question with a question, how are the victorious skins determined now?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Galetta","date":"2015-10-02T21:10:12.512+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=sixdogman,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=MFmilzXi,comment-id=00060002,timestamp=2015-10-02T20:48:44.049+0000)\n>\n> If i can respond to a question with a question, how are the victorious skins determined now?\n\nRight now the main criteria is impact in professional and ranked play during the season.

Ezreal or Urgot come to mind for bringing smite outside the jungle, and shutting down the assassin meta that we had going in to season 5 respectively. Sivir may have been the defining ADC for a while, but it was only because she had the hard engage that the tank meta needed.

I'll admit off the bat I may not be the best person to ask because I stopped playing Ranked a while ago - I didn't have the kind of time commitment for it and I found it less enjoyable. Which is sad, because I actually really like Sivir.\n\nBut as a loooong time League player I thought I'd throw my two cents in. As many others have stated the problem with choosing based on \"impact\" is the subjective nature of what that means. I actually think you guys did a pretty good job choosing though - Sivir definitely had a very specific presence in the games she was in. What I was going to say is that which ever way you guys go, the only thing I would *not* want to see is just a popularity-based decision. For example if Vayne had gotten the skin purely on the fact that she's been such a constant presence, that would have left a sour taste in my mouth. Pick rates/ban rates/win rates are too closely tied to the rise and fall of nerfs and buffs, and those Champs who most benefit from those changes and inevitably get called out as OP.\n\nThat said, other than \"not just popular\", I don't really know what the best metric would be. I think you guys have done a good enough job as it is so I'd be fine with it staying the course.\n\nThinking about it more though, I think it *would* be most fitting to try to find the \"quintessential\" Champion of that Season - but it seems like that would almost always be a Popularity kind of thing, since the Champions that best benefits from the current season's meta will inevitably have inflated pick/ban/win rates.\n\nWith Lore starting to make a comeback it would be interesting to see how it could be tied with that, but may not be the best solution.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Interact","date":"2015-10-03T00:12:26.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you guys should stick to the criteria you have right now.

Impactful, useful, sure. But BORING. Compare Tahm Kench's personality to Kalista's.\n\n When I get to gold I hope for a character I CARE about to get a shiny. The only one so far I even sort of care about is Janna, which I missed by 15 elo (rage). When Jinx was initially theorized to be a recipient I was *stoked*. This was when Ashe was relevant and even Ashe would have been fine. But Sivir? Everybody's being put to sleep by this announcement because nobody LIKES Sivir. Her gameplay's fine, her character just isn't there. There's a Victorious Urgot thread around here somewhere and even THAT would be better than Sivir because it would be unexpected enough to be interesting. Sivir, from a character perspective, is boring. Jinx is interesting as well as fun, which is why I wanted her to get it. \n\n Further, these skins are similar to other skins! Championship Kalista looks like her base if it was a bit more solid (and a bit more blue). Victorious Sivir's very likely going to look like Warden Sivir with her face exposed unless the blue and gold color scheme shifts somehow. Even Championship Shyvana looks quite similar to Ice Drake. A shiny blue Jinx skin would have been different. Now it's likely to be 3-5 years before Jinx even comes up again.\n\n Obviously you will never please everyone with these reward skins. Why not make two and offer a choice? Why not allow older skins to be chosen instead? (I would straight trade Vic Morg -and- Sivir for Janna, and I'd throw in some other super rares too!) To be quite honest, if you had announced that Sivir was getting the skin at the beginning of the season I wouldn't have even bothered. But I'm sure that's why you wait until the end.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheGreyNoble","date":"2016-10-01T23:45:46.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Galetta,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=MFmilzXi,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-10-02T20:36:06.654+0000)\n>\n> Yo!\n> \n> I just wanted to pop in an say some things! \n> \n> I can understand people being upset because a champion they play didn&#x27;t get picked or that they feel another champion deserved it more.
