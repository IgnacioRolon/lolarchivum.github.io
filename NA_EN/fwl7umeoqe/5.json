I thought I was doing really well at first. Then after the game they said I sucked when I went 0/3/28. I don't know I think that was pretty good. But they're always complete jerks so I can't even tell if they're serious. Then, when I look at their match history they aren't too great either. Like my one friend mains support and he didn't do as good. So, did I do ok or not?","replies":[{"poster":"Marthian","date":"2014-10-17T22:18:46.266+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They were jerks.

Did you kill their nexus? If yes, 1 to 0 you're better than them. Did they kill yours? 0 to 1 i guess 0/3/28 wasn't good enough.\n\nFor real though, score doesn't matter, even if it is an indicator of value added","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2014-10-17T22:17:23.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a pretty great score, don't listen to them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PandanDragon","date":"2014-10-18T10:59:42.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's all depends on how much each assist contributed to the game, if you just did one AA and ran away then I kinda agree with your friends, if you did really well, peeling for your team/shielding poke, etc then kudos to you for doing well, playing support and you definitely deserve that score. :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"aaronautumn","date":"2014-10-18T03:42:07.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People always like to put players down when they do well, not sure why but I guess they don't like to see others be happy. lel","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZeroAnarchy","date":"2014-10-17T23:54:45.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is extremely good for a support, You didn't take any kills which isn't what a support should do unless you're morgana or zyra, and you contributed a ton to the team's victory.

Seems like you did fine, being a part of 23 kills and winning the game appears like you didn't suck in that game. Just shrug it off and back to the rift, senpai will eventually notice your part in the victories.","replies":[]},{"poster":"2CJTP6","date":"2014-10-17T22:32:40.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they were trolling you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pvt Yong Tai","date":"2014-10-17T22:14:33.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't mind anyone who says that, because chances are they aren't very good themselves.
