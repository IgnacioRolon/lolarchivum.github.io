But there are comments calling Dyrus a fat fucking loser, saying they are glad he retired, 0-10, FreeSM, Na is trash, stay salty... The worst part is that nobody is moderating this cesspool. \r\n\r\nThis shit is just rediculous. If anyone is salty it's the rabid EU fanboys for finding it funny to say that stuff.

That's like degrading athletes via messaging or emails or something after they do poorly. It's just unnecessary And rude.","replies":[{"poster":"Archon X","date":"2015-10-13T12:50:05.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he's a public figure because he plays on a stream so it's fair game to call him out on his performance\n\nif he wants to be a private citizen then sure, it would be wrong to call him at home\n\nbut having a public stream specifically relating to his ability to play league makes it completely relevant to comment on said ability","replies":[{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2015-10-13T12:54:22.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Archon X,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=IXFd8j9L,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2015-10-13T12:50:05.484+0000)\n>\n> he's a public figure because he plays on a stream so it's fair game to call him out on his performance\n> \n> if he wants to be a private citizen then sure, it would be wrong to call him at home\n> \n> but having a public stream specifically relating to his ability to play league makes it completely relevant to comment on said ability\n\nIt's still rude to do so. The point of a stream is just to showcase him playing a game, not a reaction forum to the past. \n\nAlso, yet again, calling him a fat fucking loser is not acceptable. Doesn't matter if he went 0-20 every worlds game, bringing in his physical appearance is both ad hominem and just unfair to him.","replies":[{"poster":"Archon X","date":"2015-10-13T13:14:39.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"professionals shouldn't be shaken by such comments\n\ninstead of worrying about what is 'ad hominem' that you learned in your community college freshman intro to philosophy class, tell him to git gud","replies":[{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2015-10-13T16:20:03.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Archon X,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=IXFd8j9L,comment-id=00000001000000000000,timestamp=2015-10-13T13:14:39.173+0000)\n>\n> professionals shouldn't be shaken by such comments\n> \n> instead of worrying about what is 'ad hominem' that you learned in your community college freshman intro to philosophy class, tell him to git gud\n\nBased on your content, I'd question who went to community college lol.

Perhaps spend more time on the forums about how Dyrus is a loser, and should accept any comments towards him (and having seen you on every Dyrus thread, I assume you're trying very hard). He's retired, and the OP never said Dyrus was reacting to the negative comments, he's just disgusted everyone's beating a dead horse - much like yourself.\n\nIt's unsportsmanlike, unempathic, and worse of all - it's mean spirited. \n\nStill, you keep up the good work and gather attention with your unpopular and edgy opinions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FHMarshy","date":"2015-10-13T14:43:37.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am actually really really really sad that Dyrus retired :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Savage Devi","date":"2015-10-13T12:20:27.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">This shit is just rediculous.
