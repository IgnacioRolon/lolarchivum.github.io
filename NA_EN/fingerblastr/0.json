I am trying to install the game/patches on a new computer yet sometimes the client will say \"trying to reconnect\" or something along those lines.  The real problem is when it can't reconnect and I am forced to exit the client.  When I do this though, the entire download has to restart from the beginning.  Any help with remedying this would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"HUGEBALLS","date":"2017-10-06T18:26:07.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey, can you please look at my recent post my display is crashing after exiting the match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-06T18:21:07.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your connection is pretty unstable and can't keep up.  :/  It's disconnecting you from multiple services including the game server and those in the client.
