I am not a toxic player and I really don't care about stats and all that, but I think the reason why i'm not having fun is because i'm really bad. Of course it may also just be that LoL just isn't my type of game but is their a way to have fun without actually getting good at the game? You could argue that no game is fun when your bad at it, but I never really got good at dark souls and I still have a pretty decent time with it. Maybe i'm missing something because all i'm doing is staying in my lane and breaking or defending turrets. Btw this is not a hate thread towards LoL, I just really want to know if getting good makes the game better or if LoL just isn't my type of game. Also I have no clue why i'm only allowed to post in the tft board, this post is for all of LoL except for tft","replies":[{"poster":"Charmy Bird","date":"2019-09-02T00:10:52.597+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"To have fun now you have to get a cheesy champion and try hard like there's no tomorrow even if it's normal","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lapis","date":"2019-09-02T11:03:06.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll be honest with you, it takes time to fall in love with this game. I can't guarantee you that it'll happen, but it took a long time for me. Levelling up was frustrating, there's so much to learn in this game and for the most part the game doesn't teach you it. Once you figure out enough to feel like your head is staying above water, you might start having fun. Or you might not! But since you're willing to try I get the feeling you might enjoy it if you stuck with it.\nAlso, the quality of the games does go up once you level into better matchmaking. At your level, people seem to just stay in their lane until they get to the nexus. Once people learn that they can roam and gank I find it gets more interesting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xelaker","date":"2019-09-01T21:08:21.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fun comes from the addiction and rose tinted glasses gazing upon that one time you got a penta with only teemo shrooms after a lost fight for baron\n {{sticker:sg-jinx}} \n\nMy enjoyment came from improvement and (in ye olden days of yore) the slow, but not turtle pace of the game. As you learn more about the game more stuff clicks into place and stuff runs smoother. I'm sure everyone has stories about dumb stuff they did when they started the game, and can laugh at just how awful they were back then.\n\nAlso the game is full of little wins that give lots of little positive feedback loops. Oh boy I got a kill, oh boy gold, oh boy items, and so on. You stick around for those and slog through the ocean of poo that is League of Legends.","replies":[{"poster":"kribules","date":"2019-09-02T03:44:06.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so in ur opinion, is league worth investing time in?","replies":[{"poster":"xelaker","date":"2019-09-03T02:39:44.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you enjoy the loop, sure.\n\nIt requires a bit more effort to keep up with meta's and champ builds, roles, and abilities. Good peeps are gonna learn the basics of all the roles as well. The community is 87% awful as well, and in half your matches everything was your fault from wave 1 to nexus destroyed. If the way league is monetizing the game bothers you, leave now. It's only gonna get worse as they push the boundaries to see when the playerbase will crack.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FrancisMuni","date":"2019-09-02T10:47:25.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't matter how good you get as long as you play ranked, because you are going to be matched with people around your skill level anyways.\n\nThere are only 3 ways of having fun in LoL:\n\n* Get quite good to the point you are Platinum at least. Then create a smurf account and start bullying weaker players.\n\n* Play gamemodes like ARAM or the rotating ones (ARURF is in PBE right now).\n\n* Pick cancer overpowered champs like {{champion:157}} , {{champion:238}} , {{champion:145}} , {{champion:67}} , {{champion:142}} , {{champion:555}} , {{champion:141}} ...","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-01T21:52:58.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Lv5\n\n> get good \n\nYou have to play more than half a dozen games, yes. Everyone is confused and awful when taking their first step into a totally new type of game. By the time you hit 30, either you like it or you dont.\n\nAlso, keep in mind different types of champions have wildly different playstyles, and so do different lanes.
