I get into games, my arrow to upgrade the skills are stuck for the entire game. No lie, after games it takes roughly 5-10 minutes to get to the honor screens because of loading. If I'm in the game it's fine, low ping and normal FPS. It is as soon as I'm going into the games, or getting out of them that is the issues. I mean if this is a problem on my end please tell me some ways of fixing it. I've had no problems the past couple of years like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-06T22:18:03.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting an error on the loading screen typically points to some kind of issue with your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) but it could also be caused by some corrupted game files if your ability upgrade arrows aren't working properly either.

Check for that while you're in the client options and *uncheck it* if it's turned on.","replies":[]}]}
