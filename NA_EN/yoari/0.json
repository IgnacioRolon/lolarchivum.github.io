But now they are out of the shop and I'm to late buying them. I wanted to wait and see how many I could get with the quest so that's why I didnt buy them already. Sadly I thought I had a whole month from now because that's when the tokens expire from your inventory. But the quest apparently ended today and so did the option to buy tokens....\r\n\r\nIs there any other way to get more tokens or did I ruin my skin? Because I was really looking forward to the skin with the border as a yasuo main but now I won't have that?{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}} \r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\nYoka","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-30T21:06:34.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that the event has ended, all of the special store items like tokens and passes went away with it. Since it's officially over we won't be able to open those tokens for purchase anymore as it wouldn't be fair to other players. Those tokens are staying in your inventory for a bit to make sure everyone has time to spend them on icons or disenchant them into essence.","replies":[{"poster":"Okami Vapes","date":"2017-06-30T21:12:28.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot Broporo, since you seem to be the Rioter that heads the discussion for the VS. episode we just finished,  my question is: \"When will the 'Victor's Emblem' be craftable into a terrible Yasuo icon?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-30T22:07:56.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll be able to craft the emblem into the winners icon once the comic on the event site has updated and all of the results have been tallied.

I got the skin the first day it came out and thought I will be able to get the border doing the missions. Since I thought the event expires the same day as the tokens, I thought I had enough time, otherwise I would've definitely bought tokens. Now that I am just 2 missions away from getting the border, I am really sad that I will never be able to get it anymore\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
