In the first few minutes, things don&acute;t seem too bad. Having access to a projectile attack from the start is nice and the first enemies are fairly manageable, but as you try to uncover the map the number of enemies and hits they can take is getting ridiculous. Add to that that the random and sudden movement of the enemy and the sheer amount of projectiles coming your way and you are in for a rough time. \r\n\r\nI walked left and got lost in a forest. then I walked up and got lost in the mountains. I walked down the shore at the right side of the map but couldn&acute;t find anything valuable. So, up to that point, I found bombs, a hint for another secret, and like ten-thousand identical shops with prices so high I couldn&acute;t buy a single thing. Not to mention that I spent most of my time backtracking every time I died. \r\n\r\nAnd after I bit I finally found a dungeon, which really raised my moral as it reminded me of the Zelda games I am familiar with and stumbling through room to room I could see how The Binding of Isaac was inspired by the game not only visually but also gameplay wise. At the same time, Zelda felt like ten times harder. Most enemies take 2/3 of your health bar with one hit and there doesn&acute;t seem to be any health drops in dungeons, so when you lose health it&acute;s lost. At least you get set back at the beginning of the dungeon and don&acute;t have to backtrack to the dungeon every time you die. \r\n\r\nSo I went through the entire dungeon, collected the compass and the map, fought the 3 empirical red guards with my tiny sword, which felt like fencing with a needle, so I could finally face the boss of the dungeon. The two-headed green dragon, which killed me in a few seconds since I didn&acute;t know that only the heads can be damaged and that bombs were useless. After that defeat, I called it a day and saved the game just to find out that I was now set back to the beginning of the game, which means that I have to walk all the way back to the dungeon if I want to kill that dragon next time. \r\n\r\nscrew Darksouls, Hollow Knight and roguelikes like BoI or EtG. Zelda 1 beats them easily\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what are your opinions and suggestions regarding this title? I want to assure that I am not mad at the game for being so obscure. I am just shocked by how hard it was and I can&acute;t fathom how little children were supposed to play it. \r\n\r\nI can&acute;t wait to play the first Megaman blind. I guess that&acute;s going to be a massacre as well.","replies":[]}
