To me it makes no sense. The patch notes legit say its so that they can combine Eye of the Equinox and Face of The Mountain, which really just feels like its taking away different options of play. ADC&#039;s are squishy but do a lot of damage, it&#039;s what they do. As a support its my job to keep my ADC alive. Playing as Thresh I already have an ability that shields my ADC, however if I waste it for a shield I lose a way to save my ADC. Having Face&#039;s active is extremely useful so that I can negate as much damage to my ADC during early fights and still have my lantern to escape with. Now the only thing that I have is the Targons Brace heal passive, that now heals for half it normally does since Thresh is ranged. As a Thresh main one of the things I do is engage by hooking into a group of enemies and flaying them towards my team so we can clap&#039;em. This requires me to build tanky no matter what so that I don&#039;t get immediately killed the moment I go in. Face&#039;s reward was nice late game because it gave me more cushion when I&#039;d engage, now i just have wards which I could&#039;ve taken with Eye if I wanted to. In short Face of The Mountain synced well with Thresh and I don&#039;t like a company whose game is structured around options to take away usability from my favorite champion.","replies":[{"poster":"SooFr0sty","date":"2018-01-29T04:09:48.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But now you have quicker access to {{item:3190}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-29T04:07:51.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nobody used it except a few hipsters.
