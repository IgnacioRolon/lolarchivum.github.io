Mordekaiser's health growth is far too high, and his armor growth too is far too high to make him somewhat reasonable to play against. So he starts off with 37 armor, which is higher than {{champion:14}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:36}} , and {{champion:164}}. \n\n1.5) Now most, if not all, of these champions have higher base armor than Mordekaiser at level 18, but games are not dragged out to level 18 unless it's a really close match.\n\n2.) Mordekaiser's base stats on his abilites are way too high, and his kit is overloaded, with ap ratios, on-hit bonus damage, percent health damage, a shield, healing, magic pen from his e, and basically taking 10% of all your stats when he ults you. \nNow if you think about it, no champion should be able to have that many stats, just from his abilities, that's just too unfair to play and lane against, especially with top lane's current state, where a few champions just dominate every pick, but guess what, Mordekaiser still wins those matchups without the need of most of his brain cells. \n\n3.) Now for his winrate in the last three patches. \nThis is from U.gg\nHis winrate in 9.14, after being nerfed on this patch is 50.84% with a pick rate of 8.1%, and a ban rate of 42.0%\nHis winrate in 9.15 is 50.67%, with a pick rate of 7.3, and a ban rate of 29.0%\nHis winrate in 9.16 is 51.28%, with a pick rate of 7.0%, and a ban rate of 18.7%\n\nNow these stats are brought to you by blitz\nHis winrate in 9.14, after being nerfed on this patch is 51.3% with a pick rate of 6.21% and a ban rate of 38.7%\nHis winrate in 9.15 is 50.7% with a pick rate of 6.76%, and a ban rate of 27.8%\nHis winrate in 9.16 is 51.5% with a pick rate of 6.81%, and a ban rate of 17.0%\n\n4.) As you can see, Mordekaiser has had a steady increase in his winrate, as the play rate got higher and the ban rate got lower. If you look at it from an analytic standpoint these show you that the champion is strong, but his ban rate has been keeping him down, and while more and more people pick up on him, the more his winrate will get higher, and his most difficult matchups involve ranged champs, {{champion:27}}, {{champion:133}}, {{champion:107}}, {{champion:114}}, {{champion:24}}, and {{champion:50}}\n\nSo the current top laners, based on pick rate, such as {{champion:266}}, {{champion:122}}, {{champion:114}}, {{champion:80}}, and {{champion:58}} would all get demolished by the one big baddy of toplane, and no it's not {{champion:240}}, it's {{champion:82}}.\n\nThis is the end of the thread, and I'm new to making threads so any advice would help me make better ones in the future.\nLeave your opinions down below and let me know what you think about Mordekaiser\n\nReferences : \nhttps://blitz.gg/lol/champions/Mordekaiser\nhttps://u.gg/lol/champions/mordekaiser/build\nhttps://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Mordekaiser","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2019-08-28T07:35:06.400+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mordekaiser has an Armor Growth of 3.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zane Zephyr","date":"2019-08-28T04:52:03.254+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius shits on morde. \n\nDarius wants to have prolonged duels with people because of his passive and he wants to be up close and personal.

But then again you're right about him being a juggernaut and if the only matchup that he loses is to Darius then that's not healthy for top lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2019-08-28T03:24:14.208+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Irelia gets nerfed for pro play reasons, not solo queue reasons.
