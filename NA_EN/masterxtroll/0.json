The bar has been causing freezing issues for some players, so disabling that may help!  If the issue continues, then you may be having other network issues staying connected during champion select, and getting kicked out.  I recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help get that fixed.
