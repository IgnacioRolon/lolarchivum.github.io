I didn't have my blue stolen from an enemy, it was my own teammate. I should have just left the lobby when he said he had smite so he could \"counter jungle\". I thought it'd be an interesting little fun trick to steal the enemies blue without needing a whole team. But no, he smited my blue and then went on his way to top lane. Even before we came into the game, Tryndamere (The guy who stole my blue) was just clicking random until the champion select timer ended. Sadly, I left the game because I like spending my time having fun, not being forced to spend 40 minutes of my life being in a game with some asshole. So firstly, what do I do when someone takes my blue, and second, what do I do to combat assholes in league besides leaving?","replies":[{"poster":"utDOOM","date":"2014-07-31T20:42:57.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just go take the enemy buff or kill the smaller camps. \n\nAs for bad teammates, just put up with them. Theres not much that you can do (sadly). If there being loud, mute them and report them.\n\nThats about all you can do.  \n\n\n\nBTW, you shouldn't just leave; remember the other three teammates that are still putting up with it.

He can't get reported for it, and you have no choice but to put up with him or face a possible report yourself.  \n\nAnd people just downvote me when I say the system needs to change :P","replies":[]}]}
