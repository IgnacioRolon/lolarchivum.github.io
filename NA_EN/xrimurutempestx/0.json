For demotion due to decay, there are notifications that appear in your client warning you of how much time you have left.  For normal demotions however, there is no set warning system for this.  If you consistently lose games while at zero LP, you have a chance of being demoted.  \n\nI hope this helps!  If you have any other lingering questions, feel free to respond back and let me know!","replies":[]},{"poster":"aLimpBanana","date":"2018-02-28T10:13:15.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BUMP","replies":[]},{"poster":"NixGod","date":"2015-02-17T01:12:54.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"UMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM I lost 1!!!!!!!!
