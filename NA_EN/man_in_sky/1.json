I switched to full screen and back to borderless and now the font is smaller which bothers me. No it is not the chat size. It's everything else such as player names and such.\r\n\r\n2nd issue: When I alt tab, the task bar doesn't show up if I wanted to open google chrome. Also, if I were to have google chrome open, there is a portion towards the bottom that is not covered and shows league in the background. How do I fix this?\r\n\r\nAll of this is tilting me real bad","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-04T02:58:34.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Switching between fullscreen and borderless can sometimes change the config settings depending on what your resolution is on your desktop monitor, like 4k monitors. If you're able to set League to the same resolution as your desktop that should stop happening.\n\nWhen you have Chrome open and it's not filling the entire screen, you might need to just readjust that window size to make it fill up the entire screen. League won't be affecting your Google Chrome windows in any way.","replies":[{"poster":"Man In Sky","date":"2017-08-04T21:20:59.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both in-game and computer are same resolution and correct 1920x1080\n\nAs for the window size for google chrome, I do put it full screen but it does not fit all of it. You can still see like a bit of the bottom and it gets annoying. Would I have to reinstall google chrome?","replies":[]}]}]}
