I have always played smoothly on my laptop before ( I know, trackpad... ) and my resolution for my laptop is 1920x1080 and it has been that way on league settings as always. Three days ago, my laptop froze in a game and I also noticed my fps caps at 60 now. (vsync for both in game and nvidia are off). \r\n\r\nI can only play when lowering the resolution and I cannot play on borderless or full screen anymore. I can only play on windowed and I cannot scroll down so basically I cannot play this game anymore. Does anyone know why when I pick 1920 x 1080 resolution for league, my fps caps at 60 and my screen will eventually freeze and I have to force shut down? Please I really need help","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-08T18:02:50.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you running Windows 10?

I don't like this because I have to run it every time I open the client, but it does fix the resolution and freeze problem I am having. Guess I'll have to deal with this until another update rolls out.","replies":[]}]}]}
