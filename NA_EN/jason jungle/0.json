Don't bother asking for proof or explanation, they can't and won't tell you how you were caught, as doing so would undermine the detection system.\n\nFalse positives are rare, and people who get legitimately banned for scripting wind up acting innocent just like everyone else. There's no way for us to know whether you're one of the innocent ones or one of the guilty ones. Posting about it won't accomplish anything, just submit a support ticket and be polite and persistent.\n\nGood luck mate, if you're innocent then I hope you get unbanned, and if you're guilty then know that _everyone_ looks down on you for cheating and being dishonest.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2018-04-05T22:07:43.217+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"They can prove it though.
