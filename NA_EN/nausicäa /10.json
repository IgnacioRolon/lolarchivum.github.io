You can shred a full build armor tank down to around 80 armor (realistically speaking, so this isn&#x27;t a tank with 6 frozen hearts).\n\n\nYou're not being honest about any of this.\n\nPrevious last whisper was more powerful, and also cheaper, than both of the current versions we have. At its strongest it was 40% pen for (roughly) 2,400 gold.\n\nSecondly, current cleaver is only stronger if you're Darius. Original cleaver (well, after they reworked it from being an attack speed item) stacked faster (5 stacks instead of 6), stacked harder (6.25% armor pen per stack instead of 5, which means you'd get a STRONGER effect FASTER), granted more AD (50 vs 40, 20% more), granted flat armor pen (10), and has a build path which only benefits bruisers (phage + kindlegem). It was the perfect assassin item in every way, and it was changed to a beefy brawler item; because THOSE are the champions who generally have to fight and kill tanks.\n\nThirdly, old ghost blade was also stronger. 65 AD as opposed to 55, an active which increased attack speed, 20 flat armor pen (that's more -flat- pen than the current one gives in lethality...). It was objectively stronger in every way, and it also cost less gold (2700 vs 2900) than it does now!\n\nAnd lastly, brutalizer. Brutalizer was the underlying issue for assassin itemization, because for 1337 gold you got 25 AD, 10% CDR, and 10 armor pen. You could semi reliably get it on your first back, and always on your second.\n\nAll told, an assassin with brut + ghostblade + cleaver would have 40 flat armor pen from itemization, CDR cap, and after 5 hits they'd ignore 31.25% of your total armor. They'd also pick up Last Whisper, which was another 40% reduction. I can't remember the EXACT number, but if you had less than 150 (or so) armor they'd just straight up deal true damage.\n\nOh, and you could also get like. 16ish flat armor pen from runes. So there's that too.\n\nDon't pretend that lethality is broken. It's not. It's much, MUCH weaker than old armor penetration itemization was, and everyone who complains about it is viewing the past with rose colored glasses. As someone who loves to play tanky champions, s3 and s4 were the worst experiences I've ever had in league: Physical damage dealers would build last whisper second items, and just about anyone could assassinate a tank in a couple of hits. It was so bad that armor was straight up garbage, if you wanted to tank damage you had to build health and items which protected in ways other than armor (frozen heart's attack speed slow, for example).\n\n\n> &quot;Didn’t first drake before the rework always act like infernal?&quot; Pre elemental drakes gave about, 120 gold to everyone on the team. No innate stat changes were given\n\nYou're thinking too far back. In s4 or s5 they changed drake to a single 'elemental', where you'd get a different bonus (what elemental drakes give) for each time you killed it. Just going to copy the wowwiki on it here:\n\nKilling the DragonSquare Dragon nows grants a permanent stacking buff called Dragon Slayer buff Dragon Slayer:\nDRAGON'S MIGHT (1 stack): +8% total attack damage and ability power.\nDRAGON'S DOMINANCE (2 stacks): +15% damage to minions and monsters.\nDRAGON'S FLIGHT (3 stacks): +5% movement speed.\nDRAGON'S WRATH (4 stacks): +15% damage to turrets and buildings.\nASPECT OF THE DRAGON (5 stacks, repeatable): Doubles all other bonuses and your attacks burn enemies for 150 true damage over 5 seconds. Lasts 180 seconds.\n\nIt's worth noting that this was during the time of armor pen and all that. So you'd have assassins running around with 50+ flat pen, 60-70%ish (% shred is multiplied, not flatly added) pen ontop of that, items which gave MORE AD, and then a drake which further boosted their total AD by 8% (but it all counted as bonus AD).\n\nSeriously, you guys think Zed is strong now? The dude used to be able to R full build tanks, stick to them  for 1-2 seconds, and then have his ulti finish them off. Big beefy mother fuckers with around 4k hp, 300 armor, and tank steroids. That was NORMAL back then.\nSo, yeah.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Disembark","date":"2018-11-29T13:28:57.883+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":8,"body":"Lmao. “No innate stat changes were given”.

Electrocute or literally any Keystone still does way more damage than the 3% damage increase from the highest tier mastery in S4.\n3. Ok and? You're literally going to stack it every game. S4 masteries had many scaling runes, Eyeball collection is basically a scaling rune too\n4. Uhh ya and? If you're taking the rune you presumably have a gap closer. If you have a gap closer you're going to start combat with that gap closer giving you the penetration?\n\nYa AD assassins fall off harder than before when tanks are literally getting shredded, armor penetration items are at an all time high, game length is down massively and runes are offering higher levels of damage. Makes sense. \n\nPoint is the new runes have considerably more damage than S4 runes.

Same goes for not having DFG, flat AP values on most items lowered. Let’s not even mention ADC items which have been nerfed into the ground. Even LW/Black Cleaver are no stronger than in season 3/5 (gold years btw). I guess void staff and deathcap have been objectively power crept (to compensate for lower AP vals - but according to Boards AP is weak btw so I guess that doesn’t matter). \n> \n> Even for champ kits, discounting reworks and new champions, most champions in plain numbers are weaker than before. Riot has ALWAYS favored nerfing champions over buffing weak ones. In fact, in terms of raw power Leblanc is a fuckton weaker than 2015 Leblanc while still being S+ tier now. You wanna know why?
