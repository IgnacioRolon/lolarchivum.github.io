When Riot shifted to making it easier for games to finish when ahead (way back in patch 5.23 with the minions being stronger for the team that's ahead to make it easier to push towers when ahead and harder to manipulate your minion wave to push out and buy time when behind), things started slowly going downhill a bit as far as game quality for me, and that just got worse and worse as more changes were made to make closing out games easier because it makes snowballing so much more important.\n\nIt's particularly sad because they said sometime around pre-season 6 (I think, it may have been a little later) that they didn't want stalling to be such a strong tactic but that they didn't want to eliminate it as a possible option. It's felt more and more as time has gone on that playing safe isn't supposed to be an option even when at a small deficit, though, with the very notable exception of earlier this year when late-game wave clear made defending sieges far too easy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Done25","date":"2018-06-19T11:05:10.516+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":29,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=potchiker,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qlkAhYBu,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-06-19T05:16:37.404+0000)\n>\n> Why are people downvoting this?\n\nBecause his post makes no sense and is overtly hostile.","replies":[{"poster":"kargish","date":"2018-06-19T11:23:14.470+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Done25,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qlkAhYBu,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2018-06-19T11:05:10.516+0000)\n>\n> Because his post makes no sense and is overtly hostile.\n\nFunny enough this was the kind of thing that actually gets you downvoted on the boards","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Caretaker Jack","date":"2018-06-21T03:43:26.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=potchiker,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qlkAhYBu,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-06-19T05:16:37.404+0000)\n>\n> Why are people downvoting this?\n\nBecause that's how we got here in the first place. \n\n8.12 is just like the first few seasons where you could bring anything to bot lane...

Then it escalated to people wanting it to be about team play and that made games longer. People didn't like 40 minute games and they hated that their skill expression depended on other people... From there it was the whole, \"a good player cant win the game anymore.\" and \"it's not fair that the better team win instead of the better player.\" \n\nSo now were back in the cycle. And here comes this guy  upset that good players are snowballing too hard and there aren't enough chances to come back in the game because it's set to end at 20 minutes and decided at 15... I'm not saying he's wrong, but do you see why some people would be upset?","replies":[{"poster":"potchiker","date":"2018-06-21T06:44:19.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now its still the same, A good player really cant carry its still a coinflip\nIts just that gzmes end too fast and one side wins too hard","replies":[{"poster":"Caretaker Jack","date":"2018-06-21T07:43:07.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=potchiker,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qlkAhYBu,comment-id=000000050000,timestamp=2018-06-21T06:44:19.321+0000)\n>\n> Now its still the same, A good player really cant carry its still a coinflip\n> Its just that gzmes end too fast and one side wins too hard\n\nfrom my experience. its a lot more likely... but ill digress","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2018-06-19T13:58:37.655+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"First they'll need to fix the problem with champs whose only win condition (or macro counterplay, in the reverse) is crushing early or crushing late. \n\nIn mid right now, the only counterplay to assassins is to rush Zhonya's and try to not die very many times before you hit 2900g + mana item.

Win conditions are just that, win conditions.  It's exciting to have your spike early and feel like time is against you.  It's exciting to play an immobile scaling marksman and slowly grow into a big boy who gets to bully the bullies.  What your suggesting is just homogenization of champ pool which would be less strategic and less exciting tbh.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2018-06-19T16:14:25.483+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nausicäa ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qlkAhYBu,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-06-19T04:35:35.632+0000)\n>\n> According to them its too hard to win games where you have a lead and will inevitably win.\n\nWait, does that mean they want higher snowball?","replies":[{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2018-06-19T18:23:10.914+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes basically yes they actively made snowball worse lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wacky9","date":"2018-06-19T18:23:39.921+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but the intent is high snowball late-game, but right now the snowball is showing up early game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2018-06-19T16:36:03.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue they are trying to solve is that if a team has a lead and will inevitably win then the inevitability will kick in sooner and you won't be stuck in a lost game for 20 minutes more than necessary.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-06-19T19:16:04.918+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about making it so a team is never going to inevitably win?

There were so many moments of positive intensity back then even if I was losing because I knew I had a chance if I played it right and it felt great to go through those rises and dips. The game feeling like there's an inevitable outcome early now just creates negative intensity for whoever starts losing and getting the snowball going on my side feels boring very quickly. I really miss the days when either team could win even if one side was a bit ahead.","replies":[{"poster":"Think it Thru","date":"2018-06-20T14:11:32.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best game I had this season.
