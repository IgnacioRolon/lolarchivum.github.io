You run. You escape. Potentially, you bait. The smite bonus means they have an easier time keeping up with you, but that's the whole point - it rewards them for smiting. The fact that you can completely erase that with a stealth is absurd.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-02-01T07:32:04.278+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but Skirmishers isn't meant to make them visible. It's to make it to where you can out duel some one, usually some one in your jungle and occasionally outside of your jungle or you can just pop it on their most fed carry in a team fight so you can avoid some damage. If they're in your jungle and you did this and they stealthed away then bam, it did it's job. It got them the hell out of your jungle and if it's outside of the jungle and you're trying to use it for vision, you're likely using it wrong. This item isn't \"You're a carry jungle and now you can murder any stealth champ with this item\". It's meant for Bruisers and tanks who want to be able to avoid some damage, not for a Master Yi or WW to be able to counter jungle with incredible ease, hence why it was nerfed to begin with.","replies":[{"poster":"EnvyDragon","date":"2015-02-01T17:31:00.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zair Umbras,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HbFiKxZB,comment-id=00000001000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-01T07:32:04.278+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, but Skirmishers isn't meant to make them visible. \n\nIf it wasn't intended to make them visible, *it wouldn't make them visible.*\n\nSkirmisher's Sabre smite, like almost any other buff/debuff in the game, is designed to provide a window of power for a player to exploit. It says, \"For this duration, you are able to wreck target champion's face.\" It gives visibility *specifically* so that you can track them in jungle as they try to escape, outplay you, or otherwise disorient you via lack of vision.\n\nIt isn't designed specifically to waste stealth champs. It's just that it's *absurd* that a stealth champ can completely fucking ignore the item.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-02-01T21:33:44.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Skirmisher's is NOT supposed to be that at all. It's meant to give you an edge, yes. It gives you vision if they're trying to escape through bushes or trying to out play you with the bushes or happened to have flashed into the Fog of War. It's NOT meant to let you destroy every stealth champ. The visibility it gives is meant so you can follow them if they try to bush juke you, not so you can chase a stealth champion. They'd have let it reveal stealth if it was meant to, but stealth already has Lee Sin as an issue, a Lens, Twisted Fate, and of course the various issues that come with stealth. Twitch can't stealth if you hit him constantly, the delay is up to about 7 seconds. Rengar's delay is about 3 seconds. Zix's stealth is only for 1s with a 2s CD before using the next 1s stealth, going up to 2s if you evolve it, which you don't oftenly do early on and nowadays you don't do it often in general. Evelynn obviously isn't an issue here and neither is Teemo. Shaco though, his stealth is part of his escape. You can already use Skirmisher's to see which Shaco is which if he doesn't have buffs and even if it did show him in his stealth, it wouldn't help since he's likely going over a wall and dropping a box for you run into. There's simply no point in letting Skirmisher's reveal stealth.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Doctrorpheus","date":"2015-02-01T05:09:38.695+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't let any of them do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDráco","date":"2015-02-01T07:41:44.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Smite should not reveal stealth based on the fact that red trinket is already a hard counter to stealth and built on junglers.
