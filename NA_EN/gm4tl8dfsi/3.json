Tomorrow will be my last day working as a branch manager of a paper company. I will be giving up my salary of 92$/hr in hopes that I will some day become a top streamer for League of Legends. I've thought about it long and hard, and I decided that this is something I seriously want to pursue in the coming years. In 2003 I was deemed the #1 hearthstone player in the world. I had a huge fan base and truly believe that if I give it my best, I will eventually make a million dollars off of twitch. \n\nP.S. I will leave me 3 children to my wife for the next 2 years to pursue my dream.","replies":[]}
