Spell animations do not play, but I CAN send spell commands, I just won't receive feedback on those commands until the spike has ended when all the animations of the lag period play all at once. I can sort of glean where everybody is generally speaking and health bars DO update throughought the hang time with only slight delay.\n\nIt makes it virtually impossible to play the game and I have zero issues in other games I'm playing right now such as Overwatch, WoW and Conan Exiles (aside from it's minor netcode and optimization issues).\n\nI don't even know where to begin with this, I uninstalled and reinstalled, updated video drivers, I'm running an i5 4690k 1070gtx 16g ddr3 1600 a samsung evo 128g ssd and using a wireless AC adapter and router with 100M download and 15M upload. ISP is Cox communications out of Omaha, NE.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-22T22:03:06.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even with solid internet, It sounds like you could be having some pretty massive packet loss.  Even if your net is fine elsewhere, you can still have issues with specific servers like the game server or how your ISP routes to it.

Maybe some games or server routes just deal with lag better than league right now but I think I just discovered that my USB ports are occasionally dropped my wireless card for a split second too, I'll have to do more research.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AaronNDeWitt","date":"2017-02-22T21:10:12.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not crazy, I'm having the same issues, but with the ping also spiking. I'm not having ANY issues with other online multiplayer games, and League really doesn't take up any bandwidth to speak of. All my other apps are off so I'm not accidentally downloading something for steam, and no one else is at home. \n\nThis has been happening for almost a week.","replies":[]}]}
