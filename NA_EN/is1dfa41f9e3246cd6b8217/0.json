Sand is extremely system intensive and often looks bad. Given that they are actively removing the sand effects from Nasus due to these issues, I doubt they will make a skin with a sand theme.","replies":[{"poster":"arkhammer","date":"2013-11-20T17:10:11.573+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, they could always just have her take on a sandstone theme.  It wouldn't be a \"sand tornado\" she'd be standing in.  She'd come out of the sandstone (like she does ice or bloodstone), and her Q/ult would be sandstone themed.  The few particle effects on her missile could be done with sand particles, considering they're on the screen for such a brief period.\n\nOverall, I think this would be an awesome theme for any upcoming Shurima patch.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NA Katarina Mid","date":"2013-11-20T04:39:23.649+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sandstorm Lissandra.\n\nNice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VVhirl","date":"2013-11-20T19:54:57.768+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot pls","replies":[]},{"poster":"Axel Senpai","date":"2013-11-20T05:26:17.479+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just posted up my idea for a champ, but I have to say. I really like this idea, aside from the funny puns. Have you put in any thought to what the abilities might be like? That's my favorite part with skins, the edited animations. I can see a lot of potential for the ult to be a sarcophagus. Her Q could shoot pyramids. Her W could be quicksand. Her E could be a sandstorm or giant head, like from the movie the mummy. There's a lot of potential to this and I like it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ke√≠th","date":"2013-11-20T04:01:43.657+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems cool and nice job on the art","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hunter Soules","date":"2013-11-20T02:54:41.303+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can definitely see myself buying that skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VeloxEtVerus","date":"2013-11-19T20:18:49.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amazing artwork!
