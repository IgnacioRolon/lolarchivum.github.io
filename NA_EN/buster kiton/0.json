I liked the mode because the community it had. People were nice and didn't flame on mistakes. It was completely different than ranked or blind pick.\r\n\r\nNot anymore, though. Now that all these players banned in ranked are forced to play normal games to get back to rankeds again the community's got a whole lot worse. In a week I've learned to know about 20 different trolls/afkers/flamers etc. who constantly ruin games and are there just to get unbanned. The mode that had nice and friendly people got contaminated and is no more. Now it's just like every other game mode, if not worse. The quality of games has fallen and with it, the whole experience of playing the game has got quite bad.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm asking is that do not ban these people from ranked and force them to play normals instead. That's just moveing the problem away from it's source. 30 games and they'll be back trolling in ranked again, wishing death upon others just like they did before. If you just move them from one gamemode to another, you ruin experience for both of the split communities that like the different modes.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest to just straight out banning people with timeouts that deserve bans from ranked. If they aren't allowed to play ranked because they ruin the experience there, why would you move them to ruin other games instead? That's just lazy design and a bad solution. Give us the normal draft back that we used to like.\r\n\r\nSorry if this is the wrong board to post this, I didn't find a better one on the topic though.","replies":[{"poster":"TheFallenShaw","date":"2014-11-19T17:58:39.797+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"They should just ban them out right, with a new ban system.

Now at least, people will only lose time  (and maybe a bit of faith in humanity, but that requires some to begin with :P) and not LP. \n\nEssentially, I think you're confused on how ranked restrictions work exactly. 30 normal games completed are required yes, but if their behavior continues they're not getting back in, they're going to punished further.

You can't wait out the restrictions. You *have* to be better behaved to get the privilege of speaking and ranked back. Bans you can simply wait out and you can get by it without learning anything. Moving them to normals at least doesn't screw over other's LP while they're learning how to be a proper human being. (one would hope at least :P)\n\nNot to mention there's always the issue of alternate accounts. IP bans are an appropriate counter to this yes, but that *has* to be a last resort because of all the complications it can bring. (Banning an entire household when one kid was an ass for example.) Say I'm a toxic player who refuses to learn my lesson. what's to stop me from simply having an alt to switch to when the other gets banned? The toxicity doesn't leave at all.
