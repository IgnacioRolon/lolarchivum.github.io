To give you all a little background about myself, I have been playing this game since mid season 2. In my time I can say I've seen all, if not most of everything there is to see. From people who afk to people who feed, I've seen it all. I know we aren't all perfect and I realize we all have our off games, so I'm here today carrying an important message to everyone; an apology of some sorts, but also a lesson. A lesson of how you could change your attitude and how you react to all of the \"worst\" things there are to see in this game.\r\n\r\n           First off, I'd like to apologize to everyone that's ever played a game with me. If I've ever done bad in a game and you've played with me, you'll know how terrible it can be. I may not be the worst person out there, probably far from it, but I'm bad enough to where I, admittedly, should have been chat banned/restricted several times now. When I, or anyone for that matter, does bad and \"feeds\" we go on tilt; we get mad, yell, scream, shout, insult, rage, all of the above, etc. There's been times where I've punched holes in walls, or almost broken my computer over how overwhelmed I get with emotions while going 2/8, 1/10, etc. \r\n\r\n          When people like me do bad, we look for every single excuse we can and place as much blame as we possibly can on other people so that we don't look like we're bad players, so that people don't say, \"Dude, you're ass,\" or, \"Wow, you really fucking suck,\" or any of the other famous remarks people like to give. As a person like this, I know how to deal with other people like this; I know how to talk to them and calm them down. This is why I'm writing this to all of you today, so all of you who take time to read this, lets stand up for all the feeders that just want to be understood that this champion is op and needs to be nerfed, that they just got camped, its not their fault, or that their botlane fed so terribly hard that they were 20/3 at 20 minutes and they roamed mid and killed him 5 times.\r\n\r\n         Lets all as a league community, **TAKE A PLEDGE** to change our attitude when our teammate feeds and lets all promise to give that midlane going 0/5 the moral support he needs to get back into the game. What do people want when they feed? They want understanding, sympathy. When someone goes negative in lane, the last thing they wanna hear is you insulting them or coaching them on what to do better. Instead of saying \"dude, you're so bad, you died because you didn't ward,\" just tell them \"hey bro, its cool. We'll get them next time. Lets put up some wards so it doesn't happen again.\" Show them that you aren't trying to be hostile or attack their skill. Use stupid little faces like \"xD\" or \"&lt;3\" {{summoner:7}} heal his wounds, be his support{{champion:40}}. Don't {{summoner:14}} the rage within him, or you'll be {{summoner:3}}ed of losing.\r\n\r\nSo let me be the first to {{summoner:4}} in, 1 vs Everyone,  and **take the pledge to change.** I pledge to be a better teammate, encourage my 0/5 top lane and 0/7 jungler to not give up, to keep fighting until the end because we **always**, have a chance to turn around the game and make it into a victory. \r\n*\"As a **team** we will find victory, or die trying.\"*","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-10-17T09:59:10.453+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is a wonderful post. :] \n\n+1  I pledge!","replies":[{"poster":"oOMatt1Oo","date":"2014-10-18T19:44:30.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have a Rioteer on our side!

Most of these types of folks refuse to alter their playstyle when they get behind and cost the rest of their team for it. Its not hard to miss a few CS waiting for wave to get to turret or hitting up the jungle once your wave pushes out.\n\nI dont care who rages at them. They clearly didnt care about winning by at least giving their team a chance to carry them.","replies":[{"poster":"Navarune","date":"2014-10-17T21:54:08.536+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that individual players need to focus on self-improvement, but I think you may be misunderstanding the original post a bit judging from your post. If I am understanding it correctly, he's saying that it is the people who ***are*** falling so far behind in matches that tend to find any little element that will take the blame off of them, if only for a split second, that will end up raging. Taking this pledge is actually a step towards improving a player's KDA by giving him time to think about why he just died for the 3rd time in 6 minutes. Not only that, it is also encouraging teammates to help him recover and make in-game adjustments that will boost morale a bit, reducing both rage and team deaths. \n\nI've roamed mid as support many times to help out a mid who was struggling. The most recent I can recall I was Taric with an assist line of something like 5 or 6 between 10-15 minutes into the match. Our Akali mid, however, was 2/5 and their Yasuo had 5 or 6 kills, 1 death. I ganked him twice after we pushed bot tower down and when he was well overextended, securing kills for Akali both times and warding the death brush and jungle entrance to secure her lane vision. She got shutdown gold on the first kill, and by the second, she had caught up to him with a roam top herself netting another kill. She ended up with double her deaths in kills by the end of the match, and told me that my ganks to her lane helped turn her game around. \n\nWe won that match not because I was a stellar Taric player, not because we got so lucky, and not because we had superior champions. We won that match because a member of our team was able to secure his own lane and moved on to another lane to secure it as well, while also maintaining objective control in the meantime, and also while not deriding the teammate who was struggling early. Our superior attitude, not an attitiude of superiority, gave us the means to victory.","replies":[{"poster":"oOMatt1Oo","date":"2014-10-18T19:42:51.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got the exact idea of what this pledge is about. By taking this pledge and actually incorporating it into the game you will get the following results: \n1. A teammate who actually continues to do their best instead of giving up or \"afking.\"\n2. An actual chance a winning a **team game** by, get this, utilizing teamwork.\n3. An honor(maybe) \n4. A boosted overall team morale, and many more other factors to this. \nSo yes, taking this pledge will prevent the 0/7's and the 0/10's.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Navarune","date":"2014-10-17T19:59:00.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll take the pledge.\n\nAlso, as a side note that is totally irrelevant but funnily coincidental: my name is also Matt, and I started mid season 2 as well.

(*Give a pat on your back* =^_^=) I admired everybody here who participated in this discussion. Giving chances to those people who happen to don’t have that “natural” skill and providing feedback is all part of a successful game play.\n\nIf a player plays very terribly in a game, please don’t call others’ “feeders.” It’s the same concept of calling names, not like some of us wanted to become a feeder (who happens to die a lot ...unluckily ;p). This reminds me of a scenario where there are also “bystanders” involved. If one person is getting verbally abuse by another member of the team, keep in mind that it could be you too. Help that person out because no one deserves that much hatred. He/she knows she did so horribly in the team and now this?\n\nBeing a “feeder” and an “unskilled player’ are two different concepts. There is no reason to assume one player is assisting the enemy team when they are actually trying really hard to help their team. Using profanity and shouting (all caps) in a chat wouldn't benefit for the team. That’s why there are roles and position―everyone has their own part to participate. If a player is not up to a specific player’s standards, which means the whole team is not up to meet the expectations as a team.\n\n*Just breathe.* A game lost wouldn't lose one of your kidneys. The stats already shown how horrible the player did...There is no need to single out a player for his/her terrible playing skills. \n\nI wish that this post have more people who join…. *REMEMBER SPORTSMANSHIP!*Thank you for sharing in this lively discussion.
