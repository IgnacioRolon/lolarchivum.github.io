So she's only tanky because of base stats and the items she *has* to buy, but she can't be the tankiest of tanks even if she tries because the lack of steroids.\n\nSo she's kind of a weird zoning tank with a very important clutch ultimate.  Blow the ult, and you might have a really bad time.  She can flank with the leap if something good happens or hop away if it turns sour.\n\nI think she's actually kind of tricky.
