Dark Harvest with do magic damage. it can be pretty insane. If you are able to get Mejais you will be flying around the map making plays in every lane, because once yo have around 440 move speed 1 end of the map to the other is not that long. when you are not ganking Farm for that Dark Harvest. once its over 150 it takes care of itself and its an absolute teamfight destroyer resetting on kills.","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Platinum","date":"2018-09-28T20:18:22.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow thanks so much, this help alot. i appreciate it !!!!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Psyrix","date":"2018-09-28T18:55:38.475+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Works quite well, whenever I go jg I usually use him.
