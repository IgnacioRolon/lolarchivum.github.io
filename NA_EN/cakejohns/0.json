I feel this is a little excessive as i hardly talked all game. I was under immense pressure as i was playing a ranked game into my promos. Also with the factor of multiple negative, frustrating hate speech from fellow team mates. I did not give up and pursued to play the game to the best of my ability even though my team was making me feel extremely bad and useless. I have reviewed my inappropriate actions of using harmful words to affect others and will next time think before i act. Also i feel like most my reports were due to my bad score, as there wasn&#039;t much conversation throughout the game.\r\n\r\nPlease accept my apologies as I have come to realisation of how i need to act in future games.\r\nThanks Heaps Cakejohns","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-04-06T05:11:34.432+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Chat logs? \nand riot will not remove a ban even if you apologize. \nyou are only sorry because you were punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Moonlytee","date":"2018-04-06T06:27:51.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Azf3p2Ug,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-04-06T05:11:34.432+0000)\n>\n> you are only sorry because you were punished.\n\nI hate to interject, but isn't that the goal of punishment? {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-04-07T02:12:12.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Moonlytee,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Azf3p2Ug,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-04-06T06:27:51.121+0000)\n>\n> I hate to interject, but isn&#x27;t that the goal of punishment? {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}\n\nHe woulden't have given a damn if he wasn't banned, i understand that its the whole point of a ban but most players see their behavior as \"ok\" without a ban.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FLOL game suck","date":"2018-04-06T09:22:06.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Riot doesn't give a shit whether you are an angel or devil.
