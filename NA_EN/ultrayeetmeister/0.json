This problem mostly happens to players around EUNE and EUW. Because of that, i once got into Low Priority Q and every time i tried to Q up to ARAM cause it has a low waiting time, it kicks me out while im in the low priority Q, meaning, I COULD'NT PLAY AT ALL!!!!! Thanks to a friend of mine, he let me play league on his PC and i got rid of it. while i was on his PC, the \"trying to reconnect\" didn't happen, meaning, this has to do something with the IP for players around EUNE and EUW, not out connection  to your servers and not out internet. I'M BEGGING OF YOU, PLEASE look into the matter, because every day that passes and i get that, it slowly drives me AND other players insane. I don't want to get any more warnings for not accepting a game just cause of this bug/glitch/whatever. once again, PLEASE look into the matter as soon as you have the time for it, Thank You In Advance._**\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"alexTheBad1984","date":"2017-11-02T13:56:49.461+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I play on EUW. Language of the client is English. I should say I have a relatively old D-Link router. I managed to switch off all the unnecessary features like QoS, Advanced DNS, anti-spoof checking, etc. After that my internet stopped randomly disconnecting, even without setting up a DMZ proposed here by LegoJesus.\n\nStill the \"Trying to reconnect\" message popped up often, making the client unusable. I restarted client many times, rebooted windows, and when I finally got into game I kept DCing and losing control of my champion in the middle of a fight. Though web browser worked fine. I got a LP because of that. \n\nI finally got the problem solved yesterday by switching the language of the client to Italiano on the login screen. This allowed me to get out of LP and then I switched the language back to English. That's it. Worked fine since. Be aware that client has to download 3.5G of files. Also I learned that top is _superioro_ in Italian.","replies":[{"poster":"Merguez Freeman","date":"2017-11-26T21:41:05.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the tip!

However, there are a lot of ports that needs to be opened for the client to work properly, so the easy solution is to set up your PC as a DMZ on the router.\nA DMZ means that the computer will not be protected by the firewalls of the router, which puts your computer at risk, so keep that in mind.\n\nFirst, you need to know what is the IP address of your computer. You can find out by opening CMD and typing \"ifconfig\". It will show you something like \"192.168.8.15\". That is your computer's IP inside your home network. Do not go to google and type \"what is my ip\" because that will give you the external IP of your home, and not the internal IP of your computer inside your home network.\n\nAfter getting your computer's IP, go into your router's settings and find a setting named DMZ or DMZ server, and put your computer's IP there.\nENJOY.\n\nP.S.\nEvery time you restart your router, your computer gets a different IP address, so you can either set a static IP address to your computer via the network settings in the computer itself, or via DHCP reservation in your router.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazyDaz","date":"2017-10-22T11:39:50.733+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrazyDaz,realm=EUW,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=Bp9NwPHz,comment-id=0026,timestamp=2017-10-15T08:27:46.067+0000)\n>\n> Just wanted to shout out that the problem is still there.

Connect to your smarthpone \"hotspot\"\n2. Login into the game with the hotspot. \n3. Switch back to your usual wifi/net connection.\n4. While it switched from \"Hotspot\" to \"Your usual Internet Connection\" - the message might pop out again \"Trying To Reconnect\". Although, It stays only there for under a minute or so and then brings an error message that \"Something has gone wrong\". Just click \"OK\". (p.s. which just proves that it is Client based fault, and RIOT doesnt want to look into it)\n5. Now you are ready to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ataith","date":"2017-09-17T15:17:17.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same Problem here. It just came out of nowhere. I can't properly connect to the Client. I tried to fix it with the Support page (network settings, ports, etc) and nothing worked. It functions well after a fresh installed game but i won't redownload the whole game every time i wanna play. \nIs there ANY fix to this goddamn error??","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-09T01:56:40.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"It's pretty highly unlikely that you would get a connection issue because of your IP address. Rather, when you were playing on your friends pc his network had a strong enough connection to the game servers to stay in the entire match. \n\nEven with your home internet working normally, it's not entirely unlikely like you'd be unable to access specific servers (like Leagues for example). This is just a first step, but I do suggest double checking your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and possibly trying a hardwired connection if possible.","replies":[]}]}
