And worse yet, or better yet depending on who you ask, when placing down a regular ward, I still get the Golden Rammus Ward Skin.\r\n\r\nHow to Reproduce it:\r\n1. Reach level 9 and buy Greater Vision Totem. \r\n2. Buy regular Ward.\r\n3. Have a Ward Skin other than Mecha Ward, but only tested with Golden Rammus.\r\n4. Place Totem and Ward, no order necesary.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-23T17:45:45.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a known issue, and we're working on a fix!
