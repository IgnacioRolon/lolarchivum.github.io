There certainly have been some recent Windows updates that have been causing similar types of problems, but by far, most issues with bugsplats are the result of bad drivers or hardware issues. As a quick first step, I recommend working through our [Bugsplat Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes), which covers the most common solutions.\n\nLet me know if that guide resolved the issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mark Longwang","date":"2016-10-03T07:59:04.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yesterday windows forced me to do a update and ever since my league has been playing up big time. I got in a game and it was fine for a bit but then out of no where it was as if everything was deforming and melting (something I never had a problem with before this windows update) I've been at it for 6 hours now and still haven't found a solution. Idk if the update has destroyed my graphics card or not because I have a laptop that has 2 different gpu's (one amd and the other the regular Intel one) and when I use the amd one this is when I'm having the problems but when I use the Intel one  everything is fine but on my amd one I can run the game at very high 60fps constant but on my Intel one only about 40fps on very low. Help please! :)","replies":[]}]}
