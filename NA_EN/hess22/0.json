Just about every single negative confrontation in this game stems from the chat window. Out of all of the thousands of games I have played, I can&#039;t recall a single time the chat feature has been used for anything other then for people to talk trash/be &quot;toxic&quot;. I feel that if Riot were to remove chat from the game, it would make the game 100% better.\r\nYou can argue that there is a mute function, but everyone knows that the mute function does nothing for &quot;toxic&quot; people. Just because you mute them, doesn&#039;t make their first comment any more frustrating or make them any less likely to stop their harassment. The tribunal and reporting is a way to stem the bleeding of the community, but it is in no way a fix to the problem.\r\nThere are plenty of ways to communicate with the team in a productive manner, that don&#039;t involve the chat window, that don&#039;t bring &quot;toxic&quot; behavior, like pings and actions in play. Cutting out the chat window will solve all of the toxic problems of the game. Riot could even implement other in game features to make up for no chat, like emote buttons or something. Being able to chat with other players is not needed in the game in any way, and only brings toxicity into the game.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-04-12T23:14:14.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A few points. One is no communication or limiting it would only hurt a TEAM game. Example if Baron is pinged and you have no way to communicate if you want to bait and not do it, then that isn't communicated. Yes there are alot of toxic players, but they provide a mute button. And the other point is that our brains remember the negative experiences more vividly, so of course you will recall only the negative experiences. If you truly ONLY have bad chat experiences at the start of every game type /mute all","replies":[]}]}
