Unfortunately, I now have the side effect of her auto animation &quot;hanging&quot; or &quot;sticking&quot; to the minions (or whatever I&#039;m autoing). This only happens when I use her minigun, but it can be seen on my boyfriend&#039;s screen as well so presumably everyone can see her trio of bullets just... hovering above the creep for a second. If necessary I can try to get a screenshot at some point but it&#039;s kinda distracting when trying to last hit creeps.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-08T20:44:13.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ZenaSpiritdragon! \n\nThanks for the solid report!
