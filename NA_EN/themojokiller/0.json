He's a sassy (sassy is an understatement) cosmic dragon who's a literal god who can make stars. He has the best voice-line in the game, _(Seriously, what's better than a star god saying \"**Boop**\" when he's hitting anything)._ \n\nhttps://imgur.com/XmFpVn1\n\nAnd because of all that **_and a lot more_**, I've main since a little after release. Being one of the few champions to have good consistent damage and being a battle mage himself, his kit favors preferred play-style a lot! Even though he didn't peak a lot of people's interests when it's compared to other champs (Yasuo, Jhin, etc.), the people that play him love the champion and are dedicated to him. \n\nWhile I could go on about Aurelion Sol, there's just one thing I want to mention before I talk about how the PBE changes feel. When it comes to Aurelion Sol, with enough practice, playing him can get you far. And my point is that even if you have an Aurelion Sol on your team or enemy team, there isn't going to be that stench where Aurelion Sol \"has no counter-play\" or \"Aurelion Sol's broken.\" The favor of his battles depends on how well you play, and then you get rewarded from that. It feels good to be able to call him a healthy champion.\n\n_**Aurelion Sol on the PBE...**_\nAurelion Sol has received a mini rework on the PBE a couple days ago. If you are interested in the details and numbers, visit this link to get more info: https://twitter.com/RiotAzuBK\nhttps://imgur.com/C9A6NdZ\n(Here's a clip of how the mini-rework looks like provided by RiotKingCobra)\n\nThis itself may be a \"mini\"-rework, but it just changes the champion's playstyle and kit entirely. His combos, build, runes, and strengths and weakness are different now. Here is what you can expect out of Aurelion Sol now...\n\n-Due to not being able to hold W up for more than three seconds, but having a faster rotation of speed as an adjustment, he's build more of a burst-mage.\n\n-Your roaming is hit hard. You can only get good roams off whenever your e is off cool-down (which is every 1 min, 20), as you lost your e passive movement speed. This also nerfs gap-closing when it comes to long chases. So it's best to engage with Q+E or find a way to catch them off-guard. (Consistently activating your W over and over helps for chasing or running away, since it procs your w movement speed.\n\n-Instead of zoning with W and landing the stun (Q), you have to engage with your q to get your damage off. Your weak match-ups aren't as oppressive, as crowd control does not cancel your stars, and positioning when landing the combo isn't strained. When laning, you either choose to wave-clear when you activate your w, or go for the poke, as you can only use your w so often early game.\n\n-Instead of going phase rush + inspiration tree, going electrocute + precision/sorcery/inspiration is more optimal (whatever helps you burst more). Getting the Hextech-GLP item and getting squishy ability power items with cdr is required to bring out your kit to enhance burst.\n\n-Aurelion Sol is more of a laner than a roamer, and his combos are usually Q+W for trades or Q+R+W for burst.\n\n-Early/Mid game strong if average or ahead; Late game weak\n\n_**Thoughts on Aurelion Sol PBE Changes**_\n_Positives: _ \nIntroducing a feature like gaining a decaying movement speed on W when retracted is interesting. The Q buff feels very impactful and really gives more confidence when deciding if you can land the stun, and how big you need it. \n\n_Negatives:_\n-Most of these changes not only take away his identity, but also his healthy play-style of being a battle-mage. This just makes him too similar to champions like Lux, Ahri, or Zoe to where you just need to land one ability to set-up your burst. Compared to his live-current state, it's a lot boring. If I wanted to do that, I could play Lux instead to do that job. Having the ability to help your teammates was satisfying. If you managed your wave-clear and managed to find an opening to roam, you were heavily rewarded for that, as it also fits in with a space dragon champion. One other thing is that you don't have that good damage when it comes to dealing with tanks &amp; non-tanks (keep in mind you were only rewarded that damage if your position was on point). Now it turns into most-likely having to snowball to have that pressure, and that alone also takes away to how unique Aurelion Sol is. \n\n_**Suggestions:**_\n- Make the fifth rank of leveling W change the ability to a toggle (which could call for a consideration of the speed of the stars).\n-Have the (E) still give the passive movement speed still, but only if it's off cool-down. \n-Consider tuning/adjusting Aurelion Sol's main damage to have an opportunity to buff his ult. His ult feels meh. (extra effect?, damage?)\n-Keep most of the buffs to (Q) (or adjust it to a slightly lower version from the PBE version)\n-Or if there is no compromise, please don't release it how it is now.\n\nI love this champion a lot, and I can also say the same for the Aurelion Sol Community. We are also very grateful to have our time to speak out about our champion. So Riot, communicate with us more so we can end up with Aurelion Sol not losing his identity has a healthy battle-mage, able to roam and put great damage out if positioned correctly. Thank you. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxt-k9VCpBs\n_**Edit: W comparison, courtesy of @Mjolnirunleashed **_\n\n_Feel free to leave some feedback down below, all helps!_","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2019-08-03T05:32:40.604+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Instead of fixing the shit meta, they try to make everyone fit the shit meta. {{sticker:sg-lux-2}}\n\nRiot games at its finest.

The w movement speed could be tuned down a bit to compensate keeping the e passive on as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-08-02T23:36:40.447+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"I mean, you can roam like every other mage and just... walk there?

Why should a champion like Aurelion Sol, who is in a HEALTHY state and in OK place in the meta, be required for changes on what makes Aurelion Sol, Aurelion Sol. There is 140+ champions to pick and learn, but it's simply not ok for Aurelion Sol to be an interesting niche pick when compared to other flashy champions? Usually when a champion gets this type of treatment, they usually have a big source of complaint (No Zac Engage Counter-play, Fiddlesticks E, etc.), but there is nothing infuriating about Aurelion Sol when it comes to versing him. \n\nWhy shouldn't it be okay to have a champion that rewards you for practicing him to take the control of the game in your hands? Everyone has the ability to play him and fufill his potential to the fullest, but changing him to become easier to most at the sake for \"the rest of the people\" instead of listening to the DEDICATED and PASSIONATE Aurelion Sol players, who decided to go on a journey to master Aurelion Sol? Aurelion Sol not being the flashiest champion in the game can be an opinion, because I believe otherwise (but anyone is welcome to decide for themselves), but him not being flashy to some people shouldn't be the determining factor of changing him. That's just a flat-out insult to the dedicated Aurelion Sol players. \nAnd as I do thank you for your input, as it does give light on what other people think, the people of voice and opinion who have DEDICATED their time to playing this champion and who have formed a community around him, should be able to influence what should happen to Aurelion Sol.","replies":[{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2019-08-13T19:00:36.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo TheMojoKiller, show them a giant Q E cross map combo gank.

His wave-clear and roaming early game is fucking strong when you pull it off, yes, but that's IF you pull it off. Aurelion Sol doesn't have that free reign when him and his laner reach level 3. You would know as if you were versing a Fizz, he would go all in on you if you were pushing and wave-clearing, because he can gap-close and burst hard. Something a lot of champions have, which who they can punish Asol if they play the matchup right. The enemy jungler could play around engaging on Asol when he tries to roam, because it can be predictable. This is also considering the fact that he could fail his roams due to lanes being attentive to his MIA. \n\nLong story short, he is strong at what he does, but he has CLEAR weaknesses and windows of opportunity of punishment. \nLike tell me, how is being good at something, yet being able to be completely punishable, toxic? Also, \"one toxic niche\" is an exaggeration, while they are completely changing the way he's played, he's not hanging on to one toxic niche, he's hanging on to everything the champion is SUPPOSED to be.

But the beauty of it all is that it has counterplay! You can punish Aurelion Sol from pushing. The fact that Aurelion Sol shoves waves puts him at risk of getting ganked. His pushing can also punished by  the laner themselves if they can gap-close him, cc-him, or make him waste mana on them instead of pushing. Tahm's W is his identity and saving allies was strong, and all he had to do was be near them to save them. But that isn't the same case here man, if you let him push, he gets to roam. If you punish him from trying to push, he has to stay and clear waves, or gets killed from being out of positioned or just being ganked. That's why I love this guy so much, it's because he's in no terms of being absolutely broken, or too op to the point where there is no counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Tobykachu","date":"2019-08-03T15:03:35.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is it really that easy to punish him though?

If he tries to fight you, he is getting hit by 6 or more minions at once and early game they hurt and if you have exhaust or ignite, usually ends up with me winning. Very few champions can fight anyone in a full minion wave early game and those that can end up being the few champions that he can actually outscale later on into the game.\n\nI agree that Aurelion is far from broken and has a pretty fair and balanced kit and I really do wish they'd hit his E in a meaniingful way so that they can buff his damage because personally I don't really want to play a champion who's main strength is roaming around the map, but I don't think these changes are particularly damning to his identity, but only time will tell as to whether or not these changes are good or bad.

The bonus movement speed on W after it retracts now means you can afford to go other rune choices instead of phase rush every game.\n\nAs previously mentioned, because of the changes, his early and mid-game is strong. And because his passive damage was increased early, as well as his W speed, he's going to do a lot more damage, I acknowledge that. When it comes to late game against a decent comp, it's not going to be that \"easy\" to pick someone out when they know all they have to do is avoid your set-up, your q. And if the enemy-team is not fed, but scaled enough, it's not going to be easy to one-shot someone without comitting and risking your life. Keep in mind, your passive ap scaling is weaker late game. If you can't finish them with one combo, you have to either leave or commit, hence the life of a burst-mage, which we have plenty of.\n\nHaving the ability to zone, do good consistent damage rewarded with positioning, and being able to roam effectively with enough practice feels very rewarding. Having that thrown away to just turn him into another burst-mage (by which some could argue other burst-champs could do better) doesn't feel fun or great or healthy.","replies":[{"poster":"Tobykachu","date":"2019-08-02T22:49:40.662+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Aurelion's late game at the moment is nothing special.

Something that Aurelion Sol can do quite exceptionally well when comparing those champions to him is the ability to manipulate the battle-field when it comes to zoning people with your stars, and do enough damage to kill or pressure the enemies. Going the AP Bruiser route gave you the damage to kill squishes or tanks because the hp shred to tanks, and magic pen w/ cc for squishes. Of course making it so that stars aren't disabled is pretty damn good, but it's the reason why committed Aurelion Sol players can pull it off regardless. The positioning to dodge the cc, kite around their cc, and damage them and zone at the same time, (especially when you have rylais) is under-appreciated. And it's also worth mentioning that if those changes go through, Aurelion Sol won't have that strong roaming potential that has live. That's also one thing he's good at that not most champs are. \n\nThis isn't a buff to Aurelion Sol, it's a change of playstyle to make him easier for other players, but also nerfing the capabilities of how you can impact a game. With the time I've been playing Aurelion Sol, and few days I've been consistenly testing out the Aurelion Sol changes, I strongly believe that it isn't a net positive with most of these changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Tobykachu","date":"2019-08-02T23:59:58.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"A trait of all battle mages is their good zoning ability, of which most have better control of due to their much later higher game damage.

The reason he's still good because of how efficient he is when it comes to constantly being able to damage multiple enemies at once, especially when you pull off good positioning. No other battle mage can pull off consistent aoe teamfighting against up to five people AT ONCE like Aurelion Sol can. Why should he be able to do heavy impact damage when such a champion is able to manipulate a teamfight so well, with a BASE ability. High-reaching numbers don't solely measure the worth of the champion, it's what they provide. That's why I'm stressing so much that these changes will remove that kind of power, power that's rewarded for practicing a lot. Even when knowing that, there is counterplay if you can get the best of him by gap-closing him or ccing him, it's a healthy factor of Aurelion. \n\nAs with roaming, it is nerfed heavily. You honestly can't wave-clear as fast due to your w having a big cooldown with limited uptime. With the old (E), it also factors in the ability to get to your lane fast and then clearing the wave, then moving on to another lane, with you using your e or not. The movement speed boost you get is the key to roaming, and with that gone, it's a severe unnecessary impact.","replies":[{"poster":"Tobykachu","date":"2019-08-03T09:54:19.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I said he has **one of** the lowest damage outputs, **late game**, out of all **mages**.

(A win rate that stems almost entirely from his roaming potential).\n\n?? Why are we comparing Aurelion Sol to Anvia, Karthus, Cass, and etc. a solid point to saying how weak he is. Again, damage alone isn't the solo determining factor in what makes strong in the late-game. Is he super crazy strong when it comes to damage? No, but that isn't the thing here. Even though they are all battle-mages, they bring something different to the table, and that's what I'm saying about Aurelion. You shouldn't be saying he's weak because he isn't killing people instantly with his stars, because that isn't him. What no other battle-mage brings that Aurelion Sol does is the base ability to potentially damage up to 5 people at once, zone people out of fights, grant cc to the team (assuming you get rylais), at a consistent rate, as long as his W is up. What I'm saying is that it's the damage and utility Aurelion Sol brings to the team that no one complains when a team gets an Aurelion Sol because of the absolute potential to be a carry in teamfights.\n\nNow, no matter how you or Riot say it, this a nerf to his damage. It also makes him more predictable in fights. For starters, once you right past mid-game, that AP scaling on his passive will be weaker than his live. His w not being able to have full up-time at the point takes him away from having full dps WILL make a difference, because while positioning yourself right made you do more damage live, but the pbe w restricts you from constatly dps the team, because you'll just be squishy burst-mage not being able to have that power like you used to. B\n\nBut wait, stars move faster! But wait, you can have it up every 2 seconds! Again and again, his scaling was nerfed late game, and removing the complete uptime of his W does remove his battle-mage like kit, and those 2 seconds are crucial. The stars \"being faster\" isn't going to be stronger at this point or make up for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Tobykachu","date":"2019-08-03T14:57:14.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because we are talking about battle mages, control mages and high dps mages.
