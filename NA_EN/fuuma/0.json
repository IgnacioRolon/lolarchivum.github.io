I tried to play a game yesterday (June 19th) and was informed via pop-up message saying that my account was permanently banned and that I should refer to my email for detailed info. The email and the ban was issued on April 13th....\r\n\r\nIf my account was not used how exactly was there a use of 3rd party malicious software? And why is it that  Riot won't even look into the situation to give me further information? \r\n\r\nMy card information as well as my financial contribution to the game are being held hostage!\r\n\r\nI just want answers... It doesn't make sense..","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-06-21T22:49:59.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can investigate what happened on your account if you submit a [ticket ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) over to our player behavior team.
