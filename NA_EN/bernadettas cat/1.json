I'm always to type of person to play unconventional champions in roles, and Pyke Jungle is one of my favorite things to play. I don't think it's problematic, due to how slow his early clear is, and is absolutely not as problematic as solo lane Pyke, which is strong due to him being able to shrug off poke with his passive healing.\r\n\r\nSo the nerfs to Pyke are really frustrating to me. I understand that he needs to be shut down in top and mid, and hitting his waveclear is a good way to do that, but if his passive is what's entirely out of line, why is that not being changed at ALL? And the changes completely disregard that his waveclear isn't even that amazing in the first place, and it requires Pyke to use his cooldowns for his CC/Mobility abilities. If the passive was changed to be less oppressive in solo lanes, and the cooldown of his E went up, solo lane Pyke would take a sizable hit. \r\n\r\nInstead, Riot buffed the cooldown on his Q (which is welcome for support, I guess) while taking away the AoE damage (which partially guts Pyke Jungle's clear) and the increased damage on the tap (meaning there's almost never a reason to just tap instead of pulling). W got a buff, which seems somewhat out of left field, buffing Pyke's lategame roaming. The E removal of damage to monsters absolutely kills Pyke Jungle and hurts solo lane Pyke. That's the biggest problem I have, because solo lane Pyke can still just buy a Tiamat after a rough few levels (which he can survive with his passive) and regain his ability to waveclear. Pyke Jungle _cannot_ clear his early jungle if this change goes through. If Riot actually cared about nonproblematic alternative playstyles, they would change his E to do %reduced damage to minions, and increase the cooldown, hurting his waveclear against minions but still making it POSSIBLE to jungle. \r\n\r\nI might just play TFT until something better happens. I feel as thought solo lane Pyke has just been complained about so much that Riot are just taking things away recklessly without considering if it's the best overall approach (which I guess is better than doing nothing, like they're doing for Tahm).","replies":[]}
