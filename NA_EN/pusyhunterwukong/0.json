I was about to buy kled but when I was scrolling around to see other champions it just went from 7k to 3.5k and same thing happened yesterday but lesser IP this time. 3-4 weeks ago when I bought a champion the IP didn't drop at first but it did after re-logging in or otherwise I would have understood this glitch :)","replies":[]}]}]}
