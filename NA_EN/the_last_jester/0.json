I started off last season trying to focus on top/jungle, and was in a huge slump, quite tired of the game and feeling like I was never going to progress.  During the start of season 2014, I decided I wanted to get back to my typical roots of gaming, and main support/jungle.  League felt like a whole new game, and now I'm outta that Silver 4 slump (so far climbed up to Silver 2).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2014-07-15T06:39:24.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i do not understand the problem. I grew up playing hearts and chess. Probably have over 2000 chess games played at this point in my life. And i do not want to consider how many card games i have lost... \n\nWhy do people get board with challenges? None of us in this thread are even Plat. There is plenty of room to grow in this game. Games were originally meant to be challenges for people to learn form and over come. \"Fun\" is a concept that was added much later and really is not locked into gaming, though people started to say it must be fun. I really do not get that. I enjoy personally enjoy the challenge of league, just like i enjoy a good chess game. \n\nWhen did losing become a bad thing? I do not mean losing as in people walking into the enemy tower 5 times in a row. I mean a close game where you you lost due a slight mistake or them making an outrageous play? I am going to steal a line from C9 here, \"you can not learn when we are at the top\". This is not an original thought Metos or Hai had. This is a very old one almost as old as the art of war. \n\nNot everyone will be top .05% (challenger) but anyone with effort can be top 10% (plat). I do not understand people when they say its boring. Boring can only happen when you win all the time. Well boring can happen when your refuse to learn and lose in the same way every time. In league every match is different a new chance to out play or learn something new. There has to be at least 100 possible different ways of setting up runes/masteries. I ahve won matches as an ADC with 9/21/0 masteries with exhaust spell.\n\nGradius said try a different lane. yes do this. learning as much as you can about every part of the game will make you better.\n\nSo i wrote this with the question in mind, How can you be bored/tired?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roxeon","date":"2014-07-15T17:56:30.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get some friends and have fun games.

What really keeps me going is playing dominion by myself until my friends are on, then doing what they want to do, which is usually draft 5s.  Unfortunately as of late dominion solo queue is just absolutely frustrating and since noone I know likes the game mode I just suffer :P  Another thing I do is occasionally elope to Public Beta Environment to play around there :D\n\nNevertheless try to find a custom game mode or a non 5s gamemode that you enjoy, you would be suprised how refreshing it can be.  \n\n...Incidentally are there any rioters who have a passion for dominion and want a dominion buddy? :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-07-15T07:51:40.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"playing /rnd in a random role, forces you to adapt to very curious situations if you want to win the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tiropat","date":"2014-07-15T06:51:54.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried improving your play? Instead of playing to win or playing to have fun (cause the game isn't as fun for you played this way), try playing a difficult or different champ just for the reason of getting good at them. For example {{champion:39}} or {{champion:90}} strive to reach some predetermined goal so you can have a sense of accomplishment when you do \"get good\" at them.\n\nFor the goal it can be to win lane 5 times in a row to have an average of 4.5 or higher KDA over your three most recently played games as whatever champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2014-07-15T06:40:22.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried learning a new role not long ago but it just ended in frustration and less fun as I was getting flamed constantly (wasn't even doing bd, just didn't get 7 billion kills).\n\nIt is hard to learn a new role as of late so it's hard to say. I love ranked...but I hate it so so much as it ends up being frustrating more often than fun due to other players. I own all the champs so I don't have that to strive for anymore (been playing since 2011). I don't know any rl that plays or wants to play (some have tried and quit rather fast). URF was really a fun thing for me but that went away sadly.\n\nI really love this game but I just feel like I've done a lot and gotten a lot out of it but I stick around sometimes simply because I have put a lot into it and not just because I want to as sad as that is to finally admit. I'm usually good at finding my own fun and not expecting a game to throw it at me, unfortunately it is harder to find the fun in LoL after all these years, especially when all the champions I really loved playing are just weak compared to the newer ones.\n\nMy favs were always Karthus, Morg (mid thought I play her support), Sona who is getting ruined currently on the PBE, Mord who is okay, Ashe who is kind of in a bad place in comparison to so many other ADCs, Cass, and really these champs don't fit in quite as well anymore and it makes me feel out of place if that makes sense.\n\nWish I knew how to make the game fun for myself again but I'm too old age wise to have any chance of getting into the LCS regardless of how good I ever get in ranked and I've been playing too long to find a challenge in normals and normal game modes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shenron","date":"2014-07-15T06:38:57.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taking random champions into random roles usually works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaperMache7","date":"2014-07-15T06:14:26.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked can be frustrating, but as long as your remember your own skill level is the only thing that can make you stagnate you can always improve.
