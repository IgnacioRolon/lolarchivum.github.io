When the server issues were fixed, we turned LeaverBuster back on, but the penalties weren't firing. As a result of this, we're seeing that some players ***who left/AFK'd in games after the firewall and networking issues resolved*** did not receive their penalty until this week.\n\nSorry about the confusion! All low priority queue penalties should be granted immediately after leaving/AFK games now, instead of after a delay.","replies":[{"poster":"Storm of Angels","date":"2015-01-16T03:54:28.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Come on, Riot?

I disconnected from a game a few days ago because my wifi went down and i had to get it fixed. Now i get sent to low priority queue. I have been in this \"low priority\" after 2 games already! WTH Riot? Why do i have to be punished? Dont even say I have \"Been AFK in several games\" because thats actually crap. I HAVEN'T been afk and i havent been toxic in the chat. This is ridiculous.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shredder925","date":"2015-08-17T19:12:31.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I received a leave buster for 5 games at 10 min each, however it wasnt my fault.

The last game i had fix something that broke during the match that is necessary to play but like any time I am forced to divert my attention away from the game I returned it as soon as possible for the sake of my lane and teammates. \n\nI am nothing friendly and supportive in games even towards players who frustrate or instigate me so I highly doubt you can pull the verbal excuse on me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanirgon","date":"2015-03-06T19:10:02.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello everyone who is reading this.\nToday, I have received probably my first penalty in five years of LoL.\nThat's right, I've been playing since preseason 1 now.\nSo what was the reason for that?\nAFK.\nIntentional?

The other day while I was playing a game as Ahri in the Howling Abyss I accidentally spilled juice all over my gaming computer and into my power strip, I take credit for that one, it was my fault.  I tried reconnecting to the game on my laptop but it had already ended by the time I could get into League of Legends. I got a leaver-buster warning for this offense and though I was sorely disappointed to see that, I went on my way.\n\nWhat I don't understand, is that I've been playing multiple games and have never had another offense with leaver-buster after the destroyed computer incident, and I just logged on to experience a 15 minute leaver-buster time. Is this a bug, or am I facing double-punishment for missing the last five minutes of a game that I otherwise majorly contributed to? I have never had any history of abandoning games, and I haven't missed a single moment of a game after the Ahri thing. \n\nI'm in no way complaining, and I think leaver-buster is a great system to stop people from leaving games, I'm simply looking for insight as to why I am facing penalties when I've not committed any offense besides that one incident.","replies":[]},{"poster":"laserluci","date":"2015-01-26T20:04:40.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i must 5 min wait for one game :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"FertileStarfish","date":"2015-01-26T08:43:10.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it said i left games, when i havent afked in awhile.

I had one leave three days prior, because I couldn't connect at all. After that, the notification came up I was in LPQ.

I have recently been through 5 minute, 10 minute and a set of 20 minute waiting times. I was angry, yes, since they seemed to be extremely harsh for disconnecting 15 minutes in a game, but I enjoy this game, and I toughed it out. I played the games, didnt disconnect, and was playing ranked, a promo. For some reason I dont know, i think my comp was running a little slow, it took 5 minutes to get into the game. Ok. I wasnt far behind, nothing happened. Yet after I bought items, I was kicked for \"prolonged inactivity\" by Riot, which led to me taking another 10 minutes to get into the game due to the aforementioned slow running, and after the game i was put in low-priority queue ONCE AGAIN. But this time, It wasn't my fault. I got back from a dc in reasonable time and you kicked me, making us lose the game and putting me in low priority queue again. \n\nAnd before you go saying that you're gonna go checking my match history and say that Im a \"frequent\" afk, I'm not talking about those times. I'm talking specifically about this time, where you punished me for something you did.","replies":[]}]}
