Damit riot, its like you want to ruin your game even more? What happened? did the community not inform you the nerfs were too hard? Now his late game is fine, he is strong late game but Azir is literally so useless right now, that the only time I actually can play properly, is the very last 10 mins of a match because he cannot do anything at all early or mid game. Now I am not saying you can't win with him early game. I am saying his early game was nerfed so hard, it makes him useless early and that in turn makes him weak mid. \r\n\r\nNow I recently played a match aganist nasus top to see the difference because I remembed a match similar where i was top aganist nasus, I was able to do enough damage to keep him from farming to an extent, he is nasus so he made a come back mid and late game. But now I cant do anything, I had 2 soldiers on this nasus, I couldn't do jack shi* And it isnt with just nasus, its with everyone. Now i admit before the nerf he did do a bit of burst and hurt early, but you didn't need to nerf im THAT HARD jesus. Give him 10 damage back on every level, that should even it out. Or take off half the nerf. Don't you even dare riot give him some stupid buff on his ult or e. \r\n\r\nalso, I just want to say you devs need to take control of your game I don't know what's going on but this game is being run into the ground so hard its sad.","replies":[{"poster":"ryancup","date":"2015-08-15T04:19:38.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back then I was 20+/5 with Azir, now with nerfs I'm 3/19 ....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Major Sparkles","date":"2015-03-10T21:33:28.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure in patch 5.5 they're buffing his soldier range to 375.","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-03-10T21:39:55.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JonneyMarket,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WyaFwTEM,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-10T21:33:28.190+0000)\n>\n> I'm pretty sure in patch 5.5 they're buffing his soldier range to 375.\n\nits not the range. its the dmg","replies":[{"poster":"Major Sparkles","date":"2015-03-10T22:19:34.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://lol.arcana-gaming.com/en/Article/1973/updated-league-of-legends-unofficial-5-5-pbe-patch-notes\n\n{{champion:268}}  :\n\nArise!

Everyone knows how much Riot overnerfed Azir so first they're going to see how he does by giving him back some of his range. Maybe the damage will follow suit. In the meantime, try different runes?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
