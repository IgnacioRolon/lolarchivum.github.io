I go from 50-70 fps to 1-3 fps. This has happened to me a bit and forced me to afk to sniff out the problem. This ONLY happens while playing League, no other games. (I play a lot of things, from Minecraft to BioShock). I don't know why this happens. I left my Task Manager open and when my fps dropped, I tabbed out and it said LEAGUE was the problem. I had no other programs open at that time. League said it was eating up about 6/7 of my CPU. I looked during another game when this went back to normal, and it was using about 1/2 to 3/4 of my CPU, which is about normal usage. I have tried a lot of things, including defragmenting my hard drive and closing all other running programs. I have gotten 2-3 afkbusters for this, because I basically cannot move while this happens (I am currently writing this during my final 10 minute wait queue of the current punishment). My stats are 4GB RAM, Intel i5 2.67 gHZ, and I have about 100 GB free of a 255 GB Hard Drive (If I forgot a stat, please let me know and I will edit this). I really want this fixed, so I can stop disappointing my team by being forced into going afk. Also, not a must, but if you could reset my punishments, or at least 2 of them (that's how many I KNOW I've gotten from this bug, but I may have gotten more) that would be great :D . Thank you for taking your time to read this, and I really hope it gets fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-15T23:29:33.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I'm not able to remove your Leaverbuster punishments, as the disconnections still negatively impact everyone else in the match, I can point you in the right direction to resolving this issue for good. FPS issues can be caused by a number of different factors, however, problematic drivers and windows power settings are the most common causes. I strongly suggest working through the steps outlined in our [FPS troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) as a first step in resolving this.\n\nLet me know if you still have issues after taking those steps.","replies":[]}]}
