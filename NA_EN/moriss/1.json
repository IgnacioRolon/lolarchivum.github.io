I should at least have the risk of going into the fog of war. Nocturnes ult currently is exploitable with a cool-down that&#039;s far too low for what it does and the champion himself has easy access to Cool-down reduction in any build path.\r\n\r\nEven if you didn&#039;t hit the cooldown. The fact that it disables wards for tp channels seems to just have the potential in itself to &quot;when nocturne becomes popular again&quot; smother out other possible choices.","replies":[{"poster":"x R e n g a R x","date":"2016-06-14T02:29:18.490+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \n\nStop","replies":[]},{"poster":"JamesTheMage17","date":"2016-06-14T02:48:23.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the concept of it but I think it should do less damage, or no damage at all because it's so effective and gives him a free dash, escape, or kill for his team.","replies":[]}]}
