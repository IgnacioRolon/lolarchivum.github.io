The original rules were modified based on some player feedback, so that a first blood doesn't prevent your team from remaking unless it was against your team, and it happened before the player left.  To put it simply, a player can't quit after first blood and hope for a remake.\n\nHere's the (recently updated) post with more detail: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/play-games-matter/remake","replies":[{"poster":"Archadria","date":"2016-06-19T03:55:15.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problems:\n90 seconds = 1.5 minutes.

Because it is able to absolve players of a loss, it is also a target for players trying to avoid a legitimate loss so we have to be very deliberate about the cases where /remake applies.","replies":[{"poster":"Moriss","date":"2016-06-25T05:08:01.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Riot Stopthief Really glad to hear that the rules were modified and thank you for the provided link.
