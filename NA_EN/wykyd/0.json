Am I really not going to be able to play URF?!?! I haven't been able to play League for the past few months and this is how it goes now that I'm back? This started last night. Prior to that I had no issues and was able to play just fine. Nothing else has changed.","replies":[{"poster":"googel","date":"2018-01-25T01:42:06.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ما قدر ادخل على الجيم","replies":[]},{"poster":"IJustStoleBaron","date":"2017-06-16T15:26:19.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you fix it?

After some diagnostics I was able to narrow down the issue to a service called \"Razer Game Scanner\". It's associated with Razer Synapse. I'm going to be contacting Razer support to find a resolution to the issue. Currently the best solution was to disable the service in MSConfig. Will post an update when I have spoken with Razer about the issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lawlspirit","date":"2017-03-06T02:50:49.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same things happening to me.

I don't want to keep having a negative impact on the games I'm trying to join. It's quite unfortunate as I've been away from the game for quite a few months and was looking forward to being able to play again. This is quite frustrating and just want to have it resolved.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wykyd","date":"2017-03-05T22:30:32.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in the exact same boat. I just reinstalled windows because of this error... thinking it was something on my end.

I had restarted the client many times each time giving me the app error\n\nthen tried an urf to see if it was just ranked and same issue.\n\nEDIT - the URF game just finished and because i couldnt connect i have been flagged for afk behaviours and am eligible to earn loot. I hope this gets sorted because not only am i losing out on playing the game i am also being penalised for something that is clearly game related.","replies":[]}]}
