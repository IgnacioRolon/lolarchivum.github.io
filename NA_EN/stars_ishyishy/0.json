There is little to no desire for people to play support, but your suggestion will make queue times very long and get even longer the higher you climb. So League will turn in to League of Queue where everyone is waiting on supports. If you have an answer for that I'm all ears, but until then current queue system is a necessary evil.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2017-03-15T06:21:07.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"No more role selection\n\nIf you can't contend with playing support sometimes or any other position then you don't play ranked.\n\nSeason 6 was a mistake beyond just dynamic Queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Chibi Bronzlife","date":"2017-03-15T07:22:38.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Refer to my response to OP, removing the current que system will severely degrade the overall quality of the game. The thing people don't realize when they complain about this queue system is that nobody has an answer on how to get more people to want to play support. People who get stuck playing support as last pick are just as likely to treat the game as if they had got auto-filled, so what would be the point of removing the current system. Also your logic on who should play ranked is poor. There are many people who only play one champion in one role, so you don't really have any right to say who should and should not play ranked.","replies":[]}]}]}
