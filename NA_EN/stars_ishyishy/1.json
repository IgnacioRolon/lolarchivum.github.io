It should take like 2.  This behavior is the number 1 problem with this game, above any balance issues or bugs.  When someone decides to do nothing but spam ping and flame, it literally ruins the game more than any broken champion ever will.\n\nAlso, Riot needs to monitor verbal abuse instead of a player tribunal or anything else.  I feel like toxic people aren't being reported enough because not enough people care.  If you aren't the target of the flaming, you tend to just not care, and that&#039;s not beneficial to the community as a whole.\n\nAlso, muting them doesn't stop them from spam pinging the ENTIRE game.  That is just as tilting as the guy doing nothing but calling you bad the whole game.

I was so excited to be in my first ranked match this morning. when i got into the game i was immediately asked if it was my first ranked game. I of course said yes hoping to get some advice or encouragement like one should expect given the summoners code that i read just before playing this game. things did not go down that way. Instead 2 members of my team said \"F*CK this\"  and left the game, my other 2 team mates persisted to tell me to quit playing and the loss is my fault because I was new to ranked games. I am often forced to play all AI matches because of this. I know there is nothing you can do to fix this problem for me and I am only one person out of millions of players so I'm little to no importance to you but if you could come up with a way to rank up a champion in an AI match then maybe players like me that want to have fun without the constant harassment and Verbal Abuse from other players could still feel some pride and accomplishment in the hard work we put into a champion even if we aren't \"PRO\" . Thank you for your time and I hope one day a game I've grown to love and spent so much money to support will be fun to play again soon. Not that anyone will read this from riot just people wanting to troll and try to make this sound like its a joke or crybabying. but I wanted to say it and feel that somewhere out there are others like me that want a fun game with none of the Trolling or Bullshit.","replies":[{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2017-02-27T21:40:12.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh well. just mute the assholes and try and enjoy the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-02-26T22:19:29.089+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"Or you could just mute them if it upsets you that much","replies":[{"poster":"Verukato","date":"2017-02-26T22:55:41.638+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You can mute someone, but it doesn't mute spam pinging - which is like a whole new level of harassment.","replies":[{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2017-02-27T19:54:34.833+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You can mute someone, but it doesn&#x27;t mute spam pinging - which is like a whole new level of harassment.\n\nI have pings completely muted (volume at zero) because of spam pinging.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2017-02-26T23:08:23.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem is Riot's insanely stupid policy of having reports carry less weight the more you report. \n\nI honestly have reportable activity in 75% of the games I play in.
