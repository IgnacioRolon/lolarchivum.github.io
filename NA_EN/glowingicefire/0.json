I queued up in Flex to do my second promo. After champ select, next thing I know, it says i disconnected. I try to reconnect several times, and it says the same thing over again. Eventually, it works, and I get into game 5 seconds before my team surrenders for a remake. Now I have leaverbuster, and I couldn't play a game that day anymore.
