I looked in my loot but it's nowhere to be found. I'm not sure if this is because of the Hextech Crafting maintenance or if it was just a bug. Anyone else experience anything similar?","replies":[{"poster":"gabber101","date":"2017-12-12T23:12:40.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same problem.
