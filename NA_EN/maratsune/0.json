It's the fact that _only_ Dynamic Queue is an option.\n\nSince you're missing the entire point, let's spell it out: Riot doesn't give a shit. They stopped listening to their long-time, primary audience for a new audience that by sheer volume could drown out even the oldest and largest fanbases in _any_ game, movie, media entity, anywhere. But here's the thing: it's probably not even _right_. The Chinese market probably honestly would prefer our splashes to theirs, but because their audience is bigger, their servers are more taxed, it'd be just a modicum more of a hassle to actually even out the splashes and just put in the best - the best on either side, a little update to us a little update to them. But no, no no no. We can't have even the _smallest_ delay to the other side because that would mean lost money - lost thousands. Oh yeah, thousands. That's the funny thing - it wouldn't even be a massive financial hit. At most it's a slight inconvenience for actual _quality control_. Oh, be still my heart.\n\nAnd please, spare me the \"But but Riot said this\" crap. Riot said they did this to due to standards in other countries limiting and complicating splash-art releases. Riot said they were picking the \"most artistically and thematically fitting splashes\". Do you _really_ buy that? Really? You buy that? You're actually going to look at this whole process and tell me they honestly did just that?\n\nFirst day of the update, _multiple_ splash-arts were reverted to fucking censor them. All Chinese. _Multiple_ splash-arts have been altered even on the PBE because they need to be censored. Do _not_ give me that bullshit, and don't even begin to try and justify this fucking splash-art change as the most thematically fitting splash - fuck you. No, seriously, fuck you.\n\nThe end point is Riot is **lying**. **To our faces**. They stopped caring about their community. They stopped listening. They just bulldoze their way forward. The fact that solo-queue got axed while they piss on our feet about it for months on end, these constant and borderline asinine changes that only worsen things, the utter lack of any **_meaningful_** feedback from Riot on _any_ of these issues - they're following the exact practices that other companies fall into, and they aren't fucking budging because money. That is the exact practice of those other companies - granted Konami's an outlier in that there is nobody in the universe who can fathom their logic as it is purely self-destructive and is utterly batshit, but the point still stands. Ultimately it's not what the fans or the players or what anybody else wants, it's just profit.

All these anime pictures are shiny and HD and all, but they don't look like that distinct art style we love. They look cheap; art like that is dime a dozen. \nIf they're going to put higher quality splashes in later, why downgrade the quality so heavily first? I don't get it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I Am Pure Krogan","date":"2016-04-24T19:19:24.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't read all of the comments, but I was looking over the new splashes for champs... I mean \"new\" and I noticed that A LOT of these \"new\" splashes I saw from the Chinese version yeaaaaaars ago.\nFor example, Eve's splashes. Where she looks even more like a Satanic Stripper than the original splashes had. And no, I'm not talking about her classic. I mean Masquerade Evelynn and Shadow Evelynn.\nAnnie is.. Her splashes now are ridiculous. Goth Annie for example. I loved the original before this replacement. Red Riding Annie was changed a while back but still, she's too... Cutesy. Annie in Wonderland, another example. Annie isn't what she used to be to me and I'm pretty sure a lot of other people. Also Frostfire Annie is a joke.\nSivir's \"new\" splashes are a weeaboo's wet dream.\nA LOT of these \"new\" splash arts are seriously questionable and I don't really approve or like many of them... I don't understand the point behind changing a lot of these.  I don't support them at all.","replies":[]}]}
