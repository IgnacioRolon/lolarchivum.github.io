I think i speak for a lot of people when i say this. We don't really like the black pants. The dress Diao Chan has in the photo above is what we want! The big problem with this skin currently is that it looks too much like the other skins we already have (*cough* bilgewater *cough*). It doesn't look unique at all and it looks extremely unexciting and dull including the effects, especially when compared to Slay Belle. \n\nSlay Belle was really unique and great. Unique colours, completly new clothing style, new obvious effects. I personally think it would look amazing if you put a dress like in this photo above on her. I want this skin to look unique! Something new that is not like any other Katarina skin! Hopefully you understand what i mean.\n\nA response on your thoughts would be awesome. This means alot to us Katarina players that you hear us.

It isnt that I hate the skin (I am totally gonna buy it on all 4 accounts :P) it just could be so much more. It really feels like you guys are rushing it out there when it could be a absolutely amazing skin with just a little bit more work. \n\nKat has a lot of skins and it just feels like this is it for her, and I want the skin to be as op as the recall animation and a full build uninterrupted ultimate.\n\nIf I worked at riot (and had talent) I would totally stay late for free to make this the best Kat skin ever. I guess I am just a crazy Kat luver though.\n\n**For the Love of** {{champion:55}} \n\nP.S.

I still think though that by changing the hair colour to Ombre still does not fix the unique skin issue very well compared to say changing her clothing style/colour theme. I do like the hair colour change though, good start.\n\nI still do like the skin idea don't get me wrong, i just believe it has way more potential just as Kat Head is saying a few posts above. Daym, that sweet new recall though!  \n\nI'm glad you guys are aware of our thoughts however.
