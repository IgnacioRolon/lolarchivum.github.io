Also, I understand picking the skin is a lot to ask for, but can we at least pick the champion we get the skin for? I own every champion, I play maybe 20 of them, I have skins for at least 18 of the 20 that I play.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-27T17:54:26.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't have in-depth details on this yet as we're still a bit away from preseason, but I'm assuming it will be skins for champs you don't own.
