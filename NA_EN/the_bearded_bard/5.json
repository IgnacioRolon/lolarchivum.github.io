With CDR and spellvamp she would not die in fights and still would deal tons of damage - simply unfair.\n> \n> The thing about mages is that they are supposed to use their spells and then get out, wait for the cooldowns and do the same. AD champions have to stay in the fight and use AA's and spells whenever they can.\n\nShe would be essentially an AP Riven.\n\nRiven is currently unbearable mid-late game because not only her shield scales with AD, but she has lifesteal to back it up, so once she has some lifesteal items, she is unduelable. \n\nPeople defend that Diana also has a shield scaling with her main offensive stat, but they forget that Diana can't heal herself to back up that shield. If you don't damage Diana through her shield, the damage will stick to her.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2015-10-30T17:24:06.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"well. most AP champs shoot at you from a distance so if you hit from a distance and yet have defense that would be ridiculous.\nand its all in the build. most AP champs are glass cannon. a lot of damage and not a lot of defense. you can get defense but you will get regular damage just like the most of us","replies":[{"poster":"The Bearded Bard","date":"2015-10-31T05:13:27.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realize literally every ranged adc hits from a distance and they all build lifesteal, right?

And because of how his kit works, its impossible to just \"Nerf his numbers\" to balance it out. He has proven to be extremely problematic whenever a good spell vamp item was made. And he will continue to do so until they can figure out a way to fix his issues.\n\nThere are OTHER champions who abuse the stat when there is a good item for it, but Vlad is the biggest offender.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarthSpectrum","date":"2015-10-31T19:47:38.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure this has already been mentioned, but spellvamp is not allowed to be good on mages because of {{champion:8}} {{champion:84}} and {{champion:50}}.\n\nAt least with Life steal, champions regain their health in rapid small increments. As well, most AD casters only do 1/2 to 2/3 of the damage compared to their AP counterparts in one rotation of their abilities. AD Casters are assumed to use their AAs in their combos to make up for the difference in damage.\n\nHowever, because most AP champions deal burst damage, if spellvamp is efficient on them they will literally regain more than half their HP bar in one well placed AOE from 700 units away.\n\nNot to mention that Akali, Vladimir, and Swain would literally become invincible demons on the rift, leeching over 100% of their damage.","replies":[]}]}
