There would still be many ways to tell the difference, clicking on either Shaco or the Clone will still tell you which is which, the real one will still have the buff 'Hallucination' and the fake would still lack it and any other buffs, the fake one still won't be able to cast spells, and the real one will still always appear facing in the same direction he was facing when the spell was cast.

Nothing big, just changing the damage of boxes to \"spell damage\" to open up ap shaco a little more. It will allow support shaco to benefit from the ap support item better, allow liandries to work on boxes which would help vs tanks, and boxes then would proc ludens. As of now the only things boxes proc are blue elixir, rylais, and morellos. If it procs these items I feel it should also proc the others I mentioned.

It doesn't even tank more than two autos from large jungle monsters after 7 minutes. It's almost useless due to how easy it is to just ignore it. Not to mention that Oracles Lens disarms it completely","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
