This falls under the latter of the two. Telling someone to cause harm to themselves or another is not acceptable outside the game, just as much as it is unacceptable inside the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-23T19:00:53.095+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Veigar is a support.\n\nVeigar is definitely a support right now.\n\nAlso deserved.
