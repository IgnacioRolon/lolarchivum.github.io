I came home, followed instructions on the card (go to in-store game, click on Accounts, enter in the code from the card). It said it was successful. I go to join a game, I picked Sivir. The skin for Neo PAX is grayed out and has a lock on it.\r\n\r\nI've logged in and out several times. I am in NA so I would be on NA servers. Why am I not able to play with the Neo PAX skin? I am thoroughly confused.\r\n\r\nSomeone please halp.","replies":[{"poster":"Lew","date":"2017-09-04T09:57:44.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure you have the skin selected?
