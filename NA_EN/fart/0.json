Over the last two days I've had my regular 35~40 but in some games it has spiked over 150 and at the highest 400. I haven't found anyone with a similar issue. In another MMO I played recently I had the same issue and so did others but only those under the same ISP.\r\n\r\nI live in NY and my ISP is Time Warner (rip). Wondering if it's just me or mainly those under the same ISP. Thanks in advance for any help.","replies":[{"poster":"Lycanoon","date":"2016-05-19T21:12:28.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can explain the ping issues, and you may not like to hear it.\n\nDue to the \"election rampage\" taking place, the North-East has been experiencing high traffic and extremely variable connection speeds.\nThis also has to do with a lot of people utilizing the network through various forms.\n\nSo, let me put it this way...\nTime between hops, Benchmarks, and IB/OB data transfer will be slower than normal.\nDo you have P2P enabled?  I have noticed my ping SKYROCKET when I leave this enabled...and I live in Michigan, using comcast.  Without it enabled, my ping remains at 12ms - 38ms.\nEnabled, my ping is highly variable from 32ms up to 200ms.\n\nMight I also suggest you look into giving priority to Leagues connection through your modem as well via PRF and PRT...and if the option is available to you, QoS and give your system highest priority.\n\nBy the way...some of the TW modems are garbage...especially the telephony modems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-19T20:51:15.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haven't seen anything reported on widespread NY and/or TWC issues lately.  If it's happening in multiple games/applications though it sounds like it could unfortunately be a local ISP issue.
