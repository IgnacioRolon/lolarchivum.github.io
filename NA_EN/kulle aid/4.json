But I don't know if this is a alpha client problem or legacy client. The language filer wont disable. I am not trying to cuss out my team don't worry, I have good sportsman ship. It's just the way I talk. a good play will always end in \"GOD DAMN\". so anyways. I disabled the language filter in both clients and its still blocking everything in game. ONLY in game. Normal chat its fine so I'm am totally lost. What can I do to disable the language filter","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-17T01:59:33.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ugh, this bug is really annoying, so let's try to sort this out! Go into the settings and **enable** the filter, then hit **DONE**. Go back into the settings and then **disable** the filter, then hit **DONE** again.\n\nLet me know if this fixed it!","replies":[{"poster":"Kulle Aid","date":"2017-02-17T02:38:37.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its 50/50 on working it seems. Itll be on and off depending on time. I have tried that. thought that refreshing the basic setting like that would work and it did for a couple games then it started giving me **** again. I will continue to do that because it seems to work temporarily but  is it probably gonna be fixed next patch?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-19T21:23:42.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Others have reported it being an 'on and off' type experience as well. I can't provide an estimate for when you'll see a fix go out for this, but we're aware of the issue. Since I don't work on the teams that would develop a fix for this, I don't have any other information to share.\n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Kulle Aid","date":"2017-02-20T03:18:51.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the help you give, not just me but for the whole community.
