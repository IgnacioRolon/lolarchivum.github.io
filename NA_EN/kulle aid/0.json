I need help. I went and reinstalled, I lowered my settings, I changed ALL settings to max performance, including GeForce drivers, all drivers are updated. it started in 7.5, but honestly its bugging the hell out of me. I could usually have 150 on high like its nothing at ALL times. that was in 7.2 - 7.4 then now I'm lucky if I get 30 in fights and 90 while playing with no constant frames. what is going on with these patches that doesn't let it communicate with my drivers properly. help me","replies":[{"poster":"Renegade47","date":"2017-04-03T01:15:21.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same problem. I had over 200 fps then with an update it dropped to 100 fps with drops to lower then 10. So I start trying on other games like witcher 3 which where all running fine. Wrote a ticket which didn't help. Then it stopped after a small update. I still dont get the 200fps i had but i got a steady 90-100 fps which is great. Still don't understand what they changed though. My pc can better run bf1, doom and almost get more fps with witcher 3. Which is weird ofcource. \n\nAnyhow I hope they will fix it for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-02T03:52:08.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmmm typically updating your graphics drivers are a good start to fix FPS issues.

Really its a laptop that runs it on high to very high most of the time with great frames. Ive turned of my cpu for it to and have it running on gpu at all times, its a Samsung laptop and they have a \"thermal lock\" on cpu which engages every teamfight - fps from  120 - 25 in fights","replies":[]}]}]}
