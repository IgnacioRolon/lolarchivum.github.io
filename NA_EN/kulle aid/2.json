Anyone got tips?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the internet at the location I am currently at is TERRIBLE. I'm talking 200kbs. And leagues site is even blocked so I don't even bother. I, instead, use a hotspot to play league because I LOVE this game and don't want to stop playin it. What's great is that league uses barely any data, which is incredible, but the connections vary at times and it might be my carrier or just dns. I do \"ipconfig /flushdns\" which helps every now and again reset its links so I'm fine. I even run the lol tool to help fix any other settings.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there is anything else I could do to try and reduce ping besides what is posted online, any helpful tips. I love riot so maybe ill get some help and the community is always great so any advice would be incredibly useful. \r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}} \r\nbeen gone 3 months and I love these new icons.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-04T04:31:00.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo these new icons are dope though right?!\n{{sticker:sg-ezreal}} \n\nBack to the task at hand. You might be able to get a bit of a better signal by adjusting some of those hotspot settings like DNS servers and such following the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), but overall you may not be able to get much better signal since you're running on a hotspot =\\ . Those work by essentially turning your phone into a router, which diminishes the signal a bit more on top of the fact that your phone hardware just isn't built to function as a gaming router.","replies":[]}]}
