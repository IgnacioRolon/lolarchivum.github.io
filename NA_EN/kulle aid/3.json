His client in game will just minimize itself and show his home screen. It does not CLOSE it. Its closing itself in Full screen mode in game and we can not find the issue that is causing this. We have tried to \"initiate full repair\" in the client and this leads to nothing. This is causing problems for him in gameplay when team fights break out and it closes on him randomly. Anyone able to help me assess this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-27T20:51:00.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It kind of sounds like your pc is forcing an alt+tab or somehow switching the focus window. Make sure your keyboard doesn't have a Windows key that you might be hitting on accident. There might also be a program running in the background forcing those windows to switch, so let's also try restarting your pc really quick.","replies":[]}]}
