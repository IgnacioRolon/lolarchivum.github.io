The client isn't able to let me close and I have no control over my computer. Now here is how I know its league client, I have a touch screen and cant close client but can use anything else, I just stare at that defeat key and can't change it. As soon as I use touch screen to close game entirely I gain control again and can then use my mouse. Why is my game doing this and how do I prevent it? sorry if I seem rude, I'm on tilt. couldn't even view my stats due to this issue and it made it worse","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-11T02:43:30.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm.. Does your computer ship with any gesture-software or anything that supplements the touch screen features?

I don't know what causes it, and its not every game. its an occasional problem. i do not have an gesture software and its only in End game that causes it.
