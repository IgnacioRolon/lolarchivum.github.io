( No art though)","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot should make a Thanksgiving themed skin for Tristana. Her rocket can be replaced with a cornucopia and instead of shooting metal balls, she can be shooting food! Her autos could be like nuts or fruit. Her crits could be a spicy or flaming food of sorts. Her W could be the cornucopia shooting juice or soup and Tristana could land with a splash. Her E could be a turkey going up cooking stages with each auto until it becomes red and black and explodes( slightly cooked turkey -&gt; a bit more brown -&gt; More juicier and almost fully cooked -&gt; Cooked turkey that&#039;s overstuffed and about to explode). Her ultimate could be like...a huge ear of corn or fruit that explodes and pushes target away with an explosion/huge splash. Please upvote if you want to see this idea come to _**fruition**_! **(Pun INTENDED)**","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-10-16T22:56:17.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like it","replies":[]}]}
