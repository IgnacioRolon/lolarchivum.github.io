Then, the game instantly crashed. I just brushed it off as just a bug with the camera key or something so I reconnected. I came back in again, and I tried to press the \"Enter\" key to try to apologize for my teammates. Unfortunately, there was a crash too. I've reconnected multiple times and tried multiple keys, but I came to a consensus that there was something wrong with the game. I checked the recent crash reports, and they say something about RADS being unable to open specific files because \"it's not in the manifest.\" Yes, I updated my keyboard drivers. Does anyone have any solution to this at all?","replies":[{"poster":"EloDaddy Tarz","date":"2016-12-17T16:04:13.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem T_T","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-14T05:11:22.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was there a specific crash error that popped up when this happened? Maybe it was a bugsplat error, the one with Ziggs on it? I'll need a few more details to understand exactly what happened.","replies":[]}]}
