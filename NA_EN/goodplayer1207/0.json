However it seems that this account can't get past authenticating. I've tried everything in the login issues page, but it seems its something glitched about this particular account. {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"NocUrTibbersOut","date":"2017-06-12T09:53:02.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the EXACT same problem, friend bought me a skin, game froze when I tried to view it and when I try to login again its just authenticating for all eternity, been like this for 2 days now, tried basically everything I know, flushing dns, re-newing IP, restarting router & computer, Hextech Repair Tool, re-patching, empty cache, etc etc, nothing works..Only option left is to completely re-install league I guess.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-06T01:08:24.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We were having a little hiccup with the login servers earlier today, so I'm curious if that was the reason you couldn't get signed in.
