I ran into some really toxic people. I was fine and calm and i didn&#039;t care at all. I noticed after taking about a 1-2 week break from my smurf. I came back on earlier today to see a permanent ban on my smurf account. I did not get any email and i wasn&#039;t able to see the chatlogs. I looked up my match history and recalled those games. I don&#039;t remember being toxic at all so I was just wondering if i could get some help with this. This account is banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-01-11T23:29:43.085+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was likely a security ban - as in it looks like someone other than the original account owner was accessing the account unauthorized. Contact support and they will help you recover your account if it is yours.\n\nNote that if you purchased the account, or otherwise acquired it from someone else, it is not rightfully your account and you will not be able to recover it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2018-01-11T23:14:06.692+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What does it say when you try to log in?

If there was a pop-up, but something glitched with it and you weren't able to see the chat logs, then you can send a ticket to player support to get them sent to you.  But like Chermorg said, it may just be a security lock on the account.  Any time Riot suspects an account has been compromised, they lock it for the player's security, and it will show the same \"This account has been permanently suspended...\" when someone tries to log in.  All you need to do in that case is submit a ticket to player support and verify ownership.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VindicatorOFThey","date":"2018-01-11T23:20:56.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make screenshots ?
