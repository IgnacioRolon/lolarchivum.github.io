All I&#039;m saying is a wish I had the option to mute it. Muting all chat and teammates only does so much.\n\nEdit: Maybe have it where you can't mute ping until 5 min in? That way you can see if your team has anybody on it that is going to be obnoxious with pinging.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-26T19:08:43.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing to add, just voicing my support. Emotes specially are extremely obnoxious. I know technically you can use /ignore to block emotes, but there should be a more convenient way to do it. Making it so that the whole enemy team is ignored by default would be awesome too.\n\nWell I guess I had something to add after all...","replies":[]}]}
