Odds are not everyone is playing on a champ they&#039;ve played before. Add the fact that cooldowns are so low that you have no idea what to do sometimes and it&#039;s no wonder not everyone who plays is going to play like Faker. ITS 4 FUN. Seriously chill out and take AP {{champion:23}} for a spin! (get it cause he has a spin move teehee).  \r\n\r\nYes. You will get stomped sometimes. But why make it a bad experience? Making losing a good experience by doing the most derpy shit anyone has ever seen. Play with friends. Play by yourself. HELL play WITH yourself.

So you can have a really fun, good game, back n forth for 30 minutes, good plays, you got fed and got to slaughter, but then they won a key teamfight and you lost... suddenly there was no fun in that whatsoever? In any aspect? That's a piss poor attitude man and I feel sorry for you that you only have fun in this game 50% of the time. You should spend your time doing something you enjoy maybe. At least something you enjoy more than 50% of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"McFatal","date":"2017-03-07T12:02:19.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Telephone Booth,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=GjqnRXl3,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-03-06T22:40:23.029+0000)\n>\n> Losing is never fun in any aspect?

There was far less complaining about it being stale than how it is now. I never once took URF seriously till they changed it. I always had fun in victory or defeat, then they added this random BS. It's not fun when the enemy team gets the picks that caused the mode to be changed in the first place and you're stuck with someone that does absolutely nothing. \n\nHave you gotten rammus and had to play against brand/lux/vegiar etc.? It's not fun especially since you have to wait till 20 to FF and the enemy team typically just acts like douches and won't end the game and instead try to spawn kill you.
