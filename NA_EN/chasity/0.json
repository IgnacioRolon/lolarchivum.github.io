If I understand correctly it went off sale yesterday? If that's the case is there anyway that I can use my RP to gift it to them even though I'm a day late? I have 500 RP at the moment, maybe make limited items be giftable/buyable at double the price they are when there is an event of some sort? I'm sure I'm not the only person who would like this, like how everything goes on sale and all make the events be the normal price/lower at parts but things purchaseable all the time at double the price? If a red could take a lot at this and let me know if it would be possible, I'd really appreciate it even if it's not possible. \r\n\r\nAlso, sorry if this is in the wrong section, I'm not very good at forums.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-10T19:22:25.004+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Chasity! \n\nUnfortunately, since these icons are no longer available, we aren't able to allow you to gift the content/purchase the content.","replies":[{"poster":"Chasity","date":"2016-02-10T23:56:23.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, thank you for your time anyways, it is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-11T00:35:56.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gordofrog","date":"2016-02-10T23:47:43.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any chance of the icons being cycled back through the shop in the future, or were they a one off thing?
