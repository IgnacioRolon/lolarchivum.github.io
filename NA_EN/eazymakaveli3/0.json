What i noticed, is that i had a 25 game chat restriction. the last indicator that this works is that i have never, ever been punished for other reasons than chat. Also when u check out the forums, the only reason people are getting suspended is related to chat.\r\n\r\nso thats it. dont chat and u can troll as much as you want.","replies":[{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-04-21T23:48:45.470+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro you got it slightly wrong.

Riot explicitly says they do not ban people for being unskilled so if you want to circumvent the system all you have to do is play poorly on purpose! \n1. TILT YOUR TEAM- in pregame lobby tell your team that they will lose and you will troll and their report means nothing, tell them they don't deserve a win\n2. Always facecheck bushes \n3. Start fights outnumbered\n4. Steal kills\n5. Miss all skillshots\n6. Focus the support \n7. DONT Ward\n8. Go into other lanes pretend to go in then do nothing and let your teammate waste abilities/die\n9. Go into other lanes and steal farm/ exp\n10. Use a nonsense build and runes\n11. Abandon carries in team fights\n12. Do not listen to pings \n13. Snowball enemy carries, give their carries around 2 or 3 kills to start to put your own carries at a disadvantage\n14. No surrender, you only have a limited time with your teammates make sure you prolong the game as long as possible especially if your team is feeding, this will help tilt them for the next game\nTIPS TO NOT GET BANNED \n1. Do not talk- most bans are chat related, focus on making the teammate mad in ways that don't require talking\n2. Do not feed to excess, your goal is to have your teammates have worse scores and more deaths than you so that if your game is reviewed by a riot employee you don't look like you inted\n3. Once you succeed in making your teammates mad make sure to report them if they were toxic as a result remember the golden rule- riot cannot ban you for unskilled play (they won't know if you do it on purpose;) ) but if your team reacts negatively to your actions, it behooves you to report so that they can be punished instead!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SeeingEyeHamster","date":"2017-04-21T16:53:31.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"That really shows how messed up this automated system is.
