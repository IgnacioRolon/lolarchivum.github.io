The issue with him, though, is that he just isn&#039;t that good.  Since release he&#039;s had the lowest winrate of all champions.  In my opinion it&#039;s just really difficult to actually contribute much to games, which is reflected by never receiving assists in team fights.  \n\nDon&#039;t get me wrong though, I love Bard to death and absolutely love playing him so hear me out to the end.  His concept is really fun and he has the potential to be a very massive help to his team...if some numbers on his kit are improved. \n\nHere are a few things that I think would fix this champion and make him actually viable for play in, well, the game.\n\n* Range: Bard just needs more of it. On everything. His passive is a really cool harassment tool which could really push someone out of lane and even give him a kiting option. The only issue is that it only activates on his auto attacks, and a harassment option is near useless if you have to get within range of the even the shortest ranged AD carries in the game; you will be punished more than you can dish out from trying to harass. On his Q, it&#039;s just absolutely necessary: there is no way that a champion like Karma, which fills a very similar role to him in lane, should have higher damage, more reliable CC, and a drastically longer range on her damaging skillshot than Bard. It just makes the poor horn wielding fool obsolete despite his freshness to the league.\n\n* Magical Journey: This skill is honestly cool to begin with, but it has a very fatal error to use when not just collecting chimes. That error is that you are offering utility to your enemies. Last time I read, that&#039;s called griefing. There are a couple of potential solutions to this, but I think I saw where you wanted to go with the skill and I want to keep its original intention in mind. Make it so that enemies still CAN go through the portal, but give them a more prominent reason than \"they move slower\" to not want to use the portal. This can be done by making it so that enemies are slowed by a decent amount upon exiting the portal, or even a mini-stun as if to say they were tossed out on their heads and need to stand up.\n\n* Make him slightly tankier: Right now Bard doesn&#039;t necessarily have a designated role in the meta. This can be an issue for him due to the fact that everybody else does. Besides, what are you supposed to build on this guy? Right now his kit edges toward mage but even then it only slightly edges towards it. He needs a little bit more of a definition, and I believe this can be done by making him tankier. This way he&#039;ll be closer to Taric than Sona, and honestly that just sounds more appealing.\n\n* His ult: Oh my god where do I begin with his ult. It&#039;s absolutely beautiful! It&#039;s such a cool idea to be able to stasis absolutely anything in the game that you please just gives me the giggles. It&#039;s essentially a massive pause button on whatever you feel like, but that&#039;s honestly just where the problem lies: it&#039;s practically useless. It needs more to it, but also less. It needs less start up time, less travel time, and less radius on the AOE (wait, what?) In the current form of Bard&#039;s ult, casting it from max range (which you&#039;ll be doing because you were off getting chimes) means you have to predict a total of about 2.5 seconds into the future to hit a stasis that will probably do more damage than good or nothing at all because you hit allies. That&#039;s some Pantheon level of insight, there. Less AOE, faster particle speed, and faster start up animation will make it possible to be more precise in what you want to pause and still make it possible to be accurate in doing so without having Jedi reactions. And remember that analogy I made about Pantheon? Give it a Pantheon element. A cool addition would be if he recasts the spell after it lands, but before the stasis wears off, he teleports to the location. Shen can help up close and person, why shouldn&#039;t Bard? Besides, he&#039;s known as the wandering caretaker, not an artillery hourglass.\n\nBard honestly is a really cool champ and I have so much fun playing him, it&#039;s just impossible to make any meaningful contribution to team fights (reflected through a lack of assists.) He just needs more to really suture his kit into something cohesive and fluid.\n\nPlease leave comments and tell me what you think.","replies":[{"poster":"Shiela Hammond","date":"2015-05-15T21:42:03.191+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bard is fine.\nIMO his biggest problem is people _think_ he is bad, so as soon as stuff starts to go wrong it's all Bard's fault, arguments are incited, and team morale gets destroyed. \nYes he isn't the easiest of supports, and a bad Bard is obvious and will be an absolute potato. But that's true of several champs in league, the most similar I'd argue being Thresh. Unless you are really good with Thresh he just falls flat and would have been surpassed in usefulness by a lot of other supports. Bard is almost the exact same, however if Thresh screws up it doesn't tend to be obvious, he just has no impact at all. Bard can single-handedly lose a skirmish through poor use of his ult and that is going to hinder your team for obvious reasons. \nIt's just a matter of attitudes. If you're a good Bard you **will** do great, and have a good time doing so since he is a super fun champion.","replies":[{"poster":"supernoob96","date":"2015-05-15T22:10:10.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But a champ that is \"fine\" is different from a champ that is phenomenal.

Low cooldown, good stun duration and it's somewhat AOE. \nCompared to other supports it is way stronger a lot of the time.

Currently it's in a position where if you see the ult marker and act pretty much immediately, you can just walk out of it, but otherwise you need hard mobility or you're just going to get stasised without an awful lot of meaningful counterplay. The best analogy I can think of to talk about Bard ult as an engage tool is Nami's ult. Yes it has the potential to catch someone and initiate a fight when used as a long range engage, however if the enemy is aware of the situation, they will likely just outmanoeuvre it with ease. That's not Tidal Wave being bad, it's a fantastic ult, however it has strengths, it has weaknesses. Part of Bard's steep learning curve is figuring them out despite it not really being obvious.\nHe's a ranged champion, his base stats aren't meant to have him be a tank. He's somewhat squishy, but he's fine in that regard in my opinion. Treat him like a Thresh, since their situations are very similar. Neither of them are innately tanky, at best Thresh is a little bit above average against physical damage, however their kits both require them to be durable enough to manoeuvre and survive in the fray, and as a result, a lot of HP and resistances are par for the course. \nNot sure on the Magical Journey ideas, however perhaps. The thing is, it's often a bad idea to chase a Bard through one. Not only is there the potential of it being a trap, however he is very slippery. He will have a headstart of a couple of seconds, when you factor in how he moves faster through it and how he is perfectly lined up for a stun upon enemy exit.\n\n\nBut then again, like I said I feel he is fine and a perfectly viable support, so my opinion is somewhat biased.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FuIlmute All","date":"2015-05-16T00:55:51.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bard has gotten like what 6 buffs now?

He is a great champion with one major flaw; he helps the enemy team too much compared to what he does for his team.
