Nerfing her Q dmg, increasing her E dmg and turning her E  into a &quot;poppable&quot; skill like lux&#039;s E would make her a less akward Champion. Moreover, it would increase her control mage potential. Her  actual Unraveled Earth doesn&#039;t really seems like a threat, and it&#039;s really commun to see someone just walking through it.","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2016-09-20T08:40:25.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhh yeah no, just learn how to play the champion.\nright now's probably not a great time to pick her up though given the recent death by nerf bat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-20T07:24:15.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then you would either have to get rid of the high dash through damage one would receive or change her W to make it actually useful.","replies":[]}]}
