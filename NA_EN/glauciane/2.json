In theory randuins and thornmail still do. In practice all the armor pen items, {{item:3153}}, {{item:3151}}, and {{item:3124}} (if you include proccing innate % health abilities waaaay faster than the champ design intended). \n\n> Carries will ALWAYS outscale tanks in a 1v1.

That’s how it should be. Late game. The only counter item carries have to build _shouldn’t_ be an armor pen item, if, for some reason, the entire enemy team is dumb enough to build armor. \n\nIt’s also worth noting that Veigar’s ult was changed to missing health, mainly because it allowed him to scale better against AD champions. Being great against AP and lackluster/garbage against AD was _not_ the intended game design. By changing it to missing health based scaling, his ult is _technically still_ a product of the attacker’s stats while scaling even better with Veigar’s free ap. \n\nSo how about that, that sounds like a great idea! How about thornmail actually scales better with the builder’s stats? How about a tentative 5-10% hp (tentative, but needs to be significant to matter) reflected as damage on being auto attacked? Make it scale up if the offending attack is high damage or down if it’s low damage (so attack speed champions don’t delete themselves on thornmail users). How about that? Now cho’gath deletes you with _his_ stats, and _not_ yours. He now has a way to counter _your_ statcheck per second dps. \n\nThe idea behind old thornmail was that the best way to survive a long time was to force the ADC not to target you. Too bad entitled ADCs with 0 defensive stats or lifesteal built continued to delete themselves on thornmail builders.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Kombinator","date":"2019-07-26T10:58:53.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3075}} used to do % damage reflect BEFORE armor reduction. Making it perfect counter to any basic attack user who focused it. Now it deals damage/hit based on armor. And not even great one.\n\nHeavy hitters ignore it, because their lifesteal/attack is greater, and they hit slowly.\n\nMany hitters might feel it, but unless you got at least twice armor of their AD they can still lifesteal it back.\n\nAnother problem is the fact, that armor in general has very little use. It doesn't matter if you got 300, or 3000. Above a certain number it gives nearly nothing. If goal is to survive, then much better to buy items with armor+health, and stuff that reduce enemy damage in some way.\n\n{{item:3110}} {{item:3143}}","replies":[]}]}
