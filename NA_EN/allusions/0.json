Cast ult on either of his legendary skins and listen to the base SFX instead of the more Gentlemanly/Battlecasty ones.\r\n\r\nAs a side effect of his recent changes, there is also the following bonus quirk that no longer makes sense: **Battlecast Cho still plays his custom lines for reaching maximum size at 6 stacks, despite his new max size being achieved at 10 stacks.**","replies":[{"poster":"MANWOLFAXEBOSS","date":"2017-03-03T23:47:41.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Took a look at this today and everything is working on my end.

My bad on that because the issues have changed slightly. The good news is the Gentleman skin doesn't have this problem anymore, so all good there.\n\nHowever, the issue _is_ still on the Battlecast skin, and I went ahead and made a video of me mass Feasting on minions in the practice tool with that skin to demonstrate the issues the skin currently has: \n\n1. The original bug, base Cho's gobbling SFX playing over/after (hard to explain, watch the video) the custom Battlecast VO/SFX. [Easier to distinguish between the two with headphones.]\n\n2. The inconsistency that occurs because of the recent stacking mechanic changes and Battlecast's custom VO lines that occur on reaching max stacks still triggering after an executing Feast when you have 5 stacks going towards 6 (i.e. reaching 6 stacks). [**NOTE:** I stay capped at 5 in the video because of the new minion/non-epic cap.] I know the phrasing is weird, but I'm saying it this way because the practice tool revealed that the flag for the VO seems to be \"after an execute Feast when you have 5 stacks\", _not_ \"having 6 stacks\".\n\n3. Because of the second issue, I'm _speculating_ (but can't confirm) that something similar occurs with the custom Battlecast VO lines for reaching 3 stacks (the old \"half way there\" count), but since stacks can't be lost anymore it's a lot more tedious to test for. In my 7 test runs I didn't hear the \"half way there\" VO line at all, but like the \"max stacks\" VO line it isn't something that occurs every time the stack condition is met (i.e. some games you don't hear them). I'm just including this as a reminder to check those VO line flags out as well.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/jCk6KEVf03I\n\nSorry for the video quality, frame rate issues, lack of editing to remove extraneous capture, etc. freeware OP. It should be more than sufficient to show what I'm talking about, though. Let me know if you need any more information.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TTK Dreadnought","date":"2017-02-28T04:31:48.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speaking of which.\n\nIm so friggin happy with the R changes.
