Miss Fortune{{champion:21}}  or Katarina{{champion:55}} ? I only have enough money for one. \r\n\r\nMF looks like she can harass the enemy and out-trade the enemy laner, and her ult just shreds you if you are not building tank. If you aren&#039;t building tank and you stay in there for more than 5 seconds, RIP. And even if you are tank, and you stay in there for too long, RIP.\r\n\r\nAnd the reason I want to get Katarina is because it&#039;s the assassin meta. If any assassin in the game gets fed, there is no question who&#039;s gonna win. I had to go against a Kat player before. &quot;An Ally has been Slain, aarrghh! ENEMY DOUBLE KILL, UAAHHH! ENEMY TRIPLE KILL, AHHHHH! YOU HAVE BEEN SLAIN, NOOOOOOO!&quot; _Kat only has like 40 health and Caitlyn has her ult, what does she do? Use it. And guess what happens, she dodges it. _ I wonder what Caitlyn must be thinking right now. \r\n\r\nAnd there are my reasons.

I think you should get Kat though. You will need time to practice her but it is worth it.

(or am I?) If you're an ADC player, pick Katarina. If you're a mid lane player, pick MF. No, you did not read that incorrectly, and I'm not kidding. They're great \"alt mains\" for switching things up when you want a change of scenery. Whenever I'm taking a break from the bot lane, I main Katarina mid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-01-10T03:25:35.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends, Kata is pretty tough to pull off while MF is a lot simpler.

I recommend her if you are willing to sink in more hours to learn her.\n\nMF is good bot lane. She is probably more reliable than kat, and a lower skill floor. I can easily pick her up and do well with her without learning all of the 'tricks' that MF mains have. her only bane are high mobility cc champions and this butt {{champion:157}}","replies":[]}]}
