During that game, two players started trolling the game so we&#039;d surrender so I responded with, &quot;yeah just troll so you feel better about your score, good job man&quot;. 3rd strike was a game where I WAS TELLING THE PERSON TO STOP BEING TOXIC! The proof of my toxicty was me saying &quot;STOP BEING AN ANGRY BEAR&quot; &quot;YOU ANGRY BEAR YOU&quot; &quot;STOP SMASHING WITH YOUR BEAR CLAWS&quot;, and &quot;dude you&#039;re bronze because you&#039;re toxic&quot; &quot;you&#039;re score isn&#039;t great either so idk why you&#039;re being so toxic&quot;.
