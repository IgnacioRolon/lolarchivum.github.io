Whenever I played top I'd feed like crazy and lose the game. However when I go Shen mid I seem to do a lot better and have won the games where I play him mid. Is this simply because I main mid lane so I'm simply better at playing a champ mid? Would Shen mid not be viable after getting out of low elo? I doubt he would work against spammers such as Ryze or Brand but what about champs like Oriana or ekko?

Also Shen wants to split push and use his ultimate to appear in team fights. You cannot split push from mid.

But against ranged champs he has obvious weaknesses that ranged mages played by high elo players can abuse. I don't want to say it works because I have heard of some ridiculous things being mained in high elo but there is a reason he is normally played top.","replies":[]}]}
