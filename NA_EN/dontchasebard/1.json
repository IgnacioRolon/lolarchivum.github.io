I use him a ton in the jungle so I recognize that he is a very powerful jungler that was in need of some trimming (ha he&#039;s fat). Hitting the E cooldown is honestly a good/needed nerf considering most people build at least 30% CD on him with Spirit Visage and Iceborn Gauntlet and he gets a 3 second reduction if he collides with a unit. I do not agree, however, with the nerf to his ultimate. How is fine that Annie can flash Tibbers, Insta-stunning everything within the AoE range while dealing HUGE DAMAGE without a minimum cast time? Why is it that Gragas is given a minimum cast time of .55 seconds (over half the duration of his stun) on his ultimate when people are already able to flash/dash out unless that Gragas is using quickcast? Honestly you hit him where he needed (E cooldown) and his W could probably also get hit on the CD given it&#039;s up every 2.8 seconds at rank 5 with 30% CD (if you&#039;re using the empowered auto right after casting). Hitting his W would lower the time he has the damage reduction up and obviously reduce damage output. The ultimate nerf is going to leave it feeling clunky and awful.","replies":[{"poster":"Ratbert","date":"2016-08-17T07:10:31.214+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because flash is actually a very valuable thing to force? \n\nIf you're going to compare gragas ult to annie ult, then why aren't you bothered that Gragas basically has a janna ult with damage and a shorter cd right now?","replies":[{"poster":"DontChaseBard","date":"2016-08-17T07:58:34.911+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"what bothers me is that Gragas with a shorter ult CD still has a winrate 3% below your beloved Janna, Soraka, and Sona and you trying to use that comparison is laughable. i'm accepting and even suggesting other ways to nerf Gragas because I admitted he is too strong yet you're picking out his ult CD (never was even mentioned). I don't want his ult to have a .55 second cast time because it'll make him feel awful to use when trying to make split second plays during teamfights. they want to add a cast time that makes the window to ult someone back after using E nearly impossible unless that person has no escape. yet Annie is allowed to instantcast nuke/stun teams at range? I wouldn't even care if they added 10 or 20 seconds to Gragas ult CD. And yes I agree flash is actually a very valuable thing to force. most of the time when gragas is ulting someone back in a teamfight it's because he used flash+E to put himself in that position to get a carry.","replies":[{"poster":"Frager","date":"2016-08-17T12:42:58.520+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"No his comparison with janna/gragas is just as awefull as yours with gragas/annie which is his point, to show you how stupid your comparison is with another stupid comparison.\nThis nerf is fine and a step in the right direction. By adding a cast time i now have a window to save myself from gragas uncounterable combo.\nYour comparison between gragas and annie flaws as their each respective combo serves two different reasons.\nAnnie want to kill (by herself) while gragas sets up kills/saves allies.\n\nFirst off, annies combo unlike gragas has a 5 min CD. You can escape annies combo with scimitar/michaels\nWhile gragas combo is next to uncounterable as you cant cleanse a knockback. Gragas range is greater than of annies and if gragas use flash you have either even greater range or the element of surprise with e + flash.\n\nNow i have a chance to flee from gragas combo with flash. Even with this nerf gragas combo will work as his E stuns anyway.\n\nAnd that comparison between gragas w/r and ult cd with 3 support champs is just wierd.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-08-17T23:21:34.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">what bothers me is that Gragas with a shorter ult CD still has a winrate 3% below your beloved Janna, Soraka, and Sona and you trying to use that comparison is laughable.\n\nWinrates aren't that important in terms of balance.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-08-17T17:09:57.855+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gragas nerfs justified.

You can catch someone out with it, split up the enemy team, or even force them on top of each other (to set up a combo).

Meteos takes that currently when he uses Gragas. btw E was never a priority max for me because it was a static CD at 12 seconds. maxing only increased damage. maxing priority was always Q then W.
