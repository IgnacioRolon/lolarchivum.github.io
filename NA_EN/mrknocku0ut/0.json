I have no idea what is causing this, or how i can prevent it. I've used the hextech repair tool numerous times and i simply can't tell what's going on. This is especially a nuisance when i am trying to play ranked. I would join the lobby, and at times when other people are selecting their champion, it does not update. This just results in the timer sitting at zero. https://gyazo.com/14f451e73ad9a6c3064ea85b2c2918ac\r\nIn the screenshot you can see the chatroom and it shows everyone leaving the room. At that point on my screen our third player was banning but for everyone else, I had to lock in my champion and this glitch or random disconnection caused me to dodge the match unintentionally. This has happened before and i've lost LP here and there for it happening.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has info or something that may be able to help i'd greatly appreciate it. Trying to avoid losses in provisionals, placements, LP, and avoiding the \"dodge\" punishments.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-16T04:39:26.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PvP.net is a pretty important service in the League Client, as you've seen by the disconnections occurring when you've disconnected from it. Typically when you're continuously disconnecting from this service, it means your connection to this server is *unstable* due to a local or routing issue with your network. To deal with this, I suggest working through the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) so we can confirm your local settings are okay.\n\nLet me know if this issue still pops up after taking those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"yeulx","date":"2016-12-16T04:44:00.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"targon no offence we know theres something going on through riots end.. its also happend ot me and alot of other people heck even happend to my streaming friend \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}]}]}
