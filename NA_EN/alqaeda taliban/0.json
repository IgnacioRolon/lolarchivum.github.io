I always reported ppl who say &quot;ez&quot; at the end of the game or those zed/yasuo mains who get cocky after they get one kill on you.  But then I went to play HoTS and realized the importance of the /all chat. The game is just  not the same whithout it and I can&#039;t rly explain why.\r\n   In time I grew to like BMing. It still enrages me very hard when ppl do it to me, but that only gets me to play on 100%.\r\n   The problem is that ppl might not see it that way. Im never being toxic to my teammates (not on the chat atleast), I,ve never been banned and I have lvl 4 honor, but surely someone reports me from time to time. That might get me a ban someday and I&#039;ll have to rely on riot to bail me out.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-09-03T15:03:05.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Friendly BMing is, I believe, allowed. Tread carefully though -- there's a very fine line. GGEZ isn't really friendly BMing, for example: it's basically saying the game was super easy and the opposing team is awful.\n\nIf everyone is friendly and taking little snipes at each other, though, you're fine, so long as the language used isn't insulting or offensive -- the occasionally \"nice ult, Draven. :P\" at an ult that clearly wiffed by a mile, for example.","replies":[{"poster":"AlQaeda Taliban","date":"2017-09-03T22:17:02.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes exactly. Shitting on the enemy team  after every kill you get on them and \"gg ez\" is not cool, but friendly BMing is soo fun. Like this one time I killed a Garen 1v1 with fiora on urf just because I had taken heal by mistake, and telling him \"gl next time kiddo\". And he was actually kicking our asses all game. It was just too good :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rand0mH3r0X","date":"2017-09-03T15:19:25.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Nice post, The Djinn :P\"","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-09-03T15:30:09.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rand0mH3r0X,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=snBr8zKy,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-09-03T15:19:25.214+0000)\n>\n> &quot;Nice post, The Djinn :P&quot;\n\n^^Exactly.
