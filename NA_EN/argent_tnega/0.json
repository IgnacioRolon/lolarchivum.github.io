Will there be enough missions for me to get the required 320 points before the 26th of October?  I work for the government and I am being sent out somewhere.  I can provide documentation because I am sure you all hear all kinds of excuses/reasons.  I also do not want to go into specifics on the boards where just anyone can read it.  I would love a PM or email or something from Riot so we might be able to talk more about this.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nVery Respectfully,\r\n\r\nArgent Tnega","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-06T03:23:36.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It mostly depends on if you've been able to complete every mission so far, and especially whether or not you bought the Master Pass.
