Not really needs to be explained for why lol.\n{{champion:112}}  Can go mid or top. Heard you max Q for top first for the shield and movement, but idk. Haven't tried it yet.

Either that or the band wagon people that are now going to try and pick him up...)\n{{champion:161}} Can be mid, but I much rather support. High harass/peel, just watch your mana. Max Q for damage as support then I usually do E for cooldown on his knock up rather than W for clear/poke. Just find him to be much safer being a support for ADC than being solo in mid and at risk of higher mobility champs, such as {{champion:103}} or {{champion:238}} to just name probly the two more common I've seen, or jungle ganks.\n{{champion:26}} Can be mid or support. I actually found his latest changes to be amazing and help him even more. Bombs being a skill shot that can latch onto enemies or allies? Makes him all the more deadlier and safe. Haven't really found any major downsides to him aside from W not working on R, but bombs being how they are more than make up for it with zoning for time. Plus the double bomb stun is beautiful.\n{{champion:101}} Mid or support. Haven't tried him as support since the mana changes, but he works surprisingly decent. Just play similar to Vel and play safe behind minions/well-warded while poking. I usually go 1 point in Q at the start, but max W(can poke behind wave without risking CS loss on ADC and the slow) then E.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2015-03-11T18:21:53.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Viktor is both a really good mid laner and a pretty good top laner as well.
