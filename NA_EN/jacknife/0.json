It's been happening to me on and off for years, and I'm fed up to the point where I'm trying to nip it in the bud permanently. Whenever I start a game, no matter what kind of game, be it ranked or just a training game, I seem to get huge latency spikes whenever I get near a tower or enemy champion, be they player or bot. I've looked through the boards here and downloaded a tracer recommended by a Rioter. I have the results of them here. I've kind of gathered from what I read that my ISP or the route my ISP takes is the main issue, but I would have no idea how to solve the issue, as asking for help from them is like pulling teeth (I have comcast for an ISP). Whenever a Rioter can respond and help troubleshoot a solution would be great.\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                                10.0.0.1 -    0 |  286 |  286 |    0 |    6 |  147 |    1 |\n|                           96.120.49.125 -    1 |  283 |  282 |    7 |   19 |  213 |   10 |\n|  po-103-rur01.anoka.mn.minn.comcast.net -    8 |  219 |  202 |    8 |   18 |  128 |   12 |\n|be-13-ar01.crosstown.mn.minn.comcast.net -   10 |  207 |  187 |   10 |   22 |  366 |   17 |\n|be-13367-cr02.denver.co.ibone.comcast.net -   16 |  177 |  149 |   26 |   40 |  403 |   29 |\n|be-11795-pe02.910fifteenth.co.ibone.comcast.net -    9 |  215 |  197 |   26 |   36 |  315 |   28 |\n|                          75.149.228.210 -   15 |  183 |  157 |   25 |   37 |  161 |   27 |\n|                          104.160.138.35 -   11 |  204 |  183 |   25 |   36 |  402 |   28 |\n|          ae34-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -   20 |  163 |  132 |   31 |   43 |  401 |   31 |\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |  286 |  286 |   31 |   42 |  258 |   32 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting &amp; Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-28T20:47:52.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm yea it looks like you might be experiencing a bit of packet loss when your connection is traveling to our servers. Essentially, that means that bits of your connection is getting corrupted or lost before it can reach our servers. I'd suggest reaching out to your ISP with that trace route data to see if there are any current issues going on, but you can also hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see if there's anything we could adjust in your network to help.","replies":[{"poster":"Jacknife","date":"2017-07-29T06:55:12.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was hoping to avoid calling them at all costs, but if I have to, so be it.
