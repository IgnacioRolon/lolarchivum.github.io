TRIPLE the cooldown of her dash from 6 to 18 seconds @ rank 5 (3.6 sec to 11 sec with 40% CDR)\n>2. Attacking a champion/minion/monster after dash reduces the dash cooldown back to live numbers (like Gnar boomerang)\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n>IT'S CALLED &quot;VALOR,&quot; NOT &quot;COWARDICE&quot;\n\nRiven&#039;s shield provides her with good trade and outplay power.  Though many people consider an AD-scaling shield OP and BS, I feel that it fits her kit.\n\nI am mediocre at Riven and hate facing her, but I do not think that her ability to fight is too strong.\n\n**My main complaint with Riven is her ability to escape a coordinated gank with spammable dashes, many times when she doesnt even have boots and enemies have boots 2**\n\n>How to nerf her cheesy escapes without touching her ability to fight champs or jungle mobs\n\n1. TRIPLE the cooldown of her dash (from 6 to 18 seconds @ rank 5)\n2. Using Valor puts a single charge of &quot;VALOR&quot; buff on Riven that does not stack.\n3. If Riven hits a champion, minion, or monster with auto attack, immediately consume VALOR buff to refund 66% of the CDR-modified cooldown of the dash, restoring it to current baseline CD (possibly instantly refreshing it)\n\n>Illustration\n\n**Riven NOW:**\n\nCase 1:  Riven uses Valor to fight her enemy.  She goes all-in and gets to use it every 3.6 seconds (40% CDR) in a fight to shield damage and dodge spells, etc\n\nCase 2:  Riven uses Valor to escape a gank.  She gets to dash 375 units every 3.6 seconds, essentially giving her more movespeed than Swiftness boots would, and negating slows.\n\n**Riven WITH THE CHANGE**\n\nCase 1:  Riven uses Valor to fight her enemy.  She goes all-in and gets to use it every 3.6 seconds (40% CDR) because she is fighting and the scaling CD restore means she can use it as often as before as long as she is committed to fighting.\n\nCase 2:  Riven uses Valor to escape a gank.  She dashes once, but since she is running away like Brave Sir Robin, she cannot consume the VALOR buff and thus can only dash once per 11 seconds (40% CDR)\n\n>I am ready for your downvotes\n>http://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e294/kingbiff/34a_zpsapf6wsad.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Goodest Gamer","date":"2015-10-09T03:34:26.228+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":142,"body":"what downvotes lol? all your going to get is upvotes by the silver piles of garbage who dont know hwo to build armor.","replies":[{"poster":"h0tkarl","date":"2015-10-09T03:41:06.313+0000","up_votes":90,"down_votes":5,"body":"Contained above:\n\n1.

Riven is supposed to be extremely slippery; that's part of her identity. You could make the argument that she's too strong and could stand to lose some of that intended strength, but you'd have to actually come up with something substantial to convince me of that.

When there isn't much counterplay to Riven other than \"pick Renekton, Olaf, or Garen\" that's a pretty big issue. Champions with comparable strength to Riven also have tradeoffs which Riven doesn't. Renekton pushes the wave if he wants to sustain with Q, and is very vulnerable to ganks. Same thing with Olaf, his only sustain involves attacking as quickly as possible and he has no escape. Garen is still pretty overpowered right now so I wouldn't compare him to anyone. \n\ntl;dr The only champions who are stronger than Riven (early game) have a weakness in the form of ganks, which is the whole point of this thread.

You can beat or lose to Riven with every top laner you could choose to play. The difference is, due to Riven's enormous following, the Riven player is almost guaranteed to be more experienced in any matchup she finds herself in, which is an enormous advantage.

You can keep saying it, but that doesn't make it true. Riven's early game is not the unstoppable monstrosity people imagine it to be and you can very easily beat her early with many champions. Yasuo beats Riven for the first 3 levels and starts beating her again once he gets shiv. Mundo actually outtrades Riven at lvl 2 with his E. Irelia wins early trades if she uses her stun at the right time and goes hard if Riven is careless with her CD's. Jax massively outtrades Riven at lvl 1 and can easily leverage that advantage into a free lane. I could give more examples but I don't feel it's necessary. \n\nRiven has high kill pressure early but she's hardly the dominant early force champions like Renekton and Olaf are.
