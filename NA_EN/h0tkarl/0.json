NONE may be allowed to survive their damage.  Any teamates exist only to protect and support their ADC masters and bask in their radiance\n\nIf you do the math, even with 200 bonus armor this is a WHOPPING 30% nerf vs crits against an AA based ADC like ashe/cait/jinx with 300 AD and IE/PD.  You wont break even until over 400 bonus armor.\n**\nOH WAIT THATS BEFORE YOU GET ARMOR SHREDDED BY UBIQUITOUS BLACK CLEAVER OR CHAMP ABILITIES.  So in reality you would need 600 bonus armor factoring in a 30% shred  JUST TO BREAK EVEN with current Thornmail**\n\nThe only ADC who do significant on-hit damage are vayne and koggy.  This change is at best a wash against them.\n\n**TL;DR:  The one item in the game that had some measurable countering effect on ADC is now nerfed into oblivion.

That ADC starts hitting you now, with basic autos hitting for 300 and crits for 750 before resistances.  Now that's fine, except you essentially have about 135 armor left because of their armor pen.  Not to mention their autos are coming twice a second.  Even worse if the enemy has a champion with an armor reduction skill.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Squidblimp","date":"2015-08-05T13:35:08.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"THIS POST IS INACCURATE. Did I get your attention? Good. Now, they have stated on the PBE that the initial 15% damage reflection from thornmail is pre-mitigation damage, so damage that WOULD have been dealt before resistances. This is similar to what they did with will of the ancients. Additionally it scales with armor, though the scaling damage is post-mitigation.
