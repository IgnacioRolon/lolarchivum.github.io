You may have an instance already running and it won't let you start a new one. For that the fix is different:\n\n1. Open your [Task Manager](https://turbofuture.com/computers/How-to-Open-Task-Manager-on-a-PC)\n2. Go to your processes and order them by name\n3. Find every \"League of Legends\" instance and terminate them. Simply right click then \"Terminate\" or Left Click then DELETE key.","replies":[]}]}
