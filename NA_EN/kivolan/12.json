Lifesteal from {{item:3153}} and {{item:1419}} on him is absolutely atrocious and if he's not dead instantly, he's not dying at all.\n\nPlease tell me he&#039;s being addressed soon. Putting 99% of a champion&#039;s power in one skill is not good champion design. He needs to revert to his previous niche of a hybrid ADC, or at the very least spread out the power so players are actually leveling Q before there&#039;s four points into W.","replies":[{"poster":"Madra","date":"2016-08-26T11:52:46.117+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They were so infatuated with the idea of a champion getting 5.0 attack speed, they couldn't wait to build it around a new concept.","replies":[{"poster":"Kivolan","date":"2016-08-26T11:57:12.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Madra,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OM0hy2jp,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-08-26T11:52:46.117+0000)\n>\n> They were so infatuated with the idea of a champion getting 5.0 attack speed, they couldn&#x27;t wait to build it around a new concept.\n\nhttps://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/53876365.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"astralwit","date":"2016-08-26T11:45:25.555+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree and it was completely unnecessary.

So we end up with something that is only half space aids, and half voidling rush. \n\nAs for Kog, I'm not sure why Riot decided not to support his off build. (Given all the mechanics are there.) His AP build is effective a Siege mage. Perhaps Riot simply hate siege mages.

But he did get a good mid game power spike, because Tri force was pretty much core for him.
