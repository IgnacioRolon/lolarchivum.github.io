Vel&#039;s hitbox, for whatever reason, includes his tentacles, and makes landing anything (point and click, skillshots, whatever) extremely easy. If his hitbox could be reduced slightly by around 10-15%, it would be an indirect buff and much appreciated help in staying alive as an immobile mage.","replies":[{"poster":"Scuffleboard","date":"2018-04-04T08:03:45.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Vel'Koz needs buffs- he's in a decent enough spot as is, and his weaknesses are a trade-off for his poke-y, burst-y strengths.
