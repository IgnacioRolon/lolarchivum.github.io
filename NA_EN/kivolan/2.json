I've noticed that if you stand in exactly the spot where it splits, you won't take damage. That's how I usually dodge it when I'm too close anyway. So if you split it early, then you created a window for her to dash through.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kivolan","date":"2018-02-26T02:14:53.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it wasn't lag... She dashed, so I instinctively pressed Q again to split the beam in case she dashed either up or down a bit... Only she dashed right through it.

Vel'koz Q seems to behave very oddly in ping > 60-80, i have seen it visually split twice or go way off course.\n\nFiora dash does not make her untargetable, and it has definite travel time, not like a yi dash.","replies":[]}]}
