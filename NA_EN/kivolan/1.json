They won't and I'm not even trying to be a downer it's just the truth, the only reason we are allowed 10 bans on rift is because, well, there are 10 players. So if there are 6 players on treeline, there will be 6 bans and that's that","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-02T02:56:50.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:141}} {{champion:122}} \n{{champion:122}} {{champion:141}}\n{{champion:141}} {{champion:122}} \n{{champion:141}} {{champion:122}} \n{{champion:122}} {{champion:141}}\n{{champion:141}} {{champion:122}} \n{{champion:141}} {{champion:122}} \n{{champion:122}} {{champion:141}}\n{{champion:141}} {{champion:122}}","replies":[]}]}
