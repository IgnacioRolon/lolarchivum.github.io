Searching for specific champions and clicking where I knew it should be didn't work either, and I wasn't seeing anything where the ban icons are as well (though all the sound effects and voices still happened).\n\nSo after it forced me to dodge for not selecting a champion, I restarted the client and tried to load into another game... Same issue, and another dodge.\n\nI'm a little peeved at the lost LP, but any ideas on how to fix this? Do I need to reinstall? =/\n\nedit; I've since been able to load into games just fine. No idea what fixed it or what caused it to begin with. Ugh.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-27T03:22:34.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you get into the champion select/banning screen but you can't see any of the champions to pick or the buttons aren't responding, it's good sign that your network's connection to the game server is unstable.
