He locked him in the basement. \"Wtf steve\" the duck said, \"you're not gonna do things to me with your rectangle... right?\". Luckily steve was not that kind of cube. He just kept him for eggs and named him Mr. Quakers. Of course... at that version there had been no nametags. He liked the name, and for a time he lived happily. Until one fateful day... It seemed steve had failed to fully light his basement. A green monster had appeared. It was creepy looking and Mr. Quakers was like \"ew\" and then steve was like walking down the steps into the basement and all of a sudden \"BAM\" steve barely survived the explosion. His basement was a wreck. He looked through the rubble for his beloved egg machine, but all he found... was a single feather. \n\nsteve was bad and didnt know to make the feather into arrows, so instead he just got a new chicken. However, distrustful of his owners originals intentions, Mr Quakers had purchased a {{item:3026}} earlier that month... He was watching this all happen from the top of steve's wooden plank cube. His {{item:3070}}s meant nothing to someone like steve. To him, he was just an egg machine, and he knew, he could be so much more. He journeyed out into the ocean, swimming as quickly as he could, and then he despawned. \n\n\nAND DEN MR QUAKERS IN LEAGUE OF LEGENDS WAS BORN!
