Recently we've had few people step down due to real life scheduling issues and we're looking to fill those spots with like-minded individuals who can step in to an established team and grow with us.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n**Currently Looking For**\r\n\r\n* Support (Starter)\r\n* Top (Substitute) - Will get considerable playtime.\r\n* Jungle (Substitute)\r\n\r\n*****\r\n**About Us**\r\n\r\n\r\n* We are a stable and mature ranked 5v5 team that have been together for over a year.\r\n* We are not your typical \"new team that die in 2 days after placements.\" We're very consistent.\r\n* Our team members' individual ELO/league range from Diamond 1 to Diamond 5.\r\n* Team itself is currently at Plat 1 with much higher mmr (match-making rating).\r\n* We gear towards running team compositions that make sense rather than just blindly picking champions.\r\n* We practice from 5pm EST (2pm PST) until around 9pm EST (6pm PST) on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.\r\n* The schedule is a little flexible depending on the other members joining. Feel free to ask about it here or in game.\r\n* Once we're set with roster, we'll resume Go4LoL tournaments which are held Sunday afternoons.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n**Requirements**\r\n\r\n* You must be **Diamond 4** or higher in Solo Q this season.\r\n* You must be able to use voice communications. We currently use TeamSpeak3 with Skype as backup.\r\n* You must be able to make our schedule listed above, or be close to it.\r\n* You must have a good collection of champions and are not limited by a small pool.\r\n* You must know how to discuss things maturely without letting emotions run wild. Mistakes happen.\r\n* You must be willing to learn, improve, and help others improve.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n**Apply!**\r\n\r\nIf you've made it this far and would like to try out for the team, please fill out the following little questionnaire to the best of your abilities and we'll get back to you shortly.\r\n\r\n> Summoner name?: \r\n> Your age?: \r\n> Can you make our schedule?: \r\n> Your current solo queue division?:  \r\n> What is your desired role?: \r\n> What is the weakest part of your game?: \r\n> Any tournament experience?: \r\n> Any other info (optional)?: \r\n\r\n*****\r\nWe would highly prefer you to reply here first, but you can also reach us in game (**Al Bundy** or **Sexpanther**) if you have any questions or would like to apply privately. Thanks everyone and good luck!\r\n\r\n*****\r\nEdit: We're not 100% sure how the new boards work, but we'd really appreciate the upvotes so this stays near top! Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Al Bundy","date":"2014-12-08T05:27:25.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SKT T1 Mid","date":"2014-12-02T00:53:23.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summoner name?: selfz\nYour age?: 19\nCan you make our schedule?: yes \nYour current solo queue division?: d3\nWhat is your desired role?: supp\nWhat is the weakest part of your game?: overstaying in lane\nAny tournament experience?: yes, plenty\nAny other info (optional)?:  good calls when ganking, providing good support while ganks, and i know my champions limits, as well as the enemy teams champs limits.","replies":[]},{"poster":"l Desi l","date":"2014-12-01T21:53:18.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summoner name?: TheJewishGuy\nYour age?: 20\nCan you make our schedule?: Yes\nYour current solo queue division?: D3\nWhat is your desired role?: Support \nWhat is the weakest part of your game?: Well that is a broad question, I am just going to put I am eager to learn/get better overall.\nAny tournament experience?: Some online tournys placing 1st, Was part of the Collegiate Scene for my Univ participating in CSL, \nAny other info (optional)?: Nope, add me in-game for more info.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Al Bundy","date":"2014-12-01T21:01:54.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Al Bundy","date":"2014-12-01T17:44:24.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bUMP","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slapustupid","date":"2014-12-01T15:22:59.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summoner name?: Slapustupid\nYour age?: 24\nCan you make our schedule?: Yes\nYour current solo queue division?: D3 was 97lp now at zero thanks to potatos =/\nWhat is your desired role?: Support\nWhat is the weakest part of your game?: Mastering active items \nAny tournament experience?:A couple small 1v1/2v2/random 5v5.

I have also played in the weekly NotSoStock Gaming tournaments and have had some success there also.

I've also been told by many short lived teams that I seem like a fun person to be around and that I meshed well with everyone on the team within the first game. Additionally, I have been playing the game since season 1 and know quite a bit about the game. I remember the gold ol' Force Of Nature and Heart of Gold days and when TSM could poop on everyone in NA.\n\n\nhttp://gyazo.com/679418762e5a9fba8d986092c7de8024 - September 17th Win vs Yolande Wong\nhttp://gyazo.com/586f8fe2af433dc5a81ee3a970acfd19 - August 23rd Win vs Twist and Shout Fanfic\nhttp://gyazo.com/7327a922c58772cbc2ad819f1d7b7b10 - Traitors Not Needed featuring BloodWater","replies":[]},{"poster":"deegodoubledees","date":"2014-11-30T03:42:05.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summoner name?: deegodoubledees\nYour age?: 19\nCan you make our schedule?: yes\nYour current solo queue division?: d4\nWhat is your desired role?: support\nWhat is the weakest part of your game?: too aggressive \nAny tournament experience?: some\nAny other info (optional)?: playing since beta","replies":[]}]}
