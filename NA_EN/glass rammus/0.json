Don't come into my ranked games with your trashcan ass. Play norms. Very fucking simple. I'm not getting losses prevented for you throwing my game. You're trash. And you need to be banned from playing Ranked for another 5 Summoner Levels, then another 10 Levels if you still don't get it. \r\nStay off ranked. The same map exists in norms. Just. Go. There. \r\nAnd if you want to stay being a trash player trolling ranked games then throw your League app in the Recycling Bin/Trash. Because I would be A LOT more relaxed of a player if I wasn't dealing with people literally ruining ranked games with just a lack of experience or know how- whatever it is- I don't want to hate you- just go the Hell to a game mode where performance isn't so highly valued and appreciated. \r\n\r\nShit. Forgive me for pouring too much salt, but how tf do you get it into these kids' heads that they aren't WANTED in Ranked games. My last game I had to Support an MF that made me feel like I should call 911 and send somebody to see if shes okay over there- just completely spaced out doing nothing for long periods of time, face diving a bush when wee saw the Enemy Kat walk into it.. Like I can't Support your gameplay- sticking around you just leaes me vulnerable our best chance to win is to get away from you. \r\n\r\nWent Mid helped Ez with Kat and killed her twice, MF still braindead Botlane doing nothing. Our Kha Zix ganks bc the enemy Bot Lane overextends.. MF stands there a whole 5 seconds of Kha getting mauled.. the other 3 of us spamming her with ?? !!! pings.. Kha a second away from death.. MF misses an Ult. \r\n\r\nSo don't tell me you can't call people trash. Invite me I'll throw your Ranked games see how you feel. I would be trash for doing that. And I couldn't blame you for saying it- unless I wass rtolling in which case I would pretend to be offended and report you so I can abuse the system even more than I already am by choking up 45 minutes of your day to inevitably lose.","replies":[]}
