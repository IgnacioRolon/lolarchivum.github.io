You had a terrible sample base considering it **seems like** only trolls applied. I know, firsthand, that most of the players I come across didn't apply. This kind of authority assigned on a \"first come, first serve\" basis is inherently ineffective. \nThese 'Mods\" seem to only want authority to remove content they disagree with, then justify the authority with an abusive interpretation of \"the rules\". \n**It would be good and well for them to remove posts that violate rules**- but Mods have clearly abused their position by picking and choosing when the rule applies based on whether or not they agree with the statement. \n\n**PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE RESPONSES**\n\nSomebody posting about removed comments is bound to attract the attention of the Mod that removed the comment. The Mods will comment about what this player did wrong. Now, you might not see a problem with this- but it's essentially SPAM. \nBecause the Mod has ALREADY explained this in their message to the player, there is no reason for them to stalk this player's discussions just to repeat themselves. This is clearly harassing, and begs the question if they're really just abusing their power to troll players they don't agree with. \nIn fact, it's much more likely they are trolling instead of doing their job- because doing their job requires monitoring Boards- not arguing with the person they punished.\n\n**FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES**\n\nNow there's a clear system for favoritism. Player A became a Mod, and now all their Boards friends get free passes on the \"menial\" rules. Basically, the friends of Mods can get away with making comments and posts, and the friends of Mods have more weight when they report other comments or posts.\nIt's the most caveman version of politics, I'll use Champion Icons to represent players:\n{{champion:268}} became a Mod. {{champion:268}} was friends with {{champion:75}} for a while. {{champion:75}} makes a post on Boards, and {{champion:33}} comments his disapproval. {{champion:75}} replies with something passive-aggressive, and {{champion:33}} reports the comment. {{champion:268}} receives the report, sees it's against {{champion:75}}, and as long as there's no cursing or swearing then {{champion:268}} gives {{champion:75}} a pass. {{champion:33}} responds to the comment by re-explaining his stance, but using the language {{champion:75}} used to try communicating better. {{champion:75}} doesn't like the taste of his own medicine, and reports the comment. {{champion:268}} receives the report, sees it's {{champion:75}} submitting the report, then furiously digs through all the Boards Rules finding anything that can vaguely apply, removes {{champion:33}}'s comment and sends {{champion:33}} the rule he found.\n\nLaugh if you want, or get mad about being called out- but this is the reality of Boards with Mods involved. \nRiot please, we DON'T NEED OR WANT THEM. Return the players' accounts to their original state.\n\n**EDIT P.S.:**\nIf you agree with me, and think of Mods as useless- DOWNVOTE everything Mods post. Everyone agreeing with Mod behavior- DOWNVOTE THEM. Regardless of what the Mod is saying, or the situation- we need to adamantly remind them that they are an IMPOSITION and plague Boards with their presence.
