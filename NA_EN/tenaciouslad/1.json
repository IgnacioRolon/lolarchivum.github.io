It fits his brutal and barbaric nature, as opposed to \"keeping\" a dragon in the sense of being a pet master.  In other words, he KILLS dragons; he doesn't raise them.","replies":[{"poster":"TenaciousLad","date":"2019-10-16T00:52:27.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah true, lol. My mindset was of him keeping dragon \"trophies\" such as their scales being used for his armor, and his axes being made out of their teeth, and his helmet being made up of horns like how Rengar keeps his prey's teeth as a necklace. , while still having the metal armor. I think the glowing green eyes adds some of his nature thus being the essence of killing a green dragon, and you know how Thor in Ragnorok finds his true potential, having glowing blue eyes from the lightning.\n\nIs there a possibility this could be put in?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2019-10-16T03:51:28.063+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TenaciousLad,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=fiWxEGu1,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-10-16T00:52:27.993+0000)\n>\n> Yeah true, lol.

Now, it's not as similar  but it's pretty close! Super happy Olaf has a dragonslayer skin! Hopefully I was a contribution and made this skin come to be!
