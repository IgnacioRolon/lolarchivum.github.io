I created my account in EUW when I first started playing here. I played a lot of ranked over on their servers. when i was bronze 2 there I took leave back to the states and transferred my account over. I placed here as bronze 3 and then went back to Germany. the issue that im running into is that Im playing silver elo games now with a bronze 3 rank and still remaining stalled instead of climbing. every game I play in is everyone mid to high silver and im a little bronze 3. it wouldnt bother me but with the mmr transferring and my doing na placements a long time ago before i started getting better im going against people my skill level but i dont have the rank behind it. has anyone else ever run into this issue or did i just mess up a while ago and theres no real way to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-09T00:58:15.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Winning streaks or awesome performance in games can raise your MMR and may start matching you with similarly skilled players. Keep in mind that your ranked standing/placements will change for this next season and that MMR and ranked standing is region-specific. You may want to check out our [Ranked Play FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ) for some additional details on how the system works.\n\nI'm confident that if you keep honing your skills and keep at the grind, you'll be more content with your ranked standing and overall performance.
