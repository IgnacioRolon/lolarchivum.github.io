In this game I actually won and the {{champion:23}}  did pretty horrible but thats the problem, he did horrible and yet he still had as much pressure on the map as one of the strongest threats on the enemy team.  Yea you look at the match history and we are down as much as 4.6k gold @ 31 minutes, but thats not off kills, thats off relentless split push and at one point one of our members afked for around 15 minutes+ ({{champion:33}} ).  Nonetheless the other members were able to cause chaos and set an environment where this guy was able to get to towers semi-unattended, and without much of  our CC there in {{champion:33}}, dealing with him and preventing a Kamikaze to a turret is near impossible due to his ultimate. We were down a man and needed answers to stop the bleeding, that answer came when {{champion:33}}  reconnected, but even after {{champion:23}}  still crashed into tower after tower then inhib after inhib.\n\nThe problem is that unlike any other split push type champion ({{champion:77}} , {{champion:238}}  , {{champion:157}} {{champion:114}} ,{{champion:24}}  etc.) ; this champ for solely no other reason than his absurd ultimate is allowed to be a relentless threat throughout the entire game. All of these other splitpush champs can be monsters late game, are insane duelists and have very potent ultimate's. But what makes {{champion:23}}  an outlier is that his ultimate allows him to cheat death while being able deal absurd amounts of damage. The result is the demise of a very low enemy team, due to {{champion:23}}  being able to clean up really easy without the presence of abundant and dedicated hard CC; or in this case as it's relevant to this post and this game, being able to take towers regardless of his score because he can just build full damage due to his absurd ultimate.\n\nSeriously think about it logically, you encounter a {{champion:114}}  who is [0/7/1] 20 minutes into the game with only 100 cs. Do you think it possible and fair for her to just be able to take two top towers? Of course if objectives are left unattended  or no moves on the map continue for long enough such champs can ramp up and run rampant. However would it still be fair for said champ to have an ultimate that can just ignore your attempts at stopping them (literately just dying to take the tower at that point), with no defensive items and only an ultimate to keep them alive long enough to be a martyr for an objective? Would it be fair for said champ to end the game [0/23/4] and in the course of that time take 3 separate inhibitors twice each using the same method?\n\nSure some better champ picks and perhaps more concentrated grouping may have alleviated the issue but a {{champion:77}}  was on that team as well and we all know what that champ loves to do all day. You guess it, split push. At a certain point you cant just ignore them, especially if your push just isnt as strong even as 5 much less 4 for a fair part of the game (which is absurd considering the score of the Trynd). The only reason we won this game was because we could group even as 3 or 4 and win against them in their unit of 3 or 4. But with two champs hell bent on split pushing, even baron and 5th drag were hard to utilize due to the fact {{champion:23}}  could just kamikaze any inhib tower at any time. Yes I stayed at base duty, to try and mitigate this but look how long the game took to close out. The point is a champs mechanics shouldn't be so potent that it allows players to forcibly take very important objectives at will, with no skill but mere force of will.\n\nI seriously feel like no matter what you do, or how behind this champ is  you're not allowed to leave this champ in a lane on his own, only due to his ultimate and usual build path. That players who play this champ are allowed and know they can abuse the nature of this champ and force constant pressure no matter how they play individually. Thats ridiculous I know there are fans and even mains of this champ/play style. Not everyone will agree I may be even horribly downvoted  with my Elo somehow coming into question. None of that really matters though because of all champs that currently exist in this game, this champs uncanny ability to do what he does is unrivaled. It's a broken mechanic and it's tiresome it's overlooked. This isn't a tank we're talking about ({{champion:12}} )  this is a full on bruiser that can delete squishies and melt tanks, why does he even need this ultimate? He has a gap closer that can jump through terrain, a slow and a self heal along with a passive that makes his crits so dangerous. He's already loaded for splitpush and is probably the best at it, even for escaping. Why should he be allowed to effectively Zhonyas while moving and do tons of damage? It's Scion passive on crack and its needs to be changed.\n\nI know absolute balance cannot be truly attained in the game, however I do feel that the game should try it's best to be balanced. When I say balance please do realize I mean not just how powerful champs are but the risks/rewards and player performance and how that has an impact overall.  Anything can change a game, throws happen, but this shouldnt be allowed to happen, it's honestly an outlier with a direct cause. A single ability should not grant a player pseudo-immunity once they hit 6 to take any objective they please. Thank you for reading if you did read this far.\n\nTL: DR- Trynd has a really unfair Ultimate that allows him to do whatever he pleases in many situations, even if he is doing abysmal. It should be changed so that it doesnt allow players to just press R and feel free to take anything they want despite their performance, whether that be a single players life or an objective.","replies":[{"poster":"Jacknife","date":"2015-06-14T06:51:48.840+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":6,"body":"You're not getting a lot of support, but I can actually attest to this.

Keep beating him down until he's too afraid to even walk out of base ( I play a lot of{{champion:122}} so I make this sound easier said than done, his early game is as bs as Nasus' late game).

The only real solution is to stun him and hit the rest of his team, but his ult lasts way longer than any single stun so you have to chain-CC him or let him deal damage while being unkillable for a bit.

The answer to that is clearly: No. Now for everyone who says \"it is easy to deal with Tryndamere just pick champ X\" you need to understand the game a bit more. Like any team game you are suppose to communicate with teammates and pick champions that contribute as a whole to the team whether they are there for initiation, tanking, or assassinating the enemy team Squishies. Never should there be a need to pick a certain champion to counter another, in fact that's what we have 6 slots for itemization, with the plethora of items we have access to in-game (unfortunately I feel it's getting smaller based on item useage each season).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Enraged Piglet","date":"2015-06-15T07:04:40.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that would all be true if Tryndamere participated in 5v5 teamfights but he doesn't he just split pushes. and saying he does the same damage as an adc isn't exactly true because he gets a lot of free crit from his passive so he doesn't have to build as much crit to get 100% then he can focus everythign else on other stats to do more damage. Also unlike an adc who if caught out by say a zin chao will instantly die a tryndamere can ult and live and then do a lot of damage. Of course that doesn't really work in a 5v5 teamfight but tryndamere shouldn't be 5v5 teamfighting much. Though tryndamere isn't strong right now so it doesn't matter either way. But when splitpushers do become strong they become absolutely op because there's litterally almost no counter play whether it's jax/tryndamere/nasus if there strong there's not much you can do because even if you shut them down the instant you try and take your advantage and teamfight they will afk farm 20 minions and a turret and then become stronger then you. Then your screwed since he will always be pushed to your turret and you can't 1v1 him and you can't leave to teamfight. and sometimes even if you would win in a straight up 1v1 there kits are so slippery he can just push and then when you try to fight they leave then lifesteal and come back.\n\nand that's why anytime a splitpusher becomes strong it becomes immediately noticeable and almost forces them to be nerfed. But tryndamere isn't strong right now so whatever you say about him being unfair doesn't really sway me to the opinion that he needs changed.

Seriously, that's really the only thing he's got going for him that NO ONE else does. He has subpar bruiser DPS (even with the best runes and items for it), no hard CC, ONE gapcloser/terrain cross, and a small AD steroid and non-chunk situational heal.\n\nPlaying as tryndamere made it fairly easy for me to see the drawbacks to his kit and playstyle and it's counterplay options, and you also seem to be forgetting they've nerfed his ultimate AND his splitpushing power since his release, and that the \"small\" meta changes during S4 and S5 away from bruiser/assassins towards mobile DPS and tanks has only made it harder for him.\n\nThe majority of tryndameres I see today are only a real team threat against bad comps, people who can't counter-itemize (AKA Armor), and people who let MULTIPLE lanes get pushed up. Every other tryn ever normally goes into a teamfight and has to pop ult during a dive to enable his team to toe with the enemy, then dies. OR, get's caught out, or goes ham and gets locked down, has to use ultimate, then succumbs to ignite damage or is out of the next fight until ult is back up, because if you don't have at least one ignite on a tryn that goes in with ultimate up, you're stupid, and If you go in without ult as tryn with enemy ignites up, you're also stupid.\n\nThere are multiple champs out there that does everything tryn does (and used to do) better, and have more going for them. \n\nOkay, long rant done. The short one is this:\nDo you have any Idea what a slippery slope you're on? You don't like Tryn's ult. I get it.

That theme does not get changed without a very, Very, VERRRRYY good reason, and unless the whole playerbase, the koreans, the pros, and Chuck Norris agrees on that reason, it likely won't get changed.\n\nHell, {{champion:69}} , {{champion:16}} , and even {{champion:45}} 's ults didn't get changed even when their kits got MAJOR overhauls.

And he violates so many of Riot's balance philosophies that it's not even funny. Champions have been ruined or completely stripped of their identity for far less.\n\nWhere do we even begin?\n\n**Passive.** Oh god, the passive. With how much Riot hates RNG it's a wonder how the hell is this still here. It's not fun in any situation. Early on, Tryndamere spins into your face, and from there you have 2 scenarios: \n1.) He crits you 2 times. He just won his lane as you recalling because next time he will kill you - if you're not already dead.\n2.) RNGesus does not look upon him and you will probably win the trade... unless he maxed W, but more on that later.\n**Both of these scenarios are 100% reliant on RNG, and 0% on skill. There is no satisfaction for the losing side, no feeling that you got rightfully outplayed. No - either you got lucky or he got lucky.**\n\n**Q** Gives him AD based on missing HP. Not a big deal, you might say - **but Karma got her entire kit, character and personality scrapped, with her passive being called out as one of big reasons.** To quote Riot's opinion on that \"Old Karma's passive felt extremely frustrating to play against - since she got stronger with low HP, you felt punished for playing well against her\".\nAnd Tryndamere not only gets the same sort of invisible power, **but also gets a 5 second window at 1 HP where he can abuse it at its strongest.** Consistency is strong here.\n\n**W** This ability is the definition of low counterplay, invisible power and many buzzwords Riot keeps throwing around. Slow is fine, but for the love of God, _why the hell does it remove 80 AD in an AoE?_\nNow, let's calculate that in gold value: 1 point of AD costs 36 gold. With a simple, unavoidable click of a button, Tryndamere removes 80x36 = **2880 GOLD VALUE IN AD from his target** In team fights, it amounts to 14400 gold in lost stats. Lost to an unavoidable, instant AoE.\nStill not enough for you? Say Tryndamere maxes W first. Aatrox, for instance, has 82 base AD at level 9. After Trynd uses his W, he's left at, what? 2 base AD? **That's more than 95% reduction.** Ok, say he completed his damage item - BotrK. He now has AD of 27, not counting %HP effect. Mind you, Urgot's 15% reduction is considered extremely toxic by Riot.\n\nThis ability, by default, causes Trynd to effortlessly win against any AD-based champion. And here we come to another of Riot's favourite buzzwords - **false choices.** You know you can't fight him because he'll cut most of your AD, but you also can't run since he'll slow you and chase you down with his RNG-reseting gap closer.\n\n**E** This ability is not bad by itself - but put RNGesus in the equation, and oh boy. He might jump on you, eat you alive with crits and  immediately jump out... or jump in and remain stuck. 100% luck, 0% skill.\n\n**R** Funny thing. This is actually the most balanced part of Tryndamere's kit. He can use it to fight or escape, rarely both and can be countered with a DoT. Frustrating, yes - but not as much as the rest.\n\n**TL;DR** Tryndamere is a toxic mess of a champion that can't be salvaged by less than a full-on rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Bresn","date":"2015-06-14T19:29:07.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Nasus infinite Q?","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-06-14T20:02:51.651+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bresn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sQ6uhZIO,comment-id=00140000,timestamp=2015-06-14T19:29:07.013+0000)\n>\n> Nasus infinite Q?\n\nWhat has that got to do with literally anything he said?","replies":[{"poster":"Bresn","date":"2015-06-16T19:15:00.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His talk about RNG Tryn vs linear-scaling Nasus (Could be exponential as he gets CDR and instant-minion Q)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Emperor Antares","date":"2015-06-14T09:19:49.394+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"If anything...

Literally unless you've got two champions with crowd control babysitting Tryndamere so he can't split push, he's either going to split push you to death, or roflstomp you with his disgusting damage without being able to die.  After all, why bother building defense on Tryndamere when he can just press a key on a short cooldown to become completely immune to death?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2015-06-14T06:38:24.230+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"so no other champs can build {{item:3512}} , put it in range of the turret, and take it down?  also, if tryn uses his ult to break the tower or damage it, anyone with teleport can delete him for free gold if they can catch up to him","replies":[{"poster":"Bresn","date":"2015-06-14T19:22:19.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:23}} + {{item:3512}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lordofthepittt","date":"2015-06-14T19:04:16.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is not even remotely OP.  He is pretty weak right now.  For one, he is extremely vulnerable to CC.   Two, thornmail screws him pretty hard.  Thirdly, ignite kills him pretty easily if you do it at the right time.\nSplitpushing shouldn't be a problem, because if you force a teamfight while he is doing that, the enemy team is going to be down one player and weaker as a result.  If you win that teamfight, take some towers and force him off of yours.  If you lose that teamfight, then you either made a mistake as a team, or are too far behind to realistically come back and win anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-06-14T18:43:07.581+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dealing with Tryndamere ults 101:\n\nRoute 1:\n\n1.

Can he be a bit annoying? Sure he CAN be, but just about any champion that's played well can be. How about Kayle whom can throw her ult on anyone and split push very well. While not popular right now, she's not exactly bad by any means. Nasus for me is in the same category but he get's WAY tankier than a tryn does. Both if left alone are going to punish you for it, even if they're behind, but they have plenty of ways of beating them in lane to help stop that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-06-14T07:35:51.927+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"A couple seconds after he ults, just use {{summoner:14}} .\n\nProblem solved.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2015-06-14T10:21:07.916+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"We have come full circle.

Anytime tryndamere attempts any harass, you just wither him and walk away. You'll have 400 stacks by 20 minutes and tryndamere will lose a 1 v 1 to nasus at anytime because of wither.
