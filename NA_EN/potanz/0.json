We checked his match history, someone was playing on his account in SEVERAL games. He's trying to get his account back, but he can't submit a ticket or can't contact with RIOT support system in anyway due to him not being able to actually sign in to any account to make a claim that his account was hacked. How can he contact RIOT for his account back if you need to LOG IN to actually send a ticket?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-01T05:46:38.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your friend can reach out in a support ticket using [*this specific form*](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416), since it doesn't require him to sign in and is used **exclusively** for account recoveries.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.
