I know there are some people who like to, but I wish the Featured card allowed me to turn off certain maps or game modes.\n\n- I occasionally want to spectate other levels of play (usually my own), but have no way of doing so.\n\n- I wish I had the ability to spectate a game with certain parameters (e.g. a particular champion in a particular role or combination of champions on a team).","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-09-30T22:00:58.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it boils down to a few reasons:\n\n* I don't leave my client open (or open my client) unless I'm looking to play a game. \n* The spectate client isn't available everywhere. I can't be on my phone or in my living room spectating a game, I must go to a certain location of my home and watch there.\n* I enjoy commentary to go along with my viewing of games. Be it a Twitch Stream, YouTube, or something else. The current spectator doesn't facilitate that.\n\nIn the rare moment when I'm sitting down at my computer, the League client is up, I have to wait to play a game with a friend, and I feel like spectating a game all at once, then I often do feel like it comes down to what champions are being played. I don't care to watch a game with all champions in the top 5% pick rate, I see enough of those champions in my own games.\n\n**TL;DR: The spectate feature doesn't provide the kind of experience I'm most looking for**.\n\nWhat I'd like from the spectator client would be some sort of mash-up between Twitch and the Spectator Client. \n\n* Audio from commentator's coming through, tied to the game timeline, with a checkbox to turn it off or leave it on.\n* Option to follow the commentator's camera. Lets be honest, the people following the LCS action are way, *way* better at knowing where to keep things focused than the automatic camera is.\n* Audio from a specific player. This would have to be an opt-in, turn-on type thing, but could be a great alternative to Twitch streaming\n* Option to follow a specific player's camera/mouse (basically first person view, see how they set up for things, where they're looking, etc.)\n* A way to easily see if a player is in game and spectate their game, ideally launching from a web browser. If they're not on my friends list, I've got no idea if they're playing a game or not, and it makes it harder to spectate them.\n\nI realize this is a pretty far fetched dream, but I think a lot of people would actually want something like this. Can you imagine being able to go and look at a play from Worlds, go back and watch the play unfold from any perspective you wanted? Maybe you were really interested in what the support was doing on the back line, but the cameraman focused on the assassin going in 1v3. Currently you can't do anything about that but home there's a second clip, but with this type of a system you could.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2015-09-30T21:55:56.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me it's the external program part.

Are they OP now, are they still viable? just *how much* did the buff/nerf change their play..?)\n\nOr sometimes just ones that make me go 'huh?' like some weird combo of karth+anivia+annie all on the same team, I think to myself, 'How are they going to make that work?' and watch and see.\n\n(Actually something like that was how I found out Karthus ~~is~~ was a viable jungler.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crys3s","date":"2015-09-30T02:38:35.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me at least, players are the core focus of matches I spectate.

Probably can't be easily done with this client, but maybe an idea for a new version.  \n\nEither way, it would be nice to not see pro scene content plastered over every square inch of the home page for a change.

It might be a cool idea to have the ability to open voice coms with people on your friends list while in the same lobby.

Personally, I've hated the new Ahri splash since they forced it through despite community feedback, and would appreciate the option to buy the old splash art to use in my client so when Teambuilder eats my skin, I can still see the old splash, or on the HUD or on the minimap I can see the image on the Insert Champion Icon button.\n\nIf people don't like the new splash arts, or even the new voices when they get a VU, we should have the ability to buy their old splashes and voices to use on our clients with IP.\n\nThis could also extend to things like buying back the old HUD if we don't like the new one, or enable us to buy announcer packs in addition to the old HUD. It doesn't disrupt anything for people playing with and against each other. They'll see and hear what their client is set to present.\n\n---\n\n\nAmong those, I remember seeing something about custom interfaces with faction themed additions such as an Ionian-looking HUD kind of like how Howling Abyss has a HUD with an icy touch to it.  Once again, this will all be personal and would give no advantages to the player while also giving us something to do with our extraordinary amounts of IP we've accumulated with nothing to spend it on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-09-30T19:55:05.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're no longer doing that thing where the entire front page is taken up by esports stuff.
