Though each of our sites serves a unique purpose, we could do a better job tying them together as a network. The new bar has links to all our major destinations: though this is a simple change, it's now much easier to move across League's web experiences. With these improvements to network navigation we're also paring down our navigational menus across the main areas of LeagueofLegends.com - in some cases removing them entirely or moving elements into the drop-down under your summoner name.\r\n\r\nWhile we were considering other valuable additions to the login bar, we pulled the ticker into the redesign. You can now quickly spot-check server status updates from the web in situations where you might not be able to access the patcher or landing page.\r\n\r\nMore details:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fi2XDbg.jpg\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WxTPAug.jpg\r\n\r\nYou'll start to see the new login bar being rolled out over the coming weeks. Let us know what you think!","replies":[{"poster":"Moobeat","date":"2015-01-28T23:00:29.245+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"Excellent.","replies":[{"poster":"9Q1IMGTQP3","date":"2015-01-28T23:05:14.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Moobelz, what is the \"PBE\" button for and why do I not have it?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-01-28T22:41:43.442+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right off do you know if it will extend to the Dev Blog or eSports website?","replies":[{"poster":"zerocontext","date":"2015-01-29T00:58:14.541+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're working to have the new bar replace every instance of the old bar design, across all our sites.
