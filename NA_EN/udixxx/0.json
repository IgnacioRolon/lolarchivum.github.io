After the matches ended i noticed that the enemy team didn't receive loss prevented due to the lags , and in the second match the lags were freaking HUGE and i lost the match because nobody was able to play . I demand my LP's back , it is not my fault or my team's fault we lost because the game was unplayable.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-19T21:06:09.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to find a recorded issue with the servers on the [Service Status page.](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#eune) Are you still experiencing this issue, or has it been resolved?\n\nLP cannot be modified in any way after the server records a gain/loss.
