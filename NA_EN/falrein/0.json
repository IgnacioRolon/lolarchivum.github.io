There's a darkin named Enakai who's being called \"Enekai\" twice. It's no big deal but oh well!\r\n\r\nJust got a picture as a proof. Enakai is mentioned 11 times while Enekai only 2, so I'm guessing Enekai is the wrong one :p","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Catzpaw","date":"2019-03-13T19:04:54.827+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \nD'oh!
