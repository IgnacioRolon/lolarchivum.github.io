{"poster":"Falrein","date":"2019-02-07T16:48:30.228+0000","title":"List of missing bios and color stories","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi everyone! With the lovely LordRedStoneNr1, we've tracked down every missing bios and color stories on Universe!_** So basically, we're missing 36 bios, and 41 color stories**_. Bear in mind that some champions have stories that aren't categorized as color stories (Yasuo, apparently, doesn't have a color story. If you're not sure, just check the URL and it'll be written color stories (apart from Ahri and Wukong who only show \"color\" but I guess it's the same?)). For example, The Dreaming Pool is _not_ Syndra's color story, meaning that she still needs one (as we were told that every champion would eventually have one). \nThe point of this thread is to show how many bios and color stories are missing, as well as to show which champs need some. I think that by the end of the year, all champions will have an updated bio (with the regular releases every 2/3 weeks, plus with the releases that come along new champs/VGU). Hopefully, all will have a color story too, but I'm not too confident about that, as some champions don't have priority (even though I'd love a Syndra color story, I would understand if she doesn't get anything this year, as she appears in The Dreaming Pool).\nNow, if you're interested in the details...

We don&#x27;t know. Maybe a writer could help here?\n\nWith moving the lore forward, I think it depends on the champion in question. For example, One Last Shot shows how Graves (and Twisted Fate, although not present at the time of the short story) are in Piltover right now, even though for some reason, the map still lists them as being in Bilgewater, which they are not anymore. \n\nBy the way, shouldn't Snow Day count as Gnar's official color story now? I know that one was missed among all the Sylas hype, but it depicts a little event from Gnar's point of view.\n\nConcerning the Yordles in different areas (Kennen, Ziggs, Heimerdinger), they'll probably all be updated when Bandle City receives its update. I should think it's going to be more of a lore bomb than the \"Demacia event\" which we now know is going to be spread out among Lux lore and even more Lux lore in the rest of the year, but we haven't heard of any Yordles getting anything of the sort.","replies":[{"poster":"Falrein","date":"2019-02-07T18:03:26.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing for Gnar: Snow Day is not counted as Gnar's color story, while The Hunter Hunted does, according to the URLs ^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2019-02-07T17:51:20.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scathlocke confirmed short stories aren't colour stories on twitter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2019-02-08T21:30:19.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lordredstonenr1,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=KrM3dBbF,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-02-07T17:46:24.813+0000)\n>\n> I know that many want to point out stories for characters that are presumably &quot;color stories&quot;, but we are pretty sure they are not.\n> Look at the URL for _*~~First Steps~~*_ and _*~~Art is Life~~*_:\n> https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/nami-first-steps/\n> https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/art-is-life/\n> \n> Now some actual color stories: \n> https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/lux-color-story/\n> https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/annie-color-story/\n> \n> It&#x27;s clear that  _*~~Art is Life~~*_ does not follow the same naming convention.\n> Nami and Rengar are open for discussion though, they have the champion name in the URL but not the &quot;color-story&quot;.\n> Riot has other stories that do not exactly follow the same naming pattern, such as  _*~~A Fair Trade~~*_ (https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/ahri-color/) which we categorized as Ahri&#x27;s Color Story or  _*~~Fast and Dumb~~*_ for Wukong (https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/monkeyking-color/)\n> \n> In the end, only Riot knows the actual definition of a &quot;color&quot; story, however I am pretty sure that it should not move the lore forward - and Nami&#x27;s does exactly that.
