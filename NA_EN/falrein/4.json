Indeed, Riot's map is accurate, interesting, and incredibly well-made... But they fucked up on that one I swear. \r\n\r\nSure, they have a lot to do, and they can't always update the map. Sure, this map is a great gift for us lore nerds. But it's not accurate as you may think. Something _really_ important is missing... \r\n\r\n####**_~~WHY ISN'T THERE HALF A FORTRESS FLYING OVER IONIA?~~_**\r\n\r\nYes, you heard me right. There should be half a fortress flying over Ionia. But there isn't? **Even worse!** Fae'lor is a pin on the map, despite the fact that it was destroyed and taken away by Syndra! \r\n\r\nI cannot enjoy the map at its fullest knowing that. This is truly, truly disappointing. I trust Riot will make the right decision concerning that now that this is a known issue. \r\n\r\nPlease give us the half fortress we deserve. \r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2019-04-12T17:27:42.569+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pff.
