What I see is someone not picking/banning, it gets to 0 seconds, and then it sits there forever, and I'm forced to face a penalty because of it.\n\nI've had to sit out many games, and over the last few weeks, it's added up to probably 4 hours of waiting for shitty penalty's because Riot's client is just being trash. It is not my internet, I average at about 150+ mbps every speedtest, I can stream 4k videos and watch livestreams at max quality while never experiencing lag. I've reinstalled.\nI've taken a week break in hopes it will go away, it hasn't. It happens on both clients, and it's much more frequent on the \"new\" client.\n\nIn blind pick I can't select a champion for 30-40 seconds and don't even know what role is available for me, and people can't read my messages. In draft pick I can't pick my champion because it never tells me people before me have banned or picked. In ARAM if I trade champions it won't tell me if they accept or decline, so I have to guess, and I can't change runes/masteries/champion spells, then I have to restart the client when the game actually starts so I can load in.\n\nPlease fix this, I can't play your game, and if I were to play ranked I'd probably lose 100+ lp for nothing I can fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-07T22:34:55.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like you're losing sync in champion select and getting left behind.  This usually happens with connection problems during champion select, so you'll want to go through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix it up.  Your speedtest might result in perfect numbers, but it doesn't make you immune from having issues or blocks communicating with specific servers.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
