And I tried and it worked great for Italian and Japanese but... How can I make my language Korean? It is simpy impossible for me to do it from this ''old way'' as we call it and I really really want Korean announcer! Can someone please help me? :(\r\n I also have more questions about this.\r\n1. Is it legal for the Terms of use of LoL to change language via files?\r\n2. Did you guys try to do the same, but without result?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-29T01:13:53.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Korean isn't one of the supported languages on the EUNE servers I don't believe, which is probably why altering the files isn't working. When you launch into the region on the patcher, I think it'll actually replace any missing or altered language pack files so I'm not sure that old method is going to work at all.","replies":[]}]}
