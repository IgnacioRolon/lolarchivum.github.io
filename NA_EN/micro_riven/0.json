And my history said I didn&#039;t play with the brand in the previous games and brand didn&#039;t even played brand in the previous game, but Akali was in brand&#039;s game. And this proved apparently it was a joke that started with brand&#039;s toxicity in the first place and we just laughed it off\r\n\r\nSo, guys, this is an email I just send to riot below.\r\nReally don&#039;t want to write more today, and I believe Riot is going to unsuspend me.**\r\n\r\nHi, whoever is helping me on the other side of the world\r\nThis email is simply trying to tell you what happened today and I want a solution or a Fair Answer\r\nAfter spending nearly an hour going over the email I wrote this paragraph last after I wrote the whole bunch, and simply because this is the thing that I want you to know, in case you go through everything without reading it like the robot that banned my account a min after the game.\r\nImagine you are the one who is getting banned for an unfair reason, and you are the one who&#039;s trying to fix the problem. You will hope one of the riot members is going to help you.\r\nAnd please read all I wrote, thanks.\r\n\r\nSo, I&#039;m trying to control my anger now riot, let&#039;s talk politely,\r\nIn the previous email which is about how I got banned from nothing clear record to 14 days suspension by saying get fked bitches to the enemy, I said this:\r\nshouldn&#039;t there be two chat ban first? 10 games and 25 games? at least 1? before the 14 days suspension?????\r\nwhich was a game i was being pretty offensive I admit, only towards the enemy though, so firstly, let me make myself clear, I will never be offensive to anyone in my team for no reason. And last time, one of the riot members replied to me:\r\nbecause, in certain cases, even one message, if it&#039;s toxic enough, can get an account banned.\r\nwhich skipped the 10game and 20 games chat ban\r\nthis is in the situation when I got to 14 days suspended straight away which is a SPECIAL CASE due to extreme toxicity.\r\n\r\nSo if it&#039;s toxic enough 1 game is enough to get me from clear record to 14 days ban,\r\nBefore I goes into the message, all message below was not offensive, and the report came instantly after the game, I bet my life on it, that no one whatsoever had read through the message word by word that being &quot;toxic enough&quot;, so please unsuspend my account after I explain to you what happened.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nPre-Game\r\nMicro Riven: can i top?\r\nMicro Riven: plz?\r\nMicro Riven: 2 auto fills insane...\r\nMicro Riven: OMG\r\nMicro Riven: YASUO IS AN ADC\r\nMicro Riven: i dont trust anyone below plat\r\nMicro Riven: its soraka\r\nMicro Riven: bro\r\nMicro Riven: counter my shitt out in lane\r\nMicro Riven: im lv7 ashe\r\nMicro Riven: but i dont play fken adc?\r\nMicro Riven: if u guys dont carry...\r\nMicro Riven: what i mean is jax and yasuo\r\nIn-Game\r\nMicro Riven: trash brand from last last game\r\nMicro Riven: invade?\r\nMicro Riven: are u first time akali?\r\nMicro Riven: oops\r\nMicro Riven: wtf?\r\nMicro Riven: the instant ignite\r\nMicro Riven: ?\r\nMicro Riven: so akali\r\nMicro Riven: u went akali support and actually did nothing and flaming me?\r\nMicro Riven: and trying to convince me to trll riven into soraka as well?\r\nMicro Riven: and taking my farm?\r\nMicro Riven: riven adc?\r\nMicro Riven: wow\r\nMicro Riven: sej gank plz\r\nMicro Riven: report akali plz toxic and troll thanks\r\nMicro Riven: one reason i give up adc\r\nMicro Riven: u are attcking cs and missing it?\r\nMicro Riven: stop takling cs?\r\nMicro Riven: he got 11 out of all cs he ruined?\r\nMicro Riven: he missed a canon and bunch of others?\r\nMicro Riven: THERES BLOOD COMING OUT OF TOWER\r\nMicro Riven: BLOOD\r\nMicro Riven: DAM\r\nMicro Riven: attack tower?\r\nMicro Riven: gogogo jax\r\nMicro Riven: 1v2 bot is really hard tbh\r\nMicro Riven: what u expecting?\r\nMicro Riven: its not my fault getting auto filled\r\nMicro Riven: and i can play adc properly\r\nMicro Riven: its not akalis fault get auto fill sup\r\nMicro Riven: but its her fault trolling and cant play support\r\nMicro Riven: wtf\r\nMicro Riven: that dmg\r\nMicro Riven: we can win\r\nMicro Riven: only if akali stop trolling\r\nMicro Riven: he ruined my farm\r\nMicro Riven: thats all matters\r\nMicro Riven: wt\r\nMicro Riven: wtf man\r\nMicro Riven: cuz u didnt give me top?\r\nMicro Riven: just got 2 gold 5 with 80% wr?\r\nMicro Riven: are  blind or what?\r\nMicro Riven: 80% wr past 20games for rank solo\r\nMicro Riven: who is the one talked first?\r\nMicro Riven: so is there anything wrong with talk?\r\nMicro Riven: he can flame when he plays relatively better?\r\nMicro Riven: and u as well?\r\nMicro Riven: we lost all lose\r\nMicro Riven: who cares?\r\nMicro Riven: ok?\r\nMicro Riven: just got to g5 3 days before\r\nMicro Riven: nice\r\nMicro Riven: u got more death than me?\r\nMicro Riven: and u have no right to conttrl what i play?\r\nMicro Riven: rather get hibi\r\nMicro Riven: 2/8 nothing better\r\nMicro Riven: say it to akali\r\nMicro Riven: stop dying?\r\nMicro Riven: report e nothing happened\r\nMicro Riven: do it\r\nMicro Riven: report akali plz brand\r\nMicro Riven: i  simply go trolled\r\nPost-Game\r\nMicro Riven: report akali trolling + toxic thanks\r\nMicro Riven: thanks\r\n\r\nEverything I said this entire game. Copied from the client. Really anything toxic? Is &#039;wtf&#039; toxic when I got 1 shot by the enemy? and the last message I send was mean to be &quot;I simply got trolled&quot; that was pretty obvious\r\nso now im going to go through all the message, fixing some mistakes to make it clearer.

All the message that could be considered as toxic is appreantly not except maybe these 3 that I marked in bold. IT IS ONLY &quot;MAYBE, AND CONSIDERED AS&quot; I explained those 3 msgs above.\r\nPlease, I want you to understand how unfair this is, or how bad im feeling right now, this 3 messages could be mistakenly considered as a reason for the suspension, even though I didn&#039;t mean it. Its the same as saying something that&#039;s not so positive, but definitely not toxic. How is making a joke with the enemy count as toxic? And toxic enough to get me banned from 1 game?\r\n\r\nAnyway, This email is simply trying to tell you what happened and I want a solution or a Fair Answer, I believe you know what to do to help me**","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2018-08-01T22:38:59.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm locking this thread, as the discussion is going nowhere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-01T19:05:09.440+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"You flamed and spewed toxicity all game.\n\nGetting a permban requires repeated punishments, and _any_ form of rulebreaking after a 14-day appears to get you an instant perm.\n\nThe logic goes like this: if someone is too stupid/immature/dysfunctional/angry to pay attention to multiple warnings, they are incapable of reform or even accepting that they are a problem, and need to be removed.

If this riot guy is banning people for saying anything negative then lot's of people every day will be leaving league. If you watch streamers on twitch you would know that the viewers have gone from about 250000 to about 50000 in the last 2-3 years. That's about a 500 percent loss in player base on average. If history repeats itself there will be about 10-20k players left in NA by 2k20.

I'm actually telling anyone that reads this that they don't know 99.99999999999 percent of the math in this reality. This isn't new people, type in black matter or dark matter or dark/black energy and read for yourself, also type in do black holes exist? or try is Newton wrong? what is a gravity wave? how full of yourself do you have to be to copy and paste useless shlt when im talking about player base and twitch viewers to bring up math terms.
