How do you know if a report is false or not? i.e.: jungle didn't gank, reporting you - isn't really a valid reason to report someone, but people will report for trolling. This hasn't happened to me, but how do you validate the reports so things like this won't happen?","replies":[{"poster":"Roaranor","date":"2016-03-03T05:07:05.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have access to a _very_ large amount of data of the game in question when they investigate that they can audit to recreate the picture and find out if it was false or if it really happened.
