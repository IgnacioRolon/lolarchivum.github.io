But I download this issue couple weeks ago..The problem is, I keep reconnecting last night and it doesn't work. Normally the ping is 29 - 34. Sometimes it goes up to 116 - 120 but it's fine. I duo with my friend last night and already played 2 rank game before that happened. I did everything to try to get into the game (including restart my computer), and I'm pretty sure it is not network problem because I also chatting with my friend and watching the presidential debate at the same time. After the connecting problem happened I turned everything off but I just couldn't  get into the game. I live on campus. The network speed is 30m/s.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-28T22:52:24.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though you can use the net without issue, you can still have a problem specifically connected to the game server.
