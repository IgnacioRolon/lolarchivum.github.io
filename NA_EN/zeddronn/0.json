But in the time between the tournament and now, my account was permanently banned (skipped the mute punishments.) Is there any way I can get the incoming RP to get directed to another account?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-02T01:09:33.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since the RP was supposed to go to that specific account, I don't really think they'd be able to redirect the prize to someone else or a different account. To be certain though, I'd shoot our game team a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see if this might be possible whatsoever, but I can't make any promises.","replies":[]}]}
