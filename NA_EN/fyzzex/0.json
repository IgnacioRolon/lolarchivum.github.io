The game went badly. I realize that me doing badly hurt us alot but it also got me thinking, why do people play warwick? If they say its for the cc, any tank junglers laughs in your face and if they want a late game monster that eats everything a well played yi can 1v5 and will be more useful sooner. A combo of the 2? maybe but it still seems weak. I see warwick as more of a champ you learn how to jungle since he&#039;s more forgiving with no runes or masteries.","replies":[{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-04-07T22:58:06.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"WW is a good team fight jg as he can supress an ADC or APC and the team just needs to follow.  and it's an instant 4v5 - if no one follows, you're right, he's just as useless as any other champ in bad teams.  \n\nAre there different picks?  Yes.  Are there better picks?  What makes a better pick?  Team Comp.  Did you pick Vlad because it was a counter or because you wanted to play him?  \n\nLooking at that match WW is the only person on your team that didn't suck hind tit all game.  So no clue why you're bagging on him.  You had an Azir ffs... this thread should say \"Teach me about team comp\" because your match completely lacks any sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Fyzzex","date":"2015-04-07T23:02:14.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"true enough points and I blind picked vlad because top was the only thing that hadn't been called and i had a few successful games with him earlier.

His ultimate is extremely easy to use in fact all his skills are. Yes you are not going to get the highest impact, but that's typically what happens with lower skill caps champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PalPlays","date":"2015-12-17T22:34:07.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/oT5OAAuo-warwick-the-happy-slapper","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-21T10:52:46.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WW needs a emergency rework his kit is bad and toxic at the moment, He is a jungler but he no have a gank pre 6, a tan without no AoE dmg, Mana hunger, his W have a lot of hidden power, can use his E to run away (a skill create to chase not to run away), Ult have no counterplay if he reach a isolate enemy, but he is very reliable on his ult, also his ult make his vulberable because supress him and not reduce the dmg incoming, make him a easily target on tf, and the list goes on with devourer, challenging smite nerfs...\n\nI'm Warwick main all the season 4 (Feral flare time) and he have a huge power, maybe so OP but now after the 4.21 patch he are overnerf, Devourer and challneging smite too, so its time to fix. He its only viable on low elos, or good to smurf bronze accounts IMO.\n\nHas a insane sustain and is very good duelist but his weakness are more than his strenght, in low elo WW its a powerful GOD, but in high elo is a thrash, He really need a rework too fix his core problems and toxic kit.\n\nFor me He needs this to stay healthy:\n\n* -Remove W on his kit, replace with a skill that allow him gank pre 6.\n \n* -Make his E works only towards enemies (like Vayne passive,  Soraka Janna)\n \n* -Add more interactive gameplay on his E (passive and active part instead a toogle)\n \n* -Turn him R into a skillshot like Sejuanis Q, Gragas E or Malphite R to add counterplay.\n \n* -Give a damage reduction when he supress an enemy to reduce the vulnerability.\n \n* -A CD penalty if he uses his R to escape to minimizes his escapes chances,\n \n* -Fix his mana cost and mana pool.\n\nSo he needs a rework to stay in a healthy state, his problems are very evidents right now. \n\nRework when?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2015-04-08T01:29:50.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's a fantastic split pusher.
