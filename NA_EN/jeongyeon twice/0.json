Is there any fix to this? Minimap icons, cursor, health bars, are all smaller than what its suppose to look like. Does league have full 4K support yet?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-02T23:28:29.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"It might suck to hear this, but 4k monitors aren't fully supported by League quite yet. You can use them, but you'll need to workaround the resolution. You can adjust the resolution in-game under the video options, and you might need to adjust your display resolution as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeongyeon Twice","date":"2017-04-04T21:58:57.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"feelsbadman","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Uurik","date":"2017-06-23T02:29:43.048+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey guys, I know this post is really old, but it's one of the top results on google when searching for this issue and I've found a way to resolve it if you're using Windows 10 version 1703. This fix is something I found when trying to get another game to run at the right scaling on my 4k monitor and it works for League of Legends as well!\n\nFirst make sure you have Windows 10 version 1703 by going to the Run program and typing \"winver\". Right next to version it should say 1703 (or higher if you're reading this in the future).\n\nThen follow these steps:\n1. Locate your client app. Mine was Riot Games > League of Legends > LeagueClient\n2. Right click and select Properties\n3. Choose the Compatibility tab\n4. In this tab, under Settings, checkmark \"Override high DPI scaling behavior. Scaling performed by:\"\n5. In the drop down box that is available now, choose Application instead of System or System(Enhanced).\n\nOnce you relaunch the game like this, you can make sure your resolution is back up to 4k and the UI should be back to normal and beautiful. \n\nHope this helps all the 4k monitor users!","replies":[{"poster":"Congelata Unum","date":"2017-08-21T16:21:27.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually all you have to do is deselect \"Override high DPI scaling behavior\" so that it uses your display settings layout size. On my 4k monitor I have it set to 150% and with that option unchecked, health bars and other UI elements appear just like normal.","replies":[{"poster":"LÃ¡g","date":"2017-08-25T01:54:54.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhm all I see under the settings tab is \"Reduced color mode\" \"run in 640x480 res\" \"Disable displaying scaling on high DPI settings\" \"Run this program as an administrator\". Where do I find \"Override high DPI scaling\"?
