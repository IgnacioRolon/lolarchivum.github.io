I've been playing this game for over 7 years now. Never in the time that I have had my account have I been punished in any way shape or form. No suspensions. No chat restrictions. No bans of any sort. Yesterday I woke up to an e-mail saying my account was permabanned for \"unauthorized use of a 3rd party program\" which really confuses me because I've never cheated in League nor have I even attempted to download scripting programs. I've used the Discord overlay, but that doesn't affect the game in any way. When I try to log in I get a message saying \"This account has been permanently banned due to the use of inappropriate 3rd party software (known as \"scripting\"). This kind of behavior causes severe damage to our community and League's competitive integrity, so this action will not be reversed.\" I have sunk thousands of hours and over $1200 into this game. To have it all end like this would be more upsetting than I could imagine. Has anyone had this happen before? I've submitted tickets, but I still do not know if Riot is going to be able to reverse my ban (see \"so this action will not be reversed\"). Anything you can tell me to give me hope is much appreciated.\nUPDATE: I know this came literally right after my initial post, but I checked my op.gg to see my match history, and I have 5 games played on my account that I never played. Turns out my account was compromised I guess.\nUPDATE 2: We're back in it boys. Riot gave me my account back. Shoutout to Vylxeras for telling me to check my match history!","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-06-04T22:58:16.157+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can prove your account was hijacked (i am sure riot can check the IP address history for your account logins), you may be able to have it reversed.\n\nThis is probably the first time i have ever seen a \"wrongfully permabanned\" post be anything but an entitled piece of trash having a bratty tantrum, pleasantly surprised.","replies":[{"poster":"Jerg","date":"2019-06-04T23:23:22.788+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you.

Account was unbanned, no honor loss, etc.  Simply had to provide a few details to prove my ownership.\n\nTook about 3 days worth of waiting/responding.  They were super helpful, and it was very easy to get taken care of.\n\n\nSide Note - Change the password for the email your account is attached to.  That's how mine was accessed, the Email address had been compromised.  Support was also able to change the registered email address to a new one for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vylxeras","date":"2019-06-04T22:33:07.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So this can happen for a few reasons\n1) Scripts were used by you\n2) Scripts were used, but not by you.\n\nLet the ticket process go through but be aware of your own account security. Can you check and see if there are any recently played games that you didn't actually play? There's a chance that your account may have been accessed by a third party.\n\nGood luck man, it definitely sucks to have your account thrown away like that, but definitely check your match history for oddities.","replies":[{"poster":"Vreivai","date":"2019-06-05T01:20:03.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"3) False positive\n\nThese do happen, as no algorithm is perfect, but are very rare.
