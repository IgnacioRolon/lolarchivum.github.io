It's a punishment for people with bad connection, people who leave due to real life issues and kids who mismanage their time and have to go to school.\n\nGriefers have to be banned, not tortured by staring at their screen.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-10-02T10:15:34.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They end up in the same pool no matter how you label it though.\n\nThe people who alt-f4 out of the game are going to be judged the same and assigned the same punishment as the person who had their connection drop due to shoddy ISP.

I'm suggesting this for the 20 minute LPQ, not the earlier ones.  Isn't that the highest one, that you get if you continue to leave after the 5 minute LPQ and 10 minute LPQ?  Do you think people with internet issues should reach 20 minute LPQ?

If they click that they will not be AFK, the bot will do a pop up like the accept match one. With more happening closer to the end of the LPQ timer.

If you've bought even $20 of RP, that means sitting there for an hour and a half gives you a return of $13 an hour.  If you've spent $100, then that's a return of $66 an hour.  Neither of these seems like ridiculous amounts of money to have been spent on RP.\n\nAlternatively, you can check the going rate for a level 30 account.  A bare bones level 30 account with no skins and few champions is still about $20.  An account that has more champions and skins unlocked can sometimes be upwards of a $100.\n\nOr you can assign value to the hundreds of hours that may have gone into building an account, as well as the friends lists that were lost upon permanent ban.  Good luck valuing that though.\n\nGiven all this, do you really want to stick with the ridiculous estimate of 10%?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SonicAF","date":"2018-10-02T09:30:40.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can afford waiting for 20 minutes before the game and then play full game, you have to plan your time or not join the game.
