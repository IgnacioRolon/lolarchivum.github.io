Their actions are the result of someone else&#039;s actions, and therefore they should not be penalized for it.  We see it over and over again.  Someone said something, did something, didn&#039;t do something, didn&#039;t say something and that just set them off.\n\nThese players are lacking in impulse control.  Impulse control is being able to control one&#039;s actions and not  just saying or doing everything that pops into one&#039;s head. It is a life skill that most people learn at a very young age.\n\nIf you are one of these players, some of the resources below may be valuable for you.  Yes, I know they&#039;re geared towards children, but the concepts are still solid.\n\n> Sometime between the third and fourth birthdays, many kids will begin developing impulse control skills to help them control responses and behaviors. The Illinois Early Learning Project advises that kids between the ages of 3 and 5 are old enough to learn impulse control. You might compare learning impulse control to building muscles, though. Just as it takes time to make muscles stronger, it takes time for children to learn how to control emotions and actions.\n> \n> https://howtoadult.com/age-kids-impulse-control-1267.html\n\nMore information on Impulse Control:\n\n> Impulse Control: The developing capacity to wait for needs to be met, to inhibit potentially hurtful behavior, and to act according to social expectations\n> \n> https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/cd/re/itf09socemofdimpc.asp\n\nSome tips on developing Impulse Control.\n\n> Children develop controlled impulses as part of their overall development.  The very young child does not have these skills.  In fact, there are those of us who have difficulty refraining from a second cookie as adults.  Impulse control requires will power, delayed gratification, and self-control.  For the child who struggles with development, sensory processing, attention, physical limitations, cognitive delays, or social impairments, the ability to control ones impulses is very difficult.  These individuals are cognitively and automatically focused on the underlying needs.  When other needs such as sensory or balance are the primary focus, it can be quite difficult to refrain from impulses.\n> \n> https://www.theottoolbox.com/2017/03/how-to-teach-kids-impulse-control.html\n\n**Evidence**\nAs evidence for the issue identified above, I'm going to start linking threads here that show the described issue as I see them pop up on the boards.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Salter,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EI5Evqgb,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-10-01T17:40:25.650+0000)\n>\n> I find it pretty bothersome you can get penalized for calling someone a loser %%%%%% after they just shittalked my adc into leaving the ranked game, a game we were winning by a huge lead mind you...\n\n>https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/EI5Evqgb-stop-catering-to-children","replies":[{"poster":"CrisisEchoes","date":"2018-09-28T20:23:27.931+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Why do you care this much about the negative happenings of someone else... in a video game.

It is rarely an issue of the player not knowing _why_ he was penalized and almost always an issue of the player thinking it's okay to lose his cool and go off on other players.\n\nThat said, sure things have happened in game that infuriated me.  I pause, take a deep breath, mute those involved, and then continue playing.  At the end of the day, it's a game, nothing more, nothing less.  If the game is so stressful for you that you cannot control yourself while playing it, it may not be the healthiest game for you.\n \n> Why shouldn&#x27;t someone be angry over someone trolling in a ranked game?  this isn&#x27;t a fun game like say, Lethal League, where you don&#x27;t have to commit much time to a match if you don&#x27;t want to.

Go ahead and check, you won't find it.  If you're angry, then be angry.  But keep it out of the chat and out of the game.  Control the _impulse_ to go off in chat, because not only does it result in you being penalized, but it also reduces your chances of winning and worsens the experience for your teammates, even those not involved in your spat.\n\n> In the big picture, sure, it makes sense to judge people in a sense of &quot;lol just report at end of game bruh its so easy just have self control&quot; but it&#x27;s really not that easy when you&#x27;re actually in the game, and I&#x27;d like you to step off the highroad for just a second to really consider someone else with extremely different circumstances both in game and IRL.\n\nThere is no situation where it \"makes sense\" to rage, flame, or troll in game, regardless of what else has happened or is happening in the game, certainly not if you're still trying to win.  Raging, flaming, or trolling in retaliation is a 100% emotion, 0% logical response that creates a lose/lose situation for all involved, every time.\n\n> so maybe claiming people who lose control for even just one game are &quot;children&quot; isn&#x27;t the most insightful thing to say.

For those people, it's unlikely to be a single game occurrence.  It is a pattern of behavior that they should be aware of, sooner rather than later, for their benefit as well as those that end up playing with them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Flashes","date":"2018-09-29T01:46:17.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I've never popped my cap off at anyone because I just don't type ANYTHING REMOTELY NEGATIVE into the chat\n\nunless it's ironic like\n\n\"Nasus and Nami are the two furry Ns which is why they're fucking each other in the ass\"","replies":[{"poster":"SangreDeNoche","date":"2018-09-29T03:05:17.837+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FailureOfAPerson,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=PITGT6yQ,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2018-09-29T01:46:17.817+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;ve never popped my cap off at anyone because I just don&#x27;t type ANYTHING REMOTELY NEGATIVE into the chat\n> \n> unless it&#x27;s ironic like\n> \n> &quot;Nasus and Nami are the two furry Ns which is why they&#x27;re fucking each other in the ass&quot;\n\nusername checks out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mlm olo mlm","date":"2018-09-28T23:35:27.501+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":7,"body":"You, yourself, have not mastered impulse control. \n\nYou didn't even actually give help.\n\nYou called people \"children\" then misread some links.","replies":[{"poster":"Subdue","date":"2018-09-29T02:02:35.919+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mlm olo mlm,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=PITGT6yQ,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-09-28T23:35:27.501+0000)\n>\n> You, yourself, have not mastered impulse control. \n> \n> You didn&#x27;t even actually give help.\n> \n> You called people &quot;children&quot; then misread some links.\n\nWhich link did I misread?

It's possible that people who get their first chat restriction just didn't understand that their behavior was unacceptable.  But people who reach the 14 day ban?  The permanent ban?  And especially those who come to the boards to whine about those bans?  No, those people definitely have poor impulse control, and it's very unlikely that it's limited to video games.  If people can't control themselves when the stakes are pretty much as low as it gets, how can you expect them to control themselves elsewhere?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2018-09-28T22:46:24.371+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"impulse control doesn't exist on the internet/video games, silly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Whisperwind23","date":"2018-09-28T21:26:05.467+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sadly Ive just reached the point where i mute all as soon as i get into the game now.
