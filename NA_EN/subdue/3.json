If you have a 20 minute penalty, you just start the queue, set a timer, and come back when the timer is almost over.  You're not penalized at all if you know to start the queue before you actually want to play, regardless of how many games you need to do this for.  The only real penalty is if you're playing multiple games in a row, and even then, it's easy to do other things in the interim.\r\n\r\nInstead, the penalty should escalate to the following.  After receiving the 20 minute penalty, the next penalty should be a 20 minute penalty, after which a random, undisclosed penalty that ranges from 0 to 60 minutes.  This way, the user being penalized must be attentive to LoL the entire time, as leaving and having the queue pop while they're doing something else would start the process all over again.  The user cannot ignore or avoid the penalty, but must actually endure it.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-02-27T18:32:36.345+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"It sounds like you want more punishment in the 'punishment'.

At the end of the day the purpose is to deter unnecessary leaving.  I am not recommending that the detection system be less lenient.  If you wouldn't be flagged for a penalty today, I don't necessarily think you should be flagged for a penalty under the proposal either.  However, when you are flagged for a penalty, it should /feel/ like a penalty.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2020-02-27T18:32:38.670+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Random punishments do not encourage any type of reform. 20 minute penalties are pretty annoying, and if people keep exhibiting **purposeful** AFK behavior, they will eventually receive harsher punishments, such as suspensions.\n\nWhen you want to encourage a person to modify a behavior through a punishment, surprises are one of the worst, and most unfair things you can do.

I am not saying that the punishment should be randomly assigned.  The punishment should remain on its existing schedule.  You leave with a certain frequency and when you cross the threshold of too many leaves in a given period of time, and you receive the penalty, just like it works today.\n\nCurrently, the penalty is a flat value.  You know when you queue up that it's going to take exactly 20 minutes, and then the queue will pop.  So you can queue up, wander off to do whatever, come back in 20 minutes, and play.  If you're somewhat smart about it, you don't even have to feel the punishment because all you have to do is queue up 20 minutes before you actually want to play.  This makes the punishment ineffective.  The same can be said of suspensions.  Sure, it may suck not to be able to play when you want to, but you don't have to actively feel it.\n\nI am suggesting that when you receive this kind of punishment, the length of the penalty should not be visible to the person receiving the penalty, so that they are forced to be at attention, at their computer, for some period of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-02-27T21:22:03.678+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hold customers hostage at their computer?

Heck, even twice.\n\nWhat OP is saying is that after like 3-4 afks within a week(if you can't manage your time within a week and tried to play a game of league you KNEW you might not have time for, that's on you) then you would be put into a random extra 0-60 minute timer. This timer is random and is unknown to you on the screen.\n\nSo visually the timer would appear to the player probably as a message like \"You afk'd too many times and are now in a special extra waiting queue\" but would not display a timer. The actual timer could be 1 minute extra wait time because of too much afk-ing or it could be as high as 60 minutes with RNG deciding what it is. So this makes it so that people can't plan around having exactly a 20 minute timer to say, watch a television episode while not waiting for league so it's like they never AFK'd in the first place.\n\nOP is just saying that people who afk frequently should be put through this type of timer as it would cause people who rapidly afk to be unable to do so without wasting roughly an entire game of league's time as that would be equivilent to the time the person who AFK'd wasting 4 other peoples' times.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2020-02-27T21:21:45.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically, I didn't misunderstand you at all - you want some sort of random punishment.\n\nNot gonna fly.\n\n> This makes the punishment ineffective.
