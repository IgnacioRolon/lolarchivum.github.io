I fully support that, especially given that the majority of players who ever receive a single penalty never receive a second.  The penalty system also has certain zero tolerance words and phrases which will net the player an instant 14 day ban, and I fully agree with that too.  There are some things which simply should not be said, and those things should be penalized severely.\r\n\r\nHowever, the way these two penalties are combined does not make sense.  Using a zero tolerance word or phrase also bumps the penalty tier all the way to the 3rd step, skipping the first two, which means that a single use of a zero tolerance word or phrase followed by even a slight bout of toxicity results in a permanent ban.  While, toxicity should always be avoided, this does not afford the player the opportunity to reform.  He or she may understand that zero tolerance words and phrases are just that, but has not been warned that other parts of his or her chatter are also unacceptable.\r\n\r\nI propose a modification to the penalty system, wherein use of a zero tolerance word or phrase results in a 14 day ban but only ticks the penalty tier up one, such that the next penalty on a previously clean account is the 25 day chat restriction, followed by a 14 day ban, and then the permanent ban.  However, a subsequent use of a zero tolerance word or phrase should still result in a permanent ban, regardless of the penalty tier.","replies":[{"poster":"Jikker","date":"2019-09-20T14:42:06.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys,\n\nEven if you believe a thread is still relevant, bumping old threads still violates the [**Board Universal Rules**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/ITFIpNUE).

Check the Herald's reply under yours.\nThey are saying that someone with NO history of toxicity who then gets a 2 week vacation for a ZT word, should not be on 'permanent ban' thin ice for even the slightest 'normal' toxicity afterwards, only for another ZT infraction.\n\nInstead someone who was 2 week'd, tries to reform then gets into a heated argument over a bad baron call and brush facechecking and skill, should be given a 25 game chat restriction.

Is this intended, and part of Riot's strict response to ZT, or is this something you'd consider an edge case where a player might have taken the serious warning to heart, but gotten banned due to other, significantly less egregious behavior?\n\nDo you think there might be a benefit to a system that works as follows?\n\n>**Zero Tolerance:** 14-day ban if the account has not had one, permanent ban if the account HAS had a 14-day ban for any reason. Counts as a one-step escalation on the normal punishment track.\n>**Normal Punishments:** 10-game / 25-game / 14-day / Permanent, based on the severity of the behavior.\n\nIt seems this might keep the same strict policy on zero-tolerance behavior (or on those using it after significant prior punishments), while also avoiding edge cases where a player who may not know about the zero tolerance gets hit and later receives a minor punishment.\n\nNow, I'm not personally convinced such a system IS necessary (as I feel everyone should know hate speech isn't okay), but I'd be curious to see whether or not this would make a meaningful difference, or whether players who use hate speech are regularly toxic enough otherwise that it wouldn't make a major difference.","replies":[{"poster":"Capn Of Capns","date":"2018-09-20T21:44:26.571+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"This whole thread has been about me kind of so everyone can now use me as an example.\n\nA few nights ago I was playing with a friend duo in bot lane and the other team banned the champion I wanted and I didn't have a back-up who I really wanted to play, so I decided to experiment a little. My friend is a halfway decent Brand player and I'm pretty good at Lissandra so I told him we'd do that. The thematic flavor of Fire and Ice struck me as particularly middle-schoolish, and as my friend and I both share a darker sense of humor I started making jokes more appropriate for middle-school edgelords than functioning adults.\n\nThe game went on and this combo worked really well for us so we started cracking jokes in the team chat and then the all chat. Eventually I remembered the FIRE and ICE thing and started up with the dark jokes which quickly spiraled into all kinds of other jokes. I'm not going to name any of them but we covered a pretty broad array of potentially offensive things. At no point did we threaten anyone and at no point did we wish harm on anyone or use material I would consider inexcusable, but quite a bit of it could be considered nsfw.\n\nSo. **To my point**. I've been playing since season 2 and never had any form of penalty at any point. I've had every honor ribbon you can have (except that elusive yellow one), and in general I tend to get an honor every game. Opponents used to give me honors when that was thing.  Let's say something I said was flagged as ZT since I know for a fact several people reported me even though I assured them everything I said was meant as comedy. Bam. Instant penalty with threat of permanent ban. Here's my problem with this.\n\n**The judgement system is not perfect.** What one person finds inexcusable and OBVIOUSLY never to be said another could be fine with. For instance, I'm personally fine with 9/11 jokes even though my uncle almost died during that, but people who live on the west coast could find such jokes abhorrent. \n**The judgement system does not have integrity.** I don't know how infractions are judged anymore. Back in the day we had the tribunal and I even used to do it every now and then, but I knew people who said they didn't bother to read the information at all, everyone was guilty. The tribunal was meant to be a filter to send serious cases on up to actual mods, but this always still bothered me.\n**The law is vague.** I tried googling the Zero Tolerance policy and wouldn't you know it, I couldn't find it. This is obviously problematic. How are we to know what not to do or say if it is not laid out for us? I know that's going to catch flack but the world is a big place.

Since it was created, my account has always been in good standing, never been penalized, or given any indication that my behavior is unacceptable. \n\nThat said, if I used a zero tolerance phrase today, I would receive a 14 day ban, as I rightfully should. However, the lesson I would get from that is to not use zero tolerance phrases. I would understand that rest of my behavior, which had been passively validated by lack of any punishment, is acceptable. Then, behaving exactly as I have for the last 8 seasons would suddenly be putting my account at risk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-09-20T21:27:33.721+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would i be correct in assuming that it works essentially how the OP wants it to then, more or less?\n\nAssuming the punishments are severity 1-4 for 10 game - perma, it sounds like the process is\n\nPlayer gets flagged for punishment\n\nPunishment is given a number of 1-3\n\nIf punishment of 1-3 has already been received, +1 to the number and check again\n\n\nSo, a zero tolerance would be a punishment tier of 3, giving a 14 day\n\nAnd if you later get a more minor offense for just being salty too much and given a level 1 punishment, instead of being upped to permanent ban its just a 10 game restriction, as it sees youve not received a 10 game yet?\n\n(overly simplistic, but my general understanding of whats being said)","replies":[{"poster":"Subdue","date":"2018-09-20T21:53:34.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pika Fox,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=xAAcRMo4,comment-id=00070005,timestamp=2018-09-20T21:27:33.721+0000)\n>\n> Would i be correct in assuming that it works essentially how the OP wants it to then, more or less?\n> \n> Assuming the punishments are severity 1-4 for 10 game - perma, it sounds like the process is\n> \n> Player gets flagged for punishment\n> \n> Punishment is given a number of 1-3\n> \n> If punishment of 1-3 has already been received, +1 to the number and check again\n> \n> \n> So, a zero tolerance would be a punishment tier of 3, giving a 14 day\n> \n> And if you later get a more minor offense for just being salty too much and given a level 1 punishment, instead of being upped to permanent ban its just a 10 game restriction, as it sees youve not received a 10 game yet?\n> \n> (overly simplistic, but my general understanding of whats being said)\n\nRight now, if a previously clean account receives a ZT penalty, it is bumped to tier 3 (14 day ban), and even solitary minor offenses can result in a permanent ban.","replies":[{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2018-09-21T11:42:07.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not clean if they did a ZT offense.","replies":[{"poster":"Subdue","date":"2018-09-21T13:40:21.722+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xäyąh,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=xAAcRMo4,comment-id=0007000500000000,timestamp=2018-09-21T11:42:07.153+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s not clean if they did a ZT offense.\n\nReading comprehension, please.\n\n> Right now, if a **_previously_ ** clean account receives a ZT penalty, it is bumped to tier 3 (14 day ban), and even solitary minor offenses can result in a permanent ban.","replies":[{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2018-09-21T18:36:55.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Critical thinking, please.\n\nClean record citizen robs a bank at gun point and escapes.

I'll give you a realistic example.\n\nImagine that once every 50 games or so, you lose your cool and call someone a \"fucking feeder\".  The rest of the time, you are able to control yourself and commit no offenses.  You could do this for years, and never receive a single penalty, because there is leniency built into the system for \"bad days\" and what not.\n\nToday, you use a zero tolerance term, whether in jest, or really losing your cool.  You immediately receive a 14 day ban, but more importantly, you are bumped up to Tier 3 of penalties, which means you receive no leniency and the next penalty is a permanent ban.\n\nYou **CANNOT** behave the same way you behaved for years prior.  A single instance of \"fucking feeder\" could result in a permabanned account.","replies":[{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2018-09-21T19:13:25.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Absurd analogies?

For several hundred games and several months after a tier 3 penalty, you don't have to be a consistent asshole to get permabanned.  You don't even have to be an infrequent asshole.  You can get permabanned for a SINGLE toxic event.\n\nSo let's take you for example.  You have never been penalized.  You aren't a consistent asshole, so you've never been penalized, but you admit that you say toxic things once in a while.  Right now, your account is what I described as clean.  If in your next game you dropped a ZT word, you would receive a 14 day ban AND if you continued to behave as you have for the last x years you've been playing without any penalty, you would be permanently banned, despite never being what you described as a \"consistent asshole.\"","replies":[{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2018-09-21T19:40:08.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I say extremely offensive things with my friends 24/7.

More people use ZT words with ill intent than &quot;just slipping&quot;.\n\nIf you believe that an account which is previously in good standing should be at risk for permanent ban after a single occurrence of a ZT word or phrase, that's certainly your right.\n\nHowever, it's possible to not know that KYS is a zero tolerance phrase.  It's possible that a zero tolerance word or phrase which is offensive to the general population is common place and acceptable within a specific cultural segment.  For example, some black people refer to each other as the N-Word, without an offensive context.  It is culturally acceptable in those circles, a sociologically proven method to reclaim power by re-appropriating the word.  However, to the population at large, the word retains its negative connotation, and as such is considered zero tolerance.  Should these people be penalized for using the word?  Arguably yes, since they should be aware of the audience.  Should their accounts be at risk of permanent banning because they used the word once?\n\nWe need zero tolerance phrases because words have impact, and exposure or over exposure to certain derogatory words can for some by very painful and demoralizing.  We also need to hold those who have shown a pattern of excessive toxicity  to a higher standard, to demand that they change their behavior or leave the game.  However, if an account skips 2 punishment tiers and lands on the third after uttering a word in just one game, there is not a pattern of excessive toxicity.  There is a single error.  I believe that should not put one's account at risk for a permanent ban.\n\nAnd by the way, it seems you're under the impression that I made this post because I am unable to control my emotions, or that I'm a consistent asshole and I'm trying to excuse my behavior or get unbanned.  That is not the case.  I have had this account since Season 1, and have played thousands of games both normals and ranked.  I've never received any penalties of any sort, and my account has always been in good standing.  I'm even rocking the Santa Baron icon that was given out a long while ago to players who were deemed honorable.\n\nOne does not have to be a victim of a flaw in the system to recognize that such a flaw exists or to sympathize with those who may fall victim to it.","replies":[{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2018-09-21T20:19:50.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fundamental Disagreement.

The flaw is in the design itself.  It is common knowledge that using a ZT phrase puts a previously clean account in permanent ban jeopardy.\n\nTo put that into perspective, currently a player can be validly reported for tens or even hundreds of consecutive games, depending on severity, before their account reaches the same level of permanent ban jeopardy.
