However this has everything to do with league. When I first started playing, I was encouraging, positive, albeit not the best player, I played league for fun. As the years have gone on, I have increasingly gotten far more serious, toxic, discouraging, and aggressive. I have been chat restricted multiple times on several accounts, and I just got my honour level unlocked again tonight. I actually lost ranked rewards on my two main accounts because i got chat restricted on both accounts. Starting now, I am going to be honest and say I need help. I want to be able to play the game that I used to enjoy without it feeling like a chore, I want to play with good positive people who can help me become a good member of league again. I need help because I do not want to continue being more toxic and tilted, I want to make a dumb play, or see someone make a mistake and laugh, and say \"It's ok, I can do better next time\" and move on and continue having fun. Now I get tilted and I immediately get angry. I'm tired of it, and I need help to have fun again. If you are someone who wants to have fun, love this game and have a friend, please add me and help me become less toxic. Along with my efforts I think this can be a game I can love again, I just need help. Please, add me and we can play, I do not work much this week. Thanks for reading and have a good day.","replies":[{"poster":"Skeleton Matrix","date":"2019-12-15T04:33:47.663+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"mute button does wonders . not sure why players would rather read what toxic people say anyways","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skeleton Matrix","date":"2019-12-15T04:32:50.189+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giC2GMwsXVk","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-15T04:27:17.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked at your profile, I think it's cute that you like Lux.

My two main accounts (including one I'd had since 2014) got perma'd in the same week last year, so I obviously needed to change something.\n\nIt's so easy to _think_ we can maintain our cool outside of a game, but then once we get into a game and someone starts spam-pinging or trash-talking for a small mistake, it's difficult to resist getting back at them. And while the mute button is valuable, it doesn't work for everyone. It's basic human psychology that we would rather know for sure that someone is trashtalking us than not know what they're saying, and it's not easy to overcome that either.\n\nI've only been chat-restricted once on my current account, and that was when I was still being toxic on my others. So what did I do differently? Here are a few things, that may or may not work for everyone. Don't get me wrong, I'm no saint—I still occasionally shoot a less-than-Mr-Rogers-approved comment back at someone... but I'm not honor level 0 anymore! Anyway, here goes, in no particular order:\n\n1. Go into your in-game Options > Interface > Chat and try muting both team and all chat for a few days. Just try it out. It'll be a little bit frustrating at first because you'll only be able to communicate through pings, but just stay with me here. See if you can make it a week. Then, re-enable your team chat, and you'll probably find you have much less of an urge to use it. It's similar to when people go for a month without their phones, and then they don't feel the urge to check social media every five minutes. But it's easy to relapse. So if you feel your fingers itching for a battle via a few little words on the corner of your screen, take a deep breath, and _don't._ Muting the chat again for a game or two can help too!\n\n2. Think about why you play this game. How did you start playing league? Was it for the competition of climbing the ranked ladder—that prestige that comes with achieving a higher rank? Probably not. And, I mean no offense with the following, but for a gold player such as yourself it probably isn't the main reason you play now either (Hey, I'm silver; I'm certainly not in it for the glory). Like most people, you probably started playing league because you were ~~a washed up dota player~~ looking for a fun game to play, maybe a fun game to play with _your friends._\nSo find a friend who plays league, queue up for a norms game, and just try the most wack-ass troll strat you can think of with that friend (without pissing off your teammates too much; that would kind of ruin the point). Have some good laughs. Play teemo support top and enjoy a few games. Do Blitzcrank and Heimer botlane... Oh wait, that's considered meta now.\n\n3. This may be a bit cliché, but before you type a message, think how you would react if someone typed that to you. Would you all of a sudden play better if someone typed that message at you? The difference in the effect on the player between, say, \"Supp buy scanner and ward more dumbass\" and \"Don't forget to switch to scanner and use a few of them wards bro!\" can be huge. And even if they respond negatively to your attempt at being nice, hey, that's their loss. You tried your best, and that's all _you_ can do.\n\n4. Bonus: mute enemy emotes under Options > Interface. Not everyone is bothered by them, but seeing a crying bee every time I die in lane drives me insane very quickly.\n\nFeel free to add me; I'm always looking for people to play with who will make my games a better experience, and the fact that you came to the boards asking for help suggests to me that you genuinely want to change how you interact with other players in the game. I respect that, and everyone should respect an honest request for help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-12-18T06:22:28.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its all about expectations. You suffer from the thing that everyone suffers from after doing something long enough. You drive for 20 years and start thinking shit like \"how the fuck does this guy not know to do that in this situation\", or you get really into politics and think \"how the fuck does someone not know x\". Its this thing where you start to expect that everyone else should at least know a little about the thing you've spent so much time on.\n\nThat driver could be 18 and just got their license, they don't have the experience you do. The person who doesnt know the vice presidents name doesnt give a shit about politics, they dont even care to know that shit. But since YOU consider it common knowledge because youve been living in that world, you are dumbfounded that someone could be ignorant of it. \n\nSo since youve now spent a lot of time playing league, you have these subconscious expectations that other people should have learned from the mistakes that you have made and learned from. But not everyone who plays league, lives league. There's a shit ton of casuals who dont give a shit about the meta. They dont care about achieving a certain rank. League is just the lowest possible priority in their life. They dont give a fuck about it the way that you do. You've put time into it! Youve learned from your mistakes! They should too!!! \n\nThere's no magic solution here. Its a subconscious effect. Im no expert, but I think the way to fix your mindset is to put league way on the back burner. You've given it meaning in your life, and when others treat it like a joke (or a you know... video game) you take it as an insult. Good luck. The only advice I have is simple shit like stop taking it seriously and stop attatching any ego to it. Youre not good, youre trash, its just a game, others are way better than you and could be just as disappointed having you on their team, as you are having the newb youre upset with. Its all just an insignificant, inconsequential game. Stop letting it upset you.\n\nWhen I get a troll/inter, I just think to myself \"welp, I guess this is what we're doing now\". I dont get upset. Anger is like a poison that only affects you. Youre not making anyone feel bad by being mad, only yourself. So why let it piss you off? Go with the flow man. Its just a game anyways. You get a troll, well, time to focus on lane and rid yourself of any thoughts of hoping to win. Just continue like you normally do, try to make outplays and shit. Thats the fun of the game anyways. You can still do that... you just cant win. Big deal. (Sorry, I warned you my only advice is simple shit lol)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Farm Sımulator","date":"2019-12-17T15:08:42.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im right there with you, ive been trolled to high heaven and back and ended up with a chat ban and 14 day ban for telling people running it down lane they where literal human garbage their mothers should of swallowed.

Its the only way i can play and not get myself permaban. When im not playing it with someone else i really dont enjoy it tbh..","replies":[]}]}
