I can sympathize with someone leaving for an emergency or something that is beyond your control like an internet or power failure. But AFKing because \"you had to buy something\"? That is just bad planning on your part. \n\nIf you start a game of league, make sure you can actually sit down for at least 40 minutes. Don't screw over your team because you have horrible time management.","replies":[]}]}
