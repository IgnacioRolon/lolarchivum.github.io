I can't remember really the last time I had so much hype to play a new champion (I'm sure I am not alone on this). No matter what you do in game as Ekko it is fun. If you are stomping, or about to lose I honestly couldn't really say anything negative about the people in game, or on my team (even when I thought that I myself was doing terribly). Along with a great comic, KILLER LOGIN music, and a awe inspiring reveal trailer I can honestly say it lived up to the hype. \r\n\r\n\r\nThank You Riot for creating such an amazing champion.","replies":[{"poster":"FrostEien","date":"2015-05-29T18:24:22.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u2__9QlujM\nhow to play him properly","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-05-29T18:41:57.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He is a fun champion, but he is so OP and broken on release that he will get major nerfs and rework and end up not living up to the hype at all.","replies":[]}]}
