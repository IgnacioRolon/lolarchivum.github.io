Additionally, on camps that can be kited, like Blue/Red/Wolves, use the root from Hunt to save yourself taking some damage on those camps. Lastly, assuming you learn E at level 2, if you get too low early on for some reason (like if you got no leash at all or something like that), she's especially good at taking crab, and you can throw a heal on yourself while doing it before moving on to a camp that damages you.","replies":[{"poster":"SH Azykan","date":"2015-08-10T21:50:11.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still start W P:\nyou can place prep traps at the buff camp and some at the camp you start on. cougar W is actually really good for clearing with this too.\n\nClears healthier and a little quicker than starting Q in my experience.
