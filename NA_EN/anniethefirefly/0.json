Wasn&#039;t sure if the common recording software is the same. What do you guys use to make short clips or record full games?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-11-10T03:17:56.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming it's not co-op vs AI, you can download a replay of the game and play it back in spectator mode until the next patch. For short clips, you can use the \"record highlight\" button. This feature crashes for longer clips, so you'll need something like OBS instead for longer recordings.","replies":[{"poster":"AnnieTheFirefly","date":"2018-11-10T05:29:36.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would I be able to save the short clips to my computer for long term?

Thanks for answering btw!\n\nYes; the highlight feature simply records a video of whatever you're seeing on screen at that time (including pauses, etc.). When you stop recording (by pressing the button again), the full file path of the saved clip will briefly flash in the middle of the screen.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
