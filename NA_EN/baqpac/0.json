It's not something that is often done and i feel there are many people that are interested in watching non-LCS ranked matches. \r\n- We are looking for players that are positive, okay with losing (we need to be able to discuss why we lost, what we need to improve) have a deep knowledge of champs and team composition, because all this needs to be explained to our viewers.\r\n- You must have a microphone and curse voice and/or Teamspeak. \r\n- If some of you guys are willing to stream ranked 5's or solo que when myself or another streamer is not online, we are glad to welcome you to our streaming team. We're relatively new but i see this growing into something awesome. \r\n- For this team im not gonna have any rank requirements (my adc prefers ppl his elo {diamond}) but i kinda feel a mixture of elos would be interesting. We will invite you to a practice team and pick and choose people from that. As i said skill, knowledge, positivity, wiling to take a loss and learn from it and CHARISMA.\r\n\r\nAdd and Message me IG: VGA Baqpac","replies":[{"poster":"LostBast","date":"2015-03-31T19:10:01.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!\n\nI would definitely like to try out for you!
