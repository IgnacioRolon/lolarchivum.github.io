I have noticed a significantly better chat since I started playing the game. However, I have noticed a lot more stealth trolling, not only in game play, but in chat too. I've seen people try to tilt others intentionally just to try and get them punished by baiting others. It's kind of gross and awful and kind of revolting to see that some person gets their jollies off by baiting someone's anger.","replies":[{"poster":"Nankyoku","date":"2018-06-02T08:18:33.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically this, I'm tired of seeing people dodging the instant feedback system while they push their team towards the edge.\nIt's SO easy to do things that don't get you banned but make your entire team lose/flame you.

This usually turns the focus on to me from those baiters and I just mute them and keep on playing too. Sometimes it works, but usually, the person being baited and falling for it is the type that stays angry and continues the flame war anyway.\n\nIt sucks but I think baiting needs to be punished too but that's going to take time to convince Riot and also teach the IFS.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-06-02T04:18:25.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um.. welcome to the internet while players have an open chat at their disposal?\nNot just league, but the majority of all open chat in EVERY video games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-06-02T15:21:57.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like someone just got banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BATTLE4GLORY","date":"2018-06-02T05:04:08.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League has very colorful and optimistic community, yes there is a lot of comedians ingame but what would be this game without a laugh or two :P.
