During my series, I was given three games for my promotion. In the very first game of my series, the enemy team decided to remake because one of their player were afk. However, after I quit the game screen and return back to the cilent, it have shown that I received an X for one of my three games. I find this confusing because I didn't lose in that game since it was a remake. I am very concerned of this issue, so can you please find any solution in this situation please. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-31T00:13:51.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh yea sometimes those promo series can be a little confusing. After looking over your League history, it looks like you happened to dodge a queue when your miniseries first started. Keep in mind, any [**queue dodges in promo or miniseries will be marked as a loss**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760#h2q2).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rengaar","date":"2017-07-30T16:12:30.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I Up voted just because of your English :D\nPerfect","replies":[]}]}
