Making runes free was important step; but it proved less balanced and offers less meaningful choices. Reducing resistances while not allowing players to pick the stats they wanted was a massive mistake. Making 3 offense trees, 1 defense tree and 1 utility tree was a mistake. (I firmly believe 1 offense tree, 1 defense tree, 1 utility tree, 1 hybrid offense/defense \"bruiser\" tree, one hybrid offense / utility tree would have made a much more stable meta.) Pumping up Keystones to make them even stronger just forces champions to pick the most synergistic keystone.\r\n\r\nDamage Creep with discussed in season 7. Snowball was discussed in season 7. Games being decided too early was discussed in season 7. Towers being weak was discussed in season 7. Burst damage being too high was discussed in season 7. Pre-season 8 Riot pumped damage! Pumped snowball! Pushed early game! Nerfed towers! Buffed burst damage!\r\n\r\nThey also released Zoe. Zoe was a multi level failure for Riot. They knew she was a problem before release. To quote Ghostcrawler on Reddit: \"Our QA lead said it well. \"When I play as her, I have the most fun I've ever had in LoL. When I play against her, I have the least fun I've ever had in LoL.\"\"\r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/96922n/ghostcrawler_is_moving_off_of_league_of_legends/e3yqr8y/\r\n\r\nReleasing a super frustrating champion is EXACTLY what NOT to do with your aging playerbase. Peoples tolerance for BS is lower than ever. Releasing her hilariously overtuned, poorly tested because QA was busy with \"Runes Reforged\" and RIGHT before Christmas break was the worst decision in champion release history. Worse than Xin or LeBlanc or Yorick or Vlad. At least Riot reacted quickly to those abominations.\r\n\r\nPlayers almost universally shit on her for the entire season. Pro players, Solo Queue players, high elo players, low elo players, LCS Casters: https://streamable.com/z4bwa\r\nRefusing to nerf her into the ground for MONTHS was unfair for everyone including ~~Zoe abusers~~ Zoe mains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Now let us talk about LoL moving forward.**\r\n\r\nThe time for big system changes was 5 years ago. We have more than 130 champions, any big changes to runes, items or summoner spells has a direct impact on  at least 20 or 30 or even 40 and indirect effects on the rest of the roster. Big changes to items and runes in particular need to happen occasionally and only when there is a clear benefit.\r\n\r\nNew Champions need to be less frequent and clearly worth the cost of adding them to the game. Delaying a release because of circumstances is acceptable. Releasing broken shit and refusing to fix it for a year is not.\r\n\r\nLets recognize some people loved season 8. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgcpw8rtojU Sadly the irreconcilable, marriage destroying difference between me and Foxdrop is that both of us HATE the other's perfect version of LoL. I want a slower paced game than the majority of the community. Foxdrop wants a faster paced game than the majority. Riot needs to find a compromise for summoners rift. Then release some new faster paced maps.\r\n\r\nWe are long overdue for new maps, Nexus Blitz is a good idea but very rushed and 3-5 years late. Dominion needed proper support in season 2. Twisted Treeline still needs proper support. Riot's obsession with SR seems to stem from Pro play and it has hurt the game as a whole. If Riot had taken the blinders off and stopped catering to LCS years ago we could have a large and stable roster of maps and champions. As it is we have a mess where 20% of the roster has low win and play rates in the audience that actually matters because they are OP in professional play.\r\n\r\nNerfing potentially fun champions until they are not even fun to play because pro players can abuse them is a terrible solution. Make a global ban system or something because this ain't cutting it.","replies":[{"poster":"Douglas Funnie","date":"2018-08-18T20:50:07.654+0000","up_votes":89,"down_votes":7,"body":"Season 8 was a total mess.

At its peak we had lane swaps and late game team fighting.  Ironically, since going to a damage meta, viewership has decreased.    Want to throw that out right away.  I have no idea how you can actually back that up.\n\nWith that said he makes a good point about nerfing early game damage while buffing tanks.  Did they not learn the lesson of trying to shift power to/from places 4 different ways at one time was a horrible idea when they decided to nerf items, stats, and sustain of marksman?  We lack diversity because where there could be a few gentle taps toward diversity Riot gives us swings of the mallet instead and it goes too far.\n\nI agree with op.  I like teamfighting metas.  I think high damage playstyles are gimmicky, lack strategic depth, and are extremely frustrating to play against.  While it's fun for the team snowballing (Some don't think that's true) it's nothing but a 10-15 minute period of frustration as the other team hopelessly defends against an inevitable loss.  Comebacks are few and far between, often relying on the other team to get too cocky and make some dimwitted throws.\n\n**THIS IS MY MAIN POINT.  YOU CAN HAVE A DAMAGE META WITHOUT MAKING DAMAGE SO EGREGIOUS AND OVER THE TOP AS IT IS NOW.**  \n\nYou could have literally just buffed runes but let people keep all their defenses instead of only compensating them the 0 to maybe 1/3 of stats they lost.  That would have increased damage across the board.  You could have taken away defenses and made rune damage baseline to what old runes were (TLD v Electrocute).\n\nBut as I mentioned before, Riot can't seem to give gentle taps to any one direction or the other and see how it settles, they insist on twisting the knob as far as it goes and then just leaving it to sit for too long.  If you like fast paced high damage short games, ardent meta was a nightmare, and lasted way too long.  If you like strategic teamfighting macro play, this season has been a nightmare, and has lasted way too long, and it ends up that everyone is frustrated over time.","replies":[{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2018-08-19T01:21:14.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you sure that is related?

Zoe's standard is way higher, especially when there is nothing to compare her to but another unhealthy play style that even riot destroyed because they hated it (lane nidalee).

That said, it's NOT because of the game state or any sort of balance/release.\n\nMOBAs, as a whole, have run their course.\n\nWhile people will come in and tell me I'm wrong I am and that this is unique to league, every game across the board has had playerbase drops. If anything, DOTA2 is mirroring League in a lot of ways although their changes which happened years ago. Valve recognized the market was changing and tried to change things for DOTA2 to appeal to newcomers. They added talents, fountains and more to ease newcomers in. They added \"Turbo Mode\" which greatly increased game speed. The new heroes added are much more fun, cartoony and (dare I say) League-esque. All of this happened in 2016/2017. Guess what? DoTA2 is _still_ declining as a game according to steam charts. Average players are down. Peak players are too. People only tune in for the International\n\nLeague is trying the exact same thing: Major reworks to stuff to help ease people into the game. A new mode that caters to faster, punchy gameplay. An approach to design in the past season that has 100% catered to casuals. Everything Riot is doing is just as Valve did: A push to get people invested.\n\nPeople, and especially younger kids, don't want to invest a thousand hours just to learn the basics of the game. They want to jump right in with little-to-no barriers. PUBG/Fortnite are taking off because of fast gameplay and low barrier of entry, two things no moba can earnestly boast. This is the exact situation WoW and the MMO genre was in around 10 years ago as well. They ran their course and they couldn't compete with a game genre (League/MOBAs) that had a lower barrier of entry and less time to learn game basics. \n\nWhat we're seeing now is the game moving more towards the core audience. Those that played League socially aren't going to stick around anymore and/or they've gotten too old to play. Those that love League/Riot through thick-and-thin will stick around, just as there are those who stick with WoW/Blizzard no matter the state of the game. Will League have spikes? Sure. WoW recently shot up high thanks to Legion and BFA seems to have landed well. It isn't going to be the megastar #1 game in the world anymore. Just as streamers and content creators stopped making WoW content, so too are League streamers moving away. \n\nCould Season 8 have helped? Maybe. Maybe not.
