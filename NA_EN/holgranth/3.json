However, it has made DOTA far smaller than it _could_ have been. Again, not a bad thing! It's sort of the difference between a game company making money and a game company making MONEY.\n\nLeague's half-and-half has been both it's biggest strength and greatest weakness. The pub balance makes it more welcoming to newcomers and allows for some changes to be made toward that lowest common denominator while the pro changes keeps it strategic (regardless of how players might feel). However, it's never gone fully in either direction, creating a massive pain point for both sides that ends up causing more and more problems as time goes on. We've started seeing it as early as 2015 actually, where pub changes do little to solve problems while pro changes have to be massive and sweeping.\n\nMy goal isn't to dismiss DOTA. It is, however, a point that DOTA has focused on the pro scene and ends up with a far better game for the top tier of play yet makes the game tougher to get into. Comparatively, League always goes for the midpoint between both and never truly satisfies either, which I find to be problematic. In much the same way people want Riot to have DOTA-tier diversity but League-tier newbie friendliness, so too does Riot want a deep and hardcore pro scene like DOTA but with the mass market appeal of what League is/was.","replies":[{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2018-06-17T04:34:43.750+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CaptainMÃ¥rvelous,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WeQyYiEi,comment-id=000a00000000,timestamp=2018-06-17T04:19:43.205+0000)\n>\n> While true, DOTA never hit the mass appeal that League did.

If that was all it took then HoTS or other games should have killed League by now. \n\nNo, League, got to where it was by being the first to go viral as a free to play game. Much like fortnite. \nThere may be better games than fortnite that come out over the next couple years, but they will likely not make much of a dent in fortnite's popularity for the same reasons League stayed on top despite challengers.\nOnce you've seized the market it's a lot easier to keep players loyal than it is to steal players away from an existing game.\n\nIn light of these facts, it is actually a testiment to how good Dota's gameplay is that it did manage to achieve the second highest success by a huge margin compared with all other mobas. \n\n\n> League&#x27;s half-and-half has been both it&#x27;s biggest strength and greatest weakness. \n\nIt has never been a strength of the game.

Both are just as archaic and bewlidering to a new player.\nDota has more depth, more to learn, but those issues won't matter or even be apparent to a new player. From a new player's perspective they are both equally confusing. \n\nThe fact that Dota had 14% marketshare of the moba market, while the nearest competitor was Hots at 7% and smite at 2.5%, proves your theory about accessibility wrong. Especially when you consider how much bigger the gap was in marketshare must have been before Hots was released. \n\nLeague is vastly more difficult to get into than HotS, yet it had 66.3% marketshare.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMÃ¥rvelous","date":"2018-06-17T05:03:20.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Risen29,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WeQyYiEi,comment-id=000a000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-17T04:34:43.750+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re not analyzing properly why Dota didn&#x27;t achieve the same level of numbers.  Snipping these for length.\n\nAnd yet despite this, there were plenty of chances to dethrone League. Hell, if anything, DOTA2 had a fantastic chance because it did and offered a lot of things different from league such as free cosmetics (before the crafting system like 2 decades later) and all heroes unlocked. However, the difficulty made it harder for people to get into DOTA2 even with an objectively better tutorial.\n\n\n> In light of these facts, it is actually a testiment to how good Dota&#x27;s gameplay is that it did manage to achieve the second highest success by a huge margin compared with all other mobas. \n\nIf you want to cement anything as League's success, it was never earnestly the gameplay. The gameplay was nice for people, sure, but it's not what truly made league shine. It's a combination of:\n\n* Rapid change. A new character every two weeks near the beginning of League's lifespan meant there was always something new as well as balance changes.\n* A winning F2P model that became something of the standard among most MOBAs in the industry. A truly \"free\" game. \n* A blooming esport scene that began to grow and captured a teenage audience.\n\nYou see the same thing with Fortnite: Rapid changes, a winning model and a blooming community that captures a young demographic the way S2 league did. And these rapid changes also were fraught with problems in both early and later seasons for both casuals and pros. It's always been an issue, it's just gotten too big to ignore at this point.\n\n \n> Your premise is wrong. \n> You overestimate how easy League is to get into. Both are just as archaic and bewlidering to a new player.\n\nClimbing a mountain is still hard but a mountain that takes a day to climb is easier than the mountain that takes a year to climb.\n\nLeague wasn't simple, sure, but it had greatly less painful mechanics even with DOTA's superior tutorial. DOTA had a lot of design people misconstrued as clunky that required fine-practice most people didn't want to get into. Missile speeds, turn times, denying, stacking, etc. League simplified these mechanics just enough to keep the depth while still being easier than DOTA to get into.\n\nYour point about HotS also misses the biggest factor to HotS's lack of success: Time. HotS officially released June 2nd, 2015. This is _six years_ after League's debut and the renaissance of the MOBA genre.  While we don't have league numbers, 2015 is around the time where DOTA2 peaked according to steam charts and just before the MOBA genre began to decline as a whole. HotS could have had some of the greatest gameplay in the world but it was to League what Playstation All Stars was to Smash Bros: A halfhearted attempt that was too little, too late. The few who found league too complex moved to hots.\n\nLeague has a lot of factors that contributed to it's success but I'm still going to stand that the greatest was providing a tough/deep strategy game while also keeping it simple enough that a casual audience could enter it, while the biggest \"casual\" competition coming 6+ years after League's release.","replies":[{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2018-06-17T05:28:23.955+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CaptainMÃ¥rvelous,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WeQyYiEi,comment-id=000a0000000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-17T05:03:20.502+0000)\n>\n> And yet despite this, there were plenty of chances to dethrone League. \n\nI just got done telling you why that wouldn't happen despite the quality of any challenger.\n\nGo back and re-read it because you must not have understood it.\n\n\n> If you want to cement anything as League's success, it was never earnestly the gameplay. The gameplay was nice for people, sure, but it's not what truly made league shine. It's a combination of:\n...\n\nEverything you posted there was irrelevent to what you were responding to.\n\nTalking about why League was a success doesn't disprove what I said.  \n\n\"In light of these facts, it is actually a testiment to how good Dota's gameplay is that it did manage to achieve the second highest success by a huge margin compared with all other mobas. \"\n\nIn order to understand that statement, you must first go back and understand what I said about why no Moba had a chance of dethroning league no matter how high their quality was (Dota), or how broad you made their casual appeal (HotS).\n\n> League wasn&#x27;t simple, sure, but it had greatly less painful mechanics even with DOTA&#x27;s superior tutorial. \n\nYour comment doesn't disprove my point, and you left out the part of the quote that explains why your point is irrelevent:\n\n\"Your premise is wrong.\nYou overestimate how easy League is to get into. Both are just as archaic and bewlidering to a new player.\nDota has more depth, more to learn, but those issues won't matter or even be apparent to a new player. From a new player's perspective they are both equally confusing. \"\n\nLess painful mechanics don't matter as far as one game being more friendly to complete moba newbies. From their perspective, both games are equally puzzling. The fact that one will take longer to master is not something they would be capable of being aware of until they had significant experience in the game already. \n\n\n> Your point about HotS also misses the biggest factor to HotS&#x27;s lack of success: Time. \n\nI didn't miss it, your point just doesn't disprove anything I said. \n\nThe fact remains that in software and gaming, the first in to secure market share will be near impossible to dislodge as long as they keep delivering what the customers want. \n\nThe fact that the competition is already years behind in development time plays a factor in cementing the initial entry's lead. Pointing that out only proves my point, not disprove it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leto GT","date":"2018-06-17T14:53:18.397+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi so. Maybe my experience will help in that discussion. So, I've started like because a friend told me about it back in college. I started then at the end of season 2 I believe. It was not that difficult to get into because it was simple honestly. Clear itemization. Runes were simple and had not much impact on the game instead of helping you in the early stages of the game. You had 1 Drake and 1 nashor. The focus was way more on champion powerskipe themselves and there wasn't much powerskipe item whatsoever. You may say it seems being on paper but as a new player that was already a ton of information. Compare that to now. Imagine a newplayer now facing league. Herald, Nash, multiple drakes, scuttles, item powerspike, champion powerspike runes powerspike. When  I tried Dota,  I gave up immediately because I had no interest in putting that much effort to get at least to a basic level, it was just too much too complex and too snowbally. I preferred LOL for his simplicity. Right now, the new player friendliness that really appealed at first,  is a bit a thing of the past I believe. On top of that I would like to add that making a mistake was not as punishing as it is now. You may now just die in 1-trade two at best in most of the roles. So as a new player, it's tough. Even for a vet like me, I don't feel I can actually try new champion safely because I'll most probably end up feeding really hard. On these latter point, I believe league became similar to DOTA and that's a really bad thing because those points specifically drove me away from Dota back to league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-06-18T05:36:23.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"pfft, the difficulty honestly has little to do with dota's turn off\n\nit has a very steep learning curve and what really throws it off is a TERRIBLE user interface\n\ntry picking a card at random from a deck and guessing what that card will be..that's what dota's interface looked like...along with having a roster that you either had to explicitly  know the champion's name or scroll through 100+ champions in under 30 seconds","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Teemo Gromp","date":"2018-06-17T12:18:39.390+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CaptainMÃ¥rvelous,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WeQyYiEi,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2018-06-17T00:07:24.639+0000)\n>\n> Been a problem since day one my dude.\n> \n> Is League appealing to the casual moba crowd with a game balanced around the 99%? Is it a serious pro-game balanced around the best players? Is it an ability spam-fest? A slow, methodical game with little action until everyone is prepared?\n> \n> Riot wants to have their cake and eat it too, which is why we have problems that persist to this day. Casuals or pros, RTS fans or ARTS fans, etc.\n\nI am here since I think May 2010, not quite \"day one\", but back then, RIOT focussed totally NOT on eSports, but having a playerbase. The game was called \"CLASH OF FATES\" and that later dropped title was quite supported by the journal of justice and all the other nice story sidethings.\nWe (Germans) got ZenonTheStoics eMail address to report people manually, the game consisted of cheap recolour skins and I had to buy the DVD version from the store to get RP (because it was just credit card payment, which is unpopular in Europe/Germany) - I used the code on the backside of the game's manual to buy Firefighter Tristana^^ Whatever..\n\nThe games often lasted 40 minutes and a 3vs3 map could take also the same amount of time.\nIt felt really like RIOT was for the players. They often repeated to become the \"most player-focussed game company in the world\". But the Dreamhack success of 2011 (AFAIR) turned everything around. They tasted blood, and wanted more. The game really lost its focus to me in 2015. Suddenly, the matchmaking started to suck (and is still in this bad state -- compared to the really enjoyable games from 2010 it's obvious. How could the games go 40 minutes? Because of a working matchmaking) due to Flex queues and bullshit. RIOT turned into an ugly-ass monster that does not want  a quality, but flashy game. It's like Apple or Youtube. RIOT should've never sold their soul and invite known incompetence as Ghostcrawler. That's like Steve Jobs would be CEO of Microsoft in 1999 or Netscape allows Microsoft workers to work for them during the browser war. \n\nThe game now is not terrible, but a shaodw of its former self. The anime skins and all that immersion-breaking bullshit is grinding my cogs and apart from Bard and Ashe, I can not stand this game that is made for Asian spazzes* than the Western world. RIOT sold their soul, and did so even more when being a Tencent slave; a company that turns EVERYTHIGN into a cash-shop focussed grind game. Check their history and reputation...\n\nEDIT: Just in case. Look at things like \"Stickers\". And they are 350rp. RIOT needs to make money, eh? They are a business, huh? Yes, but those friggin little animations that take probably 1 day to create each... Nah. That's something that should be free. No new maps. Why? No map skins? Why? No new announcers. Why? PROFIT. PROFIT. PROFIT. The change of the IP is clearly to slow things down (and yes, it does). RIOT is huge and as long as they can invest 100,000s of US$ for eSports - something the regular PLAYER of the game does not care about, they are surely not in need to charge for \"happy kitten\" or \"be mad\" stickers. When I see Sailor Moon skins and hear their retarded SFX, see Arcade skins with fake 8-bit sounds and then \"bee mad\" stickers, I wonder if I play app store crap like CANDY CRUSH or a serious game from a billion dollar company.\n\n(*) I do not mean Asians are spazzes, but Asian gameplay is spastic to me. Button mashing all over. But you've gotta visit their internet cafes and gaming places, it really makes you crazy. Maybe you understand their gaming culture then. (Or just litsen to 90s Japanese Synthpop. It's like freestyle Jazz with electronic music in 180 bpm)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Krully","date":"2018-06-16T18:15:49.804+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"new game mode that is first team to x amount of gold","replies":[]},{"poster":"D4M2X0","date":"2018-06-17T10:00:53.605+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"i loved it when games could last up to an hour/sometimes longer cause a good player/teams could still stomp for a short win but with enough time the enemy team could make a comeback. now any old fool can just 1 click you before they even get fed dot dot dot","replies":[]},{"poster":"Seer of Mind","date":"2018-06-17T06:37:33.629+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Riot wants the game to be one that takes up to 30 mins or longer, they need to decrease damage across the board, but if they keep upping champion damage and lowering tower health like they just did, the game will only get shorter and shorter.
