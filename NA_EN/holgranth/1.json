There is no incentive for there to be diversity in the professional scene and every time there is the diversity is nerfed into nothingness. What a lot of us have noticed is that there is a certain group of champs that can simply avoid being changed for the better by the designers and ironically all of these champs stifle diversity, what we want in this game. \n\nThat said, a lot of diversity has also been slain because previous powerful champions (Kha'Zix, Elise, etc) have been gutted and are not viable nor in a good place despite what the designers say. Kha'Zix is a cockroach now and Elise is a harmless house spider. They are only two examples of how diversity has been flushed out by the playerbase as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-01-31T20:57:47.162+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think one problem is the fact that riot is too quick to nerf, and doesn't give the players any credit for developing counter strategies.
