Masteries, New items, Mass reworking of entire classes, removing Old Problem items and Champions. I may question HOW they are trying to do it, but I understand and love the direction they are trying to go.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThen there are the people in charge of Balance. Where to even begin? \r\n\r\nThe love of (and possible raging boner(s) and/or lady boner(s) for{{champion:64}}?\r\nThe Dumpstering and ignoring of an easily balanced, fun, interesting jungle champion with clear strengths and weaknesses?{{champion:14}} \r\nThe Dumpstering of {{champion:113}} who can barely clear jungle and cannot lane?\r\n\r\nLets Start with {{champion:14}} . Best rework EVER! Way to go design! He was OP with release Cinderhulk? Too Bad! Leave him completely gutted and barely able to jungle! Why? Because balance has more important things to worry about than balancing the game! It wouldn&#039;t even be hard to improve Sion&#039;s jungle without making him overpowered top, but the Balance team just ignore him. Similar problem occurs with {{champion:111}} he is briefly OP as a support, gets nerfed and gets left in the trash as a jungler.\r\n\r\nDoes Riot have the tools to balance these champions in the jungle? Absolutely! Why don&#039;t they? No idea!\r\n \r\nMeanwhile everything about {{champion:64}}  is completely contrary to EVERY new champion Riot releases. Every new champion has a niche, every rework tries to put old champions that were good at too many things into a new niche. {{champion:64}} is good at EVERYTHING. He has pretty much everything a jungler could ever want or need in one convenient kit.\r\n\r\nHaving a high skill ceiling is not an excuse, the bias towards {{champion:64}} is obvious, the Balance team is bias, the Esports casters are bias and the professional players are biased. Because of this bias {{champion:64}} warps the entire metagame further ensuring that diversity in the jungle remains a dream.\r\n\r\nHow about {{champion:113}} ? Beat to death alongside {{champion:14}} for the same reason! But it gets better:\r\n\r\n_&quot;We tend to let champions like Sejuani [who thrived close to a 60% win rate for a while], level off after we nerf them in some way. We&#039;re not intending to leave them to die and be forgotten, but in the interest of keeping the live environment fresh, we don&#039;t want to rebound and throw more buffs at her, since she only just stopped being picked so much. She&#039;ll be back -- we&#039;re just trying to let other champions have some time in the spotlight!&quot;\r\n\r\nRiot Time Wizard_\r\n\r\nSo {{champion:113}} is overpowered for 2 months and gets left in the dumpster indefinitely. {{champion:64}} warps the professional scene for years, is constantly played at all levels of play, oppresses the living hell out of anyone without a fast early clear and gets buffed the second he loses power in preseason? \r\n\r\nIt is time for Live Balance to stop living in season two.

Thing is, Lee has both of those things. His kit seems to let him coast into a nice peeling off-tank, but he still has a ton of damage and mobility and an ultimate that feels like getting hit by a truck and knocking over your allies like bowling pins.

The reason why Katarina's basic abilities are weak are that her entire kit is revolved around her ultimate and her passive, making her ultimate front-loaded with damage. Thus, comparing Katarina's QWE to Lee Sin's double Qs is also comparing apple to orange.\n\nA lot of things in your table aren't very objectively analyzed, for example Akali's 3Rs and Gunblade. Similar to Katarina, Akali doesn't deal a lot of damage with her ultimate because of the utility it brings and the fact that her rest of the kit already brings a crap load of damage and stealth. That is why when you try to differentiate the damage between Akali's 3Rs with Gunblade and Lee Sin's double Qs you are getting nowhere.\n\nEven if you try to objectively look at this there are still way too many things to consider. All champions gain armor per level, whilst a lot of champions do not gain magic resist per level, thus making their magic resist infinitely 30 unless they buy magic resist items, use magic resist runes and masteries. There are a lot of items in the game so why was Luden's Echo only considered in your calculations? Masteries also happen to turn the tide of the game too, further modifying the damage both Lee Sin and Katarina deal.\n\nTL:DR While I agree Lee SIn desperately needs changes to highlight his weaknesses and strengths, and nerf his late game power,  this table of yours doesn't seem to take everything into consideration in an objective manner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Governer","date":"2015-12-29T05:48:54.777+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":7,"body":"It is personal bias because you are ignoring what items the champions you compare will buy, etc...

I can't believe you are this dumb, and I'd like clarification on what you mean by this? My math is below. Please feel free to show your level 3 Kat vs level 9 Lee Sin math to clarify.\n\nSince you don't seem to be able to look up champions abilities and perform the check on the math before you blatantly call him out, I'll help you. I don't understand why you couldn't just glance at the numbers and his math to do simple addition in your head, but here goes.\n\nHere is Katarina's Q ability:\nBouncing Blades\nThrows a dagger dealing 60/85/110/135/**160** (**+0.45*AP**) magic damage. The dagger bounces to the 4 closest enemies dealing 10% less damage with each bounce. Enemies hit are marked for 4 seconds. Katarina's basic attacks or spells will consume the mark dealing 15/30/45/60/**75 **(**+0.15*AP**) additional magic damage.\n\n**Rank 5 is bolded. **\n\nSo, you claim her Q damage is varied. Well, he took care of that for you and calculated damage based on the highest amount. Look at the bold numbers. Those are the highest amounts you can do. Here is the math, with Q at rank 5:\n(160+75) + (.45AP + .15AP)\n235 + .6AP \n*Luden's has 100 AP, so .6 * 100 = 60\n235+60=**295**\n\nHere is a quote from Vekkna's calculation:\n \nQ (both hits): 235 + .6 AP = **295**\n\nHere is Lee Sin's Q ability:\nSonic Wave\nSonic Wave: Lee Sin projects a discordant wave of sound to locate his enemies, dealing 50/80/110/140/**170 **(**+0.9*Bonus AD**) physical damage to the first enemy it encounters. If Sonic Wave hits, Lee Sin can cast Resonating Strike for the next 3 seconds. Resonating Strike: Lee Sin dashes to the enemy hit by Sonic Wave, dealing 50/80/110/140/**170 **(**+0.9*Bonus AD**) physical damage plus 8% of their missing Health (Max: 400 Damage vs. Monsters).\n\n**Rank 5 is bolded.**\n\nSo, let's do this simple math again! Again, if Lee levels Q first, this is what it will look like.\n(170+170) + (.9 bAD + .9 bAD)\n340 + 1.8bAD \n*Warrior's has 60 AD. 1.8 * 60 = 108\n340+108 = **448**\n\nQuote from Vekkna:\nQ (both hits): 340 + 1.8 bAD = **448**\n\nIf you want to add in the bonus damage from Luden's, then look at the tooltip for the ability and do the math.\nUNIQUE: Gains charges upon moving or casting. At 100 charges, the next instance of ability damage you deal will expend all charges to deal 100 (+ 10% AP) bonus magic damage to the first enemy hit and summon up to 3 lesser bolts that target nearby enemies, prioritizing enemies damaged by the ability and champions over minions.\n100 + (100*.1)\n100 + 10 = 110 (with Luden's Echo only)\n295 (math from eariler, see above bolded) + 110 = 405\n\nFor Katarina, if you want to look at item damage in addition to her ability only damage, you would add 295 + 110. This is **405**, and it is still lower than Lee Sin's damage of 448.\n\n**TL;DR **\n**Lee Sin rank 5 Q damage with Warrior's = 448. \nKatarina rank 5 Q damage with Luden's = 295.\nKatarina rank 5 Q damage with Luden's, plus the Luden proc = 405.**\n\nPS: Math is not that hard.

Most people I run into just go full damage, be it jungle, mid, top, whatever, and just beat the hell out of everyone on the other team. I got interested in him for precisely this reason (also the reason I started playing Rumble), because I listened to the hype about how high a skill cap he has, so I was intimidated by even trying him out until I saw other people at my skill level playing him and doing well, so I though, \"If they can do it, so can I.\" As long as you can land your Sonic Wave (and how hard are skill shots, really?) you will do well on him, unless you go the hard route by building a sight stone and trying to use wards to make flashy plays, then most people will fail. So, played the fancy way, yes, Lee has a high skill cap, but played in the straightforward brawler/assassin style he is one of the easiest champs in the game.\n\nP.S. I got bored of him pretty quick as a result of his generic simplicity, but I still love Rumble and am glad I got over the intimidating hype that surrounded him at his peak (back when C9's Balls played him every game he could, ususally with a J4 or Elise in the jungle, and won every dragon fight except three, i think).","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-12-28T22:23:31.454+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't even need to go full damage.

There are times when a token change that the rest of us take in stride (such as J4 losing the passive armor from Demacian Standard or Draven losing the bleed passive in favor of Adoration stacks) that prompts LCS/challenger players to consider this once top tier champion now trash.
