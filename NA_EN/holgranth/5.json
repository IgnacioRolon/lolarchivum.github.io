This is what happens when you think that anything you slapped your brand on MUST be good *cough* {{champion:142}} *hack* *cough*. This is what happens when you ignore a large portion of your CURRENT audience and start chasing an audience you don&#039;t have in foreign climes. Then when you start getting volatile feedback from your current players talk down to them, belittle them and try your damnedest to control all criticism.\r\n\r\nThis year has not been a good year for Riot from a technical standpoint. Clash was the biggest letdown in League history and client stability issues were the worst since season 1-2. This has not been a great year for balance, the runes system made things more accessible at the cost of the stable framework the game had. It has been a terrible year for champion diversity at most levels of play. Every release since Zoe has had major balance issues. \r\n\r\nIt hasn&#039;t been as awful as some people on the boards would like to pretend but there has been significant pushback against recent releases for a reason. Pre-season seems to be addressing some of the biggest issues but 90% of it is fixing the untended consequences of previous Riot decisions. Decisions mostly made to try and make Esports &quot;more exciting&quot;. (Congratulations you not only kept the usual tiny pool of playable champions, after a year of snowball in regular games we got to watch three snowballed, 3-0 blowouts to round out pro play for the year.)","replies":[]}
