Played Dota All Stars and Footman Frenzy. Made Mods as a High Schooler and dreamed of being a Dev. Lurked on forums where Dev&#039;s posted. Started playing League on Nocturne patch. Kept up with LoL dev posts since S1. Seen lots of mistakes made and growing pains. After 5 years of playing together got engaged to someone I met on League. \n\nWatching the current development team is painful. I am totally unqualified to be a League Developer. I accept that. The best I ever did was a shitty custom mission for Team Apache. I feel like the current crop of Rioters are overconfident and believe their own hype. They keep making mistakes I made when I was making mods. Making changes without understanding why things are designed how they are. \n\nI am in Silver because I cannot be arsed to put in the time to sharpen my skills.\n\nI have been Silver for 6? Years now.\n\nI am not good enough to redesign the jungle.\n\nI am not good enough to design champions.\n\nBut I have watched, read and analyzed almost all the league related content the Developers have shared with players for almost a Decade. The mistakes being made right now are embarrassing. It&#039;s amateur hour at the incompetence factory.\n\nBack in season 1 through 3 Riot cranked out champions without taking enough time to properly design and test them. (Financial pressure during S1 &amp;2 was intense.) Zoe was a terrifying return to this pattern of terrible decision making. The first failure was at design. Don&#039;t blame CertainlyT, blame his fellow designers, blame everyone who didn&#039;t say &quot;no that is a bad idea,&quot;. Spread that blame like homemade jam on fresh bread, sink it into every bubble and fold.\n\nReleasing a Champion during Pre-Season is always risky and not worth. The Scheduling of Pre-Season has always been great for Rioters and frustrating for players. When you are a Dev dumping the Changes on live then going on vacation is great. Look at the data and make changes in the new year. Sucks to be a player dealing with an unbalanced mess over the holidays.\n\nZoe got &quot;tested&quot; during the runes overhaul. The testers failed to realize how powerful Q-Q-R was. The testers thought getting random teleport drops could ever work. The testers failed to even come close to doing their job.\n\nHuman nature is to ignore mistakes and hope they go away. Its what children do until they are taught to fix and learn from their mistakes. Riot left release Zoe in essentially the same spot for months with tiny meaningless nerfs. Only admitting she hadn&#039;t been properly tested and they hadn&#039;t reacted fast enough months later. Amateur hour. Basic shit. Thought we were past this five years ago.\n\nThe Jungle changes show clear lack of understanding of 8 years of changes to the Jungle. It is a repeat of mistakes from Season 2 onward. A proper overhaul of the Jungle requires a lot more than dicking around with Skuttle Crab and nerfing early XP. It requires a complex set of changes to XP across the entire game. It might require changes to the map, new monster types, changes to spawn times, a rework of the buff camps, new mechanics and item reworks. It takes time and thought and understanding to create a jungle that allows many different champions to thrive and unique play styles to emerge.\n\nPushing a narrow view of &quot;Jungle vs Jungle interactions,&quot; is disheartening. Jungle was more diverse and better back in Seasons 1 and 3 when there were less champions but more variety in play styles.\n\nI would go on about how blindly cranking out more champions is eroding balance and fun, but this is long enough. \n\nI still want to have a Nautilus and Nami on my wedding cake but now it will be a celebration of  how we met and the &quot;good old days&quot;, we&#039;ll have to find something new to symbolize a glorious future together.\n\n_Edit: This is harsher in tone than than I really was going for. I  forgave past mistakes because I trusted you to learn and do better I can't trust you guys to do that anymore. I just REALLY want to express to Rioters new and old just how much history this game has that they seem to be unaware of. Seeing the same mistakes for the 2nd or 3rd time is just disheartening. _","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-05-21T16:41:04.247+0000","up_votes":82,"down_votes":4,"body":"For a grumpy old man you speak a lot of sense.

The got a new lead dev, who then proceded to rape the game design because he either did not understand why heroes had been designed the way they were, or was consciously choosing to throw that out in favor of pursuing a goal contrary to the original game design. \n\nGbay was right about one thing in one of his videos - The death of most big games like this comes because the devs start ignoring what the players like and want from the game, barreling ahead to force the game in a new direction that fails to gain new players but only alienates the existing playerbase.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIi2oJiqO00\n\n\nThat's what killed HoTS for me. It went something like this:\n\n\"Hey, let's give effective AoE waveclear to every new warrior and assassin, and buff it on existing ones. Because players like blowing up lots of minions, it's fun and statisfying\".\n\nDon't you realize there is an entire class, the specialist, that was designed to have the best waveclear so they could be the class that manages the waves, sieges, defends against sieges, and generally handles the macro for the team?  \n\n\"No fucks are given. I don't want any of that macro shit in my game anyway. I want everyone deathballing over the forced map objectives all game long.\" \n\nThen what is the point of a specialist?\n\n\"We'll just change their class definition to be 'whatever doesn't fit in the other three classes'. Boom, done. Problem solved.\" \n\nBut, that still doesn't give us a reason to play the specialist. Because now they are just subpar damage dealers with random utility. Nobody actually needs their utility to win, in the same way they need a tank, DPS, or healer to win. \n\n\"While we're at it, let's nerf sieging ability in general and make everything more focused on the map objective than it already is. And let's make it so other classes can easily take merc camps too. \n\n\nThat was the point where I left and never looked back. They basically removed an entire class from the game. The class that was actually the funnest for me because it was the most strategic and macro oriented. \n\nA testament to their failure of vision is the fact that in 3 years they have released dozens of new heroes but only two new specialists. Turns out that defining the specialist as \"a dumping ground for whatever doesn't fit in the other three roles\" isn't a very effective framework for creative development. Or, maybe all the people who actually had creative talent on that team left a long time ago. It's a shame, because the HoTS specialists were some of the most unique and interesting MOBA heroes.\n\n\nOne of the reasons I like Jungle is also because I am more objective/splitpush/macro oriented. And Jungle has more freedom to do it than top lane does.

Also remember what happened to Skarner? he was fine but people were about how weak he was on the PBE and Riot actually buffed him, they had to get rid of the buff they gave him in a hotfix and Skarner came out just fine. PBE is not good for actual balance testing since MMR quality is horrendous there due to the limited amount of people on the servers  and being full of so many boosted people that play with people that have so much higher MMR (on the main servers) than they do and get carried to dumb ranks and MMR lvls that you just see them feed like crazy. Not to mention that people don't really play all that often there as opposed to the live servers to their MMR could be way lower (or higher if really lucky) than what it would be on the main servers","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cowgirl Ed","date":"2018-05-21T18:04:46.037+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":6,"body":"Dude congratz on getting married and all that stuff, but seriously DO NOT sponsor this game, DO NOT have that cake.\nThey don't deserve it, and we both know it.

Often times it seems that some of the changes we see do not look like they are thought through well enough in the sense that not all the major touch points have been revalidated or iterated on when making a change, or that the context for why certain things were set up the way that they have been in the past. If you do not have that entire architectural picture of the current state, any changes you introduce propagate a degree of risk. Sometimes that risk is acceptable and mitigatable as you might need to push out the change to get more data before fine tuning. What I do not find acceptable is pushing changes with risks that are either not well understood or not understood at all, as it results in playing a lot of catch up before it can be resolved.\n\nI would assume that having so much data coming in from the player base (both feedback on the forums and actual gameplay data) is a huge boon to quickly identifying and dismantling these risks and implementing fixes, but we don't always see that either.","replies":[{"poster":"Holgranth","date":"2018-05-22T18:11:19.535+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The stupidest decisions I have ever seen were made by very smart people with only some of the skills and information needed.

Jungle was more diverse and better back in Seasons 1 and 3 when there were less champions but more variety in play styles.\n\nI agree that pushing Jungle vs Jungle interaction is disheartening.  It's almost like laners are designing the jungle and they subconsciously think that the enemy jungler is their 'lane opponent'.  Because scuttle now feels like a way to 'punish' junglers that 'roam' to 'other lanes', lol.\n\nI think you may be right about RIOT's continued release of champions.  Don't get me wrong, I think it's great to release new champions with new ideas, but it seems evident that RIOT itself is not able to keep up with themselves ever since they broke the hundred champion limit.  It's like their ability to manage all the champions, in addition to all the other changes they make, has been spiraling out of control.  Just to be clear: I don't think it's a problem for players at all.  I definitely think the designers are unable to keep up with their own creations at this point.  And on top of that RIOT starting releasing very controversial designs for champions - things that they vetoed early on as bad ideas made it into the game because of the obsession with new champion release.\n\nLook, RIOT, if you can't keep up with your own designs, then you know you've made too many champions.  The litmus test on that was never on players; it always rested 100% on design team capabilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Holgranth","date":"2018-05-22T21:43:37.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very well said.

They release things as OP because OP sells. Who would buy zoe if she was released as, in current state. But when you see 1-shoting clips people run to get their hands on that champion, not because of lore or the looks or whatever, but because of being broken and OP.\n\n\n Sure there will be some people who get really hyped for a new champion because of other stuff than its utility or damage but if you compare them against those who want to play OP stuff, the number would be very low. The issue is money here, and sure there are way more greedier companies than Riot. I am not blaming Riot for trying to milk maximum, because in the end Riot is a company just like every other company.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eninya","date":"2018-05-22T10:27:00.713+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, maybe this was a bad time to end my four year hiatus.
