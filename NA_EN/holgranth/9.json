The utility is amazing, the price is reasonable, and it's the core of every victory and your contribution, but it doesn't feel good.\n\nThe support role has to buy sightstone. No other role has that as a mandatory feature, not even the jungler (who, in theory, can benefit from it. I know pros do that on occasion, but I don't watch much LCS). Even though the sightstone has multiple upgrades, it is *the* constant among the support class. Even the ADC class (granted, before the marksman rework it was basically IE rush and maybe BORK for Vayne/Twitch) has more building diversity. \n\nPart of the game is dynamic builds. Cookie cutter builds aren't always the best way to play the game, and some of the strategy is in counterbuilding your opponent. As the lowest income class, rushing my first 800 lane gold into sightstone doesn't \"feel\" fun. \n\nAnother factor that contributes to my feeling is a bit of spite, and how I feel that the game's state shouldn't be at a point where sightstone is *needed.* Vision should be 20/20/20/20/20, but a lot of the time I feel like it's 15/20/10/5/45. \n\nANother thing that makes me feel a bit spiteful is that people will report you for not buying sightstone, but it takes huge amounts of effort to get them to buy a pink ward, and for some people to even use their trinket. No joke, I've had people force me to buy sightstone on a bad day (normals, mind you) but put down three wards themselves in one game.\n\nNow, this is only how I feel. How I feel and how I act are two different things, and I highly doubt that most support mains feel this way. I want my role to be defined by the champions, not a single iconic item to the point that several memes, campaigns, and wallpapers represent the support role with a ward. \n\nAgain, this is just my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"VoidStaresBack","date":"2016-08-30T12:35:58.623+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a very well-thought out answer, and it's nice to see the opposite side of things from a fellow support main.  I view this issue slightly differently, though, and in this case I think it's mostly just a difference in playstyle more than anything.\n\nI absolutely think that the support isn't just there to ward shit you're too lazy for.  As a Soraka main, I'm far too unsafe and squishy to be placing wards anywhere the enemy might be at the moment, because if I get caught out on my own it's an easy kill for the enemy unless they fuck up.  I expect my team to ward as much as they can and often ping bushes when my trinket is down/sightstone is empty to ask one of my allies to ward it.  That being said, in the end, I play support not to do damage and carry the game myself, but to help my allies carry the game.  I'm already building a lot of utility items to assist my team, so why not build one that helps them in less tangible, but equally important ways.  On top of which, Ruby Sightstone synergizes well with my typical support builds, so why not buy it?\n\nDo I think people rely too much on their support for vision at the moment and are too uptight about supports not buying sightstone?  Absolutely.  The trinkets were introduced to give you a nice way to ward your lane and place wards throughout the game, and you should take advantage of this nice resource you're given as much as possible.  But at the same time, when push comes to shove I'm the one who can most afford to be caught out, most afford to miss a skirmish, and most afford to be gone for a little while, so I'm going to carry more of the warding duties on myself because of it.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2016-08-31T01:00:51.113+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">As a Soraka main, I'm far too unsafe and squishy to be placing wards anywhere the enemy might be at the moment, because if I get caught out on my own it's an easy kill for the enemy unless they fuck up.\n\nYou know, this reminds me of something: I really hope Rito eventually takes Bard's concept and try to improve that fantasy, and make a support champion designed to scout and interact with vision (which some ADC's do, like Quinn and Kalista) while sacrificing damage, cc, and/or other utility to do so.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2016-08-30T07:42:44.154+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I feel that the game's state shouldn't be at a point where sightstone is needed.\n\nI could not agree more. It would be so nice if vision wasn't a needed thing, more like something that you can get for strategy, at the very least get it to where anyone can be the designated warder and you pick who that will be based on strategy rather that \"Who needs damage the least\". \nI just came up with an idea for ward boots that I think would solve a lot of issues (if not raise a few at the same time), but at the end of the day it wouldn't make vision LESS necessary, just make free vision available to everyone without sacrificing other items (aside from boots of course).\n\n>ANother thing that makes me feel a bit spiteful is that people will report you for not buying sightstone\n\nThis is one of my biggest issues with the ward/support issue. It pretty much enforces the idea of \"if support doesn't take sightstone, report them\". You don't have that issue with ADC, Top or Mid. You might have that issue with Jungle, but that can just be an honest mistake if they forget to take {{summoner:11}}.

Back then, it was basically a sightstone without the HP and free to purchase right at the start of the game. And for some reason, Riot thought that it was a _bad_ thing when supports could just pick up their trinket and forgo a sightstone.\n\nHere's my solution. Remove sightstone from the game, buff the yellow trinket to cover for it's loss.\n\nYes, the yellow trinket might crowd out the other alternatives, but that's a much better (and more easily fixable) problem to have than supports feeling forced to buy an item they don't feel good buying.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-08-31T15:13:18.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The support role has to buy sightstone.

As a Support, you basically always spend your first 1300g for Gold item tier 2 + Sightstone, but an ADC basically always spend it on a BF Sword, and a Jungler on Jungler's item tier 2 + enchant. \n\nI won't lie, build diversity for Supports is bad, but it's more an issue of having less total gold and being almost forced to buy Gold item + Stone + Aegis than just the Stone in itself and the fact you're responsible for Vision.

Damage isn't 20/20/20/20/20 either, and Tanking isn't an equal share either. The problem is, dealing damage is *fun* (or at least, *seen* as more fun by a large part of the community) so the people responsible for more than 20% of the damage don't complain, and hoard all the glory, but no single task in this game is equally shared by all players.

Soraka, with equal AP, will never deal as much damage as Karthus, but Karthus will never heal as much as Soraka. That's a given, that's champion design diversity.\n\nVision, on the other hand, has the capability of being *close* to 20/20/20/20/20, but Riot's not really pushing it beyond the trinkets.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-08-31T16:35:53.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're missing my point, it's not a question of kits being better suited for one thing or the other, it's a question of roles in a team being clearly separated: you wouldn't want a team full of Assassins without any DPS champ.

Of course, Riot could push for Vision being a shared task, just as they could push for durability being more homogeneous among different champs, but why Vision should be treated as a different thing than all other tasks?","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2016-08-31T17:01:10.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">but why Vision should be treated as a different thing than all other tasks?\n\nBecause supports should be defined by their utility: the heals, shields, the crowd control. The the other classes can do some of that, but the supports are defined by their utility. \n\nIf sightstone was deleted, hypothetically, vision would be a shared task and supports would still have their dedicated spot on the team. Every class has its defensive, offensive, and sometimes hybrid/dueling items, and I really, personally feel that there should be vision items for every class akin to the trinket. Sightstone is a godsend, but I really feel that vision should be looked into a bit more.

Sightstone is expected from the Support position, not from the supportive classes of champions. A Nautilus support is expected to build a Sightstone, a Nautilus top isn't. Same for Annie mid versus sup. The other way around, a Lulu/Morgana going mid isn't a \"Support\", and isn't expected to build a Sightstone. So Support as a position isn't at all defined by heal/shield/CC. The definition of Support (as a position) is, literally, it's not a joke, \"the guy without gold\".\n\nThe second one is much more subjective: I really think that Vision should be a specialized task that is assigned (mostly) to a single player. Of course you can disagree with that, and then there is no point going further, but if you agree that it makes sense to give this responsibility to a single person, then it's logical to give it to \"the guy without gold\". He's not expected to build a lot of selfish items and to fill his inventory anyway (he doesn't have the income to afford it), so he can put a little gold in a very non-slot efficient item that will help the team more than him directly.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2016-08-31T17:52:31.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">So Support as a position isn't at all defined by heal/shield/CC.

Even if they did remove them from SR, they would likely still be available on other maps since wards don't exist in ARAM (and maybe TT) anyway.\nBut that's neither here nor there. \nThe fact is that Riot is going to be reworking vision and the \"support ecosystem\" (whatever that means) and no one knows what they are planning. I'd just like it if this topic could at least take a break till we know what exactly Riot is planning to do since it could range from a slight vision change, vision becoming a whole new mechanic, changing how the fog of war works, or even everyone having a {{item:2049}} option.

I could bully my laner, while keeping almost perfect vision so i could not get ganged. For 225 gold. FOW could be turned off and make no difference, It was discusting. \n\nIt is not that SS is only for supports. Its the role that makes it a lot better to build. You have 4 sources of income (3 lanes and a jungle) and its better to consentrate the gold rather than distributing. So the one that gets the stick has to build the utility in the team. Thats the support. Not having a SS in the team is a massive disadvandage. Thats why it is the smartest and most efficient for support to build it. Think about it. Does it worth taking of 800 gold from your midlaner so you have your AP item faster? He will be a lot ahead on the gold so whats the point? Those are 40 cs you are denying him. Unless Rito implements a 5th income source, someone has to play low eco and the utility. Not doing otherwise is hampering the team.\n\nAs for the support items. Eye upgrades are for supports that need to rush other items. A good example is Zyra (I cringe at Zyras with FQC with no reason). She needs both her pen items to apmlify her great base damage. But all depends on the game. FQC is when your team needs picks and a long range slow helps a lot with that. FotM is to help adcs with Assasins and when locket is not enouph. Talisman is a mini Sivir ult, i rarely have gone the other way around, thats one of the most powerful item actives (and def most underated) in the game. That is along with Ruby which has become a lot better with active item CDR. 4th ward is valuable but yea could make it have some sort of ward regen. As for the jungler item, i prefer it when i dont really need the other 2. Extra vision is golden.\n\nLast but not least. Not having a SS in the team, puts the team at a great disadvandage. I have personally punished supports that skiped SS, and i dont think they understood what happened. Get deep vision, get picks. When tower falls, if i see no SS, i call for repeat gangs on the bot. Objectives become a lot easier, warding deep also. And i have build SS on adc at 20m when my support didnt pick it. Because i could not push at all a winning lane.
