The reason that I think that would be true is that for a high AD character with lifesteal, resistances provide a much more gold efficient path to effective heath.","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-08-11T13:45:37.530+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"which is why every single adc builds {{item:3156}}  right?\n\nI get the theory, but until you rework ad items (and crit in general) adc's are just gonna go for the most optimal dps output and ignore most else unless they are against a really ap/ad heavy team comp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FalconPawwwwnch","date":"2015-08-11T06:09:16.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough, but why can't you make an AD/armor item like Titanic Hydra?
