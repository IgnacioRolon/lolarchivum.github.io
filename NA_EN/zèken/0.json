Typically, forced shutdown while gaming can be traced back to overheating. Your pc notices something is wrong that it can't fix, and they all have that feature built in to shut off before it can cause a house fire! You mentioned that you used overheat protection in the last game and the message never popped, does that mean you were able to play normally?\n\nIf you're still having your pc shut off randomly like that, I'd really suggest checking that temp a little closer to be sure if that's what is causing it. If so, hit our tech guys up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they may be able to help you figure something out to get you running smoothly again.","replies":[]}]}
