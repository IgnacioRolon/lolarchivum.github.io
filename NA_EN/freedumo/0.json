It is an automatic detection system.  It does not required any report to work.  If someone goes afk, he will be reviewed by LB.  If he has a record of frequently leaving games, he will be punished according to the LB punishment ladder whether he is reported or not.  LeaveBuster is probably the more reliable system in regard to punishing someone over the IFS and feederbuster.\n\n> Basically I got tilted at the end of the game and after LITERALLY EVERYONE LEFT THE GAME I went off... And I got banned for it. SOMEHING THAT NO ONE SAW AND THAT BOTHERED NOBODY. I believe this to be ridiculous and that I should have my bank repealed.\n\nChat related punishment is handled by the IFS, Instant Feedback System.  This system required user report (unlike LeaveBuster) to work.  If no one reported you, you will never get reviewed by the IFS and you will never be punished.  If everyone already left before you unleashed your vent, then who would report you?  You must had done something or said something either during the game or in pre- or post-game where there are people who had to read it and something toxic enough that they feel compelled to report you.\n\nIf you want further discussion, you will need to post your unedited, complete chat log of all games in your report card.\nIf you want to appeal the punishment, feel free to submit a support ticket https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fegone","date":"2018-12-24T07:39:27.242+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nope, you were toxic, you got reported, you got banned.\nIf nobody saw it, then why even type it in chat?\nType it in notepad if that kind of shit makes you feel better, but don't complain when you get busted.","replies":[{"poster":"Farkinob","date":"2018-12-24T08:38:49.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm crying I'm laughing so hard","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-12-25T16:19:17.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not gonna bother with you unless you post chat logs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Farkinob","date":"2018-12-24T08:37:32.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> LITERALLY EVERYONE LEFT THE GAME\n\nSo all 9 players left the game, you did a naughty naughty that nobody saw, and you went off in chat with all 9 players not being able to read it since they were AFK?\n\nYea.... right.....\n\nand you should have your bank repealed?
