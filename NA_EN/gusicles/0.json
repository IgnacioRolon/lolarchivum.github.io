Nautilus has a grab-closer. It doesn't grab people, it puts him and an enemy midway through so that he can act as a wall to protect his team, with his area of effect slow and conditional root.\n\nThat's what Nautilus is designed to be ; he's an immovable object on the field of justice who slows down the pace of the game around him.\n\nAnd \"Lee Sin levels of damage ?\" F you. Lee sin has 90% AD ratio on his Q, 100% on his E, **200% on his R with 600 base damage, which deals full damage to multiple targets**. The best ratio Nautilus has is 80% on his ult.","replies":[{"poster":"yay nibbers","date":"2016-03-04T19:16:24.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Here's a relatively short comparison of Lee Sin and Nautilus,  (**TL;DR at the bottom**). But first, to clarify:\n**Lee Sin scales with _BONUS_ AD, not just 90% of his total AD.** There's a big difference there. Having _**BONUS**_ AD scaling means he must *build damage items* to get any extra damage on them, and has to build multiple damage items to get significant extra damage.\n\nNautilus's isn't made to scale too well with damage items, but he has high base damages on his basic abilities to compensate (on top of having insane CC). Every single one of Nautilus's basic abilities have a higher base damage than any of Lee Sins while at the same time being much better at locking a target down. Even his shield is better than Lee Sins, as while it doesn't have as high bases, it scales with *max* HP and also gives him a DOT on auto attacks which does a pretty decent amount of damage per second. \n\nTo compare their ults, Lee Sin's is a single target *melee range* kick that freezes him in place while performing it, Nautilus's ult is a *targeted* ranged abilitiy that follows the target around, knocking them up and anyone along the way, with an added second of stun on the main target after the 1 second knockup finishes. This knockup also keeps them in place where Lee Sin's sends them flying (possibly to the detriment of his team if they screw it up). There's huge differences between these two ults which make them hard to compare, but put simply, one is damage focused while the other is CC focused and much more reliable at that.\n---\nIn short, Nautilus can build full tank and still do good damage early and okay damage late while providing amazing CC all game. Lee Sin either builds full tank and provides _okay_ CC with mediocre damage, builds full damage and does a lot of damage if he doesn't get blown up, or builds tanky bruiser and does good damage early and decent/okay damage late with _okay_ CC.\nNautilus is a reliable CC heavy tank that currently does more damage than he probably ought considering all that CC be brings to the table, while Lee Sin is an assassin/fighter that must choose between living long enough to provide his team with one hard CC or doing a lot of damage and being useful that way. Nautilus is reliable while Lee Sin really just isn't.\n\nAll of this can apply when comparing Nautilus to just about any other top laner as well. Nautilus is tanky and loaded with CC while also painful to his enemies. He's pretty much _the_ tank to play right now.","replies":[{"poster":"BIAKaboose","date":"2016-03-05T00:44:13.800+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean sure, Lee's ult is melee range, but Lee will also always have multiple dashes on a lower CD than Nautilus even if Naut hits a wall to gap close on people forfeiting damage in the process. Nautilus's ult also has a brief channel time, just like Lee's ult, so that's not something Nautilus has over him either.\n\nNautilus has not necessarily crap scalings, but not good scalings compared to Lee, which is actually comparable since Nautilus doesn't just get AP for free, and even bruiser style Lee gets some amount of damage, much how a laning Nautilus will get at least a RoA or Abyssal, Lee just has better scaling across the board, his displacement also has a lot of picking power, similar to Nautilus's lockdown, but Nautilus needs his whole kit, Lee can just ward hop and ult and have his shield back up again before most teams will respond, apart from Riptide Nautilus has rather lengthy cooldowns. Lee's second Q activation is also an execute, so he does get some free damage there, though it isn't too much to write home about.\n\nI understand that Nautilus recently has been a cheese-bot whether it be support, top lane, or even a few times mid lane, but nerfing him across the board also makes him less likely to be jungling when that was the role he was designed for in the first place, and why his base damages were so good, so he could show up, CC people and feed the lanes while having a tanky (and therefore cheap) build. People will always abuse what is out of line, and Riot has a habit of nerfing what is good until it is worse than something else and then that something else steps up as being the new OP thing.\n\nTl;Dr you're right about a lot of it, but not entirely correct, just adding clarification and general bitching at the end over balancing patterns by Riot.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Spacesuit Spiff","date":"2016-03-04T01:41:55.191+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would actually be kinda surprised if he needed it, and i main naut jg/sup.
