Over the last 2 days I've downloaded LoL 3 times, because every time i close down LoL it wont open it won't open again. This sucks because I've been planning to get some new skins with extra money I have, but need to wait 3 hours because I'll have to download the game again. So if you believe its my computer or wifi, then let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-15T17:38:43.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may not be an issue with the download, but settings with your OS that may be blocking the patcher from opening.  Without permissions it can't launch, so I recommend running through the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to allow league as an exception.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"imfezzy","date":"2017-08-15T17:48:20.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the help.
