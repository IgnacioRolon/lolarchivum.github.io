If you get a support or a tank on your team that does their job really well, you DO notice it and they&#x27;ll go something like 2/0/14\n\nYou do realise tanks and supports are more likely to die from \"grand\" reasons, such as a suicide charge into the middle of enemy team and soak their damage before potentially dying from it so that their other teammates can get their happy triple-kill, or that they may cut the losses by intentionally diverging the enemy attention after an unsuccessful teamfight so that they will die alone but save their other teammates.\n\nA successful tank is someone who can get the enemy attention; so if you actually die, chances are you've already exhausted all their CCs and bursts, and you ARE a successful tank even if you have 1 more death count. A successful support player is to put everyone on the team before themselves.\n\nHence tank and support players are more likely to have the kind of \"now go\" mentality when playing, whereas damage players are more likely to run towards their teammates if things go south, they are trained to act that way due to how their roles demand them to.\n\nWith this in mind, it's nothing but naive to assume that \" If you get a support or a tank on your team that does their job really well, you DO notice it and they'll go something like 2/0/14\". Because you know tanks and supports don't live inside a vacuum, many times tanks and supports have to die for that optimal outcome. Unlike damage dealers where their teamplay stops at doing enough damage and being self-aware enough, tanks and supports are supposed to look after the entire team and their objectives, because they're the initiators and field controllers; as such death means less on them than say the damage dealers, they only need to live long enough to engage and negate the enemy threats, unlike damage dealers who need to survive to do the damage.\n\nIn other words, it's unreasonable to assume that good tanks and supports will go 2/0/14 or something, because kda is never a big part in their existence. And thus the metric is not valid.\n\nNot to mention, do you seriously think that people actually notice that 1 successful team-ulti in the game? Serious? Because last time I checked, people are more likely to notice that guy who got a triple rather than that other guy who's set up everything.","replies":[{"poster":"Kha Trix","date":"2017-06-14T16:33:30.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Not to mention, do you seriously think that people actually notice that 1 successful team-ulti in the game?

People will most likely say \"Nice triple\" instead of \"great ulti Ezreal\". So I shutdown a 17/2/9 Syndra with ult. No? No \"thank you\" Ezreal? Okay, I get it. -A few moments later- *TRIPLE KILL!* *ACE!*  \"... No? No *nice one Ezreal*? Huh.\"  -Tries to predict enemy place and misses by an inch..-  \"GODDAMN IT EZREAL, WTF WAS THAT ULT?\"   \n... I'd go toxic for this if it weren't for the new honor system.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-14T15:42:32.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That doesn't benefit the ones that, lets say...\n\nEngage a teamfight with perfect... at the cost of his life he gets your team 4 kills but the adc gets a quadra.\n\nNo one will notice that the tank/support engaged that perfectly set up play.\n\n\nThat goes harder for lower elos too, where kda matters most to them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sheldonbunny","date":"2017-06-14T15:32:51.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Azir Chroma,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=iMPfE4vU,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-06-14T15:04:58.542+0000)\n>\n> Uh, no.

In reality it depends on the type of person. Some will definitely notice. Others simply won't care and still go for carries. Which will be the majority we'll have to find out.\n\nPersonally I find it unfair because we've all had certain games where every person on the team pulled their weight. Riot wants a team game but then doesn't want to reward people for acting as one. Trying  to emulate  Overwatch or any other game with this system does not necessarily make it the best option.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dragfin","date":"2017-06-14T16:10:12.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Matt58754,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=iMPfE4vU,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-06-14T15:02:44.527+0000)\n>\n> The new honor system has one major flaw that makes it terrible.

That is the only flaw in this whole game. Players who are not ignorant will honor the right people. Ignorant players will not. It's that simple.","replies":[]}]}
