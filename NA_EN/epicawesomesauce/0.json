When I return to {{champion:202}} still backing, however, all of the audio for the recall animation would be off. The gunshots, the music, everything. Perhaps you peeps could look into this? \n\nI&#039;m not sure if this effects the Classic skin or not. Will test this later. (EDIT: This ALSO effects his Classic skin. Will update title to reflect this.)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-09T22:02:05.857+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya EpicAwesomesauce! \n\nThanks for the report!
