Unless that player is on your team, do you take the risk that they could have queued on the enemy team, or use the ban for champions who counter you? I personally ban a champ who carried either team last game on the off chance they are in the next game. Just wondering for your opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Unreformed Shaco","date":"2017-02-12T15:34:04.372+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ban Xerath sometimes cause he tilts me","replies":[{"poster":"Yalathanil","date":"2017-02-13T01:49:02.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"...he tilts me.\" Don't you mean \"...he _pokes me over and over, then fires massive orbs of magic as I flee.

If they happen to main that champ and had a good game it would have been a good ban, however they could also get cocky from how well they did the previous game and end up giving up early kills for free by going to aggressive on an opponent who isn't nearly as bad as their previous one was. \nIn anything below diamond really, no one is actually \"good\". There are just people who have good games, and more often than not that comes as a result of either an awful opponent or a small bit of luck in early game (and by luck I mean a won all-in where they survive with <10hp). \n\nIf the player doesn't belong in that elo (e.g. they're a smurf) they probably know it and play someone different every game. Which means they weren't going to play that champion again anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Yalathanil","date":"2017-02-13T01:46:43.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"true.
