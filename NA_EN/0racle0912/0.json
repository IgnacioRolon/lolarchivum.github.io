None seemed to work, so I tried to uninstall my client, then reinstall but now after reinstalling, my client is stuck on [this](https://i.imgur.com/w20lsOA.png?1) and when completed after a very long time, it will say repair failed. This has happened several times now, even after trying to repeat the initial steps again.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-21T16:43:13.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, sorry to hear you're still having issues here.  :(  The issue sounds like more security setting issues, which would best be solved with the steps in our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide similarly to your last post.
