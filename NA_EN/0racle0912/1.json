Please try again in 24 hours\". I just bought some RP like 10 mins ago and it worked fine, I'm not sure what it's referring to here.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-27T02:21:06.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're getting that message now it likely means you've either tried and failed too many times, already purchased the limit for a days period, or a combination of the two. At this point, you'll need to wait **the full 24 hours** before trying at all or you can increase the timer. Sit tight, wait a day and a half or 2 just to be safe, and you'll be able to make those purchases again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"0racle0912","date":"2017-11-27T13:21:03.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright thanks","replies":[]}]}
