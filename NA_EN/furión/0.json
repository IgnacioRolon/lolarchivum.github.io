Any solutions? also every 3rd game i get a bugsplat. atm im using hextech repair client to reinstall to see if it helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-31T05:03:36.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It almost sounds like you might be having problems with something called packet loss.

Since there wasn't really any packet loss in that trace something else might be impacting your games to make it feel sluggish. You mentioned having reinstalled using the hextech repair tool as support requested, and it looks like you've been working with a tech agent in a ticket. Keep talking with them, and they'll be able to look into your net logs and such a lot closer than I can here on the boards and figure out what's going on!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"THEBlGPP","date":"2018-01-31T05:10:33.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=B0sENtRm,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-01-31T05:03:36.863+0000)\n>\n> It almost sounds like you might be having problems with something called packet loss.
