His bio was so good, I loved it.\nSecond I'm jealousos of you, Riot senpai should have noticed my talent! \n\nJokes apart, since I'm talking with the writer himself, I will tell you the points that I most loved in the bio. I really liked it!\n> A master of ancient, forbidden sorcery, Vladimir is among the oldest enigmas of Noxus. He was present at the dawn of the empire, and has since woven his influence deep into its foundations… but he remembers little of those days. His mind is mortal, and so most of his unnaturally extended life endures not in his memory, but in his chronicles. \n\nI really loved the fact that he cant remember everything he went though. I can imagine Vladmir hearing tales about himself, trying to remember it himself, but encountering a limitation that, even after all this time with godly powers, still remember hims that he is just a human using the powers of gods. This also give him a reason to be more public than some people want him to be, I really doubt that Vladmir want to forgert his previous lives, he want his tales to be told, so that he can hear the tales himself. \nI alsoliked how the entire bio mentions that blood magic is forbidden, terrifting and dark. Just like Vladimir.\n> History has lost track of Vladimir on many occasions, though its pages are littered with figures suspected to have been him. Legend once told of a prince in a kingdom threatened by the infamous darkin, as their great war spilled into Valoran. With his father’s crown at stake, and many more heirs ahead of him in the line of succession, the unfortunate youth was traded to the fallen god-warriors as a hostage.\n\nI like how Vladmir can just dissaperas whenever he wants. He isnt always present, but when he is, its because he will do something really important - at least after time left him wiser, as it was said in Art is Life:\n> “The paintings around you are moments of my many lives. Not all great moments, I have come to realize, and captured by journeymen for the most part. In the earliest days of my existence I was arrogant enough to believe my every deed was worthy of such commemoration, but now…”\n> \n> “But now?” asked Maura, when he didn’t continue.\n> \n> “Now I only commit the renewal of my life to canvas amid events that mark turning points in the affairs of the world...\n\nWhen Vladmir is there, he is a figure important enough to be in the pages of history. As I mentioned before, I believe that he wishes it.\n\nI also like how his early life made him feel fragile and maybe even _inferior_ than others. He was a royal, but never would receive the throne, in truth, his position lead him to be nothing but a product to be traded.\nIsnt it ironic what this unlucky boy would turn in?\n> Mortals were little more than cattle under the tyranny of the darkin, their supremacy apparent in the sorceries they had conceived—the arts of crafting flesh and transmuting blood, granting them mastery over life itself. \n \nAgain, everything told him that he was lesser than others.\nThis description of blood magic was incredibly good, the \"mastery over life itself\" gives a big imapct in the reader, it leaves clear the potential of such magic.\n> Believing himself above other mortal vassals, and therefore worthy of such power, Vladimir was the first of his kind permitted to study this terrifying magic. His devotion earned him a place of favor in his patron’s warhost, and the right to practice hemomancy and enforce the darkin’s will on lesser beings. Over time, the god-warrior watched with amusement as Vladimir came to govern his subjects with as little mercy as the darkin themselves. \n\nThen, for the first time in his entire life, Vladmir finally was able to feel superioty. A boy humilated all his life he recieved power, power that was his by right of _blood_. And well, Vlad loved it, he embraced the work without any mercy, and it wasnt just the work that made him superior but the also his mastery over magic never used by men before, at this time his arrongace probally was at the top. \nI believe that this mark the beggining of the build-up of his personality, its when the tale of an unlucky prince ends and the legend of the monster begins.\n> The fall of these cruel tyrants is, likewise, the stuff of legend. An account of it, written in the dead High Shuriman language, is kept hidden within the Immortal Bastion. It speculates that Vladimir’s master was not imprisoned like so many of his kin, but instead died at the hands of his own warhost. The few surviving mortals fled, taking what knowledge they had of blood magic with them.\n\nWell not so much here, just historical information. Though, the legend bit is nice, since it concur with the first line of his lore. \n> Unknown to all but Vladimir himself, it was he who struck the killing blow. Scarred, blinded, driven mad by the radiance of a darkin’s undoing, he absorbed enough power to renew flesh that was never meant to last beyond a mortal lifespan.\n> \n> And he has done this countless times since, through rituals too vile to speak of.\n\nI'm kinda confused by what happened when the Darkin died, Twilight of the Gods mentions celestial energies fleeing the corpse of a dead Ascended, but I didnt think it could hurt or \"blind\"(not sure if it was literal or no) a human.\nThe line saying that his rituals are too vile to speak of is really good, I like every mention of how his magic is dark and malicious. IMO blood magic being this terrifying and horrible type of magic is a core part of his caracther.\n> At the height of Mordekaiser’s dark reign, it was said that a mythic and bloodthirsty fiend haunted the coastal cliffs of eastern Valoran, demanding young lives and savage worship from the local tribes. Few were welcome in his lair, until the day a pale sorceress approached this barbarian god with an offer. The two feasted together as equals, weaving magic so dark that the wine at their table soured, and the roses withered, vibrant red turning to black.\n\nThis. Last. Line. Is. Gold. \nEven though after all the dark things Vladimir made, even if his magic is so horrible and dark, even if he corrupts life itself. LB is an equal to him.\nEven if it isnt because of Le Blanc herself, this line fits her so much, and it has a vague mention of the Black Rose.\nI loved this line seriously, wonderfull caractherization with few words(if we not count the words describing Vladimir's magic).\n\nIt can also be seen that even after so many time passed since Vladimir was only a unlucky prince, his desire of superioty still there, even though his previous work and this new way of \"being above\" are really different.\n> Thus began the pact between Vladimir and LeBlanc, rife with disputes, and games of politics and war. Over the centuries, others joined them—powerful nobles, exalted masters of magic, and beings darker still. This cabal grew into the hidden power that would guide the throne of Noxus for more than a thousand years, orchestrating many of the empire’s most ambitious campaigns.\n\nI find this \"dispute\" and \"games\" thing interesting. So are they like Swain and LB, just...a bit more friendly...you know, without send an assassin to fuck up one of your campaigns and try to kill you.\nAlso \"darker beings still\"? HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM\nTbh, I didnt like the idea of Vladimir being part of the Black Rose at first, but the description given in the story made me more interested.\n> Uniquely among the leaders of the Black Rose, Vladimir has rarely limited himself to scheming from the shadows. In the past, he deigned to join the Noxian noble courts during the most interesting of times, only to fade into seclusion decades later, his extreme age—and the atrocities his sorcery could wreak—a well-kept secret. Even so, under Vladimir’s tutelage, the art of hemomancy has found a place in the military of Noxus, and among scions of the old aristocracy. Among these diverse practitioners is the Crimson Circle, a youthful cult dedicated as much to Vladimir’s personality as to blood magic itself. \n\nThis reinforces hwta I said before about Vladimir wanting tales to be told about him and appearing only to do something big.\nI liked how his cult is _really_ dedicated to blood magic, really cool.\n> With the death of the previous Grand General and the rise of Jericho Swain, the political landscape of the empire changed dramatically, and Vladimir has been forced to rouse himself once more. \n\nThe using of \"forced\" kinda bother me. To me, Vladimir would find extremly exciting the idea of a new Noxus, the changes can bring much more fun after all cant it?\n> Wearing the guise of a benevolent socialite, he has returned to the public eye as a vocal opponent of the ruling Trifarix council… much to the concern of more cautious members of the Black Rose. Indeed, his reappearance may have come too soon, as time has not yet washed away all the stains of his previous lifetime, and it seems likely that Swain himself has begun to grasp Vladimir’s true nature. \n\nThis paragraph really fits with Art is Life, this story kinda gives more context to why Vladimir comportament seems so \"flawed\".\n> As a new and darker conflict approaches Noxus, Vladimir drinks deeply from the renewed vitality of the empire, reminding himself of his past glories. To him, this life is a mere revelry, a masquerade spanning centuries, and the prologue to greatness—for though the darkin eventually fought amongst themselves and lost their immortal grip on the world, Vladimir knows he is strongest alone. \n\nFirst, _**the teases**_.\nSecond, I like his independence, his servitude was only the beggining, he doesnt have master anymore.\n\nAnd well, I think that's it, I really liked the writing, congralutions ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2018-10-25T23:18:17.576+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!

Vlad is running Noxus from behind the scenes and is controlling life and death at least within his castle, if not also outside it, and seems totally aware all the time.  He consumes artists and turns them into paintings.  And he wants to take Noxus for himself.","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2018-10-26T17:18:06.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh, honey... sweet summer child... baby...","replies":[{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-10-26T18:37:10.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I read his bio and not the short story.

I expected her death since the beginning, I was actually surprised he let her even in. He was kind and open, it made him a lot less monstrous. Maybe he is not terribly malicious after all? With what I have read, I would choose Vladimir over LeBlanc in blink of an eye.\n\nVladimir's personality, I believe, is fairly heavily influenced by vampire myths (like Dracula, among others). He was sweet talking Maura, giving the illusion of kindness and making her trust him. He was likely so open with her because he knows that she will never leave the mansion alive, or because he knows that she would be seen as insane if she ever tried to tell anyone. He probably planned on, after she painted his portrait, blood sacrificing her in order to keep himself young. Since these sacrificial rituals are what he uses to be immortal. He is incredibly malicious, he's just a lot more subtle about it compared to something like Nocturne lol. Maura even realizes this a few times throughout the story, but it's especially noticeable near the end:\n> Maura sensed with complete clarity that to climb these stairs would be committing to something irrevocable, something _final_. How many other artists had stood where she was right now? How many had lifted their foot and placed it on the first step?\n\n>How many had come back down?\n\n>How many had turned and walked away?\n\n>Maura could leave now, of that she was certain. Vladimir was not lying to her. If she chose to leave, she had no doubt she would arrive back at the studio unharmed. But how could she face each day from now until the Wolf or the Lamb came for her, knowing she had lacked the courage to take this one chance to create something incredible?\n\nSure, she possibly *could* have walked away, and Vladimir, though surprised, likely would still have let her. However, I'm under the impression that he chose her specifically because she *wouldn't* leave, because her ambition, or curiosity, wouldn't let her.\n\nI hope I explained this in a reasonably understandable manner. I can be quite bad at these kinds of things x_x\n\n**TL;DR** Vladimir is just acting kind. He likely sacrificed Maura shortly after she painted her portrait of him. Similar to how a vampire would sweet talk someone and then kill them by sucking their blood.","replies":[]}]}]}
