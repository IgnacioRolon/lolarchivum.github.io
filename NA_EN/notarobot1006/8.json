I also think he and the \"masked\" edgy solo laner are one in the same.\n\nHe went missing, I think most of us can agree it's likely because he posed enough of a threat to the Black Rose that they attempted to eliminate him. What if he didn't get killed or captured, but somehow faked his death/capture to go off the grid?\n\n{{champion:50}} - \"Do they know who killed your father, or do they still blame me?\"\n\n* Swain/Katarina Interaction\n\nHim and Swain are allies. So this voiceline doesn't fit. It's really suspect whether Swain killed him at all.\n\n>Grand General Boram Darkwill had been deposed by Jericho Swain, and a number of noble houses had chosen to honor this coup… including Du Couteau.\nOutraged and disgusted by her husband’s betrayal, and fearing that all members of the Black Rose were now in jeopardy, Soreana became desperate.\n\n>- Cassiopiea Bio\n\nWhen DuCouteau went against The Black Rose he became a target. His wife was DESPERATE and perceived his actions as a BETRAYAL. His life was in danger so when Swain went about purging his enemies and the rest of the Darkwill loyalists he made it seem as though DuCouteau, someone who in truth supported Swain was included among them. That was when Marcus donned the mask and began working within the shadows to dismantle The Black Rose and destroy the corrupting influence that tore apart his family and Noxus because like Swain he is a nationalist at heart. \n\nThe way Reav3 describes gives me a really awesome mental image of him as \"Noxian Batman\".\n\nEven before today I was sure he was coming soon with The Black Rose becoming more fleshed out after Mordekaisers' VGU, the fact that we haven't had a new Noxian champ since 2016, The Lost General Card in Legends of Runeterra that seems to exist purely to tease us and confirm that he still is a relevant thing in the lore.\n\nNow with these subtle clues and the message in the video about wanting to bring more lore champions like Kai'Sa and Senna into the game I will eat my hat if champion 150 isn't him. It would be also fitting to mark champion 150 by making him a lore champion, a champion that has existed as an idea since October 23rd, 2009 in Katarinas' first rendition of the lore, back when she had blue hair and green clothes. That's how you celebrate 10 years of LoL.","replies":[{"poster":"AnotherPurple379","date":"2020-01-15T03:39:15.684+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now anyone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Riot Scathlocke out-right said on Twitter that LeBlanc was not the representative of Guile in the Trifarix.

Either way, the fact that this statement was revealed could possibly be a small teaser? Might be wrong... But still.\n\nSo yes, I think I'll take a chance and bet that it is General Du Couteau. Even if he isn't the lore Champion, the actual representative of Guile themselves is still an option in itself for the lore Champion instead. We did see them in the lore before, after all.\n\nAlso, I've been hearing about this Lost General card, yet I haven't been able to find it anywhere. Do you know where I can find it?
