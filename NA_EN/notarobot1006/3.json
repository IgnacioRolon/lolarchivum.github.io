He has direct control over all of their souls, as evidenced by him turning a whole bunch of 'em into bricks.\r\n\r\nSo he could, in theory, use that power to tell them to stop being agonized over their existence. What are they going to do, disobey him? They'd have no choice but to feel whatever way he chooses to make them feel. He's not _going to_  use his power for that, but he _could._","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2019-12-08T20:16:51.004+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"“I don’t _want_ to cure depression.
