Didn't really get a good look at it until after I read the story itself because I was so hype for the story, but it's just _gorgeous._ I love the bright oranges in Hecarim and his posse and the duller hints of orange for Darius to foreshadow what he'll become.\n\nNext up, the story itself. The journal format is a fun way to set up a narrative, and I like that the dates become less certain as Ashe keeps writing to show the increasing desperation of her situation.\n\nAnd while it didn't give me further justifications for High Noon Karthus, it also didn't give me _fewer_ justifications, so I'd say it all works out.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2019-10-22T18:00:39.948+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks!

The whole thing feels very impersonal and distant. Darius' fall into darkness is something we're told about, but we don't actually see it. Same with descending into the skeleton of a dead god. The idea that Ashe and Darius went from trusting friends to enemies is absolutely laughable, as is the fakeout death with Darius; there's no reason for Ashe to make it look like Darius died if this is a journal entry written after the fact.\n\nThe journal dates getting more and more uncertain was a nice touch, and I'm always happy to see more of the demon cowboy universe, but overall, I'm not a fan of this particular entry.","replies":[]}]}
