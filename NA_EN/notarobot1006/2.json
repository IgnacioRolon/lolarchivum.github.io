You really captured his specific kind of horror where he genuinely thinks he&#039;s helping, but is horribly, horribly wrong. And the DEMON was afraid of him. How cool is that?\n\nAlso I like that you left his &quot;death&quot; ambiguous.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2018-08-31T16:47:45.400+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!

If he does, the demon can't take over his body and go destroy people with it.
