He craved recognition, acclaim, and glory. He first sought greatness in the Noxian military, but his flair for the dramatic went severely underappreciated. Thirsting for a method to share ''Draven'' with the world, he turned his attention to the prison system.","url":"https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/champion/draven/","image":"https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Draven_0.jpg"},"up_votes":18,"down_votes":3,"body":"First off, he and an implied Yordle basically founded the Noxian WWE! Everyone has a \"carefully constructed backstory, fighting style, and flamboyant personality\" and they engage in \"rivalries, trash-talking, and intrigue\"? That's just professional wrestling with more sharp objects and blood (because it wouldn't be Noxian without some sharp objects and blood).\r\n\r\nI also like the line about him reconciling with his brother, especially after their rather cold interactions in Legends of Runeterra.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint is that I'd like to see exactly _how_ he helped Swain with that coup, but hopefully that'll be covered later down the line.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2020-01-17T14:58:02.411+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"When did this come out?","replies":[{"poster":"HonestJohnTheCon","date":"2020-01-17T15:16:01.762+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just yesterday, I think.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2020-01-17T15:53:31.407+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":2,"body":"It definitely did not accidentally go live with Jax and Alistar on Wednesday.

With little more than a handshake, Xin Zhao and his fellows were bought out, and placed on a transport ship heading west.\n\nAll the while {{champion:12}} and Ayelia were planning their escape from the Reckoning pits.\n> One night, Ayelia brought Alistar the key to his cell. She had sacrificed much to arrange this escape, and he swore he would repay her tenfold.\n****\n> Weeks later, **a political coup shook the empire to its dark foundations**, and the arena minotaur’s escape was quite forgotten.\n\n****\nHence Xin Zhao and Alistar would have known each other as their Reckoner careers would have spanned the same period, Alistar's probably longer than Xin's. Whereas Draven was fairly new to the scene and probably only heard of the 2 or saw them fight once or twice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zeppelins circus","date":"2020-01-17T19:01:20.910+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A good and satisfying success story.\n..But one question.
