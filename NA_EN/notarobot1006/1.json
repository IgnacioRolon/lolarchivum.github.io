They show how some Demacians are still too xenophobic for their own good, but most are willing to accept Xin Zhao once he's proven himself.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to thank the lore team for coming out with these bios and stories that show both Demacia's flaws and its virtues.","replies":[{"poster":"SkiptoMyLuo","date":"2019-03-19T17:05:28.041+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for reading!

Yet…this expectation may be wrong.\nHowever, Ignorance is not a sin, but sometimes it may be to Insult others without intention.\nWouldn't you dislike if you were told by foreigners? \"Are Americans eating only pizza or hamburgers?\"\nanyway, I think that to acquire knowledge leads to respect for the other person.\n>“I have studied much of Noxus, yet I have never heard of a place called Viscero.”\n\nSo I like this line.\n\nHowever, I say such a good thing, but often I quarrel here because I don't have  enough knowledge of different cultures and others.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JonnyBoyy","date":"2019-03-19T16:14:35.092+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"yup, i also love his new bio.
