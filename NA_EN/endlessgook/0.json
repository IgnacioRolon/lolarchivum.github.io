Each support ticket entails a VERY detailed amount of information that proves what I am saying is in fact true. Long story short, My account has been hacked and riot seems to be doing very little about it. At least some sort of acknowledgement would be appreciated but I don't even know if my tickets exist afterwards so it makes things difficult.\r\n\r\nI came home at 8pm on 4/29/2016 to see that my account email and my account password has been changed. This email that was seen was sent to my email at 7:50pm which cannot be me because I was not home or had access to my email. I have regained access to my email that seems to have been compromised and changed my passwords and security information. I would like to be able to regain access to my league of legends account and if possible, find out where this account has been linked up to. I have plenty of more information that I can provide in order to prove that what I am saying is true and that this is my account. I would like to know if it is possible to have any actions done to the one that has hacked me such as an IP ban or anything of that sort. I would imagine that riot has a policy against those who hack others accounts. Thank you and I will be waiting your response. I sent a request earlier but it was not as detailed as this one so I hope it won't be an inconvenience.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Riot, what are you doing? I have submitted two tickets and when I went to review them, it said that they did not exist. It sent me to a page saying \"The page you were looking for doesn't exist.\" I have been waiting for days for an email response only to see that my tickets do not exist. I had to CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT just to see that my tickets that are requesting a recovery of another account do not exist. I'm quite upset that riot did not tell me the responses would be through the tickets and not through email. If it was through the tickets, WHY ARE MY TICKETS NOT THERE? This makes no sense. The way riot is communicating to users who wish to have support is illogical and broken. Riot needs to fix their customer support. An industry that is growing so quickly and yet does not even have some sort of phone contact. I just cannot comprehend this. I have so much information that I can provide to prove that my account has been stolen from me and yet I cannot even contact Riot. This is infuriating.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-03T22:18:27.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, I have never heard of tickets ever being deleted.  Every time a player has submitted a request to us, it is saved and archived.  After you create a ticket, you should get an email notification about the ticket itself.  Do you have a record of the unique Ticket number that we sent you so I can look into it?\n\nI should be able to get to the bottom of this and help out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CÄ±gan","date":"2017-08-03T13:34:09.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[]}]}
