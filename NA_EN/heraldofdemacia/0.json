There was no raging in my post at all yet I got nothing but downvotes for sharing a well constructed and sincere suggestion. \r\n\r\nFast-forward to today where I see a post on the boards which starts off with explaining the 4 types of champions (low popularity/low win rate to high popularity/high win rate). At the very end of this post the OP throws in Tl;dr Jinx is freelo. Right now I believe that post is at around 100 up votes. \r\n\r\nWhat is baffling to me is how this community can seem to be begging with every fiber of their being for jinx to be fixed, and yet turn away serious suggestions on how it could be done, with very few tactful arguments as to why my suggestions were not good ones. The only thing that seemed to appear in the comments were that they believed her W to be a bigger problem than her overloaded and overpowered Q (which is not my personal opinion because it is a VERY telegraphed skillshot). \r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Wickedfates","date":"2015-05-13T14:57:00.205+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"what does an up or down vote tell u really.... that someone took a few seconds to click something... nothing else\n\n\nuntil i can see some good info explaining why a few people on these boards, or the more popular reddit boards, are a representation of myself, and the people i like to play with, i wont take \"forums\" seriously.... \n\nremember the reports, papers, work that has been going into researching these types of environments.... they create echo chambers (or often called circle-jerks) where only the same opinions are constantly being brought to the forefront.....\n\ni believe it was riot (maybe lyte?) on reddit who said something like the first 10 people who post on a thread determine the direction it heads... those are not community opinions","replies":[{"poster":"HeraldOfDemacia","date":"2015-05-13T15:00:05.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough, but I should not have to repost my entire post because a few people decided to mindlessly click down vote and my post disappeared from the page.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2015-05-15T02:21:49.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This has been a popular view on the voting system and not many (from what I've seen) are happy with having such a limited binary option. The intent behind a voting system (the general idea of one) was to allow some self-moderation for the community and easier tracking of trending thoughts/opinions on the red-side, which was in my experience regarded as a decent goal. However, I've had several discussions with others that pretty much go over various problems they have with the incredibly vague and limiting up/downvote and what that actually implies.\n\nThe main argument for the reddit-style system I've seen is ease of implementation and the fact it's an easy system to build around, and that makes sense. Any legitimately detailed feedback system (i.e. tags) can not only be absurdly difficult to make for a large community like this but also hard to maintain and build upon. Personally I view it as worth the effort, but then again I don't know enough about web design, networking and the like to actually say I know what the effort actually entails.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Windfallen","date":"2015-05-14T00:47:54.323+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"My kalista rework\" that i shared just for fun.
