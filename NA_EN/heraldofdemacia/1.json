I mean unless your team is all standing in a really tight circle she can't hit everyone, and trust me a full build Jinx doesn't need an AOE crit to waveclear like a champ.  That's probably my biggest issue with everyone screaming \"OMG, Jinx OP, NERF!\"  She's not hard to beat if you know how to fight her.  Don't group in a little ball she can use her rockets on, and do all you can to dive her.  Jinx can do a lot of damage if she's using her minigun, but a good tank will wreck her if they initiate on her.  (especially if they have thornmail. - put Thornmail on Volibear, Amumu or Maokai when they have a decent build and they can 1v1 Jinx.)","replies":[{"poster":"HeraldOfDemacia","date":"2015-05-08T18:56:49.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't take issue with the aoe crit part as much as the 700 range part.

The only reason Jinx doesn't \"break\" Ashe is because Ashe can use her freeze on basic aa, but she can out harass Cait if she wants.  Tristana has a long range jump.  In the tank meta that's not \"good\" since it basically just means I can trade the ability to hit their adc for getting gang-banged by everyone.  And THAT is if you're lucky and don't get cc'ed by SOMEONE who can break your jump.  Oh, and look, Jinx's chompers just HAPPEN to have the same range as Tristana's jump. (compare to Caitlyn's \"**Yordle** Snap Trap\" which is NARROWER and has 100 less range)\n\nPart of it IS the Tank Meta, Jinx would be weaker in an assassin meta, but she's still the most ridic ADC with way too much versatility.","replies":[{"poster":"HeraldOfDemacia","date":"2015-05-08T14:56:17.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not suggesting that every adc in game is in a wonderful place right now because most of them aren't, but I am saying that Jinx is fine with her slow, not with the insane Q.","replies":[{"poster":"BestTristMyHaus","date":"2015-05-08T15:19:32.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeraldOfDemacia,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VAdpArMo,comment-id=000100000001000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-08T14:56:17.494+0000)\n>\n> I'm not suggesting that every adc in game is in a wonderful place right now because most of them aren't, but I am saying that Jinx is fine with her slow, not with the insane Q.\n\nI actually agree that her \"Zap\" isn't the big problem.  And I ALSO agree that her overloaded Q IS a big problem.  I'm just saying they stacked way too many abilities in her kit.  As a Tristana main, I HATE that her Q basically contains BOTH Tristana's original passive AND her Q, plus half her E.  The fact that they then gave her Caitlyn's Q, but longer range and with a slow and sight (Ashe abilities), tacked on Caitlyn's W but made it wider and longer, add in a variation on MF/Sivir's passive, and Ezreal's ult.  They basially took DEFINING abilities from several champs and shoved them all into one kit.\n\nI'm saying nerf ANY one of her abilities and she's STILL a strong pick that can at LEAST contend with the champ(s) that her remaining kit is based on, if not more.  Put a 20 sec cooldown on her Q swap (like Tristana's rapid fire) OR put a time limit+cooldown on her rockets.  If at least ONE of the abilities on Q was \"gated\" then maybe she'd actually have to use strategy and THINK about using them.","replies":[{"poster":"HeraldOfDemacia","date":"2015-05-08T15:31:01.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely see what you're saying. Miss Fortune is actually my favorite adc and I have my only penta kills on her so I can definitely understand your pain. They won't gate her Q with cooldowns though because that would make her less of an adc (sustained dps and all that) and also because she's the starchild of Riot. I also think a lot of the reason they won't do anything is because with the new tank meta she isn't as much of a problem against tanky teams because BotRK doesn't work all that well on her because she outranges the active and has enough attack speed from her Q.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LilxPaprika","date":"2015-05-08T14:06:56.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeraldOfDemacia,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VAdpArMo,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-05-08T13:55:27.553+0000)\n>\n> The thing about Jinx's slow is that it is a skillshot with a small slender hotbox.
