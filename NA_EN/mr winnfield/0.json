Maybe you can use the win rate data for instance.\r\nThe rolls kind of balance the scales, but maybe this could help create more competitive matches.\r\n\r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-31T01:21:08.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I second this.","replies":[]}]}
