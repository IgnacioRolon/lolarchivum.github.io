(PA, HV) Also, I know it would just be a silly skin for the giggles but obviously Rito doesn't want to deal with the endless sea of hate from people that think its wrong or actually implying tentacle r---.\n\nAs an example:\nHeartseeker Varus was a valentines day skin that was basically added either as a joke or to make up for the amount of skins like HeartSeeker female champs which wasn't that bad, I mean some people probably got a nosebleed but it wasn't anything really other than just Varus looking like cupid.\n\nSchool Girl Vel'Koz would probably be: Vel'Koz dressed like a normal school girl which would easily fly as a joke skin and people would find it pretty funny but then people that watched (THE WEIRDER SIDE OF THE INTERNET) would get a different interpretation of what the skin really meant and then this could cause some big uproars of complaints. I mean its easy to say Rito wouldn't purposely just release a skin that had a accidental darker intention without thinking about the consequences. What i'm saying is that a lot of people would be pretty disturbed or outright frustrated at the idea of it being in the game including myself since I always found that side of the internet to be considerably gross and Rito hasn't done any genderbender skins yet so thats a good thing.  I know it might seem like a funny skin that was obviously added for comedic reasons and not for dark intentions but from my POV it seems like this becoming a thing will get nothing but backlash.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-06T09:19:34.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well at the very least I want something school-related for Vel'Koz -_- He is *the* learner in league of legends, so maybe we could at least get something like \"Senpai Vel'Koz\" where he's a student in college.\n\nAlso, Headmistress Fiora is quite the fanservice skin (also, seriously, sexy teacher trope).
