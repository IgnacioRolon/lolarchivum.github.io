(Might be already done with #3) The tendency towards punish is clear enough for punishment to occur.\n5. If it's a permaban still manually check it before issuing it\n\nI simply cannot imagine how the current system could possibly be any slower, given that it skips certain steps alltogether.\n\nAnd the leniency... well... it's difficult to tell now, but it was difficult to tell back then as well. Tribunal had an amazing transparency when it came to false positives, but you could still only see the false negatives of cases that made it to Tribunal in the first place.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mister Punches","date":"2016-09-21T06:55:48.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I screenshot it, report all of them, send in a support ticket, and then wait to see if Riot will really permaban others for sending death threats.\n\nI know, I'm a killjoy at parties.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2016-09-21T05:53:23.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obviously they are just telling you to bait/feed the opposing team!

Always be nice to them no matter what or at least try to ignore it. Use mute if you have to.\n\nMost people have an innate issue with dealing with things they cant directly control, like other people. The best way to change their view on you is to show them how they should be acting by example. \n\nOr, if you dont care at all about that, which is fair, then mute them and report them after the game. If you choose this route dont say anything to or about them, just play the game and leave a detailed report.","replies":[]},{"poster":"61939590DEL1","date":"2016-09-21T04:01:09.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you got punish but not them, i guess you were a lot worse.","replies":[{"poster":"wiggly71","date":"2016-09-21T04:02:43.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't say anything too them all game till like 30 mins","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zykklon B","date":"2016-09-21T03:57:13.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mute button 2 hard 2 find it seems","replies":[]},{"poster":"KayleeT","date":"2016-09-21T03:58:05.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"boo fucking hoo. but if internet words hurt you there's your safe space with the mute button.\n\ni'm not an asshole in game but if someone flames me I either laugh or just ignore it\n\nyou should try that too","replies":[]}]}
