For every champion, Riot either just does a champion reveal, and put it on the pbe, or they create hype with teasers and stuff. And then when they get released to live servers, there&#039;s the bundle, and they cost extra ip, and blah blah blah. But what if you did something different. What if you just released a champion without telling anybody. No hype, no reveal, no bundle. Don&#039;t even release it on the pbe or give it a bundle. Now obviously they would have to do some extra play testing, but imagine how people would react if they loaded into a game, and saw something that they&#039;ve never heard of. Now that, would be fun. It would only really be a problem for the first day, and then after that, they would just be a normal champ. Also so they&#039;re not at the top of the champ store, you could release it at 4800 or 3150 ip. I just think that this would be a really fun thing to do for April fools, or just for fun.\r\n-Max","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-05-08T02:08:46.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see this happening.  I personally love the champ reveals and having played since season 2, I much prefer the teasers and all the reveal stuff they do now then back when they just released champs onto live with a quick champion spotlight like they did with volibear or fizz.  Those always felt like, \"ok new champ, so what?\",  Now its like \"ERMAGERD A GUY WHO IS A PSHYCO KILLER WHO HAS 4 SHOTS, I NEED HIM NOW\"\n\nAlso if they hype up a champ before release it gets people to buy them with rp instead of waiting and buying them a week later with ip.  Considering a new champ gets released say every 1 and 1/2 months, its a pretty stable and guaranteed source of revenue.\n\nOn top of that lately lots of new champs have had pretty impactful mechanics.  A champ with jhins skillset needs to be announced ahead of time or people are going to get blow up.  Same with reksai and her burrow and sense mechanic or the new champ with her wall ulti.  Imagine loading up league and going into a game without checking the store,  suddenly you get walled off into dragon pit with the ulti and you proceed to get fcked by brand and malph. It would not be a pleasant surprise.\n\nIdk just my two cents.","replies":[{"poster":"I AM MAX","date":"2016-05-08T02:26:38.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really true, but I think that riot could afford not as much profit from 1 champion, and what you mentioned in the 3rd paragraph would only be a problem for about a day","replies":[]}]}]}
