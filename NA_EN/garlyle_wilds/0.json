Note, I say this having well over 5,000 games played as Janna since season 1. And no, if Riot wanted to be fair about balancing supports, we would have seen significant changes to Thresh a LONG time ago. Riot likes supports who make plays, not deny them. Janna went months of her Q not working correctly (drastically reduced knock up) before Riot even acknowledged there was an issue. \n\nJanna will never be Olaffed, simply because of how her kit works. They'd have to completely remove her knock up q / knock back ult for that to happen. However, they certainly can make her /feel/ underwhelming. It's also pretty funny that they continually knock her AP ratios, when in competitive play, it's very rare Janna builds hardly /any/ ap. It's also very uncommon in solo / duoq. Many of Janna's nerfs have amounted to the balance team having no idea how to actually balance her and nerfing parts of her kit that are actually fine.\n\nI'd also argue that AP Janna in particular has been gutted repeatedly beyond reason, especially during some of the preseasons, but that's a whole other spiel about how Riot hates supports going anywhere else but the support lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Aishi","date":"2015-10-02T09:40:21.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"janna going elsewhere than support is fine in and of itself, but janna pressing Q once every 30 seconds to perfectly last hit an entire minion wave isn't fine... it just turns out that solo lane janna isn't particularly efficient if she can't have reliable waveclear.

That alone would have been fine, but they also nerfed the ratio on AP Janna's shield, her ult ap ratio, her w ap ratio and her Q ap ratio on both the quick cast AND a full charged cast by a considerable margin. There's absolutely no reason for that lol.

Only a couple of people played it at high elo (e.g., Zekent). One of the reasons he got popular was because no one dared to play it haha, and it was interesting to watch something out of the meta.\n\n It was strong, but it was strong because of itemization, not because of Janna herself. You could build Heart of Gold, kage's, philo and even an avarice and have retarded gold income by sitting mid and pressing Q on waves with all the free AP you got from the item generated gold. This was what made AP Janna op, but luckily riot fixed the stacking on the gold generation icons and re-hauled that shit. \n\n I can't tell you how many times I've been flamed for playing AP Janna mid since season 1. During season 2 I had a 60% win rate with her mid, which I think is pretty decent considering the number of games I've played with her. I was consistently flamed for it at least every other game, even at plat-diamond elo.

Before worlds kicked off I was pretty convinced that mid-lane picks were gonna be very stale with very little diversity, but what I've learned is that it's the _most contested_ lane that's going to dominate the meta with the fewest picks. In other words, it's where the players feel the most power is located that determines what the meta is. \n\nOver the course of the entire season the \"tank meta\" developed because of jungle changes initially (nerfs to some assassin junglers and buffs or just the addition of good items for tanky junglers.) Jungle was the most contested lane for a while and the other lanes fell into a \"safe pick\" pattern of champions who complimented the junglers once that key role was picked. Then the juggernauts/Fiora & Gangplank rework totally forced the _important_ lane to be top, so top is suddenly the lane that has the most focus. Gangplank, and Darius are pick/ban Gnar is considered one of the most reliable counters to Darius, and he's still strong in his own right (despite having insane team synergy no matter who he's paired with) and Fiora is now a legit threat. I think Mordekaiser is getting banned because he changes the game so much, he's too much of an X factor and no pro team playing with everything on the line wants to take that much risk. Mordekaiser may not actually be a good pick, but teams are simply mutually agreeing to not take that risk because even the team using him doesn't know exactly what impact that has and variables, even when they may be in your favor, are hard to math and are therefore scary. \n\nUnfortunately, it's about reducing the game to the fewest variables, and creating a situation that the players are familiar with. If we know that X,Y and Z are fundamentally the most _impactful_ champions, and they also happen to rock paper scissors each other, then why allow any other letter into the mix? Personally I find this boring as hell, and that's why I tend to support teams who refuse to play that \"established\" rock paper scissors meta such as C9 with their Veigar pick (or Kha'Zix like Hai used during the gauntlet,) or pretty much any UOL game, especially back when Kikis was still on the team. Other picks are viable, but they are less \"known\" which means that even the teams who **_DO_** use these unconventional champs very well feel like they're too risky and won't pick them when something big is on the line. In the past Mid-lane was the lane considered most important, but now top lane can carry and recently had tons of power shifted into it, so that's where the focus is. This frees up mid lane to be more \"random\" so to speak since there's basically no such thing as a mid laner who can't carry, this makes mid lane exciting, but unfortunately the game is still stale in the same way, it's just where it's stale that changed.\n\nI also think that Riot seems to be taking the stance that \"flex picks\" are bad for the game, hence nerfs to champs like Lulu, Annie, Fizz, and in the past Morgana, the pro scene seems to agree since Lulu is virtually permabanned, and Mordekaiser (who can now flex, even though he's best bot currently IMO) is also permabanned.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2015-10-02T01:00:53.803+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Champions with 100% Pick/Ban\n{{champion:82}}  (6 Bans)\nChampions which have been banned, but not picked\n{{champion:82}} (6 Bans)\n\nHey riot... you see a pattern here?","replies":[]},{"poster":"NightOfLight","date":"2015-10-02T20:13:13.706+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I swear you can gut Azir all you want and he will still be viable do to the nature of his kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iainB85","date":"2015-10-02T13:49:02.823+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That juggernaut rework -- what a failure.

Darius is too strong in Pro play and he is too strong in lower Elo, i think its time for a significant nerf that touches on why he is so successful despite being outmatched/outplayed (at low ELO we call this lack of skill) or being behind (so far this is what it always is at Pro play).  \n\nThe other interesting pick is Elise, not interesting as in surprising, interesting as in why is she always a popular pick in all Worlds i see... I think other then Lee Sin i have seen her the most in all the pro games ive watched! 12 games 2 junglers per game means a maximum of 24 different possible champions could have been played in this role, 7 of them have been Elise and 6 Rek'Sai to counter Elise, not to mention she was banned 5 times. That means more then 50% of the possible Junglers played were influenced by Elise (either directly or indirectly) and out of 12 games she has had influence in all of them since she was banned to keep her away from the other team.  \n\nI guess this is nothing compared to Morde who is so broken OP right now the Pros want nothing to do with him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MegaManYYZ","date":"2015-10-11T00:06:04.308+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think you're missing the {{champion:96}} Bottom Carry.","replies":[{"poster":"Garlyle Wilds","date":"2015-10-11T06:16:32.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, yeah, somehow he got lost when I updated for today (I have to manually redo a large chunk of the post each time).
