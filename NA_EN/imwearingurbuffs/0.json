(personal inquiry)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"(Edit): Hello again!\n\nThis is basically another new thread I will be starting, but because the title fits the subject matter of this new thread, I decided to make this an edit, rather than starting a new discussion all together. \n\nThere seems to be room for improvement in terms of how Riot Games and/or Player Support deal with account suspensions specifically when the ban has to do with \"suspicious account activity.\" This is I problem that i have experienced personally when my account ending up getting banned out of the blue on September 10th. I contacted player support and had any and all confusion properly dealt with. Thanks to the work of multiple Player Support professionals, I was successfully able to recover my account and rejoin my brethren on the fields of justice. \n\nThe problem in question is how the ban was initially presented to me. It's too broad and left me puzzled and desperate for answers. When a player is banned specifically for the reason of being unable to verify that ownership of their account, there should be a different message or process all together rather than what is currently in place. My suggestion is to allow the a chance to prove their ownership before going straight to banning the account. I don't know if it's possible or the logistics behind the current system in place, but it feels like something there can be improved. If it wasn't for my persistence and the wonderful people working in the Player Support department at Riot Games, I would have been banned forever and never even known why. Sadly, the answer i got that helped me get my account recovered wasn't from the player support system, rather it came from here in the Help and Support community board. All though I'm thankful, that potentially poses a huge problem and reflects poorly of the player support system.\n\nI left the original post below to show the extents i had to go to in order to recover my account.  \n\nThank You very much and I hope to hear something back from a riot employee on their thoughts.\n\nSincerely, ImWearingUrBuffs\n\n(Original Post Below)\n\nHello!\n\nI'm having issues recieving a response from player support regarding a ticket I've made as of yesterday. The ticket in question is (#31705381). It may just be due to high traffic but I have reason to believe that that may not be the case.  You see, somehow I got permanently banned from League of Legends and my client says to check the email associated with the account, but there isn't any new emails recieved from Riot Games regarding this ban. I know this is the correct email because I got a conformation email a few days prior for $50 worth of RP. There may be an issue on either one of our sides where either I'm not recieving your email, or on your side where the email isn't being sent.\n\nI simply would like to know what Riot believes I did to warrant me recieving a permament ban. I have no frame of referrence as to what happened. I've always upheld the Summoner's Code to the best of my abilities and refrain from any and all toxic behavior. If I can find out why I was banned, I will be able to make a proper appeal and reform in anyway Riot Games see fit.\n\nLeague of Legends is a passion of mines, both as a player and spectator. I am willing to do what ever is necessary to either prove that the claims against me are false, or reform my problematic behavior, whatever it may be. I have the utmost faith in the League of Legends Player Support will thouroughly investigate this and give me the information i need to recover my account.\n\nIf someone who is with player support happens upon this post, I ask that you please bring attention the above ticket and respond to this post informing me that you have. I whole-heartedly thank you in advance for your time and your action.\n\nSincerely, ImWearingUrBuffs ( a polite and passionate league player)","replies":[{"poster":"ImWearingUrBuffs","date":"2017-09-12T20:19:22.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Porocles Thank you very much for your help!

Your account was not suspended for any behavioral reasons, it looks like we actually applied a security lock due to suspicious activity.  I did see that your ticket was received, but in this case it would be better to fill out an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) instead.  \n\nThis will allow you to use an email you're sure you have access to so we can communicate with you, and it also help our account team with recovery.
