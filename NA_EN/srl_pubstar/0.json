But then i just get the alert 2 or 3 minutes later with the notification that i didnt accept the queue. It happened alot and now im getting 20 minutes restrictions and it sucks.\r\nAt first i tought it was an IP adress error because when i was renewing the adress the queue was showing up normally on the first game, then the other games wouldn't show up, so i changed my IP to Public 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 and flushed dns, rebooted my internet router and modem, also tried on 1pv4 vs 1pv6, wi-fi/wired, but i still had the same issues. I tried the hextech repair tool(in admin) four times, same thing first game pop the other ones dosen't.\r\nLeading me to error files in recents patchs(because it just started), I deleted the old patch and I reinstalled it, didnt work. Getting me to corrupted files in the game it self, SO i just deleted the whole game + data and everything and reinstalled, i even downlaoded the Beta client to try if it could fix my problem but it didnt worked. I have no trouble when i get in game, always 44ms and never move, so i guess its not a connection intensity variation problem either. What should i do to fix the problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-24T21:24:15.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since your match queue is never showing up, but you can hear that the match pops up and you're missing the queue button, there may be a corrupted file somewhere.
