We choose to study LoL and find some \"improvable\" points. There's a set of pictures to illustrate a little in the end of the post. Tell us what you guys think :)\n\n**Spells:**\nIf the player leveled a spell by mistake, he can’t go back on its choice. A possible solution would be to be able to come back on this decision for a few seconds (canceled if player use a spell).\n\n**TAB screen:**\nThe TAB screen can be pretty confusing and is a bit messy, filled with a lot of informations without a clear organization. The player has to takes time to search and find the informations he needs, with no relation to his actual skill. A possible solution would be to give to the player a more flexible screen, with the option to organize this screen like the spectator mode (selection his main opponent and putting him side by side with himself).\n\n**UI:**\nThe UI is very strict and unchangeable. It can cause “dead angles” kind of situations. Like if a player is on the top side, the spell bar may hide a bit of the screen, and forces the player to move the camera in what might be an uncomfortable position. A possible solution would be to be able to move/customize the UI.\n\n**Pings:**\nThe number of pings is very limited and doesn’t permit a “fast” non verbal communication. A possible solution would be to have more pings.\n\n**Loading screen:**\nThe loading screen is the first time team can see their opponents, and in blind mode they can’t even talk about a strategy . A team chat box would be nice\n\n\nThanks for reading and for your feedbacks :) ","replies":[{"poster":"Shurikend","date":"2015-01-10T21:54:16.555+0000","up_votes":89,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3152}} YOUR ATTENTION, due to an error in the poll if you wanted to vote for the \"**Loading screen**\" just up this comment as a vote.
