They probably didn't get administrator privileges, so they're having a _riot_.  No worries, a little negotiating through our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) article will set things straight.

In that tab there's a section that is titled compatibility mode. In that section, check \"Run this program in compatibility mode for:\" and make sure windows 7 is selected. Click apply and open the client. It will prompt you if it can make changes to your computer and choose yes. I hope this fix your problem. Cheers.","replies":[]}]}
