(has a 1.5 second delay on switching forms during which CHAKS cannot take action)\n\n**W: Static bolt** No cost CD: 20/19/18/17/16 seconds\nStuns target champion within 600/700/800/900/1000 units for 0.75/1/1.25/1.5/1.75 seconds, silences them for 3/3.5/4/4.5/5 seconds and deals 2/6/10/14/18% of their max hp as magic damage.\nEpicenter bonus: replaces \"target champion\" with \"all enemy units\" and deals 50/40/30/20/10% reduced damage to each.\n\n**E: Solar charge** No cost CD: ---\nPassive: Regens 0.5/0.75/1/1.25/1.5% of CHAKS&#039; missing HP plus (5% AP) every 5 seconds.\nEpicenter bonus: multiplies regen amounts by 2/4/6/8/10.\n\n**R: Power Surge** All charges. CD: 200/150/100 seconds\nPassive: CHAKS generates a charge whenever it get&#039;s a kill or assist, and also every 120 seconds. (max 10 charges)\nActive: CHAKS launches a stream of energy into the air that comes crashing down on a target area after 6 seconds dealing 200/350/500(+20%AP) Magic damage to enemies within 1000 units of the center, slowing them by 40%, this damage is increased by 10% for each charge (minimum 0). Enemies within 300 units of the center are killed instantly and are still killed even if they are under the effects of an ability or item that would revive them or prevent them from being killed (does not effect epic monsters or champions who respawned in the last 3 seconds).\n\nCHAKS is a quadruped obelisk machine with tons of bells and whistles that stands about as tall as the towers on summoners rift.\n\nRole: Support / Tank\nMelee\nno resource\n\nBattlecast launch skin","replies":[{"poster":"ModelT","date":"2015-04-04T20:44:51.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This kit is incredibly over powered.\nThe passive alone can kill enemy champions by just sitting in the lane against them, as it counters any HP regen with enough change to feed a beggar for a week.\nThe Q is a fun concept.  I like it.  >.> {{champion:101}} \nW-  You know, I'm just going to build a crap ton of Mana regen so I can root into a bush and just keep the enemies stunned, silenced, and remove giant fractions of their HP.\nE is a passive ability with a cool down for no reason, and allows the champ to basically root himself in a bush near the enemy champion and just stay at full health.  Level it up first to be able to get 3% of your HP every second while doing 100 damage every second to every enemy champion near you.  So much skill I could get a pentakill from my toilet.\nR- Maybe almost fair since it has a shit AP ratio, but it can instantly kill something, ignoring their revive abilities and anything like hourglass...\n\nYou're trolling right?","replies":[{"poster":"Fertsa","date":"2015-04-04T23:37:42.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"killing regen iz bad. am nerfing.\n\n*Cough* no resource *cough* and it would take a whole minute to chunk enemies down with just W, which is a bad idea, considering it's CHAKS' only damaging ability and that CHAKS would probably get found out after he used W while rooted once.\n\nI removed the CD on E because i noticed that too. and it's MISSING Hp + 5% AP as flat hp every 5 seconds. 3% missing hp a second while being rooted and inactive is far less effective than mundo's 60% max hp over 12 seconds with a massive speed boost thrown in.\n\non his R.
