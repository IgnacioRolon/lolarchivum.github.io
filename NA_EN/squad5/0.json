{"poster":"Squad5","date":"2018-11-06T19:39:16.894+0000","title":"Ornn changes on PBE","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey everyone, going to be pushing some medium scale Ornn changes to PBE for testing over the next few weeks that I'd like to get feedback from you all on.\r\n\r\nOrnn has had some balance issues over his time - he's been a frustrating lane opponent and consistent Pro pick for a while, at the same time maintaining a much lower win rate than you might expect given those facts. This changelist should hopefully meaningfully reduce those problems and let us bring up Ornn’s win rate for the average player. \r\n\r\nLet’s get into it. Disclaimer that none of these numbers are final, any numbers are the current values as I write this.\r\n\r\nStats:\r\n\r\n* Ornn HP/level increased from 90-95\r\n* Ornn Armor/level increased from 3-4\r\n\r\nP:\r\n\r\n* **Removed: Ornn and his allies must purchase upgrades from the shop after Ornn reaches level 13.**\r\n* **New: When Ornn hits level 11 any upgradable items he currently owns or buys in the future will automatically become upgraded for no cost. For the next 4 levels after 11, each level will allow Ornn to upgrade an item for an ally (max 1 per ally) at no cost.\r\nOrnn must get close to his ally and click on them, which will cause him to forge his ally's item and replace it for them when he's finished.**\r\n\r\nThe intent of this change is for Ornn to be able to have multiple upgraded items, which coupled with some scaling base stat buffs should mean that Ornn is able to scale harder into the late game if he can purchase his items. Essentially think of Ornn as a gold accelerated character similar to Draven or Gangplank. The other benefit is that Ornn's allies should care a lot more about getting their items, since now they don't have to pay.\r\n\r\nQ:\r\n\r\n*  Mana cost reduced from 55 to 45 at all ranks\r\n\r\nLooking to make it less necessary for Ornn to buy multiple mana crystals early on. A common buy for experienced Ornn players is two mana crystals early on to make up for his high mana costs, but it isn’t obvious for less experienced Ornns.\t\r\n\r\nW:\r\n\r\n* **Ornn's shield on using W is removed.**\r\n* **Ornn's W now grants him unstoppable for the duration.**\r\n* W duration reduced from 1s to .75s\r\n* Brittle damage increased from 7%+.3% per level to 10% +.5% per level\r\n* Cooldown changed from 17/15/13/11/9 to 14 at all ranks\r\n\r\nOrnn's W currently is too much of an \"I win\" button - it allows him to win almost every trade and confuses enemies as to what their response should be when he presses the button. Looking to clarify for enemies that attacking Ornn when he uses W is a choice, as well as trying to get out of the way or move back to not get brittle proc'd. \r\n\r\nReplacing the shield isn’t intended to be a power equal trade, but it should give skilled Ornn players something to think about instead of blindly pressing W whenever possible, and should put more emphasis on Ornn proc’ing his brittle marks to win trades.\r\n\r\nE:\r\n\r\n*  Mana cost changed from 50 at all ranks to 35/40/45/50/55\r\n*  Knockup duration from 1s to 1.25s\r\n\r\nR:\r\n\r\n* R1's slow now scales with the amount of time the R1 has existed for (min 10%).\r\n* R2's knock up duration now is decreased to 50% on subsequent targets after hitting an enemy champion.\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nOrnn's R has been extremely powerful both as a pick spell and an AoE teamfight spell. Looking to make long range hitting R1 less powerful for picking off enemies, and I want to make enemy front liners feel better about getting in the way of Ornn's R.\t\r\n\r\nI’m going to be making some more changes soon, including making adjustments to what items Ornn’s passive can upgrade. Most likely you'll also see some more buffs depending on where his power read is.\r\n\r\nThanks guys, I'll try to answer any questions that come up.","replies":[{"poster":"Menelwèn","date":"2018-11-06T19:50:53.466+0000","up_votes":91,"down_votes":10,"body":"I would preffer a real Tank Style than a Bruiser style,\n\nThat means I would preffer to have Both Shield and Unstoppable Effect, but for a very low damage, I don't like Ornn being a Bruiser play syle, but more of a Giant unstoppable tank who engages and tanks for his allies.\nI would prefer a Teamplay direction, a Tank who engages in fights and tanks, not a Bruiser solo lane type who destroy his openent with his Damage as a Tank.","replies":[{"poster":"pepetecabalga","date":"2018-11-06T20:08:50.725+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":11,"body":"Hes a laner, he needs that damage for trades.

This will give him survivability in team fights, but make it so in lane landing a Q --> E will still be a short-enough duration shield that it won't be noticeable in lane. This will make it so it's not OP while running away but still good while being aggressive (can reduce E knock back to 1s). \n\n(2) A small amount on the damaging portion of brittle. This would allow for him to have a strong shield by R2 and also by winning the trade with his W --> auto (because he doesn't have anything to really follow up with afterwards, lets him fall back). If it's too strong in lane, it can scale like CoC based off the number of enemies nearby.\n\n(3) On his R1 cast, gives himself like a 6 second shield, that breaks upon casting R2. You could take away some strength by making the R2 not re-apply brittle if the shield is broken + lower the damage, while it would do more damage than live if the shield is still around.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Meow Kuroneko","date":"2018-11-07T00:55:13.248+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ornn is my favorite champion and I've always played (and wanted to play since his teaser) him as a tank support, and this new passive nicely pushes him a little bit further in that direction. He doesn't thematically look super \"bruiser-y\" to me, and I too would be happy to lose damage if it meant I kept my shield and was focused more on the team CC bit. Since anyone with immobilize abilities can pop brittle he already has some clear pick situations and synergies, and his skill-based long-rage engage/disengage potential also feels far more \"tank\" than \"I'm here to trade with you\" to me.\n\nPersonally I'm in the boat of take away some of his damage (perhaps not against minions but champions?) but keep his tank identity. I know a lot of Ornn players might disagree with me on that but there's no other tank champion that \"feels\" quite like Ornn to me, but there sure are other bruisers that fight like he does. The closest tanks that come to mind would be some sort of hybrid between Maokai and Malphite, but Ornn has more skill expression than both of them, and I feel like he's going to lose quite a bit of that identity with the W change here where he focuses more on being Olaf and less on being a big tanky CC daddy.

From my experience, and I play a LOT of Tanks, this is a bad idea.\n\nAmumu for instance has no high defensive moment, and feels pretty bad to play from behind because of that. Maokai has only his heal that you cannot really play around, and feels super frustrating to play against because of that.\n\nOn the other hand, Leona's Eclipse or Braum's shield are clear moments where you know it's a bad idea to throw your spells, and you wait it out or you flank them. Zac has to work for grabbing his blobs and you can deny them. Sion has to ponder between damage and durability from his shield. This is what makes interesting Tank gameplay, playing as and against Tanks.\n\n**A Tank with no defensive steroid is a bad idea.

Overall the changes sound really positive. \n\nIs there anyway to get his shield back,  perhaps on a different ability. Perhaps different scaling for his damage vs shield build?  Maybe if Ornn targets himself with his W it becomes a shield; could also make it delayed and/or channeled, rooted or self-slowed.

I wholeheartedly agree with what you’ve said. The moment they shifted his W to deal %max health damage, on top of all his reliability, was when he became a pain to balance.\n\nHe was sold as an unreliable tank like Sion, but his impact in CC and utility (Brittle) rather than damage. His shield was what brought him up to par with other tanks in defense, rather than as a passive stat stick, which that shift was their goal when they did the tank class update. \n\nThey’ve moved so far from what Ornn was supposed to be.

Only one champ in either of those classes lacks any sustain and that's Shyvana who is also in the camp of being a giant stat check. I get wanting to change how he has to play lane, but removing the shield entirely is the wrong way to do it. He's just going to get forced out by all of the other tanks who trade and either take less damage or heal off the damage they took. Either way he is way worse off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Makos","date":"2018-11-07T03:43:24.168+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feedback from challenger regular ornn player (less played lately because of bad changes, this looks good and a step in the right direction)\n\nI played ornn 3 times on pbe, once jungle and two times top.\n\nI love:\n\n+ Ornn feels more like his own champion rather than tank version 20 brittle edition\n\n+ I loved unstoppable and im glad we have it back. But now it wont completely cancel a cc if you are unstoppable when its applied and instead the remaining cc duration will still happen, kind of a bummer.\n\n+ The knockup duration on E is really cool. They get knocked a bit too high visually though. This makes it hard to click/hit abilities.\n\n+ Ult finally nerfed allowing this. Seriously the less slow is very noticable at max range.\n\n+ Ornns items feel good now instead of being a \"im full build time to get this\" one out of 100 games scenario.\n\nConcerns:\n\n- Lack of shield is really observable in multiple scenarios over every game i've played. Outplay potential has been reduced and sustain / teamfight reliability is greatly reduced. Ornn always felt squishy in teamfights and now he feels even less safe. I'd like to see a shield on his E if he hits an enemy champion/large monster like azir for example, or tie it to his knockup. Or even maybe every brittle proc gives him a shield. With the ult knockup being so low on additional targets this makes it a higher incentive to go for the big ults rather than the single target ones we will probably see from now on.\n\n- Passive feels clunky to use on allies. Sometimes he stops at max range to forge the item sometimes he walks up to them while casting? Probably a PBE bug\n\n- Too few upgrades. Now that they become a big powerspike for ornn's team we need more ornn upgrades than ever. It feels Ornn is forced to build sunfire/abyssal mask every game, it feels bad when your midlaner is building Morellonomicon but theres no upgrade for such a popular item, it feels like you're losing out more than before (from 1 in 100 games to every game). This is especially because before, people would just spend the gold on another item if they didnt have an upgradable one. Now since there's no opportunity cost, it just feels like wasted.\n\n- Cant choose which item to upgrade. My friend built black cleaver but decided he wanted trinity fusion, buying trinity force right after the cleaver. I clicked on him and black cleaver got upgraded automatically. What are the options for this?\n\n- Can we use anything but champion clicking for the ally item upgrade? Clicking on an ally's item on the scoreboard should be good enough.\n\n- The last game i played before writing this i clicked on lissandra who had zhonyas to upgrade it, and after the passive completed she had BOTH zhonyas paradox and hourglass. I basically gave her an extra free zhonyas in the process. While the actives share the cooldown, this is pretty much an important bug. Noting that the \"walking towards her while casting passive\" happened in this case. Might have to do with that. Lissandra claimed that this had happened on a previous game of hers with an Ornn.\n\n- My teammate could sell Obsidian Cleaver for 4200 gold. BC costs 3000 and sells for 2100, Obsidian used to cost 4k.\n\n\nI just want to say that these changes are in the right direction and i hope you get the stats and feedback you want and need. I hope you can address these concerns.\n\nEDIT: I misremembered and was wrong about unstoppable.

With that said, I think that removing his shield and increasing the damage isn't the best approach either. Since he's a TANK, most of his power should come from TANKiness and not damage because it'll almost certainly lead to one of the two following scenarios: Ornn builds full tank and wins every lane with superior damage without having to opt into damage items OR Ornn is completely useless in teamfights and every other tank is way more tanky than him so there's never a situation where picking Ornn makes any sense (almost all tanks have some sort of shields, damage reduction, healing or bonus resistances). I think a good idea would be if he would get a shield if he knocks up an enemy champion with his E (more enemies you knock up, the bigger the shield. Sort of like Courage of the Colossus). That way you can't just press one button and say \"now you can't deal any damage to me\" but if you engage in a teamfight you don't blow up instantly. In addition to the R nerfs I think this should ensure he stays viable as a teamfighter without making him a laning phase monster for no good reason (before he was both so I guess that's some improvement, as far as \"unique champion identities\" go).\n\n\nTL;DR\nUnstoppable good;\nNo shields not so good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iota Theta","date":"2018-11-06T23:33:58.071+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I normally avoid this card, but As a Mastery 6 with Ornn (up until the damage change on W from %current HP to %max Hp), I disagreed with a lot of his various buffs shortly after his release. Like others have said, his biggest issue was his damage buffs on top of reliability increases. He was originally sold as similar to Sion, less reliable but potentially more impactful tools in his CC and utility. His shield was never made W the “I win” button, but the change from %current hp to %max hp damage. He was at his healthiest for the game before that. Fairly unreliable, impactful in teamfights, just enough damage to farm and trade to not get pushed out, but not overpower, just like a tank should be.\n\nI absolutely disagree that you’re increasing his damage in the Brittle procs, and reducing the duration and removing the shield. When the tank revamp was done, tanks were pushed toward more active windows of tankiness as opposed to passive stat sticks, thus the shields, damage reduction, or heals, depending on the tank. Ornn relied on his shield for his tankiness, and his unstoppable was to help him stay in the fights.\n\nMy proposal is take him back to release, minus some of his bugs, and start him from there again, where he was at his healthiest to date. This will not make him better.\n\nIf you’re absolutely going through on these, a QoL gripe is:\n\n> Ornn must get close to his ally and click on them, which will cause him to forge his ally's item and replace it for them when he's finished.\n\nPlease no. Zilean mains have already voiced that this mechanic is easy to misclick and cost a fight. Please do not do that to Ornn as well. At least add a UI element for it to avoid game costing misclicks (see the C9 match where Jensen started channeling his passive on Zeyzal and it messed up the start of the fight against..RNG?

Allowing Ornn access to multiple upgraded items seems like it has a high chance of limiting his build paths, since these items now have so much extra stats thrown in.

Removing the shield completely feels bad for a tank who has no other damage mitigation built into his kit, I do think w is currently providing too much, and I would like to see the shield shifted to his e instead\n3. Giving W a flat cd. W is the iconic one of Ornn's basic abilities, and compared to q feels much more impactful, and from an enjoyment standpoint I feel W max feels much better than Q max, similar to when sion used to have e max as his strongest option when his Q felt much more like it should be his primary damage source.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Siqsa","date":"2018-11-06T20:07:14.622+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I run a jungle YouTube channel, my main love is Ornn jungle and the nerfs over the year kinda made that hard.

Back when he had unstoppable and a shield on W,-THE OG W WITH CURRENT HEALTH DAMAGE - his purpose was clear. Engage tank. I R start a fight, land full combo on someone with untouched health, do good damage, and because my good damage was used I start peeling for my squishies. It felt so good to play tanky, cc heavy, not concerned about dealing metric tons of damage, Ornn. That Ornn was my 3rd Mastery 7 champion, and a pocket pick support into hook champs. Position and time W well, and it was so rewarding. Don't, and you get punished. Top lane into a CC champ? Same thing. Timing. Waiting. Scaling. Trades could be won without the my enemy allchatting \"Me Ornn, Me hit W.\" But no, W had to be made into the \"I win\" button by changing it to % MAX health damage. Let's forget that for a while Ornn actually had to land a basic attack after W to win trades. His release kit was so clearly for CC and survivability in a fight, but it was decided for whatever reason that because he had a low win rate, HE NEEDS MORE DAMAGE. Nevermind that his team are buying wildly inefficient Ornn upgrades on their 2nd item, IT MUST BE BECAUSE THE CC TANK ISN'T HITTING HARD ENOUGH. He was given metric tons of damage in exchange for making it harder for him to outplay. Why would it not be expected for pros to pick him? They can appreciate his damage numbers while mechanical skill makes up for the absence of unstoppable. Meanwhile, more and more people pick up Ornn because of the W buff. Ergo, more and more people are learning Ornn. While this was going on Ornn's non-pro winrate had him targeted for so many buffs that it couldn't even be discerned properly what was making him so broken. Well, except that between his damage, CC, and tankiness, all you needed to do for a win was - and I quote, \"drool all over myself in the frontline,\" as Imaqtpie so accurately put it.  Is it really too much to ask that his W regain unstoppable and revert to current health damage? Why get rid of his shield? WHY DOES ORNN HAVE TO BECOME A BRUISER TO REGAIN UNSTOPPABLE. \n\nEnding this rant here, as I do not feel I can gather my thoughts well atm. . .

Ornn is slow, his e can be interrupted during cast very very easily so his 1 potential escape ability is useless. and his ult id telegraphed so it can be dodged if played right. i dont see this as a negative thought. i think ornn would be far beyond broken if he could pick a choose which fights to take by simply running away.\n\nAs mentioned above, Ornn is telegraphed. all of his abilities are obvious in intent, and have animations and wind ups which give the opponent enough time to react if theyre skilled enough. his q is short range and takes a few seconds before the pillar pops up giving u time to jump, dash, flash, or potentially walk away before getting e slammed. his w doesnt apply brittle till the end, which yes is a big cone, but again you can choose to dish engage if you dont want to take that trade, and with ornns w being a self-lock-out ability he cant reliably chase you unless your stood on a pillar or next to a wall. his e as mentioned can be stopped, and has a minor wind up animation and travel time anyway so it can still be dodged if fast enough. and lastly his r, it paints a big 'red carpet' as i like to call it, showing u where it is. the only people who cant dodge this ability, are the people who waste their escape dodging R1 stupidly. Again i dont see these as negatives within his kit, more fairness in giving him weaknesses. the telegraphed nature of his kit should be the outplay people need to kill him.\n\nRemoving of Unstoppable. this was really a deciding factor for me in terms of maining this lovely hunk of demigod. let me start by saying, unstoppable on its own, is kind of a bad 'tank' ability. it only effects certain crowd controls such as knock ups and knock backs, and couple that with ornns w being a self-lock-out as mentioned before, and the ability itself doesnt actually hold that much strength regarding being an 'unstoppable' threat.\nHowever, it worked. and it worked in a really healthy way. there was only 2-3 match ups that could truly benefit from the unstoppable like w'ing gnars ultimate to avoid getting stunned. in chasing, if used at the right time could prevent a vayne condemn or tristana ultimate, which felt rewarding to predict but again with patience from the adc could have just been kited out till ornn used W.\n\nOn a personal note, i explicitly remember a play where we got invaded by a team with a blitz support, who flash q'd towards my adc. without even thinking i flashed infront and instantly pressed w, tanking the pull without budging. this is the single proudest display of quick reactions i have personally done in 5+ years of playing the game, as it just looked so natural even after only playing Ornn a few weeks at this point. even the blitz was impressed. unlike the first 2 in this list, i DO believe this to be a negative. Ornn worked well with unstoppable. hes a big beefy guy he should be able to stop people pushing him around, and i am very grateful to see a return of this mechanic to him. \n\n\n**Rework Pros:**\n\nThe passive i would have to play and see, but from what i can tell i like it. concerned about how much power is given, essentially for free with the only condition just being patience to level up, but happy with the concept as it keeps to his theme as the forging demigod. \n\nas said before, W unstoppable a big big thank you.\n\nE changes are all around nice, rewarding the (in my opinion) hardest part of him to land an e (easy in a lane trade, not so easy in a chase/team fight scenario where everythings happening at once)\n\nDont see anything overly wrong with the R nerfs. if its still considered to be too strong then i rather this change than another cdr nerf or something of that nature. \n\n\n**Rework Cons:**\n\nThe W Shield. as ive read, i am happy to see everyone has an agreed idea on this. aiming towards damage and taking the shield away from him is a bad idea. many people have stated already has all other tanks have benefits to actually avoid/absorb/regen/reduce damage done to them, and Ornn only had his sheild. and Unstoppable will not be a valid substitute on its own. I am happy to see a shield appear elsewhere on his kit (as people have suggested e before), but to out right gut this is a mistake, and i heavily disagree with it. \n\n\n**My Thoughts:**\n\noverall im excited to see where this leads, but i cannot say im looking forward to not having a shield. i think it is crucial to his survivability.\n\nalthough i like the shield on e idea, i fear u wouldnt proc it nearly enough in teamfights. so my proposal, as im sure someone has already done, is to have it based on procing brittle procs. this means he can essentially get a shield via his w as before, but not instantly. so lane match ups who can keep him at range such as quinn or gnar or teemo, can try to trade him and get damage off, then simply run away before getting auto'd. \n\nthis in tern can create alot of flexibility for balancing, if you want his strengths to be in lane, then have the shield bigger if he procs it himself. if u dont want an absurd strong laning phase, then have the shield be better if an ally procs it, meaning in teamfights it requires good synergy as a team, as opposed to u trying to 1v5. this would be the optimal option in my opinion, as fights for ornn can be won by correct use of the w ability without making it so simple as 'press me to win'. if u cant hit anyone after ur w or r, then u dont get the protection u want. \n\nas for the rest of the W ability, i would nerf the damage abit from what is current, and i would potentially nerf the cooldown by a second or 2 to compensate for unstoppable, and to avoid procing the shield idea above too often. i think over all this is a better way, than trying to make ornn a lane bully who falls into a bad tank role. it just seems confusing what the aim of the changes is other than being a lane bully. \n\n\nill leave it here as im sure many of you have stopped reading by now. hope this helps in any way and if anyone wants to discuss anything extra with what ive said feel free to ask :) thank you all and remember, #MakeOrnnGreatAgain","replies":[]}]}
