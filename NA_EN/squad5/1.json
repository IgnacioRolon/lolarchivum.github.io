The Moonfall changes add a new, ultimate level source of damage onto Diana’s kit that she can use for solo assassinations or go for the big play of getting a massive teamfight winning vacuum.\n\nHaving access to Lunar Rush early should give Diana more agency in lane to maneuver, and give her more options than simply trying to survive until level level 6. Or in the case of jungle Diana, make her clear and ganking patterns stronger. \n\nNew Moonfall gives Diana a new tuning lever to hopefully make her more enjoyable to play both as and against. One of the core problems Diana currently has is a lack of variance when she attacks her enemies. She trains them down with multiple dashes and if she’s winning she likely kills them without much recourse, but if she’s losing she likely can’t dish out enough damage and simply loses the fight. With the addition of a bigger moment to play around, opponents can attempt to get out of Moonfall’s detonation, while Diana can look for a big multi-opponent cast to pull out extra damage.  \n\nThis swap should overall help both the laning and later game concerns that Diana players have, and hopefully also reduce some of the frustration that her opponents feel.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe second change is one that will probably be of more interest to more invested Diana players - changes to the way her passive works.\n\nHere’s the new tooltip (level 1 value):\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/TMhGMLL.png[/img]\n\nHere are the mechanical differences from her current passive:\n\n* Decoupled Attack Speed from Moonfall’s rank (now scales with character level)\n* Always grants a baseline Attack Speed bonus rather than only after spell casts\n* Spell casts now increase the bonus\n* Passive cleave no longer grants mana\n\nDiana’s passive had a lot of rules and mechanics that were put in for specific reasons to tune her lane or her jungle respectively, and after taking a look at them we decided that we could afford to clean them up and simplify the passive back down while instead making adjustments to her base stats and mana costs to make her feel better overall. \n\nThis passive version should hopefully be a nice throwback to her original passive while still maintaining the spell weaving gameplay of her current passive.\n\n\nThere’s a lot more tuning that I haven’t mentioned, and more to be done on PBE with the feedback we get, but I look forward to everyone getting to take a look at our favorite moon aspect’s new changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Green Girl","date":"2019-11-27T03:44:58.004+0000","up_votes":122,"down_votes":14,"body":"Hey @Squad5 , respect,  those changes looks intresting...\nNot trying to make myself big or anything but i would like to say i m maybe guy with most games played with diana and i have big exp with diana in master+ elo in last 3-4 years.\nI see u guys made some changes to Diana so let me give u so informations, i see u rly nerf her pasiv dmg and her r(E) dmg and give her dmg on E(new R) dmg, this my friends means that diana depends on hiting E(new R) to kill, thats fine, but not if u put a delay of 1 sec, what this means ? hmm  all untargetable champs : Fizz,Zed, Vladimir, Eve, elise, camile, kayne, rek sai, xayah.... and all champs with dashes like Ahri, Akali, Azir,Cait, Camile , Corki, eko ,graves, gnar,Hecarim, Irelia, J4, Jax , Jace, kaisa , kha , le blanc, lee, lucian, pyke ,Rakan, riven ,Renekton, Shivana, shen, sejuani, sylas, Trinda, tristana ,zed..... counter her new r ?\nNext time when i lock diana vs those champs, etc Leblanc my team will call me trol ? cuz she need to hard missplay so i can hit r? why diana needs to depend on enemys missplaying  ( all  champs i put on list above) so she can land r ?\nEtc cha elo game, diana vs lets say fiz, ahri, vlad... i click r and they have 1 sec to get out or go untargetable and my r is wasted? this means if old diana used to do 1k dmg to those champs now she is doing 600 at max with those nerfs on P,R.\nSo basically u cant play diana in Master+? same problem she had before( after rqr removal, i know 90% ppl here dont know for it, but u should do as ppl who work it riot) , i dont see u guys fix anything here? yes she might be good in gold elo at least.\nAnd what if lets say fizz goes Zhonya ? he has 2 ways to dodge my r dmg ? i can win him doing what ? nothing is in my hands...\nmake 1 of those changes  :\n\n-make us choose do we want to wait 1 sec or press r again for instant dmg\n-dmg is activated 1 sec after u cast r no metter if someone was in your r or not ( situation where we can use this is in tf when u hide over wall and then do r flash e to enemys in tf, only way to hit more targets in master + elo.\n-return old RQR technique ( diana r has 825 range, make it  casting RQ(EQ) over 800+range  reseting  r(E) like it used to do till big Season 9 (95%ppl cant do it cuz the used on simple combos so its doesnt metter to them)\n* bonus tip: till season 9 u could do \"RQ\" combo just flasing before your R hits enemy and get r reset but r not doing any dmg, return that too, i dont see any reason for it removal, i used to make rly good plays dodging ahri e with that and etc... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbHVukKmAw4\n\n till s9 diana was champ with combos, just ppl didnt know they exist and u removed all  and make her simple and boring,\n i bet 90%ppl here dont know that diana can swap positions with her enemy like urgot used to do with old r just on lower distance\n\nthis is 1 more nerf for high elo diana and buff for lower divsions.\n\nCheck those posts u maybe learn something about Diana that you dont know: \nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/dFvb09E8-diana-riot-zhanos\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/FrovfpFZ-diana-extremly-nerfed-3-combos-removed-riot-zhanos","replies":[{"poster":"Fated Blade","date":"2019-11-28T20:48:39.769+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Squad5, \n\nI share some of the concerns that Green Girl has, and want to add on a bit on my view on the changes.\n\nFirstly, let me introduce myself - I'm the best Diana jungler NA or at least the one player with most experience playing Diana in jungle position on NA server at high elo. You can ask other high elo Diana mains like Suntail, and they can easily confirm I'm the most experienced (or the craziest) to play her so much in jungle. I peaked at d1 97lp at about 2months with her.\n\n\nRegarding the 1second delay on R damage:\n\nSo the ap ratios from passive and dash (E) got transfered to R - which is aoe, means stronger teamfight. On paper looks fine, and her teamfight supposed to be stronger. However, what happens if they block or reduce this damage - Diana loses a huge amount of her damage. \n\nAlthough, the list is not as large as Green Girl mentioned. Why? Because its possible to cancel a dash with the pull-in on her R, bringing enemies back to same position for 1second delay damage to be applied from R. \n*Note, this is only possible to do on regular basis for players who have had plenty of experience using her old E, and it would be much harder to master for new players with her R. \n\nSo, the list is reduced to champions like Fizz, Zed, Vladimir, Eve, Elise, Camille, Kayne, Rek'sai, Xayah, etc. And anyone who builds stopwatch/zhonya, or stasis ability. This provides a clear counterplay to her (which i know a lot of complains were before), but i hope her other abilities receive some of the power back, so she doesn't get steamrolled by people just playing those champs at high elo.\n\n\nNow to address my concerns about her jungling ability. \n\nI believe the goal of the switch between her E and R was to make her early game ganks more impactful - which I believe some Riot representatives stated in the past when announcing the rework. The dash was moved to E, a basic ability, which means Diana can access it earlier. Although the slow was moved to R, this can be negligible if you start Red buff. \n\nHowever, her W was nerfed early. Diana lost 10base of the shield at lvl 1, and although she gains additional scaling off bonus* hp, this does not come into equation until she gets at least an oblivion orb or a morello. Also, I saw on PBE, the W has an increased cd of 15seconds, up from 10seconds and still no cooldown reduction one you level it. This causes her early clear to be much less healthy, and her having a dash early doesn't mean her gank will be more impactful because she would come out of jungle at half hp.\n\nI hope she can properly be adjusted before she goes live and thanks for your hard work on improving the champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Muwatallis","date":"2019-11-27T11:53:09.863+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yeah the 1 second delay is stupid.

I guess I will have to wait and see how much of her AP ratios were moved around and if any base stat changes happened but not going to lie right now Im feeling kinda worried that the point of missed of why Diana needed changes in the first place. \nAlso Im not going to lie though I would had prefered a more unique utility after effect on Moonfall instead of MOAR DAMAGE. A unique utility to decouple her from technically being replaceable by Akali,Fizz or just any other AP assassin (fighter??) really. maybe like a cool gravity effect that affected people with a debuff that would pull them back if they tried to dash or something? a memorable effect like Bard portal or Windwall....\n\nEither way I am interested in this. Diana was always a lowkey fave champion of mine. very simplistic and cathartic gameplay with a clearcut goals for laning(spampush!) and lategame (splitpush and duel!) which is something I really enjoyed.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Beardilocks","date":"2019-11-26T23:35:19.780+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"The extra damage on the ult happens after a short delay (1 second, see in the tooltip above), giving enemies some counterplay","replies":[{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2019-11-27T02:49:05.792+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Beardilocks,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=V9wBw3nx,comment-id=00190001,timestamp=2019-11-26T23:35:19.780+0000)\n>\n> The extra damage on the ult happens after a short delay (1 second, see in the tooltip above), giving enemies some counterplay\n\n\nI dont think a forced 1s delay is enough to move her from Assassin to Fighter/Slayer. Reminds me of the LeBlanc/Fizz assassin rework where the guys had the exact same philosophy. I dont think making her burst cook behind a single second is going to fix Dianas major problems and binary playstyle. \n\nI also just tested her on PBE and my feedback is this with recommended changes italicized :\n1. Bonus hp ratio is too small to properly incentivize going out of your way for hp ESPECIALLY when in the longrun deathcaps mulplicative power will give you better results overall._ **change this from bonus to a % of Total Maximum HP and lighten up on the AP**_. by going to total maximum route you still reward hp purchases but also it lets you put more of a focus on BASE effectivness which how a lot of fighters tend to find success through effective base skills ala think Morde shield kinda. I dont think the hp ratio is good enough to start going zero damage builds like ROA into Rylai/Liandrie\n\n2.for a Ultimate tier ability the new R actually doesnt FEEL very ultimate-y for a ultimate design around catching multiple people (or atleast rewarding it) the effect size is far too personal and ONLY feels like it could ever be used as a follow up after Lunar Rush. I think the range of effect should be increased DRASTICALLY at LEAST Amumu sized as currently this only feels 2 halves of a whole ala Flag n Drag. _**Pull in  and damage radius from 450-550.**_ (moonfall is also missing its cast sound effects btw). \n\n3.as I said before you need to reward Diana for fighting more overtime instead of bursting targets with magic damage. the frame for killing that I desire is not from ONE second to TWO seconds.we arent trying to make Diana a more healthy ASSASSIn remember? we are trying to move her to be a FIGHTER.  _ **Halve the damage on Moonfalls meteor-drop portion, Have it REAPPLY the slow and then for the next 5 seconds Diana gets Lunar cleave on ALL attacks not just every third while ALSO granting her the full effects of her passive for those 5 seconds and 40/60/80 flat movespeed towards enemies**._\n\nCurrently PBE Diana kinda just feels like a turn off. Massacred ap ratios  I get but not really when the only compensation is on a riskier nuke thats can be flashed or easily dashed/zhonyad. This is a rework feels more like one of those moments where too much was focused on the PLAYING AGAINST feeling that people forget the PLAYING AS satisfaction is just as important its a LOT. another rework that felt this way was the Rengar \"swim\" skill and Zac kidnap ability . while Zacs new ability was fun at first the counterplay to his kit was so easily achievable that he ended up not feeling as satisfying due to sheer unreliablness.  Death by counterplay is a terrible way for a champion to go and this is a lesson RIot has had to learn a few times over (anyone remember Rek'Sai R could literally just be walked away from?). more risk for the _same_ reward with the small plus of it all being that now her laning (or ganking?) has better options a tradeoff that wont be felt after 7 minutes or so into the game.\nanyways thanks for your time I really really want this rework to be successful and not another \"we changed stuff without actually CHANGING stuff\" type rework like {{champion:11}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:38}} \"updates\" where you just put makeup on the pig.

I'm a diamond rank Diana main here, first time posting about Diana on the boards! I've been maining her ever since she came out in 2012. I believe I should have well over 10,000 games of experience on her, counted across a few other accounts I play on. This is just my personal two cents about all of Diana's changes I see here. Really wanted to get my voice out there since the changes are so major!\n\nDiana's passive:  \n* The attack speed decoupling seems alright, although I don't actually have a PBE account to test it. I play Diana in both jungle and mid, and I remember that Diana jungle overall felt slightly slower than before when her attack speed bonus became \"next three hits only\" and attached to her E. Hopefully this will keep Diana jungle at about the same clear speed as before? I believe that the overall goal isn't to nerf or buff Diana, correct? So, hopefully her jungle is still viable and at about the same pace (in fact, it might even be slightly faster than before, early game at least, since E now has damage).\n\n* The mana changes look good. Diana has always had one of the most prohibitive mana pools of all mages/assassins, nearing the bottom of the base mana list for how much mana she started with. Passive restoration is very low for the most part and encourages too much lane pushing which can sometimes be unsafe. New mana costs look quite reasonable.\n\n* Diana's passive damage seems to have gone down from 0.8 AP ratio to 0.4 on the PBE. May I ask why? In my humble opinion, this damage is probably one of the healthiest parts of the combo. Opponents know to keep their distance because of her passive glow if she holds it up, she can't hold it up for long, and when jumping on someone, this part of the damage is delayed. I do request that her passive damage is retained so that she can also maintain some DPS in longer, sustained fights where she can't burst someone from 100-0.\n\nDiana's Q: just a 5 mana reduction buff. Not much to say here.\n\nDiana's W: a larger mana reduction buff, combined with a slight lowering of base value in exchange for 10% bonus HP scaling. I'm okay with this, because it opens up Diana's build to incorporate items like Rod of Ages, for a more bruiser-style build. But if Diana is being encouraged to build bruiser style, why must her passive's damage ratio, her main source of consistent DPS over a sustained fight, be nerfed? That seems to be contradictory with each other.\n\nDiana's new E, Lunar Rush:\n\n* Here's something that I would like to bring up that's unrelated to any buffs/nerfs. I, and I'm sure countless other Diana mains out there, have deeply ingrained muscle memory of QRR combos and so on. Changing her dash from R to E seems like it will be an extreme hassle for us to get accustomed to. I know that if this goes through, I will be swapping my R and E keybinds to each other whenever I want to play Diana. However, even Diana mains want to play other champions on occasion! Is there any way that Riot can consider keeping Lunar Rush on R still, but allowing her to level it pre-6, similar to how Udyr can? I would like to ask if the cost of that would outweigh all the re-learning that all Diana players must put in to get used to using her dash on a new key, or swapping her R and E keybinds like I plan on doing should this change go through.\n\n* The damage has been nerfed in exchange for allowing Diana to access this spell and its mobility from level 1 onwards. This seems fair enough, as obviously nobody wants Diana to become a super oppressive level 2 champion all of a sudden with this change.\n\nDiana's new R, Moonfall:\n\n* Swapped with Lunar Rush (E)\n100/90/80s Cooldown\n100 Mana\nReveals and draws in all nearby enemies and slows them by 40/50/60% for 2 seconds.\nIf Diana pulls in one or more enemy champions, the moonlight crashes down onto her after 1 second, dealing 200/300/400 (+60% AP) magic damage in an area around her, increased by 35/60/85 (+15% AP) for each target beyond the first pulled.\n\n* The above is a copy paste from surrender@20's info on Diana's new ultimate. Here's my takeaway:\n\n* Diana's identity that I presume most Diana mains will agree with me on is as an assassin with relatively lower cooldowns than others, in exchange for a lack of utility. Her kit as it currently stands is basically just damage, with a minor slow/pull that nobody will ever say is the main reason they pick her. In fact, prior to the old Moonfall E rework that coupled attack speed to it, I would never even level her E until level 13, and was quite successful with that even in high diamond back in the day.\n\n* Thus, having a 100 second CD, high impact ultimate doesn't seem to fit the fantasy that I, and other Diana players (forgive me for presuming about what other Diana players want though) would like to see. I would be quite happy instead to see an ultimate with half the cooldown and half the damage. Or, better yet, if her ultimate had 20-30~ seconds CD just like before. Low impact is fine. What's important is the ability to make plays.\n\n* It feels really, really bad to have an ultimate ability's damage be dependent on the opponent's skill level rather than yourself. Having the ultimate's damage be 100% avoidable feels painfully bad for the player. For instance, Malphite has always historically had a lower winrate in high elo compared to regular games. This is because higher elo players have better reactions, and they're much better about flashing his ultimate. A 1 second delay should be nothing to most high elo players for avoiding the damage as long as their flash is still up, even on a zero mobility champion.\n\n* Thus, my suggestion is, could the ultimate's damage portion be changed to be some type of skill check for the Diana player as well as the enemy? I would like to bring Zed ultimate up as an example of this, although I'm not sure what a similar iteration would be like for Diana. Zed is rewarded for landing his skillshots after he ultimates, while the opponent is rewarded for dodging them. That's fair gameplay for both sides. For Diana's current proposed ultimate, she has almost zero control on whether the ultimate's damage lands or not. Even if Zed misses all his skillshots, he at least gets a minor amount of damage!\n\nAnd finally, a few overall comments.\n\n* I haven't seen it mentioned by rioters, but again just to check, the goal is to keep Diana power neutral, without buffing or nerfing, correct? Let's look at the numbers on her changes. At level 6, she'll have lost 0.4 AP ratio on her passive, 0.2*2 AP ratio on her new E, and gained a 0.6 AP ratio on her ultimate. That's a net 0.2 AP ratio nerf. She also loses 10 base HP on her shield, but that doesn't affect her damage and there's the bruiser build buff later down the road if you build Rod of Ages or other HP. Assuming that players continue to max Q on her as usual, when we look at her total damage numbers at level 6, which is when most Dianas like to start going all-in, Diana has actually gained +80 damage, since old R (with 2 applications) and new R both do 200 damage, assuming the ultimate hits, and E now does 80 damage with 2 applications. With a .2 AP ratio nerf, let's say Diana has 50 AP on average at level 6, that maths out to about +70 damage in total on the new Diana's kit.\n\n* In a way, maybe this will actually make Diana snowball even easier, but only on lower elo opponents. Isn't this something that Riot wishes to avoid? Part of what was mentioned was a lack of counterplay opportunities against her when she was ahead. With a damage buff on her full combo at 6, this will only be made easier, especially because lower elo players have more trouble dodging something like delayed damage and higher elo players will not. This seems like it will exacerbate her problems, thus resulting in potential nerfs down the road.\n\n* My personal suggestions: keep Diana's baseline damage at level 6 approximately the same, meaning nerf the damage that's currently on PBE. At level 6 with zero kills, it's actually quite hard to 100-0 most mages as it is. Good Diana players weaken the enemy first before engaging all-in. Give Diana's passive damage ratio back, because it's one of the healthier parts of the kit, and promotes alternate bruiser-style gameplay patterns as well. Nerf the ultimate damage. Buff the ultimate cooldown in order to fit Diana's playstyle better.\n\n* Finally, what is Diana's identity, really? I believe that she's an AP bruiser-style assassin. However, Diana is a champion that has not been seen in many years at worlds. Her kit almost completely lacks utility. She has offensive mobility but lacks defensive escape tools (which is fine, I think she's balanced like this, I'm not asking for her new ultimate to tack on an escape ability or anything). She doesn't stand out in any one area; she has no unique niche of her own. But as for me, the seven year Diana main, I believe that pushing is one of her strong suits. She is one of the strongest pushing assassin/mages out there, and perhaps this could be explored as part of her identity? \n\nThank you for your time if you read this.

I started playing League earlier this season (~300h of playtime, Platinum 4 in ranked), so I may not have as much a say in this as others, since I've only known Diana's most recent iteration before the rework. Still, I fell in love with Diana since I first started playing her a few months ago, and she is pretty much my main drive to play right now. Thus, I thought I'd leave my 2 cents on what I've felt so far playing the reworked version of Diana.\n\nI'll be honest: playing the reworked Diana feels very underwhelming.\n\nThe AP assassin route has been utterly and undeniably gutted. You don't even get close to oneshotting anyone, even when insanely fed, which for the past season was Diana's defining trait. Her passive damage has been heavily nerfed. Her w damage has been nerfed. Her previous ult (now her e) damage has been nerfed to testimonial levels. It is almost purely mobility now, but of the worst kind, because you still can't dash to allied targets (the one change that would make Diana into an actually viable champion in high elo/competitive) to escape. Now, you engage with the same certainty of death (don't think going bruiser Diana helps any, because it doesn't. You will still die and deal little to no damage), but without any guarantees of killing anyone. Not even the 0/10 support.\n\nFrankly, having to rely on her new ult (her previous e) to even come close to killing anyone (still not guaranteed tho) is a major letdown. It feels like casting a watered down version of Orianna's ult on yourself, with significantly less damage, no cc, and abysmal cast time in comparison. Plus, don't forget you're pulling the enemy champions to you, so they can wipe the floor with you even easier! ;)\n\nOverall, I'm not happy at all with the changes as they stand right now. I've read someone comment, and I wholeheartedly agree, that too much emphasis has been put on making her satisfying to play _against_, as opposed to play _with_. Previously, if you played your cards right, you had a small window of time where you could contribute significantly to your teams victory. In her current state, she can no longer do that. In fact, she can't do anything other midlaners can't do much better.\n\nDiana is not special or satisfying to play in any way anymore. And that is just sad.\n\nTo end on a positive note, there were some things I did like about the remake. The visuals for one look really cool. Also, changing the dash to a basic ability is actually helpful in some matchups, and I personally liked it.\n\nOn the topic of possible improvements, what I would suggest as an easy fix for her current state is to bump up the damage on her passive. Put it back the way it was before. It won't impact her laning strength as much, because early on you don't have much AP anyway, but it would help her get through the mid and late game a bit easier. That may even make her into a viable bruiser, and give her some scary splitpushing potential. She would at least have something going for her that way, since she doesn't oneshot anymore, still has no escapes, and has only been given an unreliable, okayish teamfigth ult as a compensation.\n\nAnother way to make her into a champion again would be to finally enable her dash as an escape. Since she doesn't \"go in, kill someone, die\" anymore, because we are missing the \"kill someone\" part as of now, it doesn't make sense to hold onto the idea that she is an all-in champion anymore. One possible way to balance it, while retaining some of her old spirit, would be to double the cd on her dash if she uses it to dash to an allied target. That way, you would be discouraging using her dash as a disengage in teamfights, since you wouldn't be able to rejoin the fight for a long time, but it would still help her laning and overall potential as a champion a lot.\n\nLastly, you could rework her current ult entirely to give her some kind of utility (maybe a taunt? That would combo well with her w) plus instant damage. The current numbers could need some tweaking, to make her feel fair to play against; but it would at least bring back the possibility of going for the assassin build and oneshotting people when extremely ahead, something which sadly isn't viable anymore.\n\n\n\nJust my opinion, anyway. Thanks for your time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moonfall Diana","date":"2019-11-27T09:49:22.997+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, when diana ults it seems she spasms.

First of all, thanks for turning your eyes on Diana. And sorry for my grammar mistakes.\n\n_I was waiting this for a long time._\n\n   I play this game since beta(non-continuously but as a casual).And I main Diana with her realase.I love her lore and kit etc. etc. \nAnd I want to add my humble opinions based on this thread.\n\n   I believe that I will also love the new lore if it's gonna change. I thought this rework will be Katarina/Akali/Talon sized rework.Since, Riot wants her as a bruiser mage,I was hoping that she's gonna end up like Riven style gameplay. I do not know why but I was hoping for this,that why,I feel let down with this changes. I mean I fell in love with Katarina rework mechanics and Akali mechanics as well.And I was waiting this kind of a work on Diana for a long time.(really really long time);New mechanics such as her **Q** or maybe shifting phases like phases of moon.\nWeapon changes maybe ;New moon stealth assassin, Crescent bruiser,Full Moon shielding tank etc. etc. \n   But I'm aware that I was hyped from nothing.\n\nNow;\n\n**P**:Attack speed is awesome, mana remove bad move, and %40 interesting.\n**Q**:Very iconic ability thanks for keeping it.\n**W**:Nice to have some HP scale.\n**E**:Movement spell on E, cliche,nice and a need.\n**R**:This is where things get complicated.\n\n  I feel that new **R** doesn't fit at all. That felt more like Annie.**Q+E** in, _Let The Moon Shine_,**E** out?. And then wait for 100 second to do them again.While we can do the same thing now within 26 sec.This felt like, Diana lost her teamwork capability.No more E+Yasuo's R,no more punishing all-in Katarinas, no more you can't run easly if you turret-dive Diana(pre 6) plays...\n \n  The thing is, Diana lost her CC,and hew slow, which I believe very un-bruiser.And I have little concerns about laning phase as well with mana recovery,because Pale Cascade is only thing that Diana has to defend herself since Diana doesn't have a CC anymore. And she can't use it a lot because she can't gain hermana back. On the other hand Riven has also shield that she can rely on yet she can use it with no-cost beside she also has 2 CC.I believe we must consider a tiny slow on her Moonsilver Blade to keep presure beside **Q+E** till end of mana pool,but also to save ourselves. That reminds me there're no mage items corresponding to Phage.\n \n  I really like her new **E**.It's needed,especially in a world where there're lots of unending mobile champions a.k.a. Qiyana. With new **E**; Diana will become more dangerous before 6.\n\n   About Moonsilver Blade; I don't have PBE,that's why I don't know how it's %40 synergizes with attack speed,but I believe it synergizes well.The problem is it can be countered with a little bit movement speed unless Rylai's bought.However, I still believe that Moonsilver Blade need something to sustain health or mana doesn't matter which one.\n \n  Lastly,I've played Diana mostly a nuking assassin but I really want to play her as a bruiser mage too.And I believe her kit need lower cooldowns.Moonfall is a great\nability to play with please do not cage it with 100 sec cooldown.Thanks for reading and hope to see you all at the Rift.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bad at games","date":"2019-11-27T17:14:09.386+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of this looks, sounds and feels great.
