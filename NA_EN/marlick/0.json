I know that opens up people to not respect my opinion just based on ranking alone, but I feel I need to share this anyway. With 5.22 coming out I have seen a lot of negative feedback from the community, and I agree with a majority of it. There is no more  champion diversity... there are several champions which have become extremely strong picks in this new developing meta (a.k.a YASUO) and if you do not pick those champions, you&#039;re almost always going to have a poor game. Now many of this negative feedback has been pointed toward the ADC changes and the AD itemization changes, but I&#039;m here to talk about something else... the jungle.\n\nLike I said I have been a jungle main for many years now. I do not claim to be god tier, but I am comfortable in my role and I believe that up until now I have had a meaningful impact on the games I play. In this new jungle however, I can barely survive. Last preseason I thought I would never adjust to the wide variety of changes they made, but eventually I got used to it. Now that I have played a few games in 5.22 I feel absolutely **useless. ** On many of the junglers I have tried, I can barely survive my first two camps. After going gromp and blue buff (which was a pretty general start for me), I have to go back to regen. I actually cant even make it that far without a significant amount of kiting and blowing both charges of my refillable health pots. Until I get at least one fully built life steal item (which usually isnt until 20 minutes in), I feel like I can&#039;t even clear my camps without having to recall. \n\nThat leads me to my next point. All of the items feel horribly EXPENSIVE. On junglers where I build warrior, I cannot fully complete it until almost 15 minutes into the game! That&#039;s 5 minutes away from where the game is most likely going to end based on Riot&#039;s new desired game timers. I thought that perhaps that was the result of me having a bad game, but after testing this multiple times I feel like each game I am only ending with two completed items, leaving me feeling completely lack luster throughout the game. I feel I have no **impact.** I spend so much time and resources trying to survive in my own jungle that I can&#039;t even bring myself to gank. Most of the time if I clear two camps in the first 10 minutes of the game, I have to either go back or go get some autos off on scuttle crab for the health regen. Everything just hurts so much more than it used to. It is impacting my ability to generate gold and it is impacting my ability to help suffering lanes. It seems all I am useful for now it putting down wards and pinging where the enemy jungler is going to show up...\n\nRiot, please fix this atrocity that you have created in the 5.22 jungle. I feel more impactful on a support now than I do on any of my junglers.\n\n**EDIT** I've been trying out more auto attack based junglers that benefit more from new items and masteries (Hello Tryndamere) and I have had no problems with them. It seems this patch may have removed a lot of champion diversity in the jungle.

I won all but one game with Master Yi, and that was because their Yi got insanely fed (30 kills).\n\nSince I won 9 of those games, and 5 of 6 as a jungler in Bronze, I have no doubt that junglers most certainly can survive in the jungle. So I went to your match history to see what I could see. Of the 4 ranked games that you've played since 5.22 hit, you have had exactly zero (0) masteries selected.\n\nLet this serve as a reminder to everyone that all your masteries got erased when the mastery trees were redone with patch 5.22. Please go back and make new selections before you go played ranked. Your team mates will (probably not) thank you.

In fact, I tried KOG'MAW jungle (Fervor > Warlord's on Kog, btw) with straight AS runes and masteries for 5+ games, didn't die ONCE to a neutral creep. In fact, I usually got a FULL CLEAR (including Scuttlers because Silvers dunno how to deny heals to a squishy jungler) before I needed to back.\n\nYes, his clearing IS incredible for a Marksman, so take this for what you will. Guess what? Graves is supposed to be really good as a jungler now too. True, Kog'Maw can't gank very well (Red buff + lvl 6 + enemy didn't see you coming + follow-up is almost always a kill tho, his new ult rocks), but what he lacks for in ganking, he makes up for in late-game. As long as your lanes break roughly even (\"Roughly even\" can be, give or take, between 0 and 3 deaths in 20 minutes and between 0 and 4 kills) and help when invaded, you're golden to do fine.\n\nGet Devourer (I recommend either Red Knife or Teal Knife, Red for fighting or Teal for vision control) > Hurricane (Teamfight and waveclear) > Greaves (I recommend Homeguards over Furor) > Shiv/PD (Shiv = more damage, but less durability in a 1-on-1, PD = less initial damage, but better durability 1-on-1) > PD/Shiv (Whichever you didn't get) > BoRK/LDR (BoRK grants more AS, but no Armor Pen.

Why he hasn't gotten any buffs yet is beyond me, he was already doing terrible at the conclusion of season 5. Personally, I would go as far as saying he's the weakest primary jungler champion right now. He's squishy, his sustain is poor, he has no hard CC, his damage is abysmal until he starts to snowball, which is difficult to do anyways. There's nothing going for him outside of his reset mechanics.
