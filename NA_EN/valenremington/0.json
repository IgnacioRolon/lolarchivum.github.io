I loved League back then. I spent hundreds of dollars on this game over the years and then I quit September 2018 when I realized the dope-smoking monkeys that run this company will obsessively change things #BcuzReazunzNubs #$$$$$ #ooohshiny #yasuo #yasuo #yasuo and NEVER actually improve the game.\r\n\r\nTonight an ad for League pops on my computer so I thought I&rsquo;d log back in to the forums to see if anything changed. Nope. It&rsquo;s still sh*t and they can&rsquo;t balance it to save their lives. All they can do is continue to rope in new players who have no idea what this shiny trash truly is. I personally know well over a dozen people who used to play League religiously and now they won&rsquo;t touch it. I won&rsquo;t touch it. And I have a lot of influence in my sphere. Good job Riot, you will never see another dime from me or my friends again. The TenCent ChiComs can eat it.\r\n\r\nMy warning to new players: this game will make you hate your life. It looks amazing at first and then it sucks you into a dark hole like heroin, draining your soul one queue at a time.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-01-22T04:00:51.821+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Truly qualified to judge the game by the posts of angry children on the boards.\n\nWhich, incidentally, have always been meaningless trash.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2019-01-22T04:07:51.399+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"can confirm","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shandrake","date":"2019-01-22T06:08:20.839+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing since 2010 and this game has done nothing to me.\n\n\nThis is a YOU problem, as evident from your post.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2019-01-22T06:01:29.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yet you not only made a post, but even came back after seeing the AD.\n\nYou miss the game, you're just made that the current state isn't what you would like.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nimblepaw","date":"2019-01-22T04:18:43.530+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I truly dislike how certain less popular champions can be left in an unplayable state for years or months whilst ignored.
