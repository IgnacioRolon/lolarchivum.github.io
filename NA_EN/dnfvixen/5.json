Due to my ADC killing maybe 2-4 minions a wave and the fact i couldn&#039;t collect the coins that dropped, I WAS SCREWED! Coin was the item we bought to play SAFE, you removed that from us and making it so it relies on your ADC killing minions kinda punishes supports who like playing bronze because ADCs in bronze CANNOT CS, they suck at it bad. This is the worst thing riot has done yet, I thought they hated us supports? Now I KNOW they hate us supports. Honestly first they nerf and attack our mana regen and items we built on champions like Sona, now they pull this? Coin was the ONLY item squishy supports could get if they needed to play very safe, now you force us into the front lines to collect coins where we are GAREN-TEED to get fucked. Stop thinking of only the high elo players and think of everyone for once. FYI, coin wasn&#039;t boring to us, we rather enjoyed it the way it was.","replies":[{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2017-05-04T13:37:26.742+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Regardless of whether or not you enjoyed playing that way, a lane where literally nothing happens because the support plays super safe, and just heals the ADC, is not fun.

You get gold every few seconds, ill admit Ancient Coin got the short end of the stick but that's because the item has and always will be a terrible choice unless they break it. 20g boosts/mana boosts for supports are extremely strong for the laning phase and people forget that, would you rather Soraka/Sona never run out of mana? Would you rather thresh get souls on top of 20g per soul. Why do you think Soraka and Sona etc,. would grab Ancient Coin? Because the gold per second off minion death would put them far enough ahead that it didn't matter. This is better as it actually promotes you to take risks for gold just like everyone else.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Anastaecia","date":"2017-05-04T13:15:17.953+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still trying to figure out why Riot keeps throwing us all these crappy attempts at making \"support more fun to play.\"\n\nKILLS!\n\nThat's it Riot!

You see coin just leaves it way to open for the enemy laners to deny them gold and punish them for even trying.  You really need to open your eyes to what players say rito because you obviously don't give 2 fucks about what the normal players think. {{champion:1}} \n\nSince new coin I have yet to see any rakas in game.

You can dodge every skill shot, but you heal up the ADC and you have no way to recover the health loss.  If you Q away to try and heal you have no mana to heal. You don't Q you have no health to heal.  Basically Raka is just a moving target now trying to pick up coins, like playing dodge ball or frogger.  Give back the health gain on CS and coin will be fine with the interaction of picking up the drops.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2017-05-05T02:15:04.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Lynn ^_^\n\nBronze cs is the best cs, this new coin is funn~","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-05-04T14:13:55.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your adc's ability to cs has no impact on your ability to get coin drops and gather coins, are you sure you really played a game with it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"robotmaster","date":"2017-05-04T15:12:31.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like this little mini game I can do something in lane now and I may try Janna for once.","replies":[]},{"poster":"meowwow7","date":"2017-05-04T12:49:04.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yeah it seems like a nerf to raka but a buff to janna because of the mana coins dropping","replies":[]},{"poster":"StoryDuck","date":"2017-05-04T13:25:50.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Actually, I like the new coin line.
