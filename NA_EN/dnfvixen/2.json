Her lore mentions her village and her parents, yet since they are NOW spirits that form around ideals does that not mean that lulu is not a yordle or are you guys just BAD at keeping your lore straight.  Your CONTRADICTION does not only fuck up Lulu&#039;s lore it also fucks up a LOT thanks around a lot of lore you guys already had in place, also what you said ALSO makes them not only a &quot;small&quot; race but that would make it so they are also small in number rather then a thriving big race. Making it so they are spirits that manifest around ideals is probably the WORST idea you guys have ever had.  By far the worst.  I am saying this after my friends and I all ranted in agreement that you guys have yet again taken something good and just fucking ruined it.  By far the WORST idea you have ever had Riot.  By far the fucking worst. {{champion:78}} \r\n\r\nAlso since you made it sound like there wouldn&#039;t be that many Yordles wouldn&#039;t that then mean bandle city wouldn&#039;t really exist? {{champion:18}} \r\n\r\nYou making Yordles spirits was by far the WORST idea you guys have ever had.  Hire new lore makers.{{champion:117}} \r\n\r\nYordles being flesh and blood creatures that live and have children and have their own cultures and THRIVED was actually good lore and gave the race something for people to grab onto and want more lore on them.  Making them spirits makes them a rather hollow snowflakey race that not many would be interested in the lore that you would make for them.  As someone who spends all their time reading books and stories let me say this.  If they are flesh, blood and completely mortal people will be more interested in their lore.\r\n\r\nIf you got something good don&#039;t change it into something bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-08-15T19:45:17.214+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Yordles aren't spirits; they're just hard to perceive. They are flesh and blood, but exist in weird ways. Yordles don't have to manifest around human ideals, but they can if they want; it's a matter of choice. Kled, Poppy and potentially Kennen are the most evident examples of this, while you have yordles like Teemo and Tristana who're seemingly not like that at all.\n\nOn the Lulu point, there's an easy explanation; Lulu found the Fae and the Glade far more interesting and inspiring to her, so she chose to manifest around their worldly views and beliefs as opposed to any human culture, becoming a rather peculiar little mage as a result. The ageing details a bit borked though I'll give you that.\n\nAlso yordles, being hard to perceive, can be and generally are all over the place. Poppy's lore actually makes reference to this, where she \"revealed herself to Orlon\". It wasn't that she was hiding from Orlon or the other humans, it was that, as a yordle, they couldn't perceive her until she manifested around the ideals she saw in them, and so they came to see her in the way she wanted to be seen by them.\n\nBandle City does exist, but humans can't really reach it without some insane magic. Beyond the scope of human perception doesn't mean it's physically intangible, just that it's something humans just wouldn't catch on to. To draw back to an example used before look at light, and how we as humans can percieve visible light but there's light beyond that we just can't pick up on with our eyes, but it still exists. We as humans have developed ways to detect and interact with it, but at the base level we can't. It's like that with yordles; they exist in odd ways which are hard for humans to percieve, but in this case the yordles can affect how they are perceived if they so choose to, and that perception can change depending on the person, since if a yordle's embodying ideals of a culture how a person views that ideal will change their perception of the yordle in question, and magic is a thing that also affects this; yordles are all innately magical after all. Poppy and Kled probably look different in some way to everyone they come across, and there aren't many people who really truly understand yordles. Thus far we've only seen two humans with that kind of insight: Illaoi and Ryze, and even they probably see yordles differently to how they actually are. \n\nAlso as a final point, it's not like yordles, despite being League's original race so to speak were a very \"original race\" to begin with, considering when they were introduced they were basically the gnomes/asura/insert diminutive engineer/scientist race here people of League. They were just fuzzier than normal. I feel like giving yordles this kind of nature as not easy to perceive, living in their own ways but still being enticed by human cultures beyond what their own offers gives some room for developments and new characters among yordles later down the road, since now yordles tend to reflect the nations they've come to associate themselves with (if they want to that is), so you can get unique yordles from all across Runeterra. Yordles always fell in to the trap of fantasy race = culture for League as is the case with many fantasy races but with this I feel like this opens up yordles to be more vibrant and varied, more like the humans they share the world with. Humans are always highly varied in the fantasy genre, but other races generally get pigeonholed in to a specific kind of culture and rarely deviate. Right now this isn't the case for yordles.\n\nLong ramble is long and had a lot of the word percieve in it, so I'm gonna restock on my perception for now. Hopefully this made sense to somebody since I'm basically just going off conjecture at the moment and looking at what I see as a positive development for yordles as a concept; it's still really weird thinking about yordles in this way, but at least I can understand it. Maybe this helped someone else understand?

Which is why Kled is excessively Noxus in nature and why Poppy is the way she is.  They take a culture's ideals and manifest around them.\n\nIn fact, when a captain looked at Kled he saw \"an old man on a pony.\"  Humans can't see Yordles for what they really are.  If anything, to many humans, Gnar looks like a caveman, and only the Yordles will be able to tell that he's not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mistress Shyvana","date":"2016-08-15T19:31:47.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks damn.

You should have waited until said changes before passing judgement.\n\nIntact you jumping to conclusions is much the same when people watch movie trailers and somehow make crazy conclusions about said movie, like it will be bad, before you even watch it.\n\nSide Note: I kinda like Yordles being hard to perceive. If humans are the dominate race, I'd imagine they would have some kind of Xenophobia towards a very short and sometimes very intelligent creatures. I say that because most people would have some pathetic jealousy or just being arseholes picking on smaller folk.

Perhaps Yordles in Bandle City have children, grow and age as humans do in Runeterra. It's when Yordles step outside of their realm that their time becomes stagnant. Perhaps years in Runeterra is only days in Bandle City. \n\nLulu isn't a difficult issue. It is reasonable to assume that Yordles do have a society that exists within Runeterra. It probably serves as a halfway point between the faerie world and the mortal realm. Lulu got caught up in the depths of the fey and came back much, much later. I'm going on a limb in saying that Lulu could very well predate human society, so Bandle City was influenced quite differently by the time she returned.\n\nObviously Kennen, Kled and Poppy aren't an issue with the changes to Yordles. I would also categorize Heimerdinger in this group with his focus on Science. His neutrality doesn't exactly align him with Piltover or Zaun, but Piltover is a safer place to set up an Academy.\n\nRumble, Ziggs and Corki are drawn in by this Academy in the mortal realm. While Heimer is neutral, I think Ziggs leans towards the Zaun persuasive and Rumble is more in tune with Piltover.\n\nCorki... bleh. Corki has a military background, which brings up all sorts of questions. First off... why do they have a military? The most convenient explanations I can pull from are invasions from the Fey or the Void. There may also be wars within Yordle society, though we don't have any notable factions. But even with that pinned down, I don't think War would be a suitable focus for Corki. I think he needs something different. Perhaps he was drawn in by some insatiable desire of flight that he could only achieve through mechanical means.\n\nI don't think we really have an issue with Gnar.\n\nTristana represents another military faction within Yordle society.  Like Corki, I don't really enjoy the idea of a Yordle's focus being a Soldier or War. In all honesty, I think Tristana needs a lore rewrite with her possibly being centralized around Bilgewater's concepts of greed, flexible loyalty and adventure. I suppose she could remain a soldier fighting off whatever threats befall Bandle City, but it feels off. Bandle City is a magical place. It would feel more natural for it to be protected by magicians. Corki and Tristana simply don't feel right for the job.\n\nI have a couple ideals on what we could do with Teemo. Perhaps he is inspired by old tribes of natives that tried to prevent the expansions of Noxus and Demacia. He might even assist Nidalee in her efforts to keep intruders out of the Wilds. Or he could simply be a guardian of Bandle City, striking down any mortals that tread too closely to their realm. He is probably the only \"military\" Yordle that could reasonably remain untouched.\n\nVeigar is an odd ball. His lore implies there was trade between the Yordles and human society. I suppose that could be true, though that really messes with different passages of time between the realms. The whole thing about how he was arrested and jailed in Noxus feels strange. It would make more sense if he was kidnapped and sold to some connoisseur of strange and unusual beasts. Or maybe he was acquired by the Black Rose and they did all sorts of things to him. I think his focus on forbidden magic and world domination don't have to change. How he was brought to that point needs a bit of work.","replies":[]}]}
