League isn&#039;t even at the top of the streams anymore, almost all of my fav streamers stopped playing league, a lot of my friends stopped playing, I myself quit.  I try a match or month or 2 with my gf but even she doesn&#039;t play much anymore.\r\nEveryone is getting tired of this snowbally bullshit yet Riot does nothing about it.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}
