Compared to his feline counterpart, Rengar, he doesn't look nearly as badass.\n\nWarwick looks kind of generic/goofy to me, and he's got kind of a lumbering run animation. Not very ferocious. Other than his model looking like a wolf, I don't see much else about him that's wolf-like.  Here's a few changes I think would be cool:\n\n- A model that has a bit more character and nuance (like Rengar).\n- A more ferocious looking gait.\n- When he gets a movement speed boost from Blood Scent, he starts running on all 4's.\n- For his ult, instead of him just blandly teleporting above his target's head, if he instead had some kind of wolf-shadow-like pounce animation flash toward his toward target simultaneously (without adding a delay to the teleport itself).","replies":[{"poster":"BlackSunNocturne","date":"2014-11-18T16:14:43.979+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> - A model that has a bit more character and nuance (like Rengar).\n> - A more ferocious looking gait.\n> - When he gets a movement speed boost from Blood Scent, he starts running on all 4's.\n> - For his ult, instead of him just blandly teleporting above his target's head, if he instead had some kind of wolf-shadow-like pounce animation flash toward his toward target simultaneously (without adding a delay to the teleport itself).\n\nIirc, I've heard that this is basically what's happening with his VU.\nHe's getting a bigger model. However, his ult is a bit like Vi's Q: A dash and the first champion hit gets slammed with the ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Werekin","date":"2015-07-12T19:08:46.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warwick has gone without a visual or character update long enough in my opinion. i think he should look more beastly since hes werewolf i think maybe midnight blue colored fur with rusted gold cuffs or bracers, have him run on all fours basically make him look like hes barely got any humanity left.{{champion:19}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grievous77","date":"2014-12-03T01:29:46.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His ult is gonna change?
