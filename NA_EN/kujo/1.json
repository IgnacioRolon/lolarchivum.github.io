Here are my ideas on the skin:\n\n* He's outfitted similarly to Special Forces Gangplank.\n* Wears a jetpack that he hovers around with.\n* **Voidlings(passive)** - are little robot drones that deploy with this skin.\n* **Call of the Void(Q)** - is now 2 directional explosive devices similar to claymores.\n* **Null Zone(W)** - can be a flame grenade effect or something. It's a bit hard since it just kind of appears without any animation from Malz.\n* **Malefic Visions(E)** - can be some kind of weaponized chemical agent.\n* **Nether Grasp(R)** - has him break out a large shoulder mounted laser(similar to the Spartan Laser from Halo) that blasts an enemy with such force that they can't move.\n\nI wish I knew how to draw so I could provide pics, but I can't, lol. Anyway, there are obviously some details to work out, but I think a skin like this for Malzahar would please a great deal of Malzahar players like myself.","replies":[{"poster":"Gaff","date":"2015-03-25T01:10:06.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make this happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-03-24T08:50:34.997+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"YES","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kujo","date":"2015-03-24T08:15:21.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I'd be fine with it being legendary.
