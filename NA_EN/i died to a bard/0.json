But one day, during preseason, I played Yasuo in a norms game and my screen froze. I could see my mouse move, but when i used Alt-Tab I couldn't get out of league. My cursor would switch from the regular mouse cursor and the league cursor when I press Alt-Tab. I tried using Ctrl-Alt-Delete and trying to close league in the task manager but when i used that, league black screened and it covered my desktop so I couldn't use the task manager. I ended up restarting my PC (Shutting down and rebooting) and It took forever to get back. Around 7;40 is the time I got back, and I was extremely behind and couldn't catch up because I was against hard-poking champs. Now when ever I lock in Yasuo, this same problem occurs. I had this in patch 4.19 and I haven't played Yasuo since. I'm not sure if it'll work now, but I haven't tried risking it yet. \r\n\r\nAny idea what I should do? \r\nHonestly, I think it's a client-based issue, and I'm wondering if any of you know how to fix this. \r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2015-02-03T02:15:08.763+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ctrl 2 with me,\n\nThere was a bug a couple of patches ago with Yasuo causing games to crash when HUD animations were enabled, as well as when your graphics drivers are out of date!\n\nYou can disable HUD animations by following these steps:\n\n- Go into a Custom games\n- Press ESC to bring up the menu\n- Select the Interface tab \n- Uncheck the Enable HUD animations box\n\nAnd then you should be able to play with Yasuo again. Please test it out in a custom game before you're hit with more crashes!","replies":[{"poster":"I Died To A Bard","date":"2015-02-09T23:56:41.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you!","replies":[]}]}]}
