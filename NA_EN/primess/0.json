It the next fastest internet speed you could get next to google fiber at nearly 1 gbps download speed. However, even with this wifi I can't seem to download League of Legends at the speed that i could other games. Overwatch, for example, took 5-7 minutes to download while I've been in the league of legends downloading screen for ten minutes and it is only at 30%. I don't know what is causing this issue, but I know for certain that it isn't my end.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-26T22:49:48.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually, the client is scanning game files up until the 30% mark, which won't involve your download speed. After 30%~ you'll start to download the patch files and should see an increase in the speed.","replies":[]}]}
