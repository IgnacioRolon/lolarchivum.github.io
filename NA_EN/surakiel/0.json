Just bulldoze the lane so your creeps don't die, and if she walks around them to throw a spear, she's close enough to eat a triple Q which is a lot harder to dodge and does more damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"V O I D B O Y","date":"2015-04-01T22:56:28.219+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jinx is way to powerful in urf","replies":[]},{"poster":"aaronautumn","date":"2015-04-01T22:28:41.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"you could just ban her","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-04-01T22:36:06.903+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not possible when you are required to ban Shaco, Hecarim, Kha'Zix, Sona, Soraka, etc.\n\n3 bans per team isn't enough.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-04-01T22:40:35.998+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"3 bans not being enough has been a problem for a while now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drakzul","date":"2015-04-01T23:02:13.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaco really isn't THAT broken.

Give her an empty lane for about 3-4 minutes and say good bye to tier 1 turret. Leaps within a ~4 second cooldown rate, plus the 1 minute Flash cooldown she can get away without taking too much damage. Can build full AD without attack speed because her Q's nearly always up. I don't see a reason to ban her. I also don't see a reason to ban Nid, unless you're a spear magnet then yes. Her leaps might be up nearly every second, and most of the \"unviable URF picks\" have some form or long-range poke or disengage (like Jayce's Mercury Hammer's E).\n\nAnd like others have stated, Tanks are still viable in URF. Full MR Leo for example. Her W is a steroid for her Armor and MR, and with it she can clear 400 MR easily with the right items, while her URF 80% CDR pretty much makes it up 24/7 365 while she Q's the living hell out of you.
