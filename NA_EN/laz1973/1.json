A little later, I DID log in, but I realized I had a VPN on.  I turned the VPN off, and couldn't log in again.  I turned it back on, and I COULD log in again.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean?  Is my IP banned?  Is my region banned?  (I'm playing NA server from outside NA)\r\n\r\nWhen I COULD play yesterday, other people were complaining of server problems.  Are they resolved, or not?  I've spent hundreds of dollars on skins, and the thought that I might be getting region-banned is really gonna tilt me.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-18T20:58:24.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There were service issues late last night that has been resolved since then, however, I don't think they'd affect your ability to log in today. Since you're playing from outside the US, it's possible there may be issues with your route to the server, especially since you can successfully login with a VPN. \n \nLet's take a look at your route to the server with a traceroute using [WinMTR.](http://winmtr.net/) Be sure to disable your VPN before running this. After booting up the WinMTR app, enter 104.160.131.1 into the host field, then start the trace. After it has run for 5 minutes, export the results as text and paste them here in a reply to this post.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Laz1973","date":"2016-09-18T21:49:35.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I found it a little suspicious that literally the day after the server lag issues, I couldn't log in.

But if it says, \"No response from host\" without saying the host address, how can I figure out which side of the pond the problem is on, and who to contact if it's a router issue?\n\n\n--edit2--\n\nI just successfully logged on.  I guess whoever it is they've figured it out.  Thanks for the link, that's a cool program.","replies":[]}]}]}
