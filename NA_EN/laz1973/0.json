I change stances but nothing happens.  I stop seeing attack animations.  After a long delay, a jg camp or a bunch of minions explode from the Phoenix that I pressed maybe 3 or 4 seconds ago.  \r\n\r\nSo. . . it looks like commands are going out to the server, and I'm not receiving a signal back reliably.  This happens VERY often (like several times a minute), making the game completely unplayable.\r\n\r\nThis seems to happen randomly and in streaks. . . I'll play all day one day with no lag, then I'll try for a couple of hours after work, and have constant lag over multiple games / router resets / comp resets / manual shut-down of every process I can.  Is there any addon/plugin/software I can use to find out exactly what's happening and hopefully to address a possible solution?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-16T17:43:19.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you're describing sounds like potential packet loss.  Your point on not reliably receiving a signal back is a pretty solid indication (and eloquently said too).  Run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for that match to really know for sure.  I'm also curious if any other champions or game are having issues like this.  Let me know what you find.","replies":[{"poster":"Laz1973","date":"2017-02-17T06:00:56.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't run the log reader yet, but I can say I experience the lag on all champs: Hecarim zipping all over God's green Earth after R + E while lagging is a little comical to see, but only the first couple times.  I used Udyr as an example because his stance-changing makes it very obvious when there's lag-- the stance graphic won't change until the server sends a signal back.\n\nI should add that I'm in Korea right now.  I played all last season in Korea, though, and while my ping is always a little high, I'm used to that and I've never had this kind of lag ever before.","replies":[{"poster":"Laz1973","date":"2017-02-17T13:28:40.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, so I had a chance to run the log reader.  15% packet loss. . . so, yeah.\n\nThe question now is what is suddenly causing the packet loss, given that I've played for a full season without ever getting this kind of lag.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-17T16:13:27.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update!

I'm suspecting it has something to do with network traffic at certain times of the day/week, because it happens at night time often, and morning almost never.\n\nBut yeah, I'll happily go through the guide and see if things can be improved.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-21T16:27:49.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for going through the steps, though it sucks to hear that the issue persists.

Commands seem to go out to the server but I don't think that they're implemented.  I can see them being input (moving commands) on the screen, but nothing changes for me and I can see EVERYTHING else happening in real time and my ping/fps doesn't change whatsoever.
