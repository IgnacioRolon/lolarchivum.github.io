Can&#039;t even get through champ select these days without toxicity. You literally grief yourself playing this game. Unbelievable. If a lot of these kids actually got perma banned you would see results.

Remember that when RIot bans people its because they no longer want them to play their game. Before all that you get different types of punishment. Sadly people dont take those seriously, and when they do get ban all they would need to do is make a new account. The point of any kind of punishment for this game is to reform. How will banning them right off the bat going to help solve this problem?\nWith that said your last sentence doesnt really help especially since i would assume most of these \"kids\" probably dont buy skins/RP, as majority of the people who do play this game dont spend a dime.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mlm olo mlm","date":"2018-12-24T02:38:51.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"And people say China doesn't know what they are doing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"R107 Games","date":"2018-12-24T02:44:19.401+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"We need no perma bans for verbal toxicity","replies":[]}]}
