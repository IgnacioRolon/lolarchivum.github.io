I know that it will assist her jungle clear but I can&#039;t help but feel that lane Nidalee might make a comeback. I really enjoyed using Nidalee in the Jungle but it is proven that her kit is way too difficult to balance around the jg. If she is strong she is too strong and now she is extremely weak. I&#039;m sure many other players would agree on lane Nidalee being best. I would love to hear how the balance team feels about this.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-12-02T06:58:27.680+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"We'd originally been planning on buffing Nid in patch 7.1.

I would love to see you guys atleast try reverting alot of the nerfs she has received since putting her in the jungle. I think she could jungle fine without the original passive on monsters change. And would love to see you nerf her jungle by reducing damage done to monsters instead of always making it a gameplay/playstlye nerf. \n\n\nwould REALLY love the W auto reset to comeback ;-; a boy can dream","replies":[{"poster":"SILVER ELO GOD","date":"2016-12-02T15:05:46.063+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know how many times it needs to be suggested before it happens.
