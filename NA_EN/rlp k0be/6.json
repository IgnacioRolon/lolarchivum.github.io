I don't think that he is either broken or under powered, but merely a \"toxic champion\" and I think the main reason why he is so is because of the mixture of his kit which makes him a pain for both sides of the map as well as playing as or against. When you're behind as Yasuo it feels as if there is nothing you can do, can't tank, waveclear. DPS. or farm meanwhile if a Yasuo is fed it feels as if you can face roll with him. The fact that Yasuo is supposed to be a high risk and high reward champion yet has an ability that flops or wins the game completely is the issue. That ability in my opinion is his windwall. Yasuo's other skills while people may agree or disagree along with his passive is acceptable and is fair game, but it is Yasuo's W is like a \"helpless\" factor. It either makes the person using it like the skill wasn't enough or that the skill makes certain people feel helpless. In my opinion a good change for Yasuo is to just change his Windwall ability to another utility skill that helps him. For example an immobility skill that slows champions likes Talon's old E did or a skill that prevents people from using movement abilities like Casseiopeias W does are some examples.","replies":[{"poster":"ReformedYASUO69","date":"2018-09-01T18:17:04.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you dont like him that much just ban him???","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AAAlex 123","date":"2017-06-12T07:24:25.514+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":21,"body":"The only players that actually want the {{champion:157}} rework, are these that can't play him/haven't played him, and always lose from Yasuos due to their lack of skill.\nYasuo IS balanced IF you know how to play against him.","replies":[{"poster":"ZapMyHeart","date":"2017-06-12T17:33:30.266+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":9,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AAAlex 123,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E0qm48u3,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-06-12T07:24:25.514+0000)\n>\n> The only players that actually want the {{champion:157}} rework, are these that can&#x27;t play him/haven&#x27;t played him, and always lose from Yasuos due to their lack of skill.\n> Yasuo IS balanced IF you know how to play against him.\n\nIt takes more effort to learn how to play against him than it is to faceroll with him. \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"velkhaz","date":"2017-06-12T17:44:34.133+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"but if he is on your team and feeds because he isnt a faceroll champ then the argument is different i assume? get a load of this shit Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"ZapMyHeart","date":"2017-06-12T17:50:19.393+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=velkhaz,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E0qm48u3,comment-id=000200000001,timestamp=2017-06-12T17:44:34.133+0000)\n>\n> but if he is on your team and feeds because he isnt a faceroll champ then the argument is different i assume? get a load of this shit Riot.\n\nGet a lot of this shit, Riot.

The reason why players do bad is simply \"arrogance\" when playing him. His banrate is also an indication of how many people in the community don't want to deal with him or have on him on their team. Even despite a ~50% rate, meaning he is, on paper, \"balanced\"? No one wants to deal with him or the players that he attracts. Why do you think Yasuo players are branded with the stereotype of being arrogant and toxic? Because there are some truths to it and he does have more negative players compared to other champions (other noted examples are Lee Sin, Riven, and so on). Read the boards. It's not just my own personal experiences. \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"velkhaz","date":"2017-06-14T08:19:51.437+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"no that's not what that means actually. and there is a term for that sort of community. its called an echo chamber. that's where people go to blow smoke up each other's asses and go apeshit on anyone who disagrees with them without having any factual arguments themselves to try to support. you aren't stating anything relevant at all. just recycled hearsay garbage that I've heard about a billion times complaining that you are losing games and can't win them because x did y and z wasn't there for you in time to save you and also set up the perfect play because he wanted to get towers and end the game.. that's literally just a meme in league where my favorite champ happens to shit on your favorite champ when you don't know the matchup, and no one wants to learn the matchup. you notice aside from him getting buffed due to crit item price changes, no one high elo and competent had any complaints about Yasuo other than he is too squishy to be a threatening frontline\n\nevery now and then you find someone that knows the matchup and they shit on the Yasuo and the Yasuo learns how vulnerable the champion is. if he is competent then he practices and becomes the godsuo that you always seem to feed, while you continue to baby rage the matchup and type gg and forfeit at 20 like usual. if he doesn't then he continues to feed his counters and flame junglers and teammates for being garbage. has nothing to do with the champ. that's just how people are in the world. you have dumbass self-absorbed keyboard warriors that know everything, and you also have contained carries that don't get frustrated when everyone else is ready to quit.

But once they do he becomes relatively easy to beat, making him not a problem for players who HAVE put the time into learning how to beat him.\n\nI think the issue lies with how much time and effort is required to learn how to play against a champion.

He is hard too main, has many possibilites or tricks to learn, he is so fun to play, outplays juste feel amazing  when you manage to do so and watching other player is so nice, literaly beautiful.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyki11","date":"2018-01-10T22:26:26.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo main spotted.\nGiant windwall blocking every projectile and canceling many ults, and he can stand inside it to be safe from all sides.\nShield.

This is well deserved, and no, not because I think he’s broken, nor do I have a hard time playing against him. I eat Yasuo’s for breakfast normally.\n\nYasuo’s problem is that he’s a “toxic” champion. Riot intended for him to be a high risk, high reward mobile carry, but the way they chose to facilitate his carry potential is inherently flawed. How, you might ask?\n\n-Windwall is a “get-out-of-jail-free” card that is both far too powerful and way too forgiving. It has no cast time and comes from within his own hit box, allowing him to block attacks that are practically on top of him and should be dealing damage. It also lasts a hideous amount of time.\n\n-Flow I don’t have a problem with at its core, but much like Pantheon’s passive, it’s both up way too often and does too much. In Yasuo’s case , his flow shield lasts a bit too long in my opinion.\n\n-His dash is essentially a free zoning tool in combination with his other utility. A high risk champion should NOT have zoning as a strength, but rather, a weakness\n\nAll in all, he’s not fun or interesting to play against. When I win, he’s literally just free gold. When I lose, I feel like I’m being beaten by a bundle of gimmicks instead of being outplayed or outskilled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VâÿnêGôd","date":"2017-07-03T16:24:20.432+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"i mean, im in bronze and he is rly broken in my elo bcs of his kit, but we in bronze dont know how to counter him that well, and a \"good\" yasuo player can destroy people 1v5 and i think he is quiet annoying to deal with in general, so i would like a rework","replies":[{"poster":"KiLLuaZoldycK06","date":"2017-07-06T19:41:38.075+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"i dont like how u said broken cuz of its kit. in bronze thts prob the mentality because many dont know knows wats good positioning, sidesteping ,orbwalking, formations, counter builds, ect. and they dont know how to play against thier strengths and how to exploit anothers weakness. \nbronze adc: jumps into yasuo and stands still while autoing then gets clobbered by bronze yasuo. \nhigher elo adc: how about i stay as far as possible from the mininos stay in formation with my team and kite effectively. yasuo then forced to fight only the front like tanks, or get clobberd by the amount of cc if he goes for me in the backline","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"saxobk","date":"2017-06-12T17:40:23.353+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't think Yasuo should be reworked but if he does then please not a big thing, just do something like change his w only or e only or q only","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tulare","date":"2017-06-12T20:06:17.499+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't think he needs a rework.

At 0.1 seconds, he's able to dash again before most people can even register and react to his position. (Average human reaction time to visual stimuli is ~0.25s.)\n\n2. The crit chance doubling part of his passive doesn't need to exist. The Flow/Shield mechanic is enough. Raise his damage numbers a little bit and get rid of crit chance doubling.

That would be pretty extreme, but I could see Riot doing it. \n\nUnless he's super fed, Yasuo feels pretty weak to me late game.

He doesnt have any \"good matchups\" toplane, because he is mainly vs counters like tanks or hard cc bruisers (renek, grag). This doesnt fitt together AT ALL.\n\nRiot just made Yasuo/Riven skin BECAUSE they're picked very often to make money out of it, but this is just how it goes every time if you didnt realize it.

It is the most toxic ability in the game. It allows him to remove interaction from many situations. The biggest change to his kit should be figuring out what kind of tool he can have instead.\n- Either remove or rework Windwall, or make Yasuo use mana. The fact that he can react to mana abilities with a free ability that totally nullifies them is patently unfair in lane to many champions. He should need to spend mana for this power or the power should be significantly weakened and be more like Braum's shield. Flow can still be there like how Annie has her stun bar under her mana bar.\n- Move the double crit chance from his passive to Last Breath. Instead of giving his crits armor pen, he gets doubled crit chance for 15 seconds. This goes with Riot's philosophy that champions should have meaningful downtime.\n- Last Breath does half damage to secondary targets. Yasuo is too overbearing in situations when he's snowballing because he can solo kill several enemies at once using this move that is both CC and burst damage and gives him a power boost after it. The AoE damage should be toned down without nerfing his 1v1 potential.\n\nWith those changes I believe he'd need baseline stat buffs but I'd be totally ok with that exchange because his kit is fundamentally game warping from its mechanics.","replies":[]}]}
