He can't keep it going very long anymore.  At longest, it's probably Q -> E -> Q -> W -> Q -> E -> Q whereas before it was probably something like Q -> W -> Q -> E -> Q -> R -> Q -> W -> Q -> E -> Q.\n\nIt probably was actually a bit longer than that, but you should get the idea.  The full rotation has been condensed, so it's only natural that the individual spells would hit a bit harder.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Revive Aatrox","date":"2016-07-14T06:03:27.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does show like a mage crit, just like anivia augmented E. Kartus got an Ap crit indicator aswell on damage of Q landed perfectly.\n\n  Riot already said.. champions shouldnt be about one counter pick. fair gameplay in all match up is what makes champion balanced. \n\nBTW Taliyah  got 420 base damage on Q(on a 4sc cd) which is by far the most insane base damage of all champion and its aoe and does bonus damage to minions. ( why the fuck a 420 spell gotta do extra damage to minions ???) oh and it scale 120% ap..seems like a kat ult in a skill shot.but it cant be interupted (thats probably the worst part)  Once she gets riley .which she always does you pretty much cant escape the Q full damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Succub√∫s GF","date":"2016-07-14T04:20:00.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pick syndra into him and he will be crying all lane.
