Mine humble peasant self is not worthy of thy gracious response....\n\nHonestly, I am working on some insane graphics transition stuff for my shoutcasting League stream, as probably this fall I will be starting a split long series called Runeterra Rivalries (Or Institute of War, final decision has not been made yet) where teams of players volunteer to play specifically as a full Void, Demacia, Noxus, Mount Targon, Bilgewater, etc hero's battling another Region/Faction's heros. I make my own stream overlays and animations and was hoping to use the map as a background after having some flashes using your (Riot's) crests and League of Legends Universe region's backgrounds folding together like a deck of cards from screen left and screen right, ending in all of Runeterra with the Tribunal crest and slick banner before the animation transition (used between champ select and loading into a game) blinks out and the match is on.\n\nHonestly, it's only a tiny piece of all of what I am planning on doing (customizing the intro per game per champions picked), and I'm not even going to be releasing the Runeterra Rivalries till at least the end of summer, so there's probably time for you guys to finish. Even then, now that I've shared this, you might ask me not to, so I'm not any worse off than I was before. XD\n\nWelp, I hope my small pitch sounded cool! It's still a baby stream, but I'm dedicated to building a uplifting, friendly, and most non-toxic community inside of the meme'd \"Worst game community ever\" to prove good still exists, and to bring LCS shoutcasting experience to players of all skill so everyone can have that \"Hero play\" moment, even if they're silver and will never see a pro stage. Passion project of mine. ^^\n\nThanks for reading my ramblings and for responding. You guys do incredible work and deserve all the accolades! <3","replies":[{"poster":"HonestJohnTheCon","date":"2018-05-20T02:03:54.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's been lore-style in-game competitions like this before, and I'd be interested in joining this one. Sadly, I'm a filthy bronzie and I doubt any team would pick me up.","replies":[{"poster":"XLNC Jake Kelton","date":"2018-05-20T02:22:55.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not how it works. On my stream, anyone of any rank can play. First come first serve. Usually it's something like one bronze/unranked, two silvers, a gold, a plat, and a diamond on both teams. Sometimes on teams smashes. Sometimes it's SUPER close. But we've had bronzes literally win the game for their team (An ashe that couldn't miss with her ult, literally slammed like 12 across map ults and won the game singlehandedly) and had silvers make god-like outplays. That's the point of the stream. Bring the LCS experience to everyone.\n\nSo for Runeterra Rivalries, you would just volunteer to play for a team a week in advance, then be online for the game, and I invite you. That simple. First come first serve.\n\nEvery Tuesday is just free games for anyone. You just show up, ask to play, get invited, and have fun. Myself and my duocaster cast the game and hype it like the LCS, and have a grand old time! They're custom games, so no fear of losing rank, losing stats, which makes winning and losing a secondary condition to having fun and playing awesomely. Even though I believe my stream is still in it's beta stages (trust me, I've only scratched the surface of what I want to do with it), I'm happy to give you a link since you're still interested. I just don't want to be a spammy streamer who tries to garner random follows to boost their ego. My goal is a friendly, fun, and inviting community, not another salty and cussing streamer. We already have plenty of those. ^^\n\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/jake_kelton/ \nIf you want to come hang out on Tuesday. Again, stream is still Beta-mode (which is why I don't advertise), but we're glad to have you!\n\nAgain, I talk too much, sorry for long posts.

So I dont think its that complicated to conceptualize the basic layout of Runeterra. \n\nThe wiki has a list of its own that documents every location, geological landmark and country (that has been revealed so far) if that could better help in some way.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-05-19T23:30:05.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im pretty sure tha it looks liike a planet, but i might be wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"XLNC Jake Kelton","date":"2018-05-20T01:17:20.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ebonmaw Dragon,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=BwEj1UNB,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-05-19T23:30:05.377+0000)\n>\n> Im pretty sure tha it looks liike a planet, but i might be wrong.\n\nBahahahaha, hey you never know, it could be a plate.
