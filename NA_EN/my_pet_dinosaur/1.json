I drove out and tracked it down to a siren randomly by a tiny baseball field. It stopped not long after I got there after going on for at least an hour. So I was left with more questions than answers and got McDonald&#039;s.\r\n\r\nAnd now to today: I asked some friends that live nearby, a couple neighbors, and some people working at the gas station not far away form where the siren was upon getting some gas earlier. There was a police officer getting a drink at the soda fountain and I even asked him.\r\n\r\n*Absolutely no one knows what the siren was for or why it went on for so long.*\r\n\r\nMy friends have no idea. My neighbors have no idea. People that work nearby have no idea. Not even a fucking police officer could confirm what it was, but he said he heard it too while he was home and off-duty (he actually lives a couple streets over from my house).\r\n\r\n#I fucking love October.","replies":[]}
