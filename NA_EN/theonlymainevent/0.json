So anyways, 1st off a few days ago before this patch came out, there was another one, the patch where Galio wasn't updated. On that patch, everything seemed to work fine until I started playing. All champs selected and off to the loading screen I go but then it wouldn't work. My Bug Splatter on my mac would pop up telling me there was an error and overtime I try to reconnect on my LoL Client with the orange bar in the middle, it would just crash the same way and unfortunately put me on the Lower Priority Queue with 20 min wait time.\r\n\r\nI thought it must have been the patch that screwed it up. So I waited for the latest one which was the recent one where Galio got updated. I tried it out and happy I was when it got to the loading screen with all the champs and pings but then it crashed, just like it did last time. I thought it was all okay cause I wanted to take the 20 min wait off by playing Co Op vs Aim which the game ran perfectly fine but when it came to Draft, it wouldn't load. Now its fine and all if there's a bug that needs fixing. I can wait patiently but the fact that I got put into the Lower Priority Queue upsets me deeply. It may not be the patch or it must be my laptop (MacBook Pro OS X) but I see no fault on my end to be punished with these wait times. Also I've re downloaded the game thrice now. And Im back to 5 more games of 20 min wait time cause I played just now and apparently it still doesn't work. \r\n\r\nPlease Riot, help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-25T23:02:54.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client is having a hard time loading you into draft matches specifically for some reason. Since you're getting the Bug Splat, it could be caused by a number of different hardware or driver issues.
