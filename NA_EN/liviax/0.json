Everything went as normal, until around the 20 minute mark I think where I disconnected. I just opened league again, logged in, and then I'm met with the usual client. No reconnect button. The game is still going, the timer's ticking on op.gg and it says im in game. A friend could even spectate my game.\n\nI could go in q, shop and whatever. But really I just wanted to reconnect to my soloq game. We were winning pretty hard, so I'm a little pissed :) \n\nAnyone have any ideas as to why this happened??\n\nI thought maybe op.gg was bugged, it says the game has been going for about 55 minutes. However the game isnt in my match history and there's no changes to my lp, so I don't think it has ended yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-08T21:50:23.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a pretty good chance that match bugged out and did actually close out completely. Sometimes if a game crashes, it will still show up on sites like op.gg since they aren't official match history websites and they don't have 100% accurate data. If you were able to queue back up, it's most likely that game crashed and nobody will get any penalties for it.","replies":[]}]}
