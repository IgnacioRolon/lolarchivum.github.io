The AFK checks happen, no big deal, but had a bunch of dodges when people weren't happy with their champs and couldn't reroll and nobody would trade.\n\nMake some punishment for people that dodge so we can really enjoy it.  Maybe balance out ARAM and ARURF by including champion mastery points and number of champs owned into the match making.  This way people with a small selection of champs they have high mastery with would be matched with similar players.  Say (# mastery points)/(# of champs owned) = Mastery Ratio.  Then new players with 20 champs wouldn't be matched with experienced ARAM players with 20 champs and ARAM only players with a high mastery ration (few champs owned all with high mastery) would be matched with experienced players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VivaLaKitten","date":"2016-09-24T00:40:07.991+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wanna play ap Nasus- \noh wait got Renekton, uh oh\n\nYou know, Renekton wasn't that bad I should try him ag-\noh cool, Mordekaiser. . .  .\nI hate playing Mordekaiser\n\"why do you own him then\"\nbecause I bought him to try him, then didn't want to waste a refund on him\nshame on me for not having an account of perfect spam champions am I right?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ItsOrval","date":"2016-09-24T01:36:53.815+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"No. Its all about who has that one champ that is broken af in urf.

Not because of what they did, but what they failed to do. They made it healthier and unhealthier.\nIt's healthier because the randomness makes it easier for new players, because no one is guaranteed getting their main champ anymore. It's unhealthy *because* no one is guaranteed getting their main champ anymore but are still able to...add in that the random champs given to you to play can even be part of the Free-2-Use roster which consists of champs you've most likely never played at all, and you're going to have a bad time. It feels pretty bad when you have a toxic Diana or Singed that don't know how to play their Champ, and then they spam the chat because they're toxic little shits who shouldn't even be allowed to play LoL in the first place. \nI also think it's bad because of the reason randomness was in only one lane before. Randomness is supposed to be a \"nerf\" in its own right to the game while also being fun because of that randomness, but it was only able to be balanced by having a single lane where everyone -- no matter their experience -- could enjoy playing champs from outside their comfort zone. But ARURF tips that on its head because now it's 3 lanes and a full jungle quadrant of \"oh look I got ganked by an Alistar who's taking me dry to kingdom come and back\" without even having the security of knowing how to use your own champ to outplay him.\nWhich is another point. URF is supposed to be incredibly fast-paced even more so than Summoner's Rift, to the point where it takes raw experience to be able to outplay overwhelming odds. Being incapable of choosing your own champion, and even potentially getting a champ you've never seen before, ruins that because now you have learn on the fly a champ you're likely to feed as anyhow.\nMy solution would be to change it to Twisted Treeline. 1) No one cared about the Jungle in URF or ARURF, 2) a large population of players now have close-to-no experience in playing most champs they play in ARURF, and having a smaller map and smaller jungle would make it easier to play for newer and veteran players alike, 3) because URF was already fast-paced, so a full lane removed from the equation won't change much, and 4) because removing 2 players from the match would make games be more based on outplaying your opponents instead of teamfighting or running from your opponent's full team (1v5s have always been terrible in URF, but they've been managable because you knew how to play your champ and outplay them; having only 3 opponents -- and 2 allies at the same time -- is healthier in this kind of fast-paced randomized gameplay).\nSo there ya go. I doubt Riot will see or notice this at all, because they rarely pay attention to any posts that don't specifically call for Meddler, so I have no hopes for URF to come back from its dump in the future. They already ruined Ascension and Dominion and haven't done anything about them, so why would they fix URF?","replies":[{"poster":"Naenia","date":"2016-09-24T03:47:16.274+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've brought up some valid points and I thank you for your insight.
