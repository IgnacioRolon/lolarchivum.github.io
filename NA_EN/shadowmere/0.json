Experencing Severe Lagging Issues In-Game!!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get about 30-35 ping every game no matter who is on my connection. I only have my computer and my Console hooked up to my internet and I experience VERY BIG LAG with the game. I can't explain it but the best way to explain it is that everything freezes but I can still see my hp bar go down when I die. NOTHING IS WRONG WITH MY PING. It just lags off and on for no reason. If there is a fix or if someone knows what is happening please help. I get Leaverbuster because it is so bad to where I cant even play. \n\n\n\n\nEven though my ping says 30ms. \n\n\n\n\nhttps://snag.gy/vKYbRx.jpg\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-18T21:15:32.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might be suffering from packet loss, which can still happen despite your ping.
