I would be very interested in seeing that. From what I've seen (Adrian and Dekar), if a Riven goes 0-3 top lane, that Riven is expected to be a non-factor in the game. A riven \"one shotting someone under tower\" means they have flat armor pen runes and/or flat armor pen items (ghost blade, dusk blade, maw) and are killing a squishy champion with little armor. That's exactly what a Talon would do to a squishy champion by building armor pen, so I'm not sure why you would expect differently out of a Riven who is itemizing similarly. That's what a Fizz will do to a squishy with \"just\" Lich Bane. \n\n\"Lower tier champions\"? What? You mean MF, Jayce (the good jayce players rush BC too), Lucian, etc. who all rely on it? MF having the highest ADC win rates while Jayce and Lucian being very popular in competitive.  All the while Riven has a balanced win rate and is not played competitively. BC provides MANY champions with \"no downsides\" (no downsides is arguable, because that gold spent on BC could have been spent on something else such as ghostblade or maw depending on the situation). How is armor shred, HP, movement speed, CDR, attack damage not as useful on MF, Jayce, Lucian, Zed, Wukong, Talon, Garen, Varus, etc.? \n\nAlso, armor does not suddenly become null with BC. That would mean that just by buying Lord Dominik's ADCs have made tanking worthless so there's no longer a reason to build tanky in this meta.

Every game I have played against a Riven goes one of two ways lately:  \n\n*  She gets incredibly fed and there is pretty much nothing the other team can do aside from 1v5ing her and sacrificing at least 2 people.  \n*  She gets destroyed in lane, so she goes to a different lane(s) and feeds of them until your only option is to 1v5 her... \n\nThe reason is because she snowballs so freakin hard, once she gets BC shit hits the fan. Part of that is because I am at low elo and no one knows how to do anything, but right now she can be completely overwhelming. I never have any issue against her until my team starts chain feeding her, happens every time because she just goes bot lane, dives them both and is guaranteed at least one kill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2016-10-06T21:23:55.770+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riven may have a lot but not a balanced winrate. \nBy far.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TrueNoxianWrath","date":"2016-10-06T00:23:16.454+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty for the quick response!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fadingomen","date":"2016-10-08T19:02:49.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She needs to be disabled atm.
