I do not believe with what chat logs that I was given along with my ban that It was something that I did personally, rather someone elses doing on my account. I've never shared my account and I really miss everything I had and that I worked for while putting in minimal amounts of money. Is there anything that can be done to get my account back since I believe I was wrongfully banned? :(","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-26T22:29:49.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can reach out in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and speak with one of our specialists about your suspension if you'd like.","replies":[]}]}
