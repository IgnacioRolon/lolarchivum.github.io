After several times of 'updating' it suddenly didn't allow me to really launch LOL. It would pop like a 1 sec > but it won't launch it or allow me to access it. I have restarted, uninstall many times. It won't work. Can someone give me all of the instructions to make it work again?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n             WeabooHunterXD","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-22T01:40:39.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like the admin settings might have been revoked or reset for some reason when you were updating.
