My favorite games are ones that last 45 minutes, everyone gets full build, everyone is level 18, and typically baron decides who wins. At this point, there is no such thing as fed. A 5/10 person would be the same as a 40/0 person (assuming no mejai&#039;s). This is when the game is most fun to me. I hate having one sided fights in crushing victories that lead to surrenders even if I&#039;m on the winning team. Fights that last a whole 3 seconds for an ace are just stupid.\n\n\n\nAs a side note, I would love to see a full build rotating game mode. Game timer starts at 45 minutes, everyone has 25k gold, both teams have 2 random dragons, and outer and inner towers are all destroyed. This would be all I would play as long as it is available.\n\n\nOk, so lots of people have said that late game champs like vayne would just dominate the game and that nasus and veigar would start with 0 stacks. So in my eyes Vayne and other late game champs would not dominate the game because you can ban like in normal draft games. And yes somebody will say then she'll be perma banned but would she really? She is a strong late game champ but if you counter pick vayne when you see her get picked then you will win her. And now that counter picking would acctualy be a normal thing this game mode would look a bit more like the professional games because in the pros games they have to pick smart choose to counter pick or pick a champion that is strong but in return they might be counter picked. ill continue to edit here if i need to answer anything. and veigar and nasus would start with a set amount of stacks.","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-05-30T14:50:14.429+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only problem with this is hyper carry adcs like vayne would just dominate this and early game champs that fall off hard would be useless","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-05-30T19:02:46.098+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not all champions have to be strong in all rotating game modes.","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-05-30T19:05:44.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:266}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:36}} these are just a few champs that would become completely useless","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"notice me Sin pi","date":"2017-05-30T20:10:00.516+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the blood moon game mode, all champions that were not assassin were unplayable, n rito was fine with it\nIn the dark star thresh game mode, all champions that was not named Thresh were unplayable, n rito was fine with it.\nIn the nexus seige, most champions not designed for waveclear and tower taking were useless, and rito was fine with it.\n\nClearly, making champions unplayable/useless in some game modes isnt against riot's philosophy, so i dont see anything wrong with making all the early game champs utterly useless.","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-05-30T20:13:47.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"then you remember that those where themed game modes not ones that just are focused at points in the game I am not against this idea but it needs to be limited so a large majority of champs don't become useless while having a single team comp be found that rules the mode","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"caIicko kitty","date":"2017-05-30T17:12:52.627+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"So one team fight decides who wins the game?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kozmo tin can","date":"2017-05-30T16:57:59.046+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would keep the towers up as if they are all down the game is only going to be about 5 min","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-05-30T19:04:08.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"get a ziggs and a single tank and its 2 seconds","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarbaJhini","date":"2017-05-30T19:41:10.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game would be too short imo as one teamfight and it is over, if done that way for a 10min game mode having to go trough a 6 min champ select it is not worth, also i think it would be boring too soon, the only good side i see in this one is being able to try different builds on one champion as by doing so in the practice tools vs target puppies and braindead bots is not possible.","replies":[{"poster":"notice me Sin pi","date":"2017-05-30T20:05:59.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it would not be short at all if it's given similar format used in DarkStarThresh and NexusSeige; 3 innings, each inning with 2 rounds like in nexus seige.","replies":[{"poster":"BarbaJhini","date":"2017-05-30T20:24:30.976+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well dark star could afford it as there was no champion select if you do this in this game mod you should not be bale to change your draft and stick with the same champ for 3 round, if not it would have abnormally long draft times.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Crungus Bungus","date":"2017-05-30T18:47:11.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least this would be a hell a lot better than Ascension or Poro King.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kirius Dark","date":"2017-05-30T18:16:36.172+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"starts the game at end game and {{champion:75}} {{champion:45}} has 0 stacks then?? bad","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-05-30T19:14:28.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could just set a number of stacks for them both like (off the top of my head) 400 on Nasus and 120 on Veigar.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephen The G","date":"2017-05-30T22:44:30.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"650 for nasus and 460 for viegar is more realistic","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Protoform X","date":"2017-05-31T00:36:35.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd also be fine with a variation where all towers are up and no one has any dragons to start with.
