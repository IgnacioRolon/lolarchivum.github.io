I dont know if this was intentional or a mistake, but either way it takes away from the &quot;ultimate&quot; of the skin.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-12-01T18:04:10.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey! I spoke with the audio engineer on this one, and the way this is functioning is working as intended.","replies":[{"poster":"Undeadphule97","date":"2016-12-13T00:24:09.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The voice is clearly reverting to the first Voice when you listen to quotes when purchasing items.  The voice lines that dont change as you choose forms dont get the voice filter that the form comes with. If this was something that was overlooked I could understand it, but knowingly releasing an ultimate skin with this just feels like Riot is cutting corners.  On the large scale this means little for Riot as much of the fanbase is willing to ignore this, but my trust in Riot has diminished.  \n\nThank you for responding.","replies":[]}]}]}
