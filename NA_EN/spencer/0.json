I guess I worry about the \"character diversity\" initiative because it seems to almost embrace the power creep in a \"this is how it is\" type of way.\n\nI also worry for those that like to play ADC in that it seems to be a pretty significant nerf to marksman as a class.  When the initiative first launched, it basically saw the end of the marksman.  After some buffs they became more viable, but now botlane has tons more levers that need tuning because there's nothing saying that a Heimer won't all of the sudden excel in bot lane which might or might not be bad for marksmen in general, but now every nerf/buff potentially impacts the bot laning phase which I can't see being healthy long term.","replies":[{"poster":"Tik115","date":"2018-09-24T20:32:03.699+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frankly before they can go for champion diversity they need to look at Powercreep both in utility and raw power\n\nThose two things itself make diversity tough\n\nLets take Support, Due to powercreep we now have more kill-lane supports and for the past few seasons enchanter supports have gradually phased out due to powercreep ({{champion:555}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:432}} (For a time){{champion:267}} (Literally a better Sona))\n\nI already mentioned the powercreep of ADCs \n\nTop lane you had things like {{champion:57}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:58}} but powercreep and those champions lack of either overbearing power or utility they are now benched in favor of supertanks or ranged juggernauts {{champion:14}} {{champion:6}} \n\nMid lane?

We already got a taste of that when marksmen were made almost entirely non-viable.  Then subsequent marksmen buffs basically made the botlane mostly the same with a few outliers.

That&#x27;s kind of my point (if I had one) - making marksmen more viable for lanes other than bot means you have to balance them around bot *and* other lanes meaning the balance of marksmen just got a lot harder.\n\nHere's the thing: Marksmen are currently set up to be the strongest damage class after a bit of being the weakest, save a set few like Lucian or Ezreal, who're stronger earlier on and pay for that later.\n\nNow the main drawback to this SHOULD be a more exploitable early game. Thus, the strategic lever here would be \"Do I go for the stronger late game carry and work around the weaker laning phase, or do I go for the stronger lane and try to gain the upper hand and close out before they outscale?\". If a marksman doesn't have an exploitable enough early game, then this question doesn't really \"matter\" because a marksman will be \"good enough\" early and most definitely the best later.\n\nHow this ties in to other types of carries isn't necessarily *sending them bot lane,* but more like \"Well we have a late game carry down there all the time, why do we need one up there, too?\" Any well made team needs a front line somewhere and some relatively consistent damage coming from somewhere. You also need AP damage from somewhere. Well, if your dps is some ranged carry in bot lane every game...do you *really* need a melee dps champion in top lane? If they aren't overtuned (Jax)...then no, you don't. You'd be better off with other shit in top lane. If your mage is bot lane, though, that opens up a need for dps in some other lane.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2018-09-24T16:59:15.089+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Though the downside (at least in my opinion) is that carries from other lanes that are created through bot lane diversity usually don’t compare well enough to late game ADCs unless they are incredibly strong.

He wouldn't trade effectively if Ashe manages the wave properly because of all the extra caster minion damage. It's the same reason why Teemo bullies every melee top laner in lane, because even though most can beat him in the 1 v 1 all in the minion damage of a properly played wave swings the fight massively in Teemo simple because as ranged he won't ever take damage from opposing caster minions if he plays correctly. \n\n> Let's entertain your thought that ashe is stronger early.

Fizz can actually beat Syndra in a trade Ashe shouldn't be losing trades vs Fizz before first back. The thing is Fizz needs to win the lane Ashe doesn't because she has much more utility with global ult/vision and she is much more valuable in a teamfight.\n\nBut all of this is besides the point because even when Darius of viable bot it doesn't push ADCs out of the meta.
