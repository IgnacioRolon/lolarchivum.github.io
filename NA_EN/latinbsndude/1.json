I lowered all of my individual sounds to be 50% or lower (depending on game importance) because I like to listen to music and play sometimes. I&#039;ve played against a Guardian of the Sands Skarner in Poro King twice now. Whenever anyone goes to capture one of his crystal spires, the sound effect overrides both the voice effects and sound effects (which are set at 5% and 10% respectively) and seems to sound at 100%. It&#039;s not annoying so much as it is distracting and painful to my sensitive ears; I was totally caught off guard the first time I heard it.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ranger XIV","date":"2016-01-08T17:25:43.172+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello LatinBsnDude,\n\nFantastic catch, took me and the SFX guy that works on this a bit to find the problem but we were able to find the issue!\nThis will not be in 6.1 but if all goes well we will have it out as soon as we can.
