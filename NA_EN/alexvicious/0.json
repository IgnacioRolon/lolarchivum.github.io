I picked my champion, was waiting for the game to start, and my client bugs out, freezes, and stops responding automatically closing it out. Is there any way to reverse the game loss? why is this even a thing?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-29T21:34:03.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you receive any error message or window when the client crashed?
