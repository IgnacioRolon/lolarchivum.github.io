Why is the NEW ITEM not getting the NEW PASSIVE and instead being a recycle bin for a passive that was cool on an item but now would make essence reaver unbalanced because essence reaver is becoming a viable option now. You could just change the passive a little bit and still have it on essence reaver instead of BRICKING the new item that looked like it would be really cool utility for melee champions. I was really looking forward to the NEW item to play with pyke or riven but now the item doesn&#039;t seem that useful especially since the returning crit essence reaver is going to overshadow it a lot.","replies":[]}
