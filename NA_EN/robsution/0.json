Get to level 18 without upgrading any ability nor using evolves.\n2. Spam Ctrl+R to unlock your ultimate, level it up to 3 and evolve it.\n\nI tried this in practice tool and I&#039;m not sure about actual PVP matches but I managed to pull this off three games in a row.\n\n[Image](https://ibb.co/demZ5b)\n\n[Video](https://youtu.be/glw5BxoGmT8)","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2017-10-02T09:07:39.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol rip.","replies":[]}]}
