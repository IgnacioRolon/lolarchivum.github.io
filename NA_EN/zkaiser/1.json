Where is the evidence to back your claim up? All we have is the person's argument in this one post, where they complain that a character was turned white. In what way does that mean they hate white people? \n\n> Then why is the post about how her skin&#x27;s white now? -_- It&#x27;s always about us, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s so infuriating.\n\nYou assume the post is about the 'whiteness' of the character's skin. You can just remove 'whiteness' from the argument and it would mean the exact same thing. Essentially what they were complaining about was this, \"The character used to be ambiguous, now it's not.\"\n\nTheir mentioning that she is now white was, most likely, not a complaint about whiteness. Rather more an observation that is the color of skin it was changed to. They probably would have complained the same if she were changed to look 'Native American' because what they are upset about is the change from being ambiguous and relatable to people of different races to suddenly being not relatable to them.\n\n> Also, don&#x27;t try to bring this conversation past the scope of what it is and then complain when others do it \n> *points to your response to Malicious Metal just below this one*\n> \n> HowDoYouDoFellowKids.jpg\n\nYou're going to have to clarify what you mean here, I do not understand what you are implying.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Korios","date":"2017-09-26T15:01:03.178+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This discussion is why we cant have nice things","replies":[{"poster":"GenoXx","date":"2017-09-26T15:27:09.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Well he's telling the truth.","replies":[{"poster":"HalfTangible","date":"2017-09-26T16:44:42.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"turned white\"\n\nEve was already white in her masquerade and shadow skins.\n\nThis is just an excuse to bash on white people because muh representation","replies":[{"poster":"GenoXx","date":"2017-09-26T16:54:23.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"No, its not.
