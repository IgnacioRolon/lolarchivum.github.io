If you're experiencing the same issue, try deleting the PBE and reinstalling. If possible, install to an SSD!","replies":[{"poster":"InZaneDMG PWNED","date":"2017-11-28T00:01:41.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm downloading at 468kb/s the game atm. It says 297 min. Going from hard drive to SSD changed nothing, is your servers speed capped on the PBE ?\n\nEDIT: I'm at 488kb/s, that's an improvement. My guess is that URF is out on pbe for a few days now, and since you guys are starving us with this game mode everyone just swapped to the pbe.","replies":[{"poster":"Banana 18 Bro","date":"2017-12-01T13:46:57.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same issue today.
