As someone who plays a lot of other Mobas with other ban systems, you should look into what they are really doing when they ban someone for &quot;toxicity&quot; and why this system is in place. \n\nLets look at all other Moba systems that are free to play and have chat services (most more advanced than this one since voice chat is harder to police). \nLeague has one of the harshest penalty systems there is in a Moba currently. In Dota 2 they actually use a chat perma ban as their harshest penalty regarding chat. This means they will not ban you for just chat, but will not allow you to use chat anymore. If game-play offences(trolling,leaving, ability trolling)  take place that is handled differently also by placing them into lower priority queues where they cannot play with those other than those in lower priority. Eventually if they commit enough offences they can escalate to actual bans for game-play offences but these are very rare and don&#039;t take place often since lower priority is a hell placed upon this earth and only the worst of the worst get placed there (like seriously ask any other dota 2 player about lower priority, they know its worse than bronze 5 or the worst trolling you could ever imagine.)\n\nTLDR: Lower Priority is a hell that will scare you straight \n\nBut repeated homophobic or racial slurs are some of the only way to get you permabanned but usually ends with a chat ban unless the statements were found to be especially egregious. \n\nNow Heroes of the Storm have this exact same ban policy except theirs is designed to double your silence penalty every time you get one. So eventually while not perma-chat banned you won&#039;t be using chat for the rest of your natural days on that account. Same for their other game, Overwatch has the same system since it makes sense to implement the same system on multiple products, but Heroes of the Storm basically had this first since it was released first (so no its not a system just for FPSs)\n\n\n(BEAR WITH ME SOME MATH AND LOGIC ARE COMING)\n\nSo why do all these other games that are free to play also implement these systems in this way and why does Riot implement theirs in another? \n\nWell, they sell their champs for real world money, and dota 2 gives all of their heroes for free. Dota 2 actually created a system that can deal with toxic individual by putting them with their own game-play types or silencing them so they can no longer be negative.  HOT also charges money for heroes so why do they do this? Well they have many fewer heroes and takes less time to earn and accounts can be farmed much easier to unlock everything and with less money. So they have less of an interest monetarily in banning accounts and actively fixing their community. If you want the math I have included it below(might be more now the analysis was done awhile back in Septmeber 2015). Not to mention you also have to grind out the runes so you have less IP for champs so you have to buy more if you want all champs and HOT has no runes. So by banning an account with 60+ champs they actively can reap the reward of someone starting a new account if they want the same champs they had. This is the only system that actively hurts players for having negative actions and they also have the highest amount to earn since they know most players will attempt to create new accounts if they like the game, not to mention if they actually want their old skins/rune pages back. \n\n\nSO\nwith all that said we can deduct that Riot has the highest interest in banning players rather than actively implementing a solution that actively fixes the community and their actions. \n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSo why don&#039;t they implement silencing like other ban systems have? Well they can earn a lot off the player base that gets new accounts under this system and let them run another train of toxicity on the community with their newly purchased accounts. So at the end of the day if you want to actually fix your community stop supporting a temp fix that they can buy their ways around if they have the money.  \n\n\nIF ANYONE NEEDS ME\n\nI&#039;ll be playing in a system that actually fixes their community and not here for sure. Tell me when this community becomes the lions i know them to be, because all i see are sheep that bleat the same things. \n\n\n\nI&#039;ll leave this for those that listened this far to type when they reply otherwise I won't give you much credit in what you write. (this is to ensure you read it)\n                                &quot;Rise And Rise Again Until Lambs Become Lions&quot;\n\n\nIf I get banned for this I won&#039;t mind, they are taking advantage of our love of the game anyway. I would rather go down fighting than live in fear. I would rather help a few sheep become lions. \n\n\nMATH AND VALUES\n\nLeague Of Legends\nTwo types of Currency: RP and IP\nIP is earned in-game, RP can be bought with real money\nRiot Card Rates: \n$10 US = 1380\n$25 US = 3500\n$50 US = 7200\t\nChampions: 97155 RP/486900 IP \nRiot Points = $674.69\nLeague of Legends: 126 champions\n\nSkins\t                                                          RP\t              Euros &euro;\t                            Dollars $\t              Pounds &pound;\n1.
