After that had happened, I drag and dropped programs and files (Such as LoL) from my HDD to my SSD, then right clicked and deleted from the HDD. Now I'm encountering tons of problems, was this the cause of all the problems? How am I able to fix these problems?\r\n\r\nIn addition, I can't Uninstall programs like League from the Uninstall Programs tab. I have no idea why, and I'm very puzzled. Last that I knew, seperate drives/partitions did't prevent installation from each other.\r\n\r\nAlso League, I gotta hand it to you, you screwed me over really f***king bad. I had like 3 crashes in one of my games, and sent an error report each time, was gone for no more than 30 seconds each crash and yet I got TWENTY MINUTE queue times... Like seriously... Come on that's messed up. But whatever. What's worse is that I can't finish a queue without a big splat, so I literally can't play. I'm about to uninstall and reinstall, but I'm stumped because it wont allow me to on the uninstall a program place on the control panel.\r\n\r\nHere's posts with slight different info about my situation:\r\n\r\nTom's Hardware: http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-3260856/windows-crashing.html\r\nYahoo Answers:https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20161204222234AAbsALN\r\n\r\nPlease help!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-06T02:21:40.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on your post, I feel most of your issues may be caused by the method you used to migrate from HDD to SSD. While dragging a program's folder from one drive to another may work for some programs, most won't function correctly this way. This is also the reason why you can't uninstall any of the programs you dragged over because they were technically never installed on your PC, you simply moved the directory and some of them decided to work.\n\nI'd recommend going to wherever you dragged League, delete the **entire** Riot Games folder, then reinstall League using [**this guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) to ensure it has been installed correctly. Let me know if you have any other issues with this.","replies":[{"poster":"MJayMonkey","date":"2016-12-06T02:53:05.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I did screw up, but I couldn't figure out what the problems were, and instead of fumbling with the registry, I wiped both my drives (The SSD and the HDD) to unallocated space in Windows Setup and installed a fresh version of windows on the SSD, I'm installing league now, but the punishment remains, even though it was only one game's (a One For All, so not ranked, I might add) problems and I have't had any AFK problems in a while (The League server shot me a notification and told me I had been better, as I used to have Power-outtage issues)?\n\nI understand if you are unable to change the problem, I just want you to know I have fixed my problem and apologize for screwing up that one game and making it worse for all the other players. But this 20-minute queue time makes it incredibly difficult to play a game, because I have to set aside closer to 90 minutes now, than the usual 60, to play a game. If you could relieve this punishment, or assuage it, I'd be very appreciative.\n\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-06T21:57:17.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad to hear you reconfigured everything to a much better state now. Unfortunately, I cannot remove or modify your Leaverbuster penalties. Regardless of intent, a disconnection negatively impacts *everyone in the match*. This is a big reason as to why all disconnections are treated equally by the system and why we are unable to make changes to its penalties. Additionally, you'll never receive a 5-game penalty for a single disconnection, as it takes a trend to see such a penalty.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
