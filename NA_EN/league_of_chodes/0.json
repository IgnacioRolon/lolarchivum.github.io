It was never this bad before recently.\r\n\r\nI want to play, but it affects the play of the game so much it sucks...\r\n\r\nI lowered all the setting to low graphics and stuff and still the same, even when I have nothing running in the background it seems league of legends uses a lot of my cpu usage? I am not sure, but it was never this bad, consistently every game...\r\n\r\nNeed some help, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"League of Chodes","date":"2017-07-03T03:50:42.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is a 2750 Ms one :D\n\n\nNETWORK DIAGNOSTIC OVERALL RATING: MAJOR ISSUES\n\nPing Over Time\n 0ms500ms1000ms1500ms2000ms2500ms3000ms\n\nYour average ping was 205 milliseconds.\n\nThe worst ping you experienced was 2750ms.

That packet loss is the weird way that your connection is being routed like I mentioned in my previous post, and sadly sometimes the issue lays on the ISP side of things so there might not be much we can do. \n\nWith that being said, go ahead and hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and shoot them those logs you just used.
