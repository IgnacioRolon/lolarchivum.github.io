A couple of your members voiced that there is a list in a metaphorical bathroom stall somewhere so let's hear it.  \n\nI can't make any solid promises but I can do two things:\n\n1. If you ask for something and we're working on it already, I will tell you. \n2. If there is something you're asking for and we're not working on it, I will do my best to tell you why and / or take those suggestions into consideration. \n\nThis may have been done before in a million places but I am making this the one place inside of GD. [EDIT] I will sticky after a few days and update as work gets done. \n\n\n----\n\nAlso, What's up. Can I hang out?\n{{champion:96}}","replies":[]}
