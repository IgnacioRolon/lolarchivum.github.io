Earlier this week we rolled out a fix for preview and editing of comments. One of the key pieces of feedback we heard was that creating comments and seeing their previews was distracting, if not too similar — especially when editing. The output was also different than the text entry. \n\nFYI: this rollout seems to have introduced a few bugs which our team are actively working to squash. \n\nAlso continuing update on features and fixes we are working . The Quoting + Reply improvements are next and may be pushed out as soon as next week, depending on QA and bugs (no promises but we're working hard to get it to you). This should help with the clarity of who was quoted along with conversations in both Discussion and Chrono views. \n\nSee below for the other items we've got on our list and as always leave questions or feedback in the comments below:\n\n* Quoting & Replying Update — *(soon tm)*\n* ~~Character Limit Evaluation (Comments + Discussion)~~ **DONE**\n* Formatting Update — *In progress*\n* Improvements to Comments — *In progress, part 1 rollout done*\n* Update to the Red Tracker\n* Pagination / Endless Scrolling\n* Bug Fixes — *Ongoing*\n* Continued Clarity Adjustments — *In Progress*\n* Search improvements\n* Mobile improvements — NEW\n","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2014-12-06T15:28:20.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any plans to introduce a few different colour schemes you can choose between... or the ability to customize the colour scheme in general?\n\nThis colour scheme is really depressing.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2014-12-07T08:10:24.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The team doesn't currently have plans to support multiple / alternate color schemes though it will likely evolve over time.

The options need to be built into the website or else they do me no good. Please PLEASE consider this as a major flaw of these boards, since I see colour scheme as a criticism posted on a daily basis.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Baron Von Bangin","date":"2014-12-04T23:43:56.366+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What kind of mobile improvements are planned?
