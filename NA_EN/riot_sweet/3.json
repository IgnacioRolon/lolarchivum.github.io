I guess a warning if you're squeamish about the mention of blood or anything, though I didn't think it was too bad ^^ \n\nIt was the scream I heard first, the volatile, wrenching cry of bestial savagery tearing from the throat of a grotesque banshee foretelling of condemnation, and beneath my trembling feet that were trying so hard to remain upright, the ground quaked in violent array of oncoming bereavement; and oh death, how she came on such swift, striking wings. It was within mere moments that before us, thickened dirt and sifting sands parted out in a gaping, voltaic darkness, and from it, rose a horror I couldn't even begin to describe as it loomed above us in the immense, colossal stature, and with widened eyes, I watched as it swept across us like a bloodied plague. It was then, I knew the tales were every bit as sincere as they had been woven to be, a tapestry of truth swathed in oil and dread. It was as if the earth had opened up and I was being swallowed whole by it, being dragged down into a void of a graven catacomb while the beast reigned freely above me, and I had yet to realize that I was already curled up into the seeking comfort of a muddled ball as I helplessly watched all that transpired around me. I ignored the warning cries to turn and look away, but it was far too late for that as I laid there, as I played inert spectator to the appalling perception as everything crumbled down around me in the red, bloodied fervor of entombing ruins.\n\n People I had known along this journey, some I didn't know as fondly as others, were tossed and thrown like rag dolls before they ended up in the serrated, slathering jaws of the xer'sai, heard the gurgling of their last words wrenching from their throats as the monster crushed them beneath her gnashing fangs flitting like razors, and it's something, I don't even think I'll ever be able to forget. Around me, she rampaged in endless tantrum, slaughtering, feasting for what seemed liked hours, and I had gone numb to the sight of seeing all those she devoured strewn across my stilled body, emotionally shutting down into a deadened coma until I felt as if I could not will back what made me human. No, for all I could think as she moved from person to person, any that stood in her way, was the grim anger of why it couldn't be me, and then, a strange, sickening sense of relief that it wasn't among those she picked out. Yet, I knew it wasn't with purposeful intent, only that of instinct as I observed her in this gore laden cage, as I peered out through the viscera that covered me in a warm, soothing blanket at what had given to me the knowledge of the horrors that Shurima could unleash. We had been far too naive, and I was the biggest fool of them all to think we were prepared for anything that came our way. *Gods, why did I not listen?*\n\n*This one is still alive...*\n\nWords, a hushed, saccharine whisper of venomous glee were hissed near the entirety of my ear, slithering, sibilant as a coiling serpent, and barely, I was able to open my stained eyes to merely behold muddled silhouettes, ghosts without faces as they lingered near me, laughing as they settled down close to get a better look at me.\n\n*A miracle she did not slay him along with the rest. She's staring to get sloppy or perhaps, she was already too gorged on the flesh she had already consumed to bother with the likes of him.*\n\nA man's gruffened voice replied before it was then followed by a snort, one of blatant disgust.\n\n*Or he just laid here and cowered so she couldn't sense him. Look! Not a scratch on him!*\n\nIt was then I felt the roughened touch upon me, bruising to the point I weakly cried out as I was lifted up slightly before I was merely cast back down upon the ground like filth.\n\n*Let's put him out of his misery and be done with this trash. We're burning daylight as it is.*\n\nI awaited it then, the finality of sweetened release they were offering for me as I heard the man slip something from his pocket as it hushed against its leather sheath, a blade surely enough as my blurred sight settled on his raised grasp, and I smiled, welcoming the end to the madness. Yet, it was the abruptness of shadow and clutching flesh that appeared into my view, and a strange, dulcet voice rose in quieted plea.\n\n*\"Stop this! Just because this man is still alive at the expense of his own cowardice does not mean we should dirty our hands with his blood! We should be playing our hand more cautiously, and even you know this. Besides, he could be of use to us....\" *\n\nThe man uttered an inaudible swear before it was followed by a restless string of angry words, all I could not make out, and seeming to be a language all their own. They argued for a while, back and forth in this strange articulation before I felt the sudden grip of a hand upon my chest, and I was once more being tugged up, blurred eyes staring absentmindedly into a face I could not see.\n\n\"Please...\"\n\nI choked out as I tried once more to seek out the end, but it was drowned in the sneering laughter of the man.\n\n*You don't deserve to be rid of your suffering.\"*\n\nThere was a violent light as everything within me erupted into pain, into an agony I had never known, and as I screamed aloud, I felt the blackness creeping up on me, felt it taking hold of me in a suffocating clutch, and in moments, I was once more unconscious.\n\nSo in this little tale, Aelon was taken hostage by perhaps some unknown Shurima band and sold into slavery, and somehow, he got around to sending Merina his final story so he could let her know what happened.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garlyle Wilds","date":"2014-12-11T10:02:10.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure about Merina.

The stone is likely kept as a curiosity, for a bit of sentiment - but only a bit.\n\nAelon I imagine always grappling for some form of peace.  His requests for relocation far away from Shurima are met by his superiors with mockery and laughter, because fear is unbecoming of a Noxian.
