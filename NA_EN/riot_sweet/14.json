A few things that have been updated:\n\n1. **Body text color **\nAltered to help with readability\n\n*  **Links and Byline text colors **\nThese color changes are to help appropriately place them in relation to more important body text and media. Prior to the update they were causing issue with hierarchy. \n\n1. **Comment Colors**\nThere wasn't enough clarity between comments primary and secondary replies so we've amped up the contrast and rebalanced them to help readability. \n\n1. **OP Color Treatment**\nNow less obnoxious and more in-line with the rest of the color scheme. \n\n1. **Comment Spacing**\nSmall pixel reduction.  \n\nThis set of clarity adjustments is the first in a set of updates we will be making to the Boards. As always, *and seriously always*, we welcome feedback, suggestions and thoughts. In the spirit of remaining transparent and maintaining open lines of communication with you all, here is a few things that are on our list:\n\n* Quoting & Replying Update\n* ~~ Character Limit Evaluation (Comments + Discussion)~~ DONE\n* Formatting Update\n* Improvements to Comments (both Chrono and Discussion views)\n* Update to the Red Tracker\n* Pagination / Endless Scrolling \n* Bug Fixes\n* Continued Clarity Adjustments\n* **New:** Search improvements","replies":[{"poster":"Long Schlong PhD","date":"2014-11-12T21:32:08.947+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any word on improvements for the boards on mobile devices?

I believe that clarity is good but vitality is just important.  These clarity changes absolutely make certain things easier to read and comprehend, but I'm a little concerned that the Boards is becoming less visually inviting in the process.  Here's our color palette:\n\n* Off-White\n* Light blue\n* Dark blue\n* Really dark blue\n* Tan\n* Black\n\nI understand why this is, but it's not exactly inviting.  It's all cold colors, and generally it's a few shades of only two colors (blue and brown).\n\n1. **Body Text Color**\n\nFair enough, seems to help.\n\n2. **Links and Byline text colors**\n\nWhile I like how they now match the platform better, they are almost completely washed out on the lighter-colored responses.  It's a lot harder to immediately see links than before on those replies.  \n\nAlso, links look identical to the interface surrounding the comment.  It's difficult to know what's a link and what isn't without a bunch of text around it offsetting this fact, and it removes color from posts.  I'll get into this more in part 3 and my closing thoughts.\n\n3. **Comment Colors**\n\nWhile I like the overall idea of contrast, this change makes the platform feel darker and more gloomy than it did before (which is impressive on an already very dark platform).  It feels as though all color is being crushed to black, even if that's not necessarily the case.  The darker the platform, the more there needs to be at least minor splashes of color to break it up and make it feel more alive.\n\nIn a completely opposite piece of feedback, the lighter-colored responses feel washed out.  The dark ones have very high contrast between the background and text, the background and avatars/Rioter titles, and between what is hard text and what is a link.  The light ones have very low contrast, comparatively speaking, and are kind of annoying to read.  \n\nI actually really like the dark comments, they look great.  The thing is, they **need** some visual offset in the interface to really feel perfect. Summoner icons help, but they are too small and generally match the color scheme too well to really make it feel inviting.\n\n4. **OP Color Treatment**\n\nYeah, it helps.\n\n---\n\nOverall I appreciate the changes (other than what's listed above).  I still think the platform lacks vitality, however, and making things darker overall without anything to bring life or color to the platform reinforces that feeling.\n\nThe default reply color is almost identical to the background now, which is basically already almost black.  There has to be *something* offsetting the extreme darkness or it just feels...uninviting.  What does the platform look like with a more colorful background?  What about if things have gradients/patterns or other visual features as small splashes of attractiveness?\n\n[Here's an example of a link on an initial comment](http://www.google.com).","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2014-11-12T21:59:02.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"[@Daen](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/8c9IuYWP-boards-clarity-update?comment=0004) \n\nThe background for Boards is likely going to be changing here in the near term which should address a few of the points you've made.  \n\nLink color is for consistency as well as de-emphasizing them versus body text color.

If it's not primarily black/blue it would help a lot, because with the current background the color scheme is, as I mentioned above, two cold colors plus black and off-white.\n\n>Link color is for consistency as well as de-emphasizing them versus body text color.\n\nI understand, and it makes sense.  It still feels weird to me that interface links and links that are unique and created by the player are the same color, however, because it's as though they aren't valued as being unique.\n\n>The byline color should fade into its surroundings for the most part as it is secondary information at best.\n\nI agree, though it should also be visible.  I think the color for the byline is perfect on the darker replies, but it's a few monitor settings away from being invisible on the lighter replies.\n\n>We can continue to play around with colors further but at it would come at the cost of other feature updates. I'm always open to more changes in this realm but it will likely be later on down the line at this point.\n\nFair enough.  I think a way I can look at it is thus: the dark comments look clear and in focus, while the lighter ones look as though they have a grain filter on them.  It's as though they are unnecessarily obfuscated.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Daen","date":"2014-11-12T21:42:06.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Here's an example of a link on a reply](http://www.google.com).","replies":[{"poster":"BADxW0LF","date":"2014-11-12T21:52:00.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeesh.
