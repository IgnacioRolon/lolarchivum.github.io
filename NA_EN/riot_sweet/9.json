If so please listen to community.\n\nI'm betting the issue isn't this ^ but that RIOT is probably so big and corporate now that they have so much separation and departmentalization that each team can't really do anything regarding another. Corp's thinking \"k, we need a team to handle the boards, make sure people stay in line, and its something the community wants so we need to keep it up and running\" bla bla bla so they put a team in to do that - and they do a great job I'm sure (I'm hardly ever on here, usually too busy b1tc|-|ing about the bugs/lag etc while I'm playing) so don't pick on the poor guys doing their part to keep this complain box neat/pretty and tidy. This is why you have a -3 score atm. I'm upvoting you only because I agree that their are issues and that stuff needs to be done - perhaps someone in the forum department/team can help with the lack of influence they have with the dev teams etc and work something out so that RIOT could actually start to fix their sh1t before everyone leaves riot forever - I've never had any real issues with DOTA2 (for example, not a hijack) it's just a more complex/difficult/new and different game you need to learn. I think there are more trolls on league because so many bugs are so well known. ANYWAYS.... Happy Holidays etc \n\n{{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"Formguy","date":"2014-12-18T17:41:06.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happy snowdown guys, make sure to {{champion:201}} up and throw them poros {{summoner:31}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DracosKasu","date":"2014-12-18T04:03:44.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way of the poro charge on the pic remind me Worms Armageddon.
