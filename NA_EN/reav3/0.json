Ever since the Ryze visual and gameplay update (VGU) was announced we have been seeing a lot of questions regarding Ryze and why we&#039;re working on him. I thought it might be good to outline some of the reasons we chose to do a bigger Ryze update so soon after the last one. \r\n**\r\nWhy another Ryze Update?**\r\n\r\n    The decision to prioritize a Ryze VGU was actually due to many small reasons that came together to justify an update. I&#039;ll list out some of the thinking below.\r\n\r\n    A few years back, Riot put together a team called &quot;Foundations&quot; with the goal of developing the look, feel, history, and character of the various parts of the world and its inhabitants. This is the team doing many of the new character bios and the big narrative events you have seen recently (like Shadows of Fortune and the recent Shurima Stories/Bios). We were talking a lot with the foundations team about Ryze and we all wanted to further establish his importance in Runeterra, something we&rsquo;d never fully solidified previously, and reflect that importance in-game. Since we recently changed our strategy on Champion Update to focus mainly on champions that need Gameplay, this alone wasn&#039;t enough to work on Ryze, but we did talk about it. That&#039;s reason number one.\r\n\r\n    The second reason is that honestly the last gameplay iteration of Ryze just didn&#039;t hit the mark we wanted. He is either WAY too strong in an experienced player&#039;s hands or struggles significantly in a inexperienced players hands. We have tried multiple iterations of &quot;Machine-gun Mage&quot; that &ldquo;does tons of damage,&rdquo; and we felt it might be time to try something a little different. While we still want to preserve the iconic feeling of a &quot;Machine-Gun Mage&quot; we thought we could take this opportunity to add something more unique Ryze&rsquo;s kit. By giving him something more unique we could tone down the &ldquo;does tons of damage&rdquo; bit. We also wanted to make a Ryze that had more interesting decisions in his kit and was less reliant on how fast you can push all his buttons in the correct order. On the surface Ryze&rsquo;s kit can look very simple but he was deceptively hiding one of the highest mastery curve kits in the game. The advantage of dedicating a huge art team to a champion update is that design is free to change and alter whatever they need to. Which brings me to my third reason.\r\n\r\n    Back when we were doing the last gameplay update to Ryze we actually were also doing a visual update for him. We had a model close to completion but lacked a strong narrative direction and Voice Over to tie his thematic together, so we chose to simply release the gameplay with a texture update. Having a near-complete model/rig meant that we could have an accelerated production process on Ryze should we ever revisit him.\r\n\r\n    The fact that we felt we needed to go in a different design direction with Ryze&#039;s kit, coupled with the fact that we wanted to reinforce Ryze as a key figure made Ryze a prime candidate for a full VGU. That we also had a 80% complete model and could do the update in much less time than a typical VGU was just icing on the cake for what was already looking like a promising rework.\r\n\r\n**Is Ryze going to delay Yorick, our big VGU planned for release after Ryze?**\r\n\r\n    The answer to this is no. Ryze has not delayed the Yorick Update. We currently have three separate groups on the Champion Update team. Two of the groups work on our big updates (Sion/Taric level) and the third works on the Roster projects, like the recent Marksmen &amp; Mage class changes. The group that worked on Poppy rolled onto Yorick shortly after Poppy released. The group that worked on Taric rolled onto Ryze shortly after Taric released. Ryze&#039;s scope is smaller than Yorick&#039;s and due to the reason I mentioned above (Having a near complete model/rig,) Ryze will most likely come out before Yorick.\r\n\r\n    I&#039;ll be monitoring this post over the next week or so, so feel free to ask any questions you have and I&#039;ll try to answer as many as I can.\r\n\r\n**Reav3**","replies":[{"poster":"DartExplosion10","date":"2016-06-15T16:29:52.512+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"With Yorick's update are you going to update his skin(s) like what was done with Emerald Taric?","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-06-15T16:36:58.734+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"We will be updating his skins.

Will the next iteration keep the same mastery curve? I like that when I do well on Ryze and Azir, people are impressed and have kind words on both teams. I fear he will be watered down and more accessible, which is something that needs to exist in the champion pool overall and I get that, but I fear of having the \"fancy\" feeling pulled out from under me.

(Sion, Tariq). Other ones are lackluster/ make the champion worse (Shen, Morde). \n\n\nWhy / how are bad updates pushed? I'm not hating, I'm trying to understand how the behind the scenes workflow goes, so maybe we can improve in the future. \n\nRegarding Ryze: Consider removing that CDR bs on passive. I think the \"machine gun mage\" is great WHEN HE ULTS. So he can only be a machine gun beast for a few seconds. \n\nPerhaps his ult can read \"Gain movement speed, and all basic spells have a cooldown of 1 second for 7 seconds\" etc\n\nThanks for being transparent.

While I don't want to go into a big retrospective here (there are other threads with those) I can go over some of the changes we have made to try to get more successful reworks.\n\nShen and Morde are 2 different problems with 2 different solution's so I will discuss both.\n\n**Shen**\n\nAfter Shen we went back and evaluated the entire history of our Medium scope reworks. Looking back our medium scope projects have been pretty hit and miss. Our conclusion was that by limiting our scope we make compromises are various things. Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn't. We have recently changed our strategy to focus on either class updates or full VGU's. While the scope of a VGU will change depending on projects, the idea is that we don't limit ourselves on scope and are willing to change anything we need on the champion. If Shen had been a full VGU we could have done bigger changes to his thematic/lore to match the new gameplay (like make him look more like a spirit warrior, or something more tanky looking) or we could have done bigger kit changes and made him feel more like a ninja. Going forward we want all the major updates to be the scope of Sion, Taric, GP & Poppy.\n\n**Morde**\n\nWith Morde it was more about doing a small gameplay update to a champion that needed a bigger update. We found that changing 1-2 abilities on a champion that probably needs a entire new kit wasn't the best strategy. Going forward we have been more careful in our class update selection and have avoided champions that really need a full VGU. This is why we skipped doing a bigger update to Swain for the Mage update (I know he got smaller changes, but not the size/scope of the bigger Mage updates). Urgot also got a small change but was passed on for a larger update for the same reason during the marksmen update.\n\nWhile I know our process is still far from perfect, we will keep evaluating what is working and not working and keep making adjustments when necessary.\n\nHope this kind of answers what you are asking!","replies":[{"poster":"Sad Tyrant","date":"2016-06-16T04:12:26.321+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":14,"body":"> First of all I don't personally feel that Shen or Morde are worse then before\n\nIf you are making statements like that, then you obviously haven't play them","replies":[{"poster":"Brown Monkey","date":"2016-06-16T07:45:15.290+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or he simply disagrees because that is a subjective evaluation.

He retained some of his bruiser traits while losing his infinite sustain capabilities. Retaining his Taunt and ultimate allowed him to keep his role as defender and initiator while the shift in his shield mechanic pushed him more towards needing to use his skills effectively to maximize his durability.\n\nWhat are the biggest gripes regarding his kit other than mostly thematically not ninja like.

Rylais is the most bought item on him for a reason, so to say he has no CC is a little misleading as an item that gives him CC is core on him, so basically he has a massive aoe slow.\n\nIf they gave him some real CC, removed his AP scaling, and made him an AD juggernaught like his brethren, then he would practically be the same, only the CC he had would be balanced around his kit.\n\nAnd the CC im suggesting isnt anything outrageous, its something like a 15 second single target darius pull, not gamebreaking by any means, it just gives him a little more control in a fight and enables him to actually utilize his kit.\n\nI personally have never understood why players cling on to the idea that not having CC is core to him, Its not thematic by any means, it causes him to be nothing more than a ball of stats and it doesnt do him any favors whatsoever!

He is a poorly designed champion that needs a different kit, mainly because of his passive and w. Also, itemization is not good for him at the moment. He wants the passive of rageblade, but it costs too much and is relatively weak. He wants to heal off of his w active with death's dance, but that costs just as much. He wants attack speed, but blade of the ruined king has a bad build path (note: haven't tried it recently with cutlass price reduced, so it may be better), and no other item fits him. He wants bruiser items, but they either don't have attack speed (BC, Maw, Sterak's) or don't benefit him through his kit (Triforce). Other bruisers such as Olaf, Xin Zhao, and Jax have much easier time getting the items they want. Olaf can build black cleaver to do all of the damage he wants because he can spam his q. Xin Zhao has high base damages to help him progress into a tanky champion that can still hurt squishies. He also has low cd abilities should he go triforce and can one shot if he goes full AD. Jax can easily tank with his ult and e. He has no sustain unlike most bruisers, but his spamability gives him great synergy with triforce and he has a reliable gap closer that situationally acts as an escape. All of these champions have much higher base stats than Aatrox as well, but because of the nature of his kit, he becomes overbearing if he has decent base stats. In its current iteration, his kit will always be unbalanced.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
