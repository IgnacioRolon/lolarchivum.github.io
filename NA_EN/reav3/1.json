{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2017-01-11T20:24:12.515+0000","title":"Warwick Skin Feedback","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":66,"down_votes":8,"body":"Hey guys,\n\nI have read over all your feedback on Warwicks new updated skins and I wanted to talk about what our thoughts are on them and also what changes you can expect to see before release (Or maybe even in the patch after release if needed)\n\nFirst off I want to say that our goal for skin updates is always to do, at the minimum, what is on live pre-rework  (or if what is on live doesn't work with the new direction at least something in it's place) We generally don't add more then what is on Live. This is because if we brought every skin up to the modern standards it would extend our release time by a fair amount and we think getting the base update out to players as fast as possible is the highest priority. However, we do try to squeeze in cool things that didn't exist before when possible. \n\nThat being said we have heard your feedback about the quality of some of his skins and we will be adding more cool stuff over the next couple weeks. I also want to address some concerns I have seen about Feral in particular and at least talk about how we landed where we did on that skin thematic.\n\n**Tundra/Firefang\n**\nFor Tundra and Firefang we will be adding unique or recolored Fire and Ice VFX to all there abilities, not just W. We feel that the green or red in Tundra WW case just feel really out of place and you guys where right to call us out on that. While neither had completely new VFX pre-rework we also don't want VFX that look super out of place in the game so we will be updating these skins.\n\n**Hyena Warwick**\n\nFor Hyena Warwick we added some unique VO lines and kept his unique laugh emote. We however didn't have a laugh on Q or his Ult which a lot of players are rightfully sad about. We will be adding laugh VO to his Q, Ult, W activation AND when he kills someone. Hopefully this will retain the feeling of the previous Hyena skin. We will also be giving him unique or recolored VFX across the board as well to better fit his thematic. As for pre-rework Hyena's unique run animation, new Warwick already has a run animation when he hunts. In the place of a run we added a unique Engine rig to his back that has unique engine animations that don't exist on any of the other skins.\n\n**Feral Warwick**\n\nSo there have been many comments about how Feral Warwick isn't Feral anymore. We don't plan on doing big changes to the skin except small adjustments to the splash to match the in-game color more and a bit of model polish on his clothing. I did think I should at least explain the thematic and how we got to where we got. We definitely didn't intend to take away his feralness or ignore his previous thematic. Pre-Rework Feral Warwick was a feral beast that got captured and then escaped due to how feral and out of control he was (hence the broken chains on his wrist) We had to preserve the tanks on his back and claw for each skin so we needed to incorporate those into the new skin. The thematic is supposed to be similar to pre-rework feral in that he was a feral werewolf that gets captured and is experimented on and then escapes the lab, killing everyone and running back into the wild. We just added a bit of a twist to it. I thought it would be at least fair to explain our reasoning behind the changes.\n\nAnyways that all for now. Feel free to let us know what you think in the comments below.\n\nUPDATE:\n\n**Feral/Grey**\n\nSo looks like our FX artist Bitsplosian has been making crazy progress on Hyena/Tundra/Firefang. Since he is getting through those so fast he is actually going to also do a color shift pass on Grey/Feral, making the VFX on those skins match the theme of the skin closer. These will largely just be VFX recolors to most abilities and also the glow of there eyes/tanks. Keep and eye to the PBE for those soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Qeun","date":"2017-01-11T23:19:25.263+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":2,"body":"My biggest problem with feral ww is that HIS BASE SKIN looks more feral.

Because when I read this, the first skin that pops into my head is Grey Warwick Followed By Tundra.\n\nOne could argue that medieval is opposite hextech in Runeterra. You've got a skin which replaces the high tech injection cylinders or whatever with what seems to be a magic/cursed sword that's radiating an intense shade of spooky green/blue miasma. yet somehow when it gets driven deeper *through w activation* instead of increasing the effects of the miasma like it theoretically should, everything turns into a completely irrelevant red. When he uses E it should look like he's releasing a buildup of spooky green/blue miasma as he howls. Nothing about keeping the original vfx makes sense.\n\nSuch an incredible skin harnessing such an intense Shadow Isles color scheme being overshadowed by Firefang and Tundra solely because of something like a vfx is completely unfair when you use this statement as the reasoning, especially since the number of people \"calling you out\" on Grey compared to Tundra and Firefang is 5/1.. at the very least... Grey Warwick has the potential to be his absolute best skin with such a minor change that's beyond Justified/Deserved based on how hard it was to get. You could literally move the current Tundra VFX over to Grey and it would still look 5x better than the current red. We aren't even asking for completely unique vfx, although something similar to Firefangs updated vfx only spooky green would be amazing, all we want is the default vfx to at least be recolored to match the skin. My biggest concern is I don't want a skin with such potential ending up a skin in which the only reason why anyone would ever pick it being rarity because it lacks what others skins don't. Why use Grey Warwick when you can pick up a skin with matching VFX for ONLY 520 RP. Re:Releasing Grey in its current state would completely remove it from play after a week or two depending on how easy it is to get.\n\nSo many people have pointed this out as well as other issues with the skin such as the sword not sticking out his chest like in the splash, yet nothing is even mentioned in this post, a Rioter has yet to reply to any Grey Warwick posts regarding anything other than its potential re:release. meanwhile reading through comments its basically the second/third most commented about skin after feral/hyena.\n\nI want to give Riot the benefit of the doubt and just assume they're holding off on any changes until they decide on it's re:release and that maybe they are saving the special VFX for an original owner only version (Like Championship Riven) But right now if feels like any comments regarding Grey Warwick are being deliberately ignored.\n\nCan we please get an update on this skin? At least tell us you're looking into it or something because deliberately ignoring it just makes us feel like you don't give enough of a damn to even listen to Grey Warwick feedback.\n\nEdit: In regards to Feral, I think the biggest issue is people want a kind of traditional Werewolf skin, and the closest skin to that (grey) is unavailable to them. You don't so much have to completely change feral, but if you guys promise to make him a traditional skin most of the people complaining would be happy i think.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The KoolAidMan1","date":"2017-01-12T05:52:40.400+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wait.... did I just read a paragraph explaining how the theme of the feral ww skin is legit the exact same theme and backstory of the base default skin (wasn't he tested on and escaped in the default skin)?

Off the top of my head make the tube on his back an arrow, make his claw normal with no metal (if it has to stay make make it larger with longer nails), and bring back the scratches all over his body.

This would solve most people's issues with the skin and make it so they can keep up hope that there will eventually be a real Feral skin.\n\nAs for the current \"Lab Rat\" skin, just retcon the skin lore to be a Warwick that was brainwashed and controlled by Singed. Instead of hunting down evildoers, Warwick now hunts specimens for Singed's laboratory.\n\nAlso for Grey Warwick there's the fact that the splash shows the sword in his back sticking out of his chest too.

I've been excitedly waiting for this rework to drop the past few months, and when I saw the champion teaser earlier last week, I couldn't help but fanboy at Warwick's new look. I've currently been testing his kit on the PBE, and have been loving every minute of it.\n\nHowever, I'm currently in the same boat as the users that dislike the reworked Feral Warwick. The previous iteration of the skin, to me, fulfilled the fantasy of a runaway beast; bloodthirsty, wild, unhinged -- exactly what feral is supposed to convey. And the textures of the previous skin reflected that. You had these broad claw-marks on his back, minimal clothing, broken chains, a wild-eyed visage. I understand that with the current iteration, Warwick is presented as, similarly, a runaway beast, but one that has been experimented on. For some reason, I find myself disconnected with the skin -- especially considering its effects and presentation seem lackluster in comparison to it's 'cheaper' counterpart, Tundra Hunter. \n\nThe loss of this skin's identity to me, however, occurs somewhere in Warwick's transition from, I guess a 'visceral, unhinged, unruly beast', to a 'torn lab-coated, belt-buckled experiment.' It feels more like it would fall into the lines of a Hextech/Augmented or an 'Uncaged/Test Subject\" line instead of 'Feral'\n\nIt's truly hard for me to say in words, but I believe, currently, that if perhaps (in order of importance):\n1) More clothing was removed, replaced with a similar torn fabric/loin cloth akin to pre-rework.\n2) A few more scars added and the colorings/textures darkened, allowing this skin to align more with the fantasy of being 'feral' -- blackened/dark fur, battlescars, etc.\n3) VFX on eyes when Blood Scent is active -- Perhaps an yellow tint, again referring back to pre-rework\n4) Replacing leather straps/belt-buckles with broken, rusted chains\n5) Replacing his canister-tank on his back with something a bit more 'Dangerous, escaped beast', perhaps an object similar to Grey Warwick's Sword, something weighty and heavy, like a ballista bolt. \n6) Replacing pseudo-claw with similar less-technological iron gauntlet?\n \nAgain, I enjoy _everything_ about the rework aside from these few disconnections I have with the Feral skin.

Then again, I wasn't on the team that made the skin, just someone who has played the game since S1. \n\n\nFeral Warwick was like the traditional Warwick, except if he was a regular werewolf and not some science experiment victim. In most Werewolf \"lore\", the knowing victim of a bite will go out of their way to lock themselves up. Usually chaining and tying themselves to the sturdiest and heaviest object they can. This is to prevent the beast from escaping and wreaking havoc and bloodshed.\n\nFeral had broken free of his bonds. That was the point of the skin. A normal man turned into a werewolf, and his precautions had not been enough. So his werewolf persona had got loose and thoroughly went on a blood-crazed killing spree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Feral is really lame now. Like really, really lame. In reference to the Grandma skin, you say \"The idea is that he is horribly disguised as a grandma. He has rolling pins on his tanks. It's supposed to be comical :)\"\n\nThis is along the similar vein of what Feral was supposed to be. He was supposed to be the Grimm Brothers' Fabled Wolf that Little Red met in the forest. Before he ate the grandmother and donned her clothing. It's supposed to be a little goofy. Now it just looks like a generic chroma with a few extra bells. \n\n\nIf you cannot get rid of the thing on his back, why not make it a spinal bone or something like that? It's just really lame that the only difference from the base skin is more clothing and a rounded knob on his tank. It doesn't really feel like a lot of thought was put into it. And why would you put effort into it? It's not like it makes you guys very much money anyways I guess.\n\n\n\nA better name for this skin is \"Augmented\" or \"Hextech\" Warwick, as the first thing any creature would do after escaping is pry every single restraint that they can off of their being. Being as strong as he is to break out in the first place, that mask would be gone immediately. It's pretty much the shining example of \"That word means the opposite of what you think it means.\" in this scenario. Feral should mean *less* augments, not more.\n\n\nHell, Gray Warwick looks closer to what Feral should look like.

In the same way skins like \"Pre-Void Kassadin\" work, I think an augmentation free or even post augmentation feral Warwick would be a better alternative.

Please, allow me to make a response.\n\n \"Pre-Rework Feral Warwick was a feral beast that got captured and then escaped due to how feral and out of control he was (hence the broken chains on his wrist\"\n\nI think you're targeting the word here too much. In my earlier post, I have stated it already, the name doesn't matter at all. It's the visual identity, which people chose to buy, and not the name. Nobody has to read the official concept documents, to know that the old Feral Warwick was intended to be a a classical Werewolf, quite possibly a 'Halloween-skin'. The word feral was just an insignificant label placed on it, thus trying to define a new interpretation to justify the design changes is very un-professional. It is not, by any intelligent reasoning, an acceptable point. \n\n \"We had to preserve the tanks on his back and claw for each skin so we needed to incorporate those into the new skin.\"\n\nThis is disproved with the 'Grey Warwick' skin and the 'Fire Fang Warwick' skin. Both models display completely symmetric arms that completely excludes emphasised claws, or any other elements. Furthermore, the sword on Grey Warwick's back and the metal rod on Marauder Warwick's back proves that the reactor/tank can be reduced and alternated very fluently. \n\nWhy did those skins get more attention of artistic creativity, while Feral Warwick didn't? And even if this point was more legitimate, why didn't you came up with more drastically changed design for the \"augmented\" particles? (example: Urf Warwick).\n\n \"The thematic is supposed to be similar to pre-rework feral in that he was a feral werewolf that gets captured and is experimented on and then escapes the lab, killing everyone and running back into the wild. \"\n\nAgain, another attempt of using the word 'Feral' to justify the changes. There were no signs of experimentation in the old Feral Warwick's visual communication, through design. Nothing indicated the laboratory test subject theme back then, its an entirely new invention. \n\nCan you please provide evidence for this statement? \n\n \"First off I want to say that our goal for skin updates is always to do, at the minimum, what is on live pre-rework (or if what is on live doesn't work with   the new direction at least something in it's place) We generally don't add more then what is on Live. This is because if we brought every skin up to the modern standards it would extend our release time by a fair amount and we think getting the base update out to players as fast as possible is the highest priority. However, we do try to squeeze in cool things that didn't exist before when possible.\"\n\nI apologise if I have misunderstood this part of your response. But it seems to me, that Warwick's release had much higher priority than to rework his skins, according to current standards. It seems like it was all rushed, just so a box can be ticked out and the designers could move on. \n\nIf that's the case, it might just be an insult to the community and whoever owned the Feral Warwick skin. It also undermines your following points, suggesting that the skin's poor quality is due to little attention. \n\nI understand, and everybody should understand that Riot is a very busy company that took game art to a very high level. It's probably difficult to maintain such a level all the time, especially when not enough time is given. \nGiven the detail of the rework, the teasers, the artworks for the skins, it must have been a very busy process. \n\nReav3, I think people who argued against the new Feral Warwick changes proved to be intelligent about the matter. I'm very concerned that a delayed release for another Feral Warwick skin would be acceptable. We are already getting new content to the game with the update itself, a little patience for more amazing content could work out just fine. \n\nThe problem is here that the \"True Werewolf\" is gone, and is replaced with something we didn't want and don't even like. The new Feral skin is fine, just please consider making it to a stand-alone skin, like how Captain Gangplank was created. \n\nI can't represent everyone here, so I try not to be too subjective. However, from the comments I have read so far, I can only conclude that we don't have that much of a high expectation for Feral Warwick. The base skin is almost fine, it looks much more Lycan-like than the previous Warwick. Some colour changes, such as yellow eyes and darker born fur would already make a better step towards the original concept. \n\nI view you guys as the modern \"Monet and friends\" kind of inventor group, please don't turn away from us.  \n\nThank you anyway in case you take the effort to read this long message, and for responding to the points. Its good to see you're nurturing a relationship with your community, and please don't stress yourself too much about it.  \n\nKind Regards","replies":[]},{"poster":"Busta Wolf","date":"2017-01-13T21:05:59.075+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be completely honest, with the exception of the particle effects, I'm fairly ok with all the skins... except for feral. It's the most disappointing to me. But it's more for how stupid the mask looks in game. It's a cool concept, but the model is not very appealing. He'd have torn that thing off ages ago lets be real here. The whole escaped experiment theme is basically what the original classic skin is... but more cartoon-ish? It's not unique. Feral should be wild, organic, uncontrollable. The original skin translates this message immediately. The new one? I had to check to make sure it was still the same skin. It does not translate as \"feral\". \"Rab lat\" or \"Test subject\" fits better with this theme. But if you're insistent on keeping it this way, at LEAST remove the stupid mask. Add some scars too maybe? \n\nAt the very least... please turn down the saturation on his fur colors. Make it closer to the original's colors and it'll be passable to me.

All of his skins have been changed to fit his new looks and most of them give a pretty distinct feeling when playing the champ. Hyena Warwick gives that funky punker style which was built upon the existing Hyena theme. Firefang and Tundra Warwick have great visuals and present those elements (ice and fire) as Warwicks innate and controllable ability. Big bad Warwick and Marauder Warwick have stayed true to their original designs and haven't been extremely changed as they're, in fact, pretty cheap skins. Grey Warwick is decent, it is a pretty rare skin, due to the act that it was only obtainable through invitations, and a decent amount of effort has been put into making the new one satisfactory for the people that own the skin.\n\nThat leaves us with Feral Warwick. Out of all the skins, this one feels the most clunky and patched up together just for the sake of making him.\n\nSplash Art\nIn the splash art, Warwick is presented as an enraged beast. In his fury, he's tearing down the lab he was trapped in and we can see the legs of what seems to be the person that was experimenting on Warwick (probably not Singed). The lab is heavily damaged; the door has been destroyed and we can see scratch marks on the lab floor coming from Warwick's mechanized arm. Warwick himself is scarred. His body is covered with the remains of his restraints as well as something that appears to be an asylum or a mental institution restrainment clothing. His augmentation seems to be additionally mechanized and improved in this skin. The arm is considerably bulkier than in the original artwork. We're, however, unable to see the augmentation on his back fully. His face depicts an enraged wolf, with saliva splashing around it and him showing off his teeth which is typical wolf behavior. There is however, a strange addition to his face, a small piece of metal that feels extremely out of place. It might be a part of a broken nozzle (unlikely), but it's extremely strange that such a monstrosity that is being experimented on and that is a danger to the people inside the lab has a spiked metal added on top of his already enormous teeth, to help him bite better.\n\nCriticism\nThe art itself is decently done. The background blur isn't too emphasized and it allows us to see the details of the lab Warwick has been held captive in, yet it is visible enough to divert us from looking at the lab and makes us focus on Warwick himself. A job well done. However, Warwick himself has some inconsistent features. It is true that if you're experimenting on Warwick and improving upon his original weaponry, you're aware that he's dangerous and the amount of restrains shown in the picture shows off the amount of security measures they've invested in keeping him restrained (still wasn't enough). However, there is the factor of arming the caged ''animal'' with additional weapons which is blatantly put, stupid and careless. Zaun is indeed a place where questionable experiments are conducted, but it hosts intelligent people and scientists, which I highly doubt would allow their laboratory experiment to run loose with all the augmentations done to his already existing weaponry. Singed was unaware that the subject he had experimented on was still alive, therefore his error was justified. Justifying the error of the scientists that worked on a live specimen is a lot harder. All in all, the splash art is, on the artistic side, a decent representation of the idea, but on the concept side, there are still some inconsistencies that show the lack of thought behind the scenery.\n\nConversion from old to new Feral Warwick criticism and debate\nThe conversion idea of converting Warwick from a Feral beast that was once caged and is running rampant in the woods causing havoc, to a lab rat that's been extremely experimented on and has broken out of his chains is somewhat, in my personal opinion, questionable and very far from the original design. Feral Warwick was originally shown as a rampaging beast, destroying whatever he finds in his path, with the light of the full moon shining in the background. He was a true werewolf. The name feral used to fit him well. The new Feral Warwick is far from that, if we exclude his rampaging nature shown off in the new skin. He is now a subject of experimentation. While the idea of such a thing happening is decent itself, the name ''Feral'' doesn't fit.\n\nChampion model criticism and debate\n\nThe Feral Warwick champion model is by far the most questionable design decision made. The model itself has too many additions which, as a result make it feel extremely clunky. The added augmentation parts make Warwick feel like a large clump of something and nothing, instead of a werewolf. It is okay to improve the existing things or completely re-imagine them as it was done in all the other skins (Hyena - car engine, Firefang and Tundra - Ice and Fire etc.) but to simply add more of the same is an obvious sign that there was a lack of inspiration. The champion model is a simple color conversion with additional augmentations added to the already existing ones. The spiked nozzle hides his face and mouth, feels clunky, unnecessary and overly emphasized.\n\nMy own opinions\nWhile the idea of additional experiments on Warwick is okay, the way it was developed isn't thoughtful of the true ''Feral'' theme this skin carried. The Original Feral Warwick was something that a skin owner could have been proud of; it gave off a new feel to the champion as well as a new model, in addition to it being a legacy skin. The new one is by far the least desirable skin Warwick has. It's clunky and visually unattractive, far from the original concept. It is no longer special in any way, aside it being different from the normal one (which is basically better than the Feral). I'd rather have a skin that shows a Feral Werewolf, a forest dweller that occasionally runs rampant in the cities or towns close by, just like the Firefang and Tundra Warwick have their non augmented yet improved arm and back, he could have a robust, muscular arm with huge fangs instead of the overly robust augmentations that feel out of place.\n\nI'm from EU, but some people told me I should share this here\nIt's just my criticism towards Feral Warwick","replies":[]},{"poster":"VAGABUNDO","date":"2017-01-14T03:37:33.439+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito you really dropped the ball with Feral Warwick.\n\nThe color of his fur should be darker, more rugged\n\nGet rid of the muzzle\n\nThe VFX doesn't match the theme.

I think that is the problem here. 'Feral' doesn't simply imply organic, it directly states it. You don't have Feral machines. Feral Warwick isn't Feral anymore if he is being experimented on. Breaking out of that isn't a 'Feral' instinct, it is a natural reaction to the situation.
