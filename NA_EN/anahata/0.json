I typically never have problems dodging blitz but had a really bad game a few days ago against an Iblitz,  I assumed he was just really good but. .. wow. \nWhy is the skin not changed...

That seems unfair?","replies":[{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2014-10-06T22:49:40.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if they release a skin, they can't just remove it from the servers. Some people don't even know about the visual issues and just like the way the skin looks, and pulling the skin off the live servers would cause a minor uproar, even if they refunded people who bought it. And then, they would have to do the same thing with every other skin that may have questionable visuals, like Hired Gun Lucian, so they could make it fair.","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2014-10-07T13:26:59.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry,  I meant more along the lines of updating the visual to better represent the hitbox.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Anahata","date":"2014-10-10T07:18:12.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True.

There are a number of skins that are banned during tournament play because of one of those 2 factors. a great example is arcade hecarim, when he is at 2 stacks multiple areas change color making it obvious he has full stacks on his q buff while his other skins are far more subtle when you reach full stacks. It is small things like this that make a skin unavailable to be used in tournaments.","replies":[]}]}
