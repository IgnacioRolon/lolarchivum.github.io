I would like to discuss my recent ranked game of mine that I just had. One ranked game. I played as Katarina mid lane. we played for approximately 2-5 minutes. then my 3 members of my team started doing what they are not supposed to do. For example .afk, int, troll, grief, feed intentionally. I had an argument with the enemy which caused me a lot of anger and trouble. they started doing what they could (both the 3 members in my team and 3 members in the enemy team). they did whatever they could to make me angry and sad. I discussed and I did not flame. I only argued. for example, I typed things about why people do this, why they are so toxic why they have to int and troll others and ruin their games. they don't gain anything from it. and more. I am terribly mad about this and think that u should not have permanently banned me. pls, grant my request to unban me since I did not flame or have inappropriate content, and ban those who should have got banned. I'm begging you.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-07-05T01:38:23.510+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Negative behavior such as arguing is not acceptable, but it isn't *that* bad. However, it sounds like your argument was about your teammates actions - that is harassment and flaming - even if it is \"the truth\" (in quotation marks because in reality it's just your opinion).\n\nIf you have had a recent 14 day ban, that is why this is a permanent suspension. The 14 day ban told you that your next punishment would be a permanent ban. You ignored that message and continued to misbehave.","replies":[{"poster":"YasuoXpro","date":"2019-07-05T01:42:05.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yes, I know exactly what you mean and respect that. however.
