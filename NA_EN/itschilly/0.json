Finished with the firewall process and proceeded to open the game but it popped a message saying the game is over and brought me to the after match review, I checked my profile to see my final placements were set in, i'm just confused because i never thought remakes counted as a game especially in rank.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-19T00:53:05.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As others have mentioned here in the reply section, a remake **does count** if you were the one to cause the remake.
