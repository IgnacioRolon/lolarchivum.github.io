You can find these located here:\n[Universal Rules](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/ITFIpNUE)\n\nCalling people \"whiny bitches\" directly violates the Golden Rule: Always be respectful to players, community members, moderators, and Rioters.\n\nIf you have any other questions I'd be happy to answer them.","replies":[{"poster":"ODiiiiiN","date":"2018-12-16T23:23:39.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Well gooood job Evangele, you caught the villain.
