I&#039;m forced to hug tower because if I try to stay within the middle of the lane and he tries to trade with me, I have nothing to trade back. His turrets auto agro someone attacking heimdinger and the range is big enough that if a try a trade then back off ill most likely take all or more of the damage I dealt back.\r\n\r\nEven then If I play passively  his turrets just start randomly attacking me because of one of his AA. He can also just kill you out of the blue by landing a E or hitting the sour spot of the E.\r\n\r\nIt just feels so unfair and unfun when I fight him and just leaves a pit in my stomach whenever I do.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m still very bad at the game but I have no Idea what to do other than just pray I have a good late game phase.","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-08-22T20:06:54.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a lane once Nunu vs Heimer. Nunu consume on those turrets (this was before recent targetting changes) made the lane super easy for me. It starts slow, but once you consume 3 turrets, he won't be able to keep making them and then he has a useless lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2017-08-22T19:49:39.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on who you play. You could play a champ that out ranges him, a champion with poke for his turrets, a champion with good sustain, or an AD champion with an auto-attack reset. Any champion who fits into one of these categories would have an easier time dealing with Heimer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-08-22T19:41:05.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's not much to do if you have no way to take out the turrets.\n{{item:3060}} is an option, but {{item:3194}} is probably the best thing to survive with.\n\nWhat champs are you playing?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-08-22T19:37:34.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take out his turrets instead of worrying about him.

There is a couple characters who can match his early push like syndra and Taliyah.\nIMO the best way to face him is to make sure you have crowd control for any ganks. Heimer needs money to be relevant so why not camp him to make him useless until 30 minutes","replies":[]}]}
