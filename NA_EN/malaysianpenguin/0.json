So CLG won't be able to rely on bot-lane for the carry but the \"Great Danes\" also seem unstoppable. So they'll have to look for ZionSpartan, maybe a classic Jax carry? But I still think TSM takes the W, just my opinion. Please share whether you agree or disagree! And GL HF all in ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ve1vet","date":"2015-02-09T21:45:09.772+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the real question is who do you think can rock the pink hair better- Regi or Hotshot? :D;;","replies":[{"poster":"Smart Kitty","date":"2015-02-11T06:08:04.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":O did they make a bet to dye their hair?!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MalaysianPenguin","date":"2015-02-09T22:36:30.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is indeed the real question xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rjdude31","date":"2015-02-09T12:43:26.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tsm is bad and they will get stomped. Wild turtle i s the most overrated player ever and once again double lift will show us how real adcs do it. Also berg is overrated and will get crushed by link. Dyrus will do nothing and santorin is by far the worst jungler in the na lcs.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDuelist999","date":"2015-02-09T20:21:57.141+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol\nnot sure if clg fanboy or tsm hater\nThe solo lanes about balance out bjerg and zion are prlly the best respectively but dyrus and link are both in the up half and capable of holding their own. Aphromoo and lustboy are about even overall but with very different strengths.  Double lift is a bit better than wild turtle but unless that makes an impact early on in the 2 v2 not enough to matter. I really don't have enough game knowledge to judge the junglers since their showcases of skill aren't always so obvious. I doubt one player will be able to take over this game so it will come down to shot calling an area where both have looked pretty solid but its been since TSM beat C9 that TSM has looked particularly special with shot calling over all I think the game is about 60/40 in favor of clg.","replies":[{"poster":"Lstrike","date":"2015-02-11T09:06:23.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same opinion...

All I know is that it's really exciting to see a game like this go down.  I think the only advantage CLG has over TSM is that Aphromoo is way better at team fights and skillshots than Lustboy.\n\nIf both Bjergsen and Link play perfect mechanical games like they have so far I have no idea who wins midlane.  I'm hoping this game is where both mid laners have to step up their game and one of them will make an impossible play to get the advantage on the other.\n\nI think Turtle and Double lift are equally talented.  I think Zion has had easier laning phases in his games as Dyrus has been camped 1v3 in most of his games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SinatraZ","date":"2015-02-12T14:16:18.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tough question!

I'm gonna be rooting for CLG, and I do think they will win. To be fair, TSM has been looking great recently too. If we're talking head to head matchups, I think dlift and aphro are a stronger pair than turtle and lustboy. Bjerg's stronger than Link, but as of late, Link has been looking pretty good himself. I still don't think he'll beat Bjerg unless he gets an early lead. Idk about jung cuz I haven't been paying enough attention to either. Top lane, is about as close as mid. I feel Zion is the stronger player, but Dyrus is about equally as good (eventhough it doesn't show in his stats because he is always camped). Top's probably gonna depend on who wins lane, and which champions are picked (since Zion seems more pick reliant than Dyrus).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tentacle Love","date":"2015-02-10T00:15:52.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CLG's pretty awesome, but I have a hard time visualizing an ADC laning well against the sure pick they're going to see. If Kassadin, Ahri, or Xerath make it to champ select, TSM's going to walk all over them. The bans are going to go far. Either CLG bans all the mid picks and lets TSM get ridiculous team synergy for the late game, or they lose everything but the late game.\n\nBut that's just a hypothesis.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CLG Factor","date":"2015-02-09T19:33:34.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im gonna have to go with clg, They stomped Gravity pretty hard, and I thought they were the best team in na","replies":[]}]}
