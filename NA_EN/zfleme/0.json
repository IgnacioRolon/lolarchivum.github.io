It might be best to stick to custom games until this gets resolved, otherwise your queue is going to keep escalating.  Even though your intention is not to disconnect or leave, it's still causing others a negative experience.  Your best bet now would be to use this time to run through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help fix whatever is causing your network to struggle while reaching the game server.","replies":[{"poster":"ZFleme","date":"2017-11-19T09:20:05.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also it's not gonna keep escalating, it just started at 20 min and then mid queue decided it would be a good idea to add 11 min to the queue.\nWorst of it all was that then got stuck on 31:30 so we had to cancel the queue to play, annoying having to queue for an hour just to play a game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZFleme","date":"2017-11-18T17:57:26.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for trying to help, but it was a one time thing but it's something that could happen again and i don't wanna play if theres a risk of getting penalized for it.","replies":[{"poster":"ZFleme","date":"2017-11-18T18:01:24.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also thanks for being the first customer support thingy thing out of the 1 million support people i talked to, to actually help me.\n\nThanks","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ELPAP0","date":"2017-11-18T15:25:34.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eyo....he is right.
