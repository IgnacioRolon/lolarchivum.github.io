I get a glimpse of the task manager when i try and tab away and it is league of legends that has crashed. I don&#039;t know why this happens as I&#039;ve never had a problem alt-tabbing before, y&#039;know when I&#039;m dead or whatever but it&#039;s put me in leaver buster cause it happened during the load into the game and counted as an abandon cause I couldn&#039;t recconect in time from restarting my PC and it happened again, loosing me a ranked game. Any and all help would be appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-17T21:32:16.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not much help is possible if you do not provide system information and logs.","replies":[]}]}
