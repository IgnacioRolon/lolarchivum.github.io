I've tried everything I can think of to try to repair this problem, Uninstalled and reinstalled the game, Made sure internet was working on multiple other devices, firewalls not blocking league, etc. and still no fix. Today, I found out about the hextech repair tool and tested that to see if it may be able to fix the problem and it tells me that everything is fine but the issue still persists. It began happening out of the blue between games a few days ago and hasn't stopped since. Also, since the only way to test to see if I had fixed the problem or not was to join a game and just hope that it would work I accrued a lot of games that show me as a quitter. So now I have to deal with the whole leaverbuster issue too.  Has anyone else had this problem or anything similar to it? Any help would be greatly appreciated thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T01:34:14.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So first off, if this ever happens again and you need to test some troubleshooting: ***Test those changes in a custom or practice match ONLY***. This way you won't be marked as a leaver for multiple games due to testing changes. \n\nDo you happen to see any specific errors when your game crashes other than \"stopped working\"? That could help me narrow down specifically what is going wrong, but off the top of my head, this might be related to damaged or missing game files. Try running a simple repair through the client options instead of trying to reinstall, as that installation may not actually be working 100%.","replies":[{"poster":"monnagnis","date":"2017-11-06T02:39:23.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ran the repair and it is still not working. The message that pops up says \"League Of Legends (TM) Client has stopped working\" then it gives me the option to check online for a solution or to close the program.When i choose check online for a solution a message appears statong \" The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000005). Click OK to close the application\". No matter what option I choose the client reopens and offers the option to reconnect and if i do the same process just repeats. Other than the error I mentioned there doesn't seem to be any other error status's or anything like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T02:57:11.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm alrighty. it sounds like some of the game files just aren't working properly for some reason, at this point, my only guess is that maybe the files weren't installed properly due to lacking admin privileges during installation. I definitely don't want to steer you in the wrong direction though, so go ahead and hit up our tech team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They'll be able to take a deeper dive and figure out what's going wrong!","replies":[{"poster":"monnagnis","date":"2017-11-06T03:26:56.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thank you for the help!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
