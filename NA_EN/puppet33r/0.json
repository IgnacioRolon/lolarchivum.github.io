It also gets popped Lux&#039;s E ability without it detonating. On the other hand, healing plants don&#039;t slow him on pickup and don&#039;t pop his shield. \r\n\r\nNot that Malz is weak or anything right now, but I really think his passive should be popping when he takes damage to avoid all those weird(buggy?) and not obvious interactions.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-01-03T10:32:31.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The first cast on nocturne's ult is a blind, so it makes sense.\n\nSame thing for lux (slow instead of blind)\n\nI haven't played malz and walked on the plants to know this, so ima leave that subject alone.","replies":[{"poster":"Puppet33r","date":"2017-01-03T15:10:52.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that even after popping the shield u are still blinded is kinda stupid. Especially since it is global and unavoidable. It should either pop and not apply blind or apply blind like for everyone else but leave shield on.\n\nLux's e poke with its silly range is just generally annoying and the fact that she can still poke u down without wasting any e's to pop the shield is pretty infuriating.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-01-04T03:03:36.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure it's a bug, because i thought it was supposed to negate the blind, same way that banshees does, but i may be wrong","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"morris1","date":"2017-01-03T10:34:38.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strange, when the MYMU first came out I can remember ignoring Nocturne's ultimate vision debuff with the passive on multiple ocassions.
