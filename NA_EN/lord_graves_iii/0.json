I feel he has strong potential there.\r\n\r\nHe has high early game damage, strong lane dominance, a blind, and better than average late game single target sustained damage.\r\n\r\nTeemo is an AP marksman. He uses the fighting style of an ADcarry but with the damage and build of a mage.\r\n\r\nHe out trades loads of marksman early game and he dominates them individually come mid and late game.\r\nHe turns bot lane into a poisonous mess post 6, and with a support can push bot lane farther than most other marksman are able.\r\n\r\nHis only real weakness is that he can't make good use of lifesteal, and this is possible to account for and minimize with the right early game build and support pick.\r\n\r\nWhy do we never see bot lane teemo?","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-06-30T22:52:05.888+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"A few things about bot lane dynamics and what-not:\n\n1. It's actually fairly hard to force long-duration engages, meaning the blind isn't actually amazing, since your opponents are likely to get 2 attacks off before the blind takes effect. This is about how long trades are in the first place, so his unique CC isn't very useful. His damage in the trade would be decent, though.\n2. Teemo is remarkably short-ranged. He's basically got the same reach as Vayne, and you'll have a similarly difficult time in lane, but a harder time in team fights, since she kites better (Awesome Shroom gameplay notwithstanding)\n3. In general, without some way to clutch-save yourself or extremely long range, it's hard to be an auto-attacker in a team fight. Kayle functions with her targeted slow and ultimate, Kog'Maw makes do with 700 range, and Ashe just has no much CC it's worth it.\n4. That said, Teemo is still a better choice than many other champions in a bot lane pairing. He's able to Shroom up for Dragons and such, plus he can blind someone like Fiora, Yi, or Tryndamere to ruin a team fight. Don't let difficulties dissuade you: Every champion has a down-side. And as long as the upsides are worth it, then Teemo bot can totally work :)","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2014-06-30T23:16:22.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Phreak, don't you think teemo's blind should be updated according to the new attackspeed buff/debuff mechanic?\n\nI personally think that all aa's should perform the check for if blind is applied as it connects rather than as it is fired.\n\nIt's really annoying to try to pull off a clutch blind to save your (or an ally's) life or turn around an engage only to have the blind connect, but the enemy aa still follow thru even tho the blind duration is almost expired.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-06-30T23:43:25.264+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, it's currently checking when you start swinging.

First time I've had a Rioter appear in one of my threads.\n\nAnyway, perhaps its a novelty thing, but I find combined with a strong engage support like thresh or leona, teemo's early game is much stronger than the average marksman.\n\nPerhaps the best part though, is that sending him bot frees up mid and top to be AD champs if desired without fear of your team's damage type being too lopsided.\n\nHe has issues in some matchups but I've found given the opportunity he can do real work functioning as a primary marksman for a team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2014-07-01T22:56:26.874+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried this in days past with decent frequency.

Two rioters in one thread. {{summoner:3}} \n\nI agree, though would argue he is to an extent no more vulnerable to it than any other marksman. His issue is he has poor sustain options. (doubly so with the dorans changes)\n\nAlthough this thread is starting to make me think that perhaps its just my good luck getting extremely strong supports like thresh.\n\nMaybe its all in my head but I feel like teemo has better early damage than most marksman, and given a support who can find plays teemo can seriously put the hurt on. Also, it frees up top to be tanky which I cannot undersell. Its probably my favorite part about it. \nI'd argue a farmed/fed teemo can be more useful to some comps than a farmed/fed Trist or Caitlyn.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-07-01T05:44:55.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support teemo perhaps?  Run around the map after laning and drop teemo shrooms everywhere.\n\nIMO it'd work better if you were running an AD mid or a strong AD jungler because you don't want the other team to get only one resistance type. However, if fed, Teemo can get pretty nasty.\n\nAnd as Phreak said, his lack of mobility is a liability in lane.  You'd need someone with ranged hard CC like Lux or Morgana to pull it off better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-06-30T22:45:58.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a few reasons, but the main bits being the trade-off is not worth it most of the time. You either replace the support and lose a lot of cc and/or range or your replace the adc and lose a lot of sustained physical damage.\n\nThe reason any adc will outdamage Teemo is two-fold. Physical damage burns towers a lot faster, which leads to easier objectives, and Teemo's DoT actually limits his sustained damage, as the DoT only refreshes. Granted he does also have an on-hit in his E, but most of the time an adc simply getting a crit will do better.\n\nNow I'm not saying it can't work, in fact I've done it occasionally, but it's imply not as good as a normal bot lane match up.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Graves III","date":"2014-07-01T02:36:43.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not as good is a strong term. More situational or niche perhaps, but basically owning dragon, stomping any autoattacker out of the fight mid-late game, and strong early damage can make the weaknesses worth it.\n\nEspecially if you have a mid, jungle, and top that all want to AD.\n\nI also find its easier to fit into a comp than top teemo which sacrifices a slot that would normally have a tank or off-tank.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cerbearus","date":"2014-07-01T02:11:02.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No poke, short range, no escape, only does well in sustained trades, is Satan, many reasons.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2014-06-30T21:55:10.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo is squishy like a mage.

And marksman do fine in duo lanes  all the time.\n\nThe reason you don't send mages bot is because of their superior ganking power compared to a marksman, and that they scale harder with levels than CS.\n\nTeemo scales wonderfully with CS and isn't much of a ganker. And he gets out of ganks almost as well as a pre-6 Ashe or twitch, or Kog do with Teemo's movespeed. And post 6 he is basically ungankable thanks to mushrooms.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fires of Justice","date":"2014-07-02T22:12:08.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Phreak.
