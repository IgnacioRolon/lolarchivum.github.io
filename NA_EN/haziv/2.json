Instead of gems he should have planets that orbit him, his cape should be more like Rakans cosmic dawn skin where it's like looking into the cosmos. His Q is a sun that rains down light to heal, W attaches 3 of his 6 planets to orbit his ally, E can be stars in a straight line and his ult can be a meteorite that falls from the sky and once it hits him/his allies they turn  dark purple with speckles of stars seen inside, it would be distinct so that enemies know that they are invincible. \nHis hammer can have astral crystals attached together, and his wardrobe can be very similar to the Star Guardian one here.\nThis could be his legendary that he desperately needs, Cosmic King Taric could be the name. He always talks about stars and outer space so it's like his own voice lines beg for him to get a skin like this. \nEDIT: I almost forgot to mention he basically radiates, like the beautiful man he is. {{champion:44}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ikaseus","date":"2019-03-31T19:39:39.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cleric Taric \nBodyguard Taric\nJewel King  Taric\nCyborg Taric\nSoulstone Taric","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skias","date":"2019-01-08T05:20:18.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to see Woad Taric where he has red hair and is all Celtic.
