Tell me why I&#039;m wrong/right\r\n\r\n**TOP**\r\nI play top lane and recently {{champion:31}} has been doing very good for me. He out sustains most champions, great at team fighting, great at picking, and can 1v1 with his ult if you poke people down. I only lose control in my lane against champs like {{champion:58}} , {{champion:122}} , or {{champion:150}} . Champions that require you to play super safe let me live and cs and outpower so many people. Not to mention the gold you get from poor victims who forget the power of Cho&#039;s ult.\r\n\r\n**JUNGLE**\r\nIn the jungle whether I play a tank jg or an assassin jg, ganking is always a gamble. Whether you step on a ward, your laner doesn&#039;t follow up, you get counter ganked, or your laner decides that it&#039;s a good idea to flash towards the {{champion:7}} to auto finish her off and dies to tower. Sometimes your laners are pushed up and you waste your time trying to do a bush lane gank. Sometimes they just push up and you can&#039;t gank. Sometimes the enemy gets better ganks off than you.\r\n\r\n**JUNGLE VS TOP**\r\nIf you let the game up to the laning phase and play a champion jg that has a huge spike lvl 6 like {{champion:54}} , {{champion:32}} , {{champion:9}}  then you lose a lot of control of the game. If you play an early game jungler like {{champion:28}} , {{champion:64}} or {{champion:35}} then if you lose early game or just don&#039;t win it hard enough, you don&#039;t have much to do besides play a very squishy champion who is probably behind in gold and levels since you don&#039;t own a lane. If you split push, you can&#039;t rely on your team to play it safe. If you team fight, you can&#039;t rely on your team to fight properly. If you played a laner instead, you are as strong as, if not stronger than all of the other champions. You can gank other lanes with your teleport if you take it, and are only exposed to the risks that you can see on the map. Mid MIA? See it. Jungler coming? Warded. As a jungler you take many risks. Trying to drag without a pink ward and an mia is dangerous. \r\n\r\nJungle seems to have so much more chance involved rather than top or mid lane. I feel like it&#039;s too hard to carry with jg as I almost never lose lane and maintain a great kda while in jg it depends on if my laners can lane well enough for my jungling to help.\r\n\r\nMy question: Am I seeing any of this wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"Great Muta","date":"2016-10-10T04:59:26.896+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can lose top lane.

I agree most bronze players cant play safe well (I think I'm an exception tbh, went against a quinn top and played passive early, ended up out cs'ing (not hard) and only popping 2 potions to stay relatively healthy (not burstable). She got a kill on our jungler, but I managed to kill her after in lane which shows how effective my staying safe was), but a lot of them have this habit of just not cs'ing at all and sitting under tower. If they're lucky and played someone with hard CC, then i cant kill them, but if they didn't then I can usually dive after poking.\n\nEven though I'm by all rights stomping my laner, the problem is, without kills, **I'm not as strong as whoever is fed on the other team**. Meaning that unless they're squishy enough for me to oneshot, which I can't do reliably yet ;(, I'm pretty much fked.\n\nGanking is a lot easier to get kills, since having 2 players, you have twice the damage and cc (theoretically). You also don't have to be nearly as safe. Especially in lane, most relatively bursty junglers (not dps basically) can easily burst a laner who's not building full tank in conjunction with their laner.\n\nAlso, with mid lane usually occupied by an immobile mage...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-10-12T04:22:40.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungle is one of the best gold income sources to carry from because you don't have to worry about minor mistakes costing you your entire early game or cheese outside of stuff that can be prevented very easily with wards. \n\nEven if the enemy team invades, oh well. Start at your opposite buff (or krugs if its on the other side) and carry on; it'll hardly set you back, especially from the time investment the enemy put into that move. \n\nIf you know how to power-clear, and are playing a champion that can do so, almost every situation outside of dying is a winning situation, as far as you're concerned. Farm up, stat-check 1v1s or 2v1s, and carry hard.\n\nJungle is easily the most consistent gold income, role-wise, if you play it right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ItsOrval","date":"2016-10-10T05:07:18.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungling is better to get carried off of. But jungling takes longer to master than the farming lane top. Junglers get to gank a lot more than top laners, thus they get more kills. If junglers know how to counter jungle, then they will get more gold faster from jungle farms. Junglers usually become useless late game tho, most top laners are good throughout the mid/late game. Top lane is all about getting that cs, and trading. You dont focus on getting the kills as much as the cs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2016-10-10T04:50:27.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much depends on you.
