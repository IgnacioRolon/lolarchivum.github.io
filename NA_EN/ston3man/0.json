Then all of a sudden it got better for about 2 months i was happy as could be then the problem came back. I've tried every fix in the books. I've called my ISP they said they did a trace and i wasn't having any packet loss issues and all the tests i've done have come up as my internet is fine.  when i lag sometimes I can see others moving around me sometimes I dc my ping and my fps remain relatively constant through the lag.  the other odd thing is that when i get to loading screen after champ select it can stay black for awhile or show the empty  borders but no one is connected and this happens every game so it doesn't feel like a internet problem. Its a problem for me to play and it also hurts my teammates. help me fix this so that league community doesn't suffer and i can finally climb out of bronze.","replies":[{"poster":"aaaadddddddd","date":"2016-12-28T01:02:13.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problems. I run different programs, like hextech repair tool. Result=0 packet loss. Why I didn't have any problems before the new patch? I mean, before the patch the game run perfectly, after the patch I get \"packet loss\", just wow. And the other thing is that i can play normal(no lag problems) games like cod, battlefield, dota, fifa, overwatch, hots, cs go... but this one? Nope! Really now? Really? Packet loss? Why there is no packet loss on the other games too? This is really f** up... a lot of people with same problems... no fix. \nI had this before and it was fixed only with a new patch... so till next patch can't play at all... this game is unplayable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ston3man","date":"2016-12-27T22:48:27.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"go check out my submitted ticket i have all the info there","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-27T18:44:06.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having a connection issue, so reinstalling may not really fix this.  This could indeed be packet loss or some other problem.
