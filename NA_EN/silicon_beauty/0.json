After re-watching the game I couldn't find what causes this since it doesn't seem to be easily reproducible. It happened 4 times on both play thoughts of the replay although not at the same times as before. Note this was all in the official spectator mode and not a third party replay software.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-29T17:57:54.263+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Soul Relay, \n\nThanks for the report! \n\nWould you mind attaching your DXDiag? DX Diags can be found by typing \"DX Diag\" into the start menu search bar. \n\nIn addition, can you see Arclight Vel'Koz normally in games? Did this specifically occur in Spectator?\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Silicon Beauty","date":"2015-01-29T21:25:54.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There you go.
