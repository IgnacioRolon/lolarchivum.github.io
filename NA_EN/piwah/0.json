League is always online, so connection issues are pretty common because networks can degrade or run into issues.  My suspicions are with packet loss, and you can run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for an overview to know for sure.  Let me know the results and we can go from there.","replies":[]}]}
