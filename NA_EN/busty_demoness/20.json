Why should death increase that timer?\n\nEDIT:\nThe reason I suggest this is that is can become a hassle, particularly in situations where you will want her W to help defend an inhibitor. You can't afford to get there as quickly because you have to W on the platform to get the full speed and will need to reset it once you get to the minions.\n\nEDIT 2:\nConfirmed in a recent game that activating her Strut will disable the undo function, which is another reason to simply have her passive up in full upon respawn.","replies":[{"poster":"King of MF","date":"2017-06-03T06:16:36.754+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"you know if u just w in base it's automatic? plus you get the mana back because you're in base.","replies":[{"poster":"ForgottenLuck","date":"2017-06-03T07:00:17.372+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"True but it does put the spell on CD and it is a bit annoying","replies":[{"poster":"nyx1998","date":"2017-06-03T21:03:35.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FearfullLuck,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XBrjEQEf,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2017-06-03T07:00:17.372+0000)\n>\n> True but it does put the spell on CD and it is a bit annoying\n\nI never notice that it have CD untill now\nI think if you use w at base by the time you may have it off CD now or just need one or two auto to refresh it CD","replies":[{"poster":"Busty Demoness","date":"2017-06-04T17:13:46.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except it's not \"one or two autos\" if they're on your nexus, nexus turrets or inhibitors.

I dislike when choices are dumbed down for players. If you have to choose between leaving fountain a slight bit faster or waiting in case you need the cooldown for a fight, I think that's something that should be left as-is.

If Rammus wants to use his Q to leave fountain faster, he risks it being on cooldown if a teamfight breaks out - why should MF have the benefit of not having to choose?\n\nThat being said, if we just make the argument about her passive not being active on respawn, that I can agree with - if homeguards is instantly refreshed on respawn, then other movement speed passives should be as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Busty Demoness","date":"2017-06-03T16:25:20.525+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kritty,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XBrjEQEf,comment-id=000100030000,timestamp=2017-06-03T16:19:07.584+0000)\n>\n> Honestly, I supported your entire argument until that last sentence.

Her W cooldown is low enough that it's rare for this change to be a buff, since it focuses on her ability to get off the platform and defend. The only situation where this is a buff that matters is when there is an active siege on her base (anything from the nexus to the inhibitor turrets).","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2017-06-03T19:38:45.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The difference is that most champions actually have to USE an ability to get out of base faster.

After a few seconds of not being hit, gains 25 movement speed. After a few more seconds, the bonus is increased even further based on the rank of Strut. \n\nUsing the active portion immediately grants the full bonus. MF can use the active to get out faster by fully charging the passive immediately, but then can lose out on having the attack speed boost ready depending on how far she has to go.
