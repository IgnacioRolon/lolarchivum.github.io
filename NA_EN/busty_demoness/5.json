Is there any point to getting 25 prestige points?","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":25,"down_votes":4,"body":"Assume I don't get any other Prestige Points. Am I to expect that they will expire without ever being usable for anything?\n\nBecause if there is literally no incoming use for 25 prestige points before January 31st, this gift becomes an insult to players as Riot gives something that's not intended to be usable without spending more money.\n\nAnd I don't just mean \"you can get a border for a prestige skin you own\". I mean something that ANYONE can use regardless of what they have on their account, even if it's just 5 Masterwork chests plus keys.\n\nEdit:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Wümbøløgy,realm=NA,application-id=yrc23zHg,discussion-id=oREFbhoV,comment-id=000200000003,timestamp=2019-10-24T00:29:54.799+0000)\n>\n> They announced there is going to be a shop with those options at the end of the year.
