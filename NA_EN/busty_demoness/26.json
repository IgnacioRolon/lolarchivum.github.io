Simply survive as long as you possibly can.\n\nPick a champion, and do your best to survive endless waves of minions in a single lane.\n\nEach completed wave increases the health, damage, armor and magic resist of the minions 2% of their base (so at wave 51, those values are doubled) and every few waves adds a minion.\n\nRules: \n\n1. Normal Urf buffs apply to your champion.\n2. Between waves, your champion has greatly increased health regeneration and can buy items regardless of location.\n3. All towers have some health regeneration and will attack normally.\n4. You do not need to deliver the killing blow to a minion to obtain the gold and minion kill gold is awarded to all players.\n5. Minions do not spawn for your team.\n6. At wave 3 and every 6th wave afterwards (9, 15, 21, so on) an additional caster minion is spawned.\n7. At wave 6 and every 6th wave afterwards (6, 12, 18, 24, so on) an additional melee minion is spawned.\n8. Every 10th wave, an additional cannon minion is spawned.\n9. Every 25 waves, an additional super minion is spawned.\n10. Game is lost when minions destroy your nexus.\n\nGroup up and see how long you and 4 allies can last!\n\nEDIT:\n\nPossibly adding added effects on minions every few waves.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Busty Demoness,realm=NA,application-id=yrc23zHg,discussion-id=9yhWEK2A,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-25T05:48:03.545+0000)\n>\n> Although I can see adding a special effect to minions every 7 waves.\n> \n> - Champions hit suffer from grievous wounds\n> - Champions hit have any channels interrupted\n> - Caster Minions do Magic Damage with basic attacks (warranting some MR)\n> - Cannon Minions ignore champions and go directly for towers.\n> - Melee minions gain increased attack speed.\n> - Super Minions protect allied minions from 50% of AOE spell/ability damage.","replies":[]}
