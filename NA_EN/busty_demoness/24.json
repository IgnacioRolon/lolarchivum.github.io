No more playing League for me...","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":18,"down_votes":8,"body":"The following changes have convinced me Riot has decided to take a leap of faith, Dukes of Hazard style, over a canyon.\n\nNot to say they&#039;re definitely going under anytime soon, but these changes have told me that they have no idea what they&#039;re doing, and I don&#039;t think they have any idea what they&#039;re trying to accomplish in terms of balance. And this is just a couple of them.\n\n- Ziggs Satchel Charge able to instantly destroy towers when they&#039;re 25% hp or less.\n- Jungle Buff Camps now offer timers whenever they&#039;re about to spawn to both teams.\n- QSS Cleanse effect only applies to Crowd Control effects, not all debuffs.\n\nNone of these changes seem to have balance in mind at all. Rather, they simply drop the skill floor.\n\nRiot, it&#039;s very clear you&#039;re catering to casual players. The players most likely to leave your game for another one. The players least likely to keep spending money on your game. The players least likely to spend most of their gaming time on it.\n\nWell, you&#039;ve managed to lose me, one of your dedicated players of over 6 years. I&#039;m sure more of your dedicated players aren&#039;t too far behind.","replies":[]}
