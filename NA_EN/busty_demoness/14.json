You have to find a way to offer something mechanically new and different to keep players from seeing the same mechanics over and over again.\r\n\r\nNow, while it&#039;s still necessary for long-lived games to continue thriving, it can also be done too quickly to be healthy for said games (look at Pendulum and Link monsters regarding Yugioh). League, to some extent, has been okay about keeping the power creep slower. The problem is that it hasn&#039;t been so slow that everything can be scaled up in reasonable amounts of time.\r\n\r\nThe best kind of power creep, in whatever form it takes (raw attacking power, mobility, defenses, utility), is the kind that&#039;s slow and meticulous so that nothing is outright left in the dust. World of Warcraft actually did a fairly good job regarding power creep, with many raid bosses of the immediately previous expansion usually still needing at least a small group. Blizzard hasn&#039;t quite done a perfect job, however. And this shows even more in Hearthstone.\r\n\r\nRiot focusing on champion reworks is a good sign that they understand they didn&#039;t reign in power creep very well. However, I still believe that Riot could do one better and simply reign in the biggest offenders of power creep rather than buffing everyone else up to speed.","replies":[]}
