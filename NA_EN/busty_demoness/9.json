Because toxicity punishments being tied to rewards has been a thing since Season 4. This isn&#039;t new for most people. Most everyone knew the end of season was coming up and knew punishments would lead to being stripped of rewards.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not going to deny that honor takes time to obtain. But I honestly have to ask, how hard is it for all of you to NOT be punished? I have my moments, and I have RARELY been punished. So part of me simply doesn&#039;t understand why so many people have trouble with not being unpleasant.","replies":[]}
