Mana is useless obviously, and attack speed is actually bad because it messes up her animation canceling. What she needs is AD, and triforce doesn't provide enough to justify the cost and delayed powerspike. Remember that she's a champion whose survivability scales with AD (because of her shield), so going damage is actually what makes her thougher to kill.","replies":[{"poster":"Tshum94","date":"2017-06-26T17:54:29.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just tried it and it felt really clunky. There was only really increased damage on one auto. 2 if I was lucky. And tbh I don't think I've played riven enough to get good at her.

Though it is not a good item on Riven, it is very interesting to think about the synergies and why we thought it could be good (CDR, sheen procs) but it actually wasn't that great (worthless stats, high price for not that much).\nI encourage you to keep looking into trying out items on which you see some potential synergies with champions because understanding the synergies and why people mostly pick X or Y item on champions, its strengths and weaknesses, is a very interesting part of league of legends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rexxiee","date":"2017-06-26T23:03:11.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not good, too low damage for her and she cant fully abuse the sheen procs because she wants to get the most spells going in the shortest time possible, so the sheen cd kinda ruins that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Senpai Negro","date":"2017-06-26T23:00:27.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't recommend Tri Force simply because the way Black Cleaver and ani-canceling works you get more damage when you ani-cancel with Black Cleaver than Tri Force","replies":[]},{"poster":"Denims Wrath666","date":"2017-06-26T22:59:25.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bc is just better on her, and the cd items are too good to just stack bc and tri on her. the sheen proc isn't that impressive either. after like 3 or 4 bc stacks you make up for the lack of sheen damage anyways with just straight up auto attacks. this debate would be similar to asking if bc would be good on nasus. sure, but not that great for his kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2017-06-26T22:42:10.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"asked the same question a few weeks ago. Answer I got was that Black cleaver was much better due to stats and her scalings.

You'll get more damage from pure AD with your passive than you will with Trinity procs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-06-26T19:18:30.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you wanna use Triforce, you're gonna be using an entirely poke based playstyle. Take Tlords.\n\nWhat you wanna do is Q+W+auto+dash out for trading. It'll do decent damage and you won't take much damage.\n\nYour all in will be pretty weak compared to normal Riven, unless you're 1) against a tanky champion who will take more than a normal fast combo _and_ 2) you have enough AD for the attackspeed/Sheen proc to outdamage AD stats, and 3) If you're replacing cleaver, you'll also have to make up for no armor shred.\n\nIt's not a terrible item, per se, but it's too expensive and has too much gold in stats that Riven doesn't use (or rarely uses), like the mana and attack speed. Compared to most other items, it's pretty shit. Especially if you're using the same amount of gold.","replies":[]}]}
