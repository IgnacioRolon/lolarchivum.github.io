I didnt touch it but my friend clicked the link and logged in. Since his email wasn't confirmed someone stole his account. His name is --snip--and he has spent a lot of money on RP so it would be awful if his account got lost. Is there any way to get his account back? If anyone have any ideas i would be thankful if you would be willing to help. I would do anything to help my friend get his account back.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-16T17:14:46.781+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw damn, sounds like he fell for a phishing scam.  :(  I've edited out the account in your post for privacy, but locked it as a security measure to prevent further unauthorized access.
