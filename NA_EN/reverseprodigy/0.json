I knew my wifi was not the problem because i was playing youtube music while i was playing league so if wifi was the problem then the music would also stop. So i sign in to league once again hoping to see the reconnect button but I dont see it there so i was so confuse i can check the match history and there was no sign of the game i just quit. No LP lost, no remake , or lost in match history. When i left game i was 7 minutes into game and took me a minute to relogin and did not see it so i click the play button and it allow me to play another league game. I was just so confuse of what just happen and i just wanted to share this experience , wondering if it had happen to other before. I been playing league since season 4 it never happen to me and i dont think it will ever again.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-28T00:07:52.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's likely that match was either forfeited, remade, or possibly crashed entirely on the server side. When those crashes happen, you won't get any penalties and should be able to requeue as soon as you're back on the client home screen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CheesepufAcademy","date":"2017-08-27T08:50:52.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They probably ffed tbh but yeah that's weird.","replies":[{"poster":"P3NANC3","date":"2017-08-27T12:48:57.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CheesepufAcademy,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=rdj2vIwm,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-08-27T08:50:52.451+0000)\n>\n> They probably ffed tbh but yeah that&#x27;s weird.\n\nPerhaps, but just as I dislike others leaving, I don't ever leave...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"P3NANC3","date":"2017-08-27T07:06:28.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had the same problem with a normal yesterday.\nReally annoying since I don't know if the rest of the players continued, and whether or not they reported me for something I couldn't do anything about.","replies":[]}]}
