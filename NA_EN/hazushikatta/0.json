My friend told me that Riot said that editing particles was impossible or very hard to do but it's actually _literally the easiest part._\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5q4Ue_Ih2M&feature=youtu.be\n\nhttp://puu.sh/h5XlB/d76a9e206a.png \nhttp://puu.sh/h5XmE/b5ebdb1c7a.png \nhttp://puu.sh/h5XnC/1522238663.png \nhttp://puu.sh/h5Xo3/a493c88647.png\n\nedit again: the same friend told me to do a blue zac one and to put it here too so here you go, this one literally took less than 5 minutes ಠ__ಠ\n\nhttp://puu.sh/h5SjV/571f8844e8.png\n\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/FOhsMJB0-introducing-chroma-packs\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/frequently-asked-questions-about-chromas-packs\n\n\"The community has been asking for recolors for a long while, but despite testing and experimenting with a few internal ideas, we couldn&rsquo;t find a way to build them that satisfied our high standards. The current price reflects the work we put into crafting them.\n\nYeah, it&rsquo;s possible to do a quick and dirty overlay, or shift a slider left in an editing program, but we think you would call us on that bullshit real quick, and as players ourselves, we wouldn&rsquo;t be satisfied with such a hacky solution.\"\n\nYou were right, Riot. This is in fact bullshit.\n\nI&#039;ve done my own recolours before, both the base skin and the particles. I wish I could find screenshots. (Update, see below)\n\nIt looked just as \"professional\" as Riot&#039;s provided screenshots, and you know what? It took me an hour to do. And I&#039;d never done it before.\n\nRiot are showing their greed. You could sit down the coffee intern who has no art training at all at a computer with photoshop and all the skin textures, come back in a week and he could have _easily_ made three recolours of each skin in the game.\n\nIf they made it unlockable through champion mastery, which is currently terrible (CHAMP SUMMONER ICONS. RIOT. ARE YOU DEAF.), it would be a good feature. Or even IP.\n\nBut charging money for a level of effort equivalent to changing the name of a folder? Yeah no, Riot.\n\nUpdated: I went into Photoshop and messed around with a random skin (happened to be Foxfire Ahri, in hindsight I should have picked someone with more... visible clothing like Twisted Fate for example, or even Anivia or something), like literally scribbled here and there without caring too much. \n\nThey can claim it takes effort all they want but the simple fact is that I have no training in doing this, spent less than half an hour, and basically made a \"chroma\" which they want to charge us for. \n\nI picked completely random colours, I can do the particles too if you&#039;d like. They take even less time than the actual skin itself, literally all you have to do is use the colour replacement tool and scribble all over it.\n\nhttp://puu.sh/h4n9j/8493a4a97b.png\nhttp://puu.sh/h4ncq/2239be20cb.png\nhttp://puu.sh/h4ne3/902dfb413a.png\nhttp://puu.sh/h4ng5/76886a6e03.png\nhttp://puu.sh/h4mZH/266a3c1a70.png\nhttp://puu.sh/h4n1a/a738c75d42.png\n\n\n\ntldr triggered","replies":[{"poster":"Migrañaboy","date":"2015-04-07T04:02:12.213+0000","up_votes":166,"down_votes":11,"body":"What people dont know:\n\n>>Chroma packs were intended to be obtained by methods other than RP.\n>>They have a great idea, and first state its a RP exclusive.\n>>Then they \"deliver\" by doing what the community asks.\n>>Now Rito is seen as a community-oriented company.**\n\nYou read this first here. :^)","replies":[{"poster":"PoisonedPeace","date":"2015-04-07T08:59:31.543+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":3,"body":"Maybe that will happen 6 months later when nobody buys chromas","replies":[{"poster":"Kosmicosis","date":"2015-04-07T18:20:58.272+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":147,"body":"Cute, you are so narcissistic that you think that you and a few people on forums, whom agree on one point, suddenly means \"everyone\" will boycott...\n\nNewsflash: the minority of players even bother with boards, and you are the minority of that minority.

It's like I have to repeat the point over and over for you people to understand. The point is that the all these people that DID take the time to post mostly shared the same opinion on the subject. It's like if APPLE had all their products showed a poll asking some random opinion on something. Let's say out of the billions of people who bought their products, only a hundred thousand took the time to vote on the poll. Let's say 90% of those voters chose the first option on the poll. Do you think Apple is just going to ignore the 100k that did vote just because they have billions of users who didn't take the time to vote? \n\nYou can argue about us still not being the 12 million all you want but that isn't going to change the fact that the people that did take the time to post in these threads, polls, and websites had the same opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"2 much sauuuce","date":"2015-04-08T03:26:17.589+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":14,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chaoswyrm,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=dzOjoPEz,comment-id=000300000001000000010000,timestamp=2015-04-08T02:00:29.059+0000)\n>\n> They had over 2000 user's post in their main thread, 25,670 in their main Reddit thread, 19,815 users post in their second Reddit thread, and tons of other unofficial threads sharing the same opinion.\n\n25,670 divided by 12 million means a 0.022% of the player base.  That's an awfully small sample.\n\nAlso the majority of players vote and show their support through their actions and wallets, not by posting on the forums which is mostly a bunch of people complaining, whining, bitching, etc.\n\nNot trying to belittle your position, and it's true that these people did take the time to respond and all that.  But it's still a VERY SMALL portion of the player base that even uses the forums and reditt, and an even smaller portion saying \"this is just bad\".\n\nIn Riot's defense, any visual content change has always been attainable by RP only.  There have never been any in-game cosmetic visual changes that I can recall in the 4 years I've been playing attainable by non-RP means.  Riot is simply following their own business model.  If it fails, then it fails and they need to figure out something new.  But they are following their tried and true model.","replies":[{"poster":"Thanatar16","date":"2015-04-08T04:44:09.627+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ask the average League player if they would prefer paying 450 RP and it's value in money for a skin recolorization, or if they would like it free.\n\nOr even skip the whole \"free\" part, and simply ask the average League player who spends money if they think 450 RP is a good value for a simple recolorization of their Champions, and if they plan on buying it.\n\nSimple as that really.","replies":[{"poster":"2 much sauuuce","date":"2015-04-08T07:26:02.185+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thanatar16,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=dzOjoPEz,comment-id=00030000000100000001000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-08T04:44:09.627+0000)\n>\n> Ask the average League player if they would prefer paying 450 RP and it's value in money for a skin recolorization, or if they would like it free.\n> \n> Or even skip the whole \"free\" part, and simply ask the average League player who spends money if they think 450 RP is a good value for a simple recolorization of their Champions, and if they plan on buying it.\n> \n> Simple as that really.\n\nAnd I totally agree.  Considering the \"average\" skin takes at least a months worth of work to create (One at the 750 rp tier anyways) I whole-heartedly agree that the price they are asking, and also bundling them all together, is not a very business savy model.  Under any circumstances.\n\nI just don't think they have thought this out thoroughly just yet.\n\nHaving a 3 color chroma pack for the base skin at this price seems reasonable.  Making it a 3 color chroma pack at the same price for a skin THAT WE ALREADY HAD TO PURCHASE and then forcing us to buy 3 of them is overboard.  We already paid good money for the skin.  If it's a recolor for a purchased skin then each separate color should be purchasable for less.  Say 50 to 75 rp per recolor.\n\nUnless there is some coding problem which is likely why they are making them packs.  If that's the case, the price for purchased skins should still be lower.  150 to 200 rp for 3 recolors wouldn't be over the top or too little.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-04-07T11:43:36.925+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, for the proper \"Rito is seen as a community-oriented company\" effect, they have to change it to something other than RP *before* people notice that charging RP was a flop, otherwise it becomes a \"Rito done goofed\" situation instead.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-04-07T05:20:59.589+0000","up_votes":70,"down_votes":62,"body":"People cannot read.\n\n*\"All options are still open in the future, including earning additional chromas through champion mastery, but we’re sticking with RP-only **at launch**, in line with our historical approach to cosmetic content\"*\n\nRIP entire thread\n\nIt's really popular to hate on Riot it seems.

If it takes a complete novice less than an hour to create a chroma for a reasonably complex champion (art-wise), this becomes reeeeeally questionable.\n\n---\n\nMath!\n\nLet's say there are five main parts to this development process:\n\n* Research\n* Recolor\n* Assessment/QA\n* Iteration\n* Release\n\nI'm going to use extremely rough numbers and probably be way off base, but I'm going to err on the side of overboard because it paints a better picture (cwutididthar).  Let's assume each step of the process requires the following work:\n\n* Research - 5 people, 40 hours each\n* Recolor - 1 person, 8 hours\n* Assessment/QA - 3 people, 40 hours each\n* Iteration - 10 people, 40 hours each\n* Release - 5 people, 8 hours each\n\nThis works out to a total of 768 hours, though I would be pretty surprised if a single Chroma pack took this many man-hours to complete seeing as the OP did it in half an hour.  Let's also assume that everyone working on this project was paid an average of $40 an hour, or roughly an $80k salary per person.  This works out to a total cost of $30,720 for each chroma pack, and assuming each chroma pack costs $5 in RP Riot requires 6,144 sales.  \n\nAssuming a community of 50 million people (it's much higher by official numbers, but whatever let's make the numbers look as good as possible for Riot), this is about 0.0001% of the population, or about a tenth of the number of people in Diamond in North America.  I would be very surprised if that sale percentage isn't feasible from Riot's perspective, selling six thousand units of a desirable product to a population of 50 million people really shouldn't be that difficult.\n\nTLDR, here are the numbers as per above:\n\n* 768 total man-hours for a set of chromas\n* $40 cost per hour\n* $30,720 total cost\n* 6,144 sales to break even\n\n---\n\nRiot needs to make money, and I get that these cosmetics are the main source of revenue for the entire company, but it's a little concerning that either a simple recolor takes such an extraordinarily long time that it warrants this cost or the profit margin is so astronomically high.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kile147","date":"2015-04-07T08:03:28.180+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"All I got from this post is that champions look creepy as hell when you smash them into a 2-D image.","replies":[]},{"poster":"insaiyanbacca","date":"2015-04-07T03:18:13.019+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":73,"body":"i dont see a problem tbh there is a reason you get 3 for 590 rp they are super easy to make and dont change much so each of them is only worth like 190 ish rp. so its 5 bucks and you basically get 3 really cheap skins","replies":[{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2015-04-07T03:59:38.674+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":5,"body":"Of which you're likely to use one.

I've messed around with photoshop myself and done pretty much what the OP describes. It's hard to justify paying for what feels like extra colors on a Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter game. Really, this kind of blatant cash grab reminds me of that old Horse Armor DLC for Oblivion. Difference being that Bethesda made that mistake years ago for everyone to learn from and haven't really pulled crap like that since then to my knowledge.
