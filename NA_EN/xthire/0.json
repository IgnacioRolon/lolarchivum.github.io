Be sure to double check that your OS is allowing League access to the files it needs by going through the steps in this [**permissions guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions). \n\nIf that doesn't help, reach out to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with some game logs so they can get a better idea of what's happening.","replies":[]}]}
