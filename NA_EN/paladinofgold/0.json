It used to be and is still occasionally 32-28 ping stable. But now, about 90% of the time, my ping jumps randomly between 60-220 ping. This is causing my game to perform worse and I've tried many things to try and fix it. I close out of everything when I play league, so that it is the only thing open (not even the client is open, i turned that off). It is not my router because i have restarted it and came back to league with the same issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-10T21:32:06.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might be experiencing packet loss in your game, something specifically degrading your connection while in-game.
