Java and JavaScript, on the other hand, would increment Gameplay by 1 first, but would add to Gameplay the _old_ value of Gameplay and then assign that back to Gameplay, overwriting the brief Gameplay+1 that Gameplay used to have, for an equivalent expression of 2\\*Gameplay.\n\nIf you used pre-increment instead, C/C++ would produce 2\\*(Gameplay+1) while Java and JS would produce Gameplay+(Gameplay+1).\n\nAs far as I can hypothesize, Python assignment expressions in 3.8 will treat the closest approximation of Gameplay := Gameplay + (Gameplay := Gameplay + 1) as Gameplay+(Gameplay+1), according to my dictionary-as-namespace setup. But that's more of a pre-increment situation - I don't currently see how to emulate a post-increment, since integers aren't even mutable in Python.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend not mutating a variable while you're mutating it. In any language.\n\nOf course, a Gameplay object could have custom behavior for these operators rather than behaving like an integer, so who knows.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-08-30T20:36:03.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Notepad++ is really great.
