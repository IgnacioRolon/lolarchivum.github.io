The timer slowly counts down to zero and we&#039;re basically in a game with no jungler. Especially in ranked, it forces someone on your team to dodge if it looks like your jungler is AFK without Smite. \n\nThe solution would be to automatically kick the jungler when the timer reaches zero and no one on the team has Smite. This is more fair because others shouldn&#039;t suffer dodge penalties for a jungler&#039;s inattention. You&#039;d still be allowed to trade since there's no issue as long as someone has Smite.\n\nAnother way to reduce the chance of this happening in the first place is to automatically give the jungler Smite on the key he used in previous jungle games. In case of a trade or a change in preferences, he can still modify it but this would avoid accidental smiteless jungler games.

You need Smite to get the basic components for clearing such as Hunter's Talisman or Machete. Besides the help with clearing and sustain, the jungle items  provide essential experience so that you don't fall too far behind laners. Even if none of these were issues, it would be difficult to contest objectives without Smite.","replies":[{"poster":"The Poetic Zed","date":"2016-01-27T04:35:22.370+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":30,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=exigentomic,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=j2wEK4hp,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-01-27T03:07:11.663+0000)\n>\n> You can choose many off-meta picks but the role of \"Jungle\" still requires Smite and that's pretty clearly defined.

But that doesn't make it a requirement. That's like punishing an ADC for not having heal. Most of them take it, but it's not required. And for the record, Rengar is a jungler that can go without smite. I'm not debating the fact that it puts you at a severe disadvantage, that's 100% true. But you can't punish someone for not having a specific summoner spell, regardless of what role they're in. A jungler is someone who is in the jungle, and helps the team with objectives and laning while clearing jungle camps. A jungler is not someone with smite. Smite used to be a top-lane thing too.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLittlestLulu","date":"2016-01-27T08:08:36.666+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":11,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Poetic Zed,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=j2wEK4hp,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-01-27T04:35:22.370+0000)\n>\n> No, smite is tailored to the jungle.

I'm saying skill level doesn't have jack shit to do with this argument. Riot isn't going to kick someone from a game and give them a queue dodge because they didn't have smite. Because it is not a MANDATORY summoner spell. And that's what you don't seem to understand. I'm not saying it's a good idea to go smiteless, I'm not saying it would work well, I'm saying it's not okay to kick someone for not having smite.

In fact what the OP was describing is a **PROTECTION** for the players, including the jungle, in champ select.\n\nFor argument sake lets say the OP also wanted it as a **PROTECTION** from off-meta wild picks.  IM SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT RANKED COMPETITIVE PLAY.  When you as a player decide to Q up for a RANKED COMPETITIVE game, you as a player apart of a five man team have just taken on a degree of responsibility.  You said that, \"I'm defending the option to play smiteless jungle\", and you know what in normals non-COMPETITIVE play sure good ahead.  This changes in ranked, you have a responsibility to play the game with a mediocre of strategy and efficiency.  You said, \"I don't give a shit if someone wants to jungle smiteless.\".  That is swell, but I'm pretty damn sure if we took a poll the majority of people in RANK COMPETITIVE play would have a big problem with this.\n\nIs one persons desire > 4 innocent players on his team?

You sabotage your team in such a massive way that there is no way you can realistically consider it anything but a requirement. Not taking Heal on an ADC is nowhere near the same thing. They don't have IE require Heal and there are plenty of viable even if suboptimal choices. Ignite or Barrier won't make your team lose anywhere near as much as not having a Smite.\n\nThe standard queue dodge penalty is a punishment. You can play with two top laners instead of a jungler. It's the same as a smiteless jungler except one is roaming. The only way it \"sabotages\" a team is because everyone is so used to having a jungler. You aren't. Granted it's been implemented in the new queue, but before that there was no requirements to a team other than having five members.","replies":[{"poster":"ofart","date":"2016-01-27T05:11:54.067+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Poetic Zed,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=j2wEK4hp,comment-id=00000001000000000000,timestamp=2016-01-27T05:06:46.913+0000)\n>\n> The standard queue dodge penalty is a punishment.

I'd love to see how it goes. It is NOT a different playstyle or creative new way of playing. It's simply not viable and equivalent to going ADC Soraka just because you can. I suppose the first idea wouldn't have to be implemented for normals but it's 100% trolling in ranked. There is no equally viable non-Smite jungle playstyle and Riot has designed the game around Smite being taken on the jungler. It's not the same as deciding \"hey, I want to go play AP Nami mid because I'm so cool and hip.\" Even in the case of Nunu, not having Smite is a large disadvantage in clear time, efficiency for ganks, objective control and levels.

That's your prerogative but it's nice to have that option. Personally, I've never had people troll me for being accommodating enough to offer a trade of roles. If I think a trade is best for the team, I'd be willing to go for it even with the risk of the dodge penalty once in a blue moon. When someone says to trade and trolls you, it probably wouldn't be a fun game with good teammates anyway.

Or, I've accidentally kept smite on a laner simply because I jungle primarily.  Often people will end up taking the wrong summoner simply because they're running on autopilot and it doesn't occur to them that they want heal now since they're going to be adc, not the teleport that they had from last game.
