I suppose Mundo has better sticking power 1vs1 but I don't think it matters much since Swain has his W, Q and if he really needs more, Rylai's will give him a 40% slow on everything. From playing Swain, the problem is less sticking power and more getting onto them initially. The new Swain may not have the same burst as before but he will still destroy any squishy if he lands W.\n\nI agree that Mundo has more sustainable poke though. It's not actually better in terms of damage but the low CD and cost makes it fairly spammable. Its damage becomes negligible though unless you go a squishy Liandrys Mundo or something of that sort. \n\nI think Swain needs a longer CD on his ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2016-05-19T18:57:40.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget Mundo can build full tank and gets speed in his ult.\n\nComparing individual abilities without considering the whole champion isn't useful.","replies":[{"poster":"PrometheS","date":"2016-05-19T19:04:26.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=gank me pls,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1KdcpZnv,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-05-19T18:57:40.822+0000)\n>\n> Don&#x27;t forget Mundo can build full tank and gets speed in his ult.\n> \n> Comparing individual abilities without considering the whole champion isn&#x27;t useful.\n\nMundo does have a mobility advantage due to ult. and his W CC reduction but he's not really that good in teamfights or late game. He shines mid game and is best on a low-income since his base damage is fairly good but doesn't get much better later. Swain is probably a far better top laner than Mundo at this point but at least Mundo can hide from Swain in the jungle. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2016-05-19T19:19:51.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"then why are you comparing an early-game health stacker with a late-game sustain mage","replies":[{"poster":"PrometheS","date":"2016-05-19T20:57:58.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Big Lincoln,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1KdcpZnv,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-05-19T19:19:51.408+0000)\n>\n> then why are you comparing an early-game health stacker with a late-game sustain mage\n\nI'm comparing two tanks mid game.
