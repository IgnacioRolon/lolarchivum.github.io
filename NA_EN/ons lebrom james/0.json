The game starts smoothly with constant 60 fps but in about a minute, the FPS number drops to 10-15 a doesn´t get to previous \"level\". After restarting the game, the fps gets back to 60 but then again drops after a while. Before I‘ve never experienced any fps problems like this in the game. Tried to clear my registry, reinstall my drivers etc. Nothing helped. \r\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-02T16:10:09.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reinstalling drivers are a good step, but there could be bad game files as well that's struggling to render the match properly.
