Here I meet the second unbelieveable obstacle. It showed me that I still cannot log in my account in NA region with formal way. (I use the link from password reset email to come to here and type this) RIOT, do you understand if a player like me lost his or her account and got account transfered, there is almost no way to subscribe a ticket to report their troubles!!!\r\n\r\nAnd after I try my greatest effort and finish my report, I got a receipt email with the language I could not understand, and I have to use google translator to help me to get understand it. \r\n\r\nHow could there is not any single link or buttom for players who could directly contact to RIOT and report the most important problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-22T05:35:02.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oof, losing an account is not a fun experience!
