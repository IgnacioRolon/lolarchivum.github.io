I can't spend 24/7 on this game to get Honor 5 with 15 checkpoints I have to go through. Even if I manage at minimum 2 honors a game, 10 games a day, 7 days a week, 365.25 days a year. I don't think I will be able to hit Honor 5.\n\nLast season I got Honor 4 but that's after like 1000 games with maybe 2-3 honors average.\n\nNow it feels impossible unless I live League, which I don't want to. I mean sure, it makes sense to play more, you get more in return but I simply can't put in as much effort as I did last year due to conflict in life schedule.\n\nI wish the checkpoint were more like a progression bar, that the \"honors\" you receive from team mates would add to that progression bar. If you get honorable in a game it boosts even more, etc etc. \n\nI don't know where I am with the checkpoints. Stage 1 of 3, I've been on this for over the past 6 months :P I feel better if I would be able to see the progression as oppose to a vague, you are here.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-09T03:32:00.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mærk,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jB2E3x6t,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-07-09T03:30:06.926+0000)\n>\n> See...

I honestly don't think it's average. I am sure the new honor system is more complicated *(like how most updates since season 4)* and or probably requires you to obtain certain honors within a time frame.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-09T04:37:30.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mærk,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jB2E3x6t,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2018-07-09T04:32:06.470+0000)\n>\n> If it&#x27;s not a grind method, the average should have gotten me at least honor 3 by now.

Decay for punishments/leaves works similarly.","replies":[{"poster":"mærk","date":"2018-07-09T04:57:17.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jB2E3x6t,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-07-09T04:37:30.368+0000)\n>\n> It does, but the time frame is almost definitely a number of games, not real time.
