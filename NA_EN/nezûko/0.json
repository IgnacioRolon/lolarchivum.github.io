My fps and mms are the same as always and i havent touched any graphically settings since the day i downloaded league going on 3-4 years ago. In game my champ will stutter around, and will slow down to a crawl then it's movement speed will sky rocket, as if catching up to where its supposed to be. All timers, including ability cool downs and objective timers are delayed by a couple seconds and I believe that even enemy spells are delayed on my end too because they seem to almost come out of no where now. My friend had this same type of lag, it lasted for a couple months almost. it finally fixed when his power went out one day and everything in his house went down. And before someone says 'ISP's fault', I use Comcast and he has Windstream I believe, so I doubt it. Any fixes?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-09T05:41:47.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your friend may have had a different solution to his issue, but it sounds like the issue may be the same- *Packet Loss*. Packet loss is often the result of problematic network settings or routing issues along your ISP (and their affiliates) network. As a first step, I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local network settings are fine.\n\nLet me know the results of those steps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Es Gaurdian","date":"2016-11-07T01:25:57.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same","replies":[]}]}
