Problem is exactly as you described it, loading circle on the champion icon, where mastery and grading are supposed to be, and the upper left corner where it shows the LP you gained. Seeing as you play on EUNE too, it could be a server problem. It has happened before, and in my experience, I did gain my LP later, so expect it to be sorted out soon. If it doesn't get fixed by tomorrow, then the best you can do is file a support ticket on Riot's website.","replies":[]}]}
