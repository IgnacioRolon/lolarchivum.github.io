When I clicked the icon on my desktop top it brought up the patcher and when I clcked launch it did not bring up the login page I did not receive any error. When I tried clicking the icon again it gives me a message saying there is another process of the LoL running I went to the net and looked up all the processes tied to LoL and terminated them and tried running it again and the same issue happened I brought up the patcher hit launch and it didn't bring up the sign in page. I've been trying to fix it for a while now and I've hit a brick wall if anyone has this issue and has had it fixed can you tell me what I need to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-19T03:02:42.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue often happens as a result of a poor connection to the login servers.
