{"poster":"Senpai Gnar","date":"2014-12-15T06:10:55.174+0000","title":"Issues since 4.21","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ever since patch 4.21 was released, I have been having a ridiculous amount of problems. I have covered everything from firewall errors to league crashing my computer and forcing me to hard reset. Ive even had to reinstall League to fix frame rate problems that still occur, which I now know deleting the file game.cfg also fixes that issue, temporarily. Every time I try to contact support, they blame my computer and honestly, that is getting old.\r\n\r\nYou know how I know it isn't my computer? Riot doesn't care, so they can skip this paragraph. I play Steam games as well as league, and if I can run Tropico 5 max settings (a game that came out not even 3 months ago) and have absolutely no problems, my computer is fine. I play everything from Fallout to Garry's Mod, and I don't have any issues of any kind with any other game but League. So for once, can Riot please stop saying it is my computer and take this seriously?\r\n\r\nThere is a problem somewhere in League's code that doesn't like Windows 8.1, or some part of my hardware. Maybe my computer is to advanced and modern for League, or maybe my drivers are updated beyond what League is capable of. I keep my system in good health, running all the maintenance it needs when it needs it, not to much and not to little. I don't have any clue as to why League has these problems, but somewhere along the line, it does and Riot doesn't seem to want to admit it.\r\n\r\nI also know I am not alone. I can easily google some of the issues I have and there are forums on websites from gamespot to the very boards you are on now, all with people sharing the same problem I have experienced recently. Whether this gets attention or not, I have no idea and cant control that. All I want is for Riot to accept there is a problem, and perhaps try to resolve it. Game balance is great, new content is great, but whats the point when the game itself has problems that limit some people's ability to even play?\r\n\r\nThis may be just another rant from a person who has run out of patience, but I am posting this because it makes me feel better knowing Riot MIGHT read this, and also that other people with similar problems might come across this and bring it to Riot's attention. I love League, both the gameplay and the lore behind it, but it is very difficult to enjoy a game that has bipolar.exe syndrome. It might work, it might not work, who knows? If it doesn't want to work today, have fun getting busted by leaverbuster!\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I am done now.{{summoner:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-12-15T22:33:26.657+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Senpai Roadkill!\n\nI took the time to read your entire post (even the paragraph you said that we can \"skip\" -- btw, how is Tropico 5?

The R3d log I attached is from a game that went fine, but I have one game where League locked up my entire computer forcing me to reboot. The R3d file for that game is 136,240 KB and I cannot attach it because it is to large of a file. \n\nAnd thank you for taking the time to reply {{summoner:31}} \n\nAs for Tropico 5, I love it! The 4 player online is a bit buggy, not sure if that ever got patched yet, but 3 players is just as fun.\n\n\n*EDIT: I opened up the R3d log that was 136 MB and after scrolling for some few minutes, I only saw the same thing over and over. it was like it was stuck in an infinite loop. If you would like, I can include some copy/paste from it but I have no idea how I would send you the entire log. My email wont even let me send a 136MB file xD\nThere is also another game from the other day that did the same thing to my computer, forcing me to reboot. The R3d file from that game is 147 MB. I may not be a programmer, but judging by the averagee file size of less than 1,000 KB, these logs are absurdly large.\n\nAdditionally, I am running league in compatibility mode for Windows 7. I have been doing this since I upgraded to Windows 8.1 but this problem only just started in the past week.

However, I did learn something that maybe someone with more tech knowledge might be able to explain to me?\n\nI read that Alienware system use both an intel integrated graphics card and the NVidia graphics card, which both have drivers that can work together to complete various tasks. What I think I understood from that is if I updated to the news NVidia drivers from the NVidia website, maybe the drivers I downloaded don't support this Alienware feature and since the two cards are not working together properly, it is the cause for various games to crash. \n\nI also can confirm that League is not the only game crashing on me anymore. I had Fallout NV crash on me today as well, with the exact same symptoms I get when League crashes. I no longer believe it is League, but if anyone knows more about this, any and all help will be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\nAs a side note, I don't want to delete drivers and install older ones unless I know for sure it will fox this. While I can do it, I am not comfortable with it unless it is necessary.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Senpai Gnar","date":"2014-12-16T00:08:55.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dArtagnan,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=78Oum4MU,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2014-12-15T23:57:47.494+0000)\n> I took a look at your logs and two things immediately jump out at me as big red flags:\n> \n> 1) Your DxDiag shows you running an integrated Intel Graphics Card.

Follow these steps very carefully to try to clean re-install them:\n\n**NOTE**:  *You may want to create a System Restore point before proceeding.  This can be accomplished by simply navigating to your Start Menu, and typing \"create a restore point\".  Once the new Restore Point window opens, selecting the \"Create\" button near the bottom.  A new window will appear asking you to name it.  Simply name it \"old drivers\" or something related.  Follow the last few prompts to create the restore point.*\n\nPut the latest Nvidia drivers you downloaded earlier somewhere easily accessible on your desktop.\n\nNext, follow these steps:\n\n1) Open your start menu > Control Panel > search for device manager\n2) In the device manager follow the tree to: (user name) > Display Adapter > Right click your graphics card and click \"properties\".\n3) In the new window, navigate over to the Driver tab and click the uninstall button at the bottom.  When a new window appears, make sure to select \"delete the driver software for this device\" before clicking OK\n4) Once the driver has been uninstalled you will need to restart and your resolution will likely change to a very low resolution as the computer is now using generic windows drivers for the graphics card.  Rest assured, this is completely normal.\n\nNow that your drivers are completely uninstalled, find that Nvidia driver file that was on your desktop and run/install them.

Never with any other champion. Now im wondering if there is some correlation? One of my friends also reports bad frame rates when using the Project Yasuo skin. Is this known issue?\n\nEDIT: I can confirm that Yasuo is now the source of my problem. For whatever reason, my game only locks up when I play Yasuo, not any other champion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"supersonic2","date":"2014-12-16T01:42:38.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I been having issues myself.","replies":[{"poster":"Senpai Gnar","date":"2014-12-16T01:49:55.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=supersonic2,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=78Oum4MU,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2014-12-16T01:42:38.910+0000)\n>\n> I been having issues myself.\n\nWhat issues might those be?
