Riot will normally begin making balance adjustments on live servers no sooner than 2 weeks after release, unless there are major problems. \n\nGiven how unique Ivern is, compared to pretty much every other champion, the community is somewhat slow to pick up on his strengths and how to play with and against him. As a result, most people will see him as weak, but the few who have got an early grasp on him will seem strong. There isn't really a middle ground at this point. \n\nDo I think he is 'broken' ... no, not really. He has a lot of strategic advantages that he offers to his team, but he doesn't really have all that much damage. He is designed as a Jungle support. The closest role in relation to this is a Mage Support. Fed Mage Supports are strong on their own, so it is theoretically possible for him to get fed and be strong. However, as a Support, is meant to assist strong carries. All of the things that you have mentioned as his strengths, are his tools for doing just that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Perma CC","date":"2016-10-14T03:51:13.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you kidding me?

Far from it actually. Think of him as a secondary Support to your team. He's in the jungle, getting stronger on his own. Yet he can't really fight on his own, like a Kayle can. He can't use Red and Blue buff well because he can't duel. That's why he gives Red and Blue buff to other champions as well as him.

Ivern pretty much screws over anyone hit by his Q, a free flash for his ally, combined with a retarded 70% slow from his E, + if his ally has a hard CC = Youre fucked. Lets not forget about the double red buff wombo combo retardedness Ivern offers. Dont even get me started on that dumb looking boombox summon thingy that can knock you up whenever it's bored.","replies":[]}]}]}
