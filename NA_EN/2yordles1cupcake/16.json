The joys of Riot \"hating\" snowballing, and fixing it by implementing 20 things to make you snowball games faster lol\n\nOne of the biggest problems with towers is how easy is to drop aggro\n\nFor example, do you know one of the reasons why Elise is so strong at the moment? Because she can towerdive easily. With the help of her laner, Elise can just towerdive pre-6, take tower aggro, and when she is about to take fatal damage, drop tower aggro with her Spider form's E.\n\nOne of the problems with towers early game is that it is just too easy to escape without dying, thanks to mobility/untargetability that allows laners to tower dive early with too much ease.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-10-26T20:14:16.838+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny you said that, just last game as ADC Kennen I was able to tower dive and kill a Lucian by myself while taking like 4 shots from the tower, even ADCs can tower dive with ease.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-10-26T16:33:15.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"You mean a powerful long range mage has no problems killing under tower?\n\nWith a reapplying shield? \n\nUm, wow?","replies":[{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2015-10-27T00:26:33.724+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Silents429,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PWaPItrn,comment-id=000200000001,timestamp=2015-10-26T16:33:15.562+0000)\n>\n> You mean a powerful long range mage has no problems killing under tower?\n> \n> With a reapplying shield? \n> \n> Um, wow?\n\nMaybe you missed the part about turret diving.
