He wasn't saying \"why are they recommending ignite on a support?\", but \"why are they recommending support items when I pick ignite?\" \"Why are they recommending xyz with ignite\" was kinda vaguely worded. I was thinking, wat? They don't recommend summoner spells... now I see what he means.\n\nAnd, of course, the answer to his question is: the only definitive summoner spell on which you can base certain item recommendations is smite, which is why Riot has given us item set customizations to make our OWN recommended builds. Because, oh I don't know, they actually ARE in touch with the community? W/e, I'm not gonna edit my other post. Gotta remember that ignite-spellthief proc idea. IT'S HAPPENIN'.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Archon X","date":"2015-11-22T08:00:23.181+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"ignite is a legitimate ss on supports","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kãtãrinã","date":"2015-11-22T07:43:55.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"it doesn't recommend items based on summoner spells (unless you have smite)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Milodic Mellodi","date":"2015-11-22T11:20:04.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{summoner:14}} is an extremely legit Spell on Supports. You're assuming all your ADCs are incapacitated potty-trainers, since pretty much any ADC that actually practiced their Champ can deal enough damage to get the First Blood (or kill in general). The *Grievous Wounds* is also a nice touch, because it means the enemy {{champion:16}}/{{champion:37}}  can't heal that damage as efficiently, and their {{summoner:7}} also won't work as efficiently.\n{{champion:25}} is an excellent Champ to have this Spell on. Combined with her well-aimed Q and properly-placed W, you can deal enough damage for the ADC or Gank to pick up the scraps.\nI'm not sure how {{champion:18}} was reworked, other than her Abilities changing their cooldowns and her E getting 1 less hit counter. I personally feel our good ol' Demoyordle got buffed more than nerfed.\nGoing back to {{champion:25}}, I'd say that {{summoner:3}} is actually worse to have than {{summoner:14}}—in many situations at least. Yeah, the slow and lowered defenses/offenses from Exhaust guarantee someone's going to lose a few limbs, and if they're too far from their turret it's pretty much a guaranteed kill vs anyone without a Dash...but that bit of damage with Ignite, plus the lowered healing, **plus** the fact taking \"bleed\" damage prevents you from recalling until it stops means that if your team has the balls to Gank and teamfight, they will. Most likely, they'll get the kill too because Ignite's just that good.\nI suppose, though, that it's really the difference between {{summoner:7}}/{{summoner:4}}, {{summoner:7}}/{{summoner:12}}, or {{summoner:7}}/{{summoner:14}}. If you're going to be taking some chances, take Ignite. If not, and you're playing more defensively, you won't be able to take advantage of Ignite well enough to warrant having it over Flash or Tele. And what with {{item:1329}} becoming a post-20-minute buff for everyone instead of being a Boot Enchantment, you're liable to pick Tele a lot.","replies":[]}]}
