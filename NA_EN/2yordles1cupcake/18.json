So stacking offense instead of grabbing defense on a 3rd or 4th item makes sense.\n\nOften the offensive champion is ranged. Thus, they can stay safely away while their defensively building champions tank for them. This not only applies exceptionally well to Baron (much more efficient for a pure glass cannon and a pure tank to take him down than it is for 2 hybrids to take him) but also towers and teamfights. In most tower sieges your adc is only getting a couple shots at the tower each wave because the enemy has 5 champions there with waveclear. You want your ADC powering out 1/4 of the towers health each time rather than 1/10 when no one else can even reach the tower. \n\nCrowd control provides better 'defense' than defensive items do. Taking no damage is always better than taking reduced damage.\n\nDefensive seals and glyphs are popular because there are no offensive counterparts. Make reasonably tough AD glyphs or AS glyphs and I guarantee you ADCs will start taking them. And APCs do indeed take AP, AP/lvl, CDR, or CDR/lvl glyphs fairly regularly. Some also take MP5 seals. It's just really tough to drop defenses that are really strong early game when you can't gain a similar amount of offense.","replies":[{"poster":"Need Gold 4 Tent","date":"2015-10-05T22:20:14.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea, yellows are made for defense, there are no offense runes that are effective on them. if one goes full hyper offense, there will be wasted gold on the yellows (you'd be getting less gold's worth of AD compared to another defensive stat).

I personally think it might be worth removing runes entirely from the game and buffing all champions directly in compensation if needed, though that's very probably not the only solution out there.\n\nAs for marksmen or mages building full damage plus one defensive item, I don't think that's especially a problem, since it preserves their weakness to incoming attacks and focus (a successfully tanky ADC would likely be a nightmare to deal with). As for build diversity, I agree with you that marksman itemization is really abysmal in terms of interesting and varied choices, though hopefully that will change soon with the marksman pass. Mage itemization is a lot more diverse, imo, though there's probably even more that can be done to improve it (Rito's been trying to split {{item:3001}} into two separate items, for example, one for AP bruisers and the other for mages seeking a MR option).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meeks011","date":"2015-10-06T21:35:24.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Remove runes entirely and buff every champion's stats based on what they lost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rito Staff","date":"2015-10-05T22:26:34.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel that there's diversity now with defensive items but not with damage ones. \n\nWarmog -> good on aram specially c:\nBanshee -> Good for Zed, Yas, ADC's.
