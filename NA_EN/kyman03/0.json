They barely enforce Boards rules anymore. That said, your permanent ban is... well, permanent. Riot only lifts permabans when they were given in error, and you yourself admit that it was a correct punishment. Permabans happen because those players are extremely unlikely to reform. The time to reform was before your permaban, not after.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Waaaarrrrgggghhh","date":"2020-02-06T22:39:17.480+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I get suspicious when I see someone act all friendly like you.
