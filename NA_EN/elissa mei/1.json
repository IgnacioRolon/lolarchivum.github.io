I had a nid with silence and im like i got this fight that gnar was placed to close to my nidalee he wont transform and win them the game he transforms through silence and wins the game. Rework the item to be useful or remove it please.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2019-07-04T13:34:13.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know anything about tft, but Gnar transforming in the actual game is a passive, which silence doesn't stop, so that is probably why that happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Elissa Mei","date":"2019-07-05T00:56:33.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but it happens with a LOT of special abilities in tft to the point the silence knife is pointless.","replies":[]}]}]}
