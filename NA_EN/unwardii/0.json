A failed attempt at positive reinforcement.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":12,"down_votes":12,"body":"I have long said that Riot&#039;s system of player punishments is draconic as fuck and does just as much to punish people who already have a bad thing happen to them beyond their control (such as having the power shut off and getting a low priority ban or even 2 week ban for leaving the game) as it has any meaningful impact on player toxicity, which is such a nebulous fucking term as to be almost meaningless.   \r\n\r\nThe problem isn&#039;t punishments, the problem is, there is literally no reward for being nice.  You don&#039;t win more, that&#039;s a fucking lie and you know it.  It&#039;s a cart before the horse argument.  Of course teams that don&#039;t flame win more, when you&#039;re winning, you don&#039;t typically feel the desire to flame, because everything is going nicely and after the game you&#039;re generally in a good mood and you don&#039;t feel the need to report any minor incidents of name calling in chat, it was all in good fun.  It&#039;s only when you lose that the blame game starts and the reports get hurled back and forth indiscriminately.\r\n\r\nSo why should I wish to be nice to someone in this game?  I don&#039;t want to make friends with these fucking mouth breathers, if I wanted to make friends, I&#039;d join a softball team or take up international round dancing or some fucking thing.  Here, I play to win...  However, _I do like getting free stuff_.\r\n\r\nNow, back when the Honor system was first rolled out, I could see how banners were about as much reward as they could reasonably offer and you know what?  I fucking loved my team work banner.  I treasured that thing, but then I called someone a fucking garbage jungler in a game, got reported and OH SHIT, that&#039;s the end of that.  Does me calling someone a fucking terrible jungler make me any less of a team player?  I don&#039;t think so, but never mind, soon after it became an unheard of thing to ever see a banner and I think everyone now just thinks it&#039;s a hack when they see one.\r\n\r\nHowever, now we have this hextech crafting nonsense, which to my mind provides the perfect method to offer some kind of reward for Honors and here is the TL:DR\r\n\r\n\r\nRiot should change the Honors system to provide players who collect a certain number of honors with small little hextech crafting items.  They don&#039;t have to be big, just a fragment, some dust, whatever the fuck, I don&#039;t care.  You get your egg heads and your economists together and work out something that isn&#039;t going to break the bank.  Obviously Honors would have to be from unique accounts and the rewards would have to be small enough so as not to encourage exploits through dummy accounts.  Maybe it make it so that only lvl 30 accounts can even give honors.  I don&#039;t know, you work it out, my point is, this is a form of positive reinforcement for good behavior rather than the relentless threat of living under Ritonian rule where you can have your account suspended indefinitely at any time with no recourse, which, take it from me, is only a problem if you spend any money.  You&#039;ve already lost me on that score, never again, but, you can reward other players who are NOT me and I think it&#039;s about fucking time that you do so because after last season, you&#039;re lucky anyone still plays this fucking game.  You owe them.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-12-15T00:51:26.823+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"Trust me, we agree that the honor system needs a rework.","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2016-12-15T01:13:56.461+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ucXIJmx4,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-15T00:51:26.823+0000)\n>\n> Trust me, we agree that the honor system needs a rework.\n\n2019TheDream?","replies":[{"poster":"Myrmiron","date":"2016-12-15T01:18:43.636+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"They'll rework it right after the tribunal is back. :^)","replies":[{"poster":"PrimeWraith","date":"2016-12-15T01:47:23.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is the tribunal coming back?","replies":[{"poster":"Myrmiron","date":"2016-12-15T01:50:51.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, it'll be back soon™. :^)","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2016-12-15T02:46:44.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Myrmiron,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ucXIJmx4,comment-id=00000001000000000000,timestamp=2016-12-15T01:50:51.908+0000)\n>\n> Yes, it&#x27;ll be back soon™. :^)\n\nAfter two more Ryze reworks, the World Finals returns to North America and Yorick gets first ever new skin.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2016-12-15T11:53:21.643+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"All I need is to know that people enjoyed playing with me,  that's my ultimate goal, have an spread fun","replies":[]},{"poster":"UnwardiI","date":"2016-12-15T01:01:02.109+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ucXIJmx4,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-15T00:51:26.823+0000)\n>\n> Trust me, we agree that the honor system needs a rework.\n\nWell good, I suppose I'll believe it when I see it but that it is a thing being talked about is, I suppose, a promising thing.  \n\nPrimarily though, my issue isn't with the Honor system per-say, it's with the complete and total lack of any positive reinforcement towards so called good behavior, I just think the Honor system, with some tweaks, provides a decent means by which this could be delivered.

I make myself a liar and a bitch and a cuck.\n\nBut here's the thing: It doesn't make you either of these things. You can absolutely be an honest without being an asshole, and being polite to others doesn't make you a bitch and a cuck. In fact, if you can remain calm despite other peoples' aggressive behaviour and/or incompetence it can serve as a **much** better display of power by proving you are in control of the situation.\nIf **you** can't pull off being nice to others without lying or being a quote-on-quote \"bitch\", then that is 100% your problem. It's also a problem **for you**. Because, even though you say\n\n>I would put it to you that the reason you do not go around trying to make friends by farting in people's faces is that you know this is an ineffective strategy at accomplishing your aim\n\nthe simple truth is: Telling people to stop being awful is pretty much exactly as effective as befriending people by farting in their faces.\nNobody in the history of League of Legends has ever gone and said \"Oh, okay then. See, I absolutely know how to play like a god, I just didn't realize that playing good was the goal of the game.\"\n\n> The fact is, I will not be tone policed by anyone.  Not Riot, not you, not anyone.  It is the hill I will die on.  I reserve the right to be a massive insensitive %%%% whenever and to whoever I choose.  However, if Riot will insist on making tone policing a matter of policy, then I will simply not give them money.\n\nThat's absolutely okay. But your methods are ineffective, and the logic with which you try to justify them is extremely flawed.\nIf you like being an asshole, say it. But don't mask it with supposedly trying to win, or with just being honest. Because you can do both of these entirely without all that bullshit; and one of them even way more effectively.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UnwardiI","date":"2016-12-17T00:15:40.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TrulyBland,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ucXIJmx4,comment-id=0001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-12-16T23:32:35.282+0000)\n>\n> And this is why, again, you suck at communication.

Did I not say I keep extra accounts available in case I get banned?  Does that sound like the actions of someone not taking responsibility?\n\nThe fact is, I will not be tone policed by anyone.  Not Riot, not you, not anyone.  It is the hill I will die on.  I reserve the right to be a massive insensitive %%%% whenever and to whoever I choose.  However, if Riot will insist on making tone policing a matter of policy, then I will simply not give them money.\n\nI would put it to you that the reason you do not go around trying to make friends by farting in people's faces is that you know this is an ineffective strategy at accomplishing your aim, but as I stated before, I'm not here to make friends.  I'm here to win and if that involves telling my jungler to stop being fucking awful, then that's fine.  If I say nothing and they continue to be awful, I've lost anyway.  If I'm saccharinly sweet about it and we lose, then I have sacrificed my principles and still not won the game.  I  make myself a liar and a bitch and a cuck.  I am not a liar, nor a bitch, nor a cuck and I will not bitch myself out for a win, even for the chance of a win.  \n\nMy wins will be earned and just and I don't care who's precious feelings I hurt along the way.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Morality Coach","date":"2016-12-15T07:34:28.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do win more games by being positive though.
