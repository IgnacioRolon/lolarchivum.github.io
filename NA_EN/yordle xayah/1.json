As I was playing, I noticed she was behaving in a strange way with her gun.\n\nThis strange interaction occurs when she stops walking, and the gun takes a very strange position, as if she was holding it infront of her, but it doesn&#039;t look natural, and I'm pretty sure it's a bug.\nI don&#039;t think that&#039;s intentnional, but it&#039;s better illustrated on the video that I captured.\n\nThe bug happened also in **Summoner&#039;s Rift**, **The Crystal Scar** and the **Twisted Treeline**, as I tried Trist in those maps soon after to make sure it wasn&#039;t just a thing of the new **ARAM** map. Upon further testing, I tried out a couple more skins, and the bug seems to be **only** for the **Riot Girl Tristana** skin.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-24T17:44:45.215+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey FNC Saki,\n\nThanks for the report!
