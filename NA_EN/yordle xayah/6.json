They exacerbated snowball in a hard to perceive, but insanely powerful, way.\n\nCosting more gold meant that it severely punished the team which was behind, further delaying their items to try and compete in the vision war. It also led to an arms race where the team which was behind, and struggling, would have to contest vision; which led to them losing more fights, and getting farther behind.\n\nIf you think that current league is too snowbally, take off the rose-colored glasses and remember what stealth pinks were ACTUALLY like.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Salron","date":"2018-11-08T06:10:43.916+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah removing buyable green wards was the worst change riot has ever made imo","replies":[]},{"poster":"SilentBomber","date":"2018-11-11T19:17:28.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss the old seasons where the game was trully fun in competetive games and people were doing less shit that today!","replies":[]}]}
