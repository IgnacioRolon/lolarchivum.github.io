Most the champions I thought were overpowered I since learned to deal with. Evelynn? Learned to vision and safety. Darius? Learned to safety and duel positioning. Yi? Learned what exhaust, Warden's Mail, Grevious Wounds and Kiting do. \n\nI started in S2 preseason. There isn't a champion yet that I think is OP I did back then. Some are OP, due to number issues or overloaded kits, but usually Riot fixes those or dumpsters them until a rework.\n\nBut if I absolutely had to pick something. Nidalee, simply because regardless of meta or design she has always been a good pick, because her bloated kit is simply... too hard to balance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2016-09-26T04:31:43.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When noob {{champion:67}} \nYears later {{champion:67}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mimy","date":"2016-09-26T04:27:02.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:21}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2016-09-26T04:23:53.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Graves (season 3).
