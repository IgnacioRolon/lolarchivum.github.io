This might be happening due to some compatibility issue.  Try going to your patcher properties and run it in Windows 7 compatibility.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Waitapy","date":"2017-01-26T08:13:07.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It didnt helped meh ... I will try to update drivers .

You may have a bad install or update that's no longer able to launch the game, and the lack of a Launch button further affirms that suspicion.  If you haven't downloaded the updated client, you should be able to use our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to perform a clean re-install of the game.  Otherwise, a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) should fix it up.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
