{"poster":"Ozu","date":"2019-02-16T11:42:59.028+0000","title":"Banned For Taking Ghost/Cleanse Strategically","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":32,"down_votes":5,"body":"https://prnt.sc/mlu0vv\n\nhttps://imgur.com/XXmBoHU\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/u07ielncrvg21.png\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/60o27Hf\n\nSo apparently I griefed for taking cleanse/ghost as a strategic choice when the opponent against a  veigar that I can't move past without as a rengar queued for top lane. \n\n\nhttps://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2975755896/231250034\n\nSome backstory: I'm the top laner that went rengar. The jungler went soraka without smite and copied my summoners to try to force a dodge (autofilled player that doesn't play jungle whatsoever the typical NA ranked game with positional ranking). Proceeds to pick soraka with ghost and cleanse because he's actually griefing  Afterwards the 3 other players decide to go afk immediately from minute 0. I type nothing and play out the game by going to my assigned top lane and lose my main role's lp regardless from the troll. So if taking ghost + cleanse = suspension while typing NOTHING in game and NOT feeding, why are the summoners allowed to be taken together? I guess riot's perfectly okay if you actually grief if you take any other summoners. But god forbid you end the game with 0 deaths with ghost and cleanse. Oh, and even better was that there were 3 afk people on my team because of the jungler deliberately not taking smite. Was I going to somehow win the game with conventional summoners in a diamond ranked game with a jungler that picked soraka and ran down bot?\n\nTyler1 has done off-meta at  various random points i.e. picking adc kayle with no flash or this amazing beauty of predator ghost heimerdinger in challenger which I don't see him being banned for : https://i.imgur.com/eTu4awg.png\n\nIt appalls me that a Rioter didn't even have the decency to even look at the match replay when they respond to tickets on suspensions these days. The adc and mid laner are level 1 and level 2 in game when our nexus exploded. I actually played the game out, took their top lane turret, and proceed to get a 2 week ban for griefing while having 0 deaths with the highest gold and levels on my team. I bought a doran's shield, went top lane immediately, and laned. Normally.\n\nTLDR: \n\ntook ghost + cleanse top lane as a strategic choice vs veigar as a melee assassin that is hardcountered by his E, type nothing. End game with 0 deaths and most farm + gold while laning top lane. Get banned b/c game is lost. \n\nHere's my extensive chat in game aka none whatsoever:\nhttps://prnt.sc/mlu0vv\n\nPrelobby I typed 'gogogo' at the last seconds, expecting the soraka to dodge since he was trying to get everyone in the lobby to play chicken for it.\n\n Riot Legendary's response: 'You didn't feed but you took ghost and cleanse so we're banning you.'\n\nFunny thing is I've played shit like cleanse/ghost zilean in the past and not been banned probably since we won. But moment I lose with it i'm banned while trying to play legitimately. \n\nSo what happened to this video Riot?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb53aa_nFTo","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-02-16T22:03:36.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Op had his post reaponded by a Rioter, so copying Keyru's repsonse here.\n___\n> [{quoted}](name=Keyru,realm=NA,application-id=yrc23zHg,discussion-id=c7EL1bBz,comment-id=0056,timestamp=2019-02-16T21:43:29.103+0000)\n>\n> There are no chat logs here because this was a griefing suspension, not a chat suspension.

You're the only person of the 5 that shouldn't be, and probably were only 1 of 2 that did. I doubt the 3 AFKs were even punished beyond a leaverbuster warning. \n\nRiot's team for bans is pathetic really. Seeing the automated responses to tickets, etc... it's sickening. I've never received any punishments or warnings, but if even 1% of the shit I read on these forums is true, then Riot's really not handling things correctly.\n\nNot to mention the actual shit I see in my games. Like a mid-jungle duo constantly over-extending without vision and getting caught and dying, then spam-pinging that I have teleport up. Yup, like I'm going to TP into the middle of a 2v4 fight when we're already down 7 kills.

Did he say anything else later in that exchange? Banning somebody for \"wrong\" summoner spells is fucking insane.\n\nI suspect, though, that the main reason you got flagged is that you were willfully ignoring the action in the game. I don't think your participation would have been particularly helpful since you were alone, but it could be interpreted that you were unilaterally giving up the game by not preventing the enemy team from taking your base. You and Soraka clearly were just shoving side lanes while the enemy took your mid, and I guess Riot expected you to contest that push.\n\nUltimately, this is a unique situation that Riot clearly owes an actual review of, not just a shrug-off like what you've received.
