I restarted my computer, uninstalled  and reinstalled and now it looks like the old logo. Now it's doing the same thing again. I'm really upset because I love LOL so much but it doesn't load for me, do you know why I can do to fix it at all?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-14T21:32:01.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ehhhhhhh that's not supposed to happen xD! It almost sounds like your patcher is hitting a file that it just can't seem to process for whatever reason. I want to make sure that you get a clean install of the game without any errors, so let's go ahead and use our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) to run a reinstall as well as clean uninstall. That should be able to get that update working correctly.","replies":[{"poster":"BroKolson","date":"2017-05-14T22:50:53.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you it's now working properly!","replies":[]}]}]}
