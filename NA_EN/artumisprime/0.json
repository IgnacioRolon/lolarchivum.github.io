We want to make Edge of Night a more attractive option **and add a fourth choice to the lineup**:\r\n\r\n* Duskblade is mostly the same.\r\n* Ghostblade is also mostly the same.\r\n* Edge of Night's spellshield now works like Banshee's Veil, which is a more straightforward effect that avoids the learning curve of an active item while also allowing for clearer counterplay opportunities for opponents.\r\n* Sanguine Blade is a new Lethality item that enables split pushing. Its unique passive grants a huge attack speed buff when no allies are nearby.\r\n* **Weâ€™re also exploring a few other potential lethality item options that you may see on PBE.**\r\n\r\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/preseason-2020-gameplay-rise-elements\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, {{item:3001}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3194}} and no mention of better/more MR options for tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2019-10-17T04:24:42.611+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Having another option would be nice but to say that the MR items are bad is really dumb.  A tank rushing a spirit visage against a mage basically invalidates the mage's existence.  If a tank is in a game that warrants building all 3, they can get those with a warmog's and become unkillable.  I think Riot is hesitant to add another MR/health option for that very reason.  A tank can already become practically immortal against mages while still having an open slot.","replies":[{"poster":"ArtumisPrime","date":"2019-10-17T05:33:11.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"First of all, I never said they were bad. They aren't great, but spellpen kind of makes them useless mid-late game. They are definitely okay in the early game, but not good by any means.\n\nAgainst one mage, sure. Against 3 of them?, 4?, it takes a very specific subsection of champions to become immortal. Maokai, Mundo, the like.\n\nI also completely disagree that it takes a Spirit Visage alone to invalidate a mage. If you are laning against someone who will buy a big MR item early on, you get Sorc Shoes, Morello, and sometimes an early Void Staff. But with the first two alone, you negate almost the entirety of Spirit Visage's MR. Yes yes. It's 4100g vs 2800, you can add Merc Treds in there, etc. etc. Frankly, if your damage profile is so heavily invested into one type of damage you deserve to lose, which is not even the case any more with all the penetration in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2019-10-17T12:05:59.159+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, 3-4 mage teams that lack in AD is the best thing you can see as a tank player, and I'm speaking from experience here. They're exceedingly rare because they kinda suck against tanks. Stacking up Mercs, Adaptive, Spirit Visage and Warmogs lets you just ignore mages completely. You can round that out with Mask, Locket (which is pretty underrated in an AP heavy situation), Gargoyle's or situationally a QSS. Alternatively you can just stack on another HP item because most mages are really bad at dealing with large HP pools and moderate MR anyway.\n\nAlso, Sorcs/Morello's gives 33 Mpen, Visage gives 55 MR. You're up 22 MR and 1300 gold in this scenario. Yes, they have extra AP from Morello's as a combat stat but you have extra HP and CDR from Visage. In every way this is a huge advantage to the tank player.\n\nAs a tank player what I dread isn't AP comps due to lack of itemisation. The variety is low but the items power level is more than enough to deal with AP comps easily. The main issue is full or heavy AD comps. Armour itemisation is just woefully inadequate to deal with the damage that ADs can bring in League's current state.","replies":[{"poster":"ArtumisPrime","date":"2019-10-17T14:41:55.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The notion that MR invalidates mages is only true against burst mages. Cass, Ryze, Vlad, Brand, Fid, etc. are still going to be able to do damage to you. Get 2-3 of those champions on you and you will still die in less than 10s. Admittedly, 10s is a huge amount of time to live in the current state of the game, but that's the entire problem IMO.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"boricCentaur1","date":"2019-10-17T14:29:33.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean it would be nice actually it would be great to have more mr items since they are actually pretty bad.\n\nI was playing poppy vs cho and there was also a cass. It felt awful since all the mr items don't help ad champions amd they all suck as a first time.\n\nLook at sunfire it give damage to help with trading but also hp and some armor but it's not a tanky as other items that is what tanks want for a first item since they need damage more not to be tanky.\n\nEven for ap tanks they're not good. {{item:3001}} this is the only one that can be built every game on every tank. The rest can't {{item:3065}} o your champion has no healing so the passive doesn't do anything, {{item:3194}} none of the enemies can proc it welp it doesn't do anything then.\n\nThey all give the same fucking stat line too low mr for high hp.","replies":[{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2019-10-17T14:52:25.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adaptive help kills Cass damage and work nice against Chogath's E which is his only source of %hp damage.
