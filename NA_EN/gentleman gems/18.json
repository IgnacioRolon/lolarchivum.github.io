A log cabin built for four. It doesn’t have electricity, but at least there’s running water. There’s a kitchen, and a well-stocked pantry to go with it. Around the cabin is a small clearing, and beyond that, forest. Yellow squirrels and enormous deer — the animals here are nothing I know of. We seem to be part way up a mountain, but the summer air is still pleasantly warm.\n\nI hadn’t had much of a chance to explore before the first new arrival turned up. She called herself Anivia {{champion:34}} , and seems to be a massive, telepathic bird made out of ice. I knew the others on this vacation (?) might be weird, but I wasn’t expecting anything like that. Anivia seems pleasant enough. She says she’s some sort of guardian of winter, that she wishes me no ill, quote “mortal”, and that she looks forward to meeting the “other”. All the same, I’m kind of glad she doesn’t fit inside the cabin.\n\nThe remaining two of our group of four showed up I think late afternoon (No electricity + What’s clockwork? = No clocks). I had not anticipated there being only one other human. Actually, I don’t think I realized there were intelligent nonhumans. I think I’ll keep to myself, though. Of the last two, one’s a boar, and one’s a boor. Apparently Anivia and this Sejuani {{champion:113}}  gal know each other and hate each other. I didn’t hear all of their row, but there was something like “Sirilda would do what is necessary!” and “All I do is necessary!” and much back and forth along that theme. Is Sirilda the boar? Er, is the boar intelligent?\n\nI made myself dinner. It’s so much easier to be on a good schedule out here, away from it all. Anivia will be roosting on top of the cabin, apparently, and Sejuani said the boar will be going out in the woods. She chose the bed farthest from the fireplace, which is fine by me. I’ve decided to record a journal of this adventure. How did I end up here anyhow?\n\n_To be continued_","replies":[]},{"poster":"2ManyJons","date":"2016-02-22T03:21:11.366+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:89}}  Wakes up at the crack of dawn to make breakfast and do other mom-like things.\n\n{{champion:29}}  Only wants the egg shells for breakfast.
