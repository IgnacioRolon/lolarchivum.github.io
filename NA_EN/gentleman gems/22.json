I always wanted someone to do what I am doing now when I was a young LoLer. Coaching was never readily available and it was quite difficult to attain it consistently without having to pay someone. I am setting up a hierarchy of officers some of which include these coaches. A calendar will eventually (next week I think) be set up so that people may request coaching sessions. There shall also be competitions between squadrons (we shall have up to 3 club rooms filled up, each being a squadron) and winning can get one rewards in rp, skins, or cookies! There is a lot more involved, of course. The complexity of managing this type of army is something that I single-handedly could never do, which is why I do have officers who assist in different aspects of it (Hades, for example, is the PR/Recruitment Officer).\n\nI extended the offer to LF to help with managing the army but that would involve him reforming and subsiding some of his ego and rude tendencies. And instead of joining, he insults me then my followers. So as much as it pains me to oppose he who gave me my king, I cannot support he who hurts my people. ;_;","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JayHog1992","date":"2016-07-12T20:02:24.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, there's a war going on?
