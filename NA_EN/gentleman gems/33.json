I swear, that I will protect Xayah at all costs, but of course, not at the cost of my life, for I am one with the Draven. And you know the saying, \"Blood before bloodrush\". I live by this code. It is my life. Xayah falls for me. We are in love. Rakan gets brutally assassinated by Zed, but do I care? Not at all, for he is not one with Draven.
