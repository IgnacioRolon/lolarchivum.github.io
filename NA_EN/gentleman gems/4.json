Meaning it was never a great pick, but people picked him because they psyched themselves into thinking it was more important that he actually was. After the group stage how many people chose Darius and won? Hint: it was only Origin against Flash Wolves. Aside from one game where KT won (but lost the series with a Darius pick as well), none of the other teams found success with Darius outside of group stage. \n\nSkill range is shorter than Autoattack range. While Teemo has 500 auto range and Darius has 550 on his E, they end up being almost exactly equal. \n\nIn the old Darius v Teemo matchup, Darius relied on his E's interaction with champions who were inside the cast range before the animation but ran out before the animation ended. Now, a good Teemo can easily stay out of the E range as long as you dont stand still autoattacking. If youre playing teemo like you should be playing teemo - running away as soon as your attack animation goes off - you shouldnt be caught by the E. And if Darius misses an E, its a 24 second cooldown thats exploitable. But if he does land an E, its almost an instant kill. \n\nAlthough its a skill matchup, it depends on the Teemo making a mistake.","replies":[{"poster":"Elkhantar","date":"2016-01-26T11:49:26.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are actually contradicting yourself. You say that if Darius lands an E is an instant kill. I agree, after 6 its certain death.\n\nYou admit Teemo's AA range is lower than Darius' E, which it is.\n\nThen you say it's a skill matchup, and here I agree a little bit, if the Darius is bad you can bully him with Teemo, you can say that on any matchup, but on equal skill terms, it doesn't depend on Teemo making a mistake. It is actually the Darius who has to make a mistake, because Teemo's survival is absolutely depending on Darius missing his E.\n\nAnd if you go in for an attack, no matter whether you run back quick as hell or not, you are in range for an E. A bit of timing, and you are toast. And if you are not attacking... what are you going to do? stare intensely at Darius? Farm from afar and let him farm as well, and be more relevant late game? (At least, Darius doesn't have good tools to prevent you from farming).\n\nDon't take me wrong, I love the little squirrel, and I've bullied some Darius with him some time ago. Heck, I got destroyed by a fed Teemo recently. But he's not in a good spot at the moment.\n\nDarius builds naturally tanky with a couple of damage/health items. He can withstand some poke. So whereas he can miss a couple of E's and stay in lane (fall slightly back inbetween cooldowns and harass with Q's if the Teemo gets too cocky), he just has to land one and Teemo is toast.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2016-01-26T15:08:22.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You missed one key important part - Skill range is shorter than Autoattack Range. Skill range is calculated from the center of the model (this prevents things like giving FIddle a larger ult because he bought a Elixer of Iron or got Lulu ult). Autoattack range is calculated edge-to-edge. The difference is noted to be about 50-100 units for most champions. Teemo is about 100 units wide - his skill range loses about 50 range due to the calculation. Darius, who has a much larger champion model, loses more. \n\nTeemo has 500 autoattack range. Darius has 550 skill range. Darius' E range is slightly LOWER than teemos autoattack range. Plus, now that they removed the bug from Darius's E, it has a .25 second windup time without the pesky bug where you could leave the cast range and still be pulled. \n\nSo a Teemo in this situation has a tiny bit of range where he can autoattack and not get pulled, and still be able to escape with the .25 second windup time. I wouldnt say its a \"reactive\" amount of time, meaning i dont think anyone can see it coming then dodge it. But you can however, predict it and play accordingly. \n\nThats why I say its a skill matchup. It requires the Teemo to misplay. Not severely misplay, but misplay. \n\nAlthough Darius gets naturally tanky, part of the reason that Teemo is (was) a top laner is because his zoning starting at level 1. You need to prevent the Darius from getting farm so his tankiness doesnt scale faster than your harass. Hybrid pen reds and the hybrid pen mastery helps, along with the +AD/AP mastery and starting corrupting potion. \n\nThis tactic works until 6, where you need some knowledge of playing Teemo vs Darius to continue your dominance. Strategic use of mushrooms, blinding the W-auto combo (so he cant stack up his passive) instead of wasting the Q on harass, and not immediately running away after a flash-pull to not take the full hit of his Q.","replies":[{"poster":"Elkhantar","date":"2016-01-27T10:30:25.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't really aware of the windup time and the fixes on Darius' E. Knowing that, you might be right, sir.

Admitidly, I am not even level 30, so I might not be the best indicator of what is strong, but with my experience with him, what I have seen from others, and his ban rate at my level, he is pretty damn strong. Maybe somebody could enlighten me to the otherwise, but he has a great gap closer, an AA reset that does a a ton of damage. His ult gives him a ton of tankyness, as well as passively increasing his damage. Then he has a stun that, for two seconds, stops all AA from damaging him. Plus, his passive gives him a massive amount of attack speed, and if you slap a Guinsoos Rageblade on him, he will be hitting 2 AA per second in almost no time at all. That Guinsoos is especially powerful because he scales off of ad and ap, and all in all, Jax is just plain strong.","replies":[{"poster":"WutsKraken","date":"2016-01-21T19:43:06.249+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I'll follow up on this with a very very VERY different perspective\n\nI think {{champion:24}} himself is fine, it's THIS freakin mega-buffed item {{item:3124}} that is keeping him strong\n\nFor one thing, Rageblade needed a change, it was just too weak.
