But it was removed and suggested to be moved to Concept &amp; Creations. I would like to know why it was removed? Are you using a bot that quickly checks the post and decides if it fits based on the contents. If so I would like to ask if you could just quickly fix that when you have the time. I really just want clarification of why it was removed and how I can fix it so it won&#039;t be removed.","replies":[{"poster":"Mod Curator","date":"2016-09-27T22:51:53.544+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was deemed a fan art post and as such was redirected to the appropriate section.
