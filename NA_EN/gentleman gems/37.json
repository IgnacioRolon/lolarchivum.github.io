If anyone were to ever try to tell me that another MOBA was better, he or she never wins. Because it is all opinion. \n\nIn all serious though, all we as a community ever do is complain. We never seem to really focus on what we truly love about this game.\n\nI love the game itself. So good. Got me hooked since the day I started playing it 2 years ago.\n\nI love ranked because it quenches the competitive side of me and gives me a chance to move up everyday. \n\nI love the esports scene of it because it gives me something to discuss and ideas to work off of. I can learn and man is it just awesome to watch. I went to the NA Finals and I never was so happy in my life to be around people who shared the same passion.\n\nI actually love the community. Sure, we do get those people who are terrible people and rage at us. Great, we can mute them. Do not let those few people who are mean shadow the great individuals who motivate and befriend us. Without this game, I would never have met my best friend. He helped me through my toughest time and pushes me to pursue my dreams. And we became such good friends because we both shared a similar playstyle, while at the same time making up for each other's weaknesses, such as his over aggression with my extremely cautious laning, him being a top and jungle main whereas I am a mid, adc and support main.\n\nI love the content (documentaries, short animations, other shows) that they develop.\n\nI know this suddenly got all serious, but you can find me preaching this game everywhere. I used to complain about it too, especially about things that cannot change, and forget to even think about how much I love this game. About how it is literally my life. It is all I ever want to play because I feel like I belong in this community. Sure the game has its faults, and we do need to address them, yet the general state of the faulty situation is usually reasonable or cannot be changed. I hope no one takes this the wrong way. I just took my time and found just a few things I love about this game. \n\nWhat are your favorite aspects of Lol?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-10-07T01:31:36.913+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"I had a game not too long ago with a Zac jungler that wanted to do Baron every possible instance... we were in a decent spot before he kept trying to force it, then he blamed us for not being able to clear any wards or place new wards around it before he started it. \n\nAfter the fourth attempt or so, our support pointed out that the enemy no longer needed wards at Baron to know that's where we'd be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolfenstin","date":"2015-10-07T07:26:16.443+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Junglers that obsess over Baron, even if it's a really bad idea grind my gears.

If I go and they all die, they'll also yell at me. #lanerlogic\n\n\nI played a game the other day where we killed just the other teams jungler, and the rest of their team was up. The minions were pushed up to our base, we had an open mid inhib,  and the enemy team was rolling us in gold lead. For some unknown reason, just because we killed the jungler, my team kept pinging and rushing for Baron, and no matter how many times I told them \"That's an awful idea, please, just push out and defend. We're making a comeback, no need to throw it.\" It was basically useless arguing with them because they were doing it whether I was there or not. So I went and bam. We all die.
