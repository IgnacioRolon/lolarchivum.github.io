When Garen taught the recruits on special occasions Doltish would always volunteer for his visual demonstration, to the humor of his peers. He would take beatings that no one would even ask someone to take to try and find a recognizable trait. The only two traits he had been noticed for was his idiotic bravery and his ludicrous amount of untapped potential. This potential has shown many times like when he defeated a giant on what was supposed to be a scouting mission, only because he challenged it to a battle of &ldquo;Standing of your right foot the longest&rdquo; and the giant forgot it had lost it&#039;s right foot in a previous event and fell on a sharp stone that ran it through. He specialized in using the spear and shield in battle but instead of striking with the spear and blocking with the shield, he did the exact opposite. This was considered impossible and was a prank played on new recruits by the senior members. When they played the prank on Doltish, he beat them in front of everyone even after he was proven to fail on using it traditionally. He only graduated after the school said he learned all they could teach him (Considered an insult under the current conditions) and they sent him to the 12th regiment, a group of soldiers who were sent on suicide missions. The first mission he took with the group was to storm a secret Noxian fort in Freliord, during winter. While everyone else died Doltish was the only person to return, and was successful. He single handedly stormed the fort and sent the Noxians running like cowards back home. He was called the &ldquo;White Monster of Freliord&rdquo; because he happened to be covered with snow when he attacked the hidden fort. He had the eyes of Demacias greatest, like Garen and Lux, follow him after words while he completed his missions that led him to his path to glory.\n> \n> &ldquo;The difference between idiocy and bravery is knowing that you will come out of it alive&rdquo; Quoted from Doltish&#039;s speech at the Demacian museum of heroism.\n> \n> Physical Description: Tall Muscular, Blue eyes, Bald and brown haired, and wheres white and gold armor.\n> \n> Mental Description: Courages, Loyal, Slow\n\nBase Stats\nHP: 555 (+79)\nHP Regen: 5.02\nMP: 230 (+50)\nMana Regen: 5.94)\nAR: 310\nAD: 52 (+2.87)\nAS: .49 (+.31)\nArmor: 27 (+4.0)\nMR: 30\nMS: 250\n\n> Abilities\n> Passive: Bold Strides: Every two levels Doltish will gain a Bold Stride stack to add to one of his abilities to a total of 4.

I'l try to give my 2 cents as it does have a few cool ideas hidden in there.\n\nThe passive is really interesting. so he get's a maximum of 9 stacks right? So he can mega empower three skills? That sounds quite interesting to have some sort of upgrade every second level. It makes the progression curve must more unique, but the 10% scaling sounds rather obscene. So essentually this guy's kit will eventually gain a 90% scaling increase? Thats a huge amount. like, thats double the damage! I like the idea but im not sure the numbers are right. I'd just remove the numbers or make an approximation. For now it can stay.\n\nThe q sounds like a Captain America shield smash. Interesting idea but sounds very difficult to make feel good. either way, sort of a mix of {{champion:119}}'s axes and {{champion:150}}'s boomerang. The scaling is really powerful. Too powerful I'd say. The cc is also quite a lot for such a small cooldown ability.\n\nThe W also seems really powerfull. Thats 3 seconds of NOTHING from the adc. 3 seconds in an age of gaming where a character in LOL can be blown up in less than a second by someone like {{champion:7}}. Yeah the range is small, but the ability is worth flashing in for. The slow is just more insult to injury when your already useless adc has no chance of doing anything productive, now you just outright kill him. this is like a \"kill adc\" ability. Doesnt sound healthy for the game.\n\nThe E sounds also really powerfull. Grievous wounds shouldnt be a permenent passive. This is an ability that just instantly, without DOING anything counters someone like a {{champion:50}} or a {{champion:36}} just by you standing there. It literally decides the fight before the game even starts. And thats just the passive! The active deals 400(!!!!!!!!) damage plus scaling(which is also a bit of his armor becauseo f the passive) DAMAGE to an enemy. this thing ONESHOTS a level one {{champion:37}}. Just overall this is way too strong. No champion in the game can do that. Just not a good idea, but I like the armor into ad thing. Maybe not 50%. That seems a tad much, but it sounds solid, in theory. You gain damage, but you LOSE survivability. It seems like a good idea to play around with. \n\nThe R is a nuke, and a buff, and a steroid. The windup is huge, yes, but this will usually just murder someone in one hit AND give him 400 armor and magic resist. But the active isnt so bothersome to me. To be fair, it could even work in some cases. Its the passive that bugs me. The passive is just crazy good. This guy is basically immune to autatacks because of that, and thats bad. I think the game needs more blinds and more cc types, but this just doesnt seem fair. \n\nOverall the champion is just OP. He's a nuker mage bruiser that just instantly murders the adc AND the bruiser while surviving the make with 500 magic resistance. I dont think you should tweak numbers, but if you so desire then sure go ahead. I would just make it approximate amounts and then reassess the idea. Compare him to someone like a {{champion:133}} (because she has a blind) or a {{champion:80}} (who is similar, with spear and shield and he also blocks autoatacks AND nukes people) This guy just outclasses them and that shouldnt be the case. The passive is interesting, the e armor conversion is interesting and the captain america shield bash is interesting though.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-05-20T00:52:40.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a quick note here, practically everyone in the game can one shot a level one sona. she has less health than a melee minion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gentleman Gems","date":"2015-05-19T17:50:26.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your response.
