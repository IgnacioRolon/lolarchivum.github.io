Occasionally Teemo would grant them random abilities. I realize it would need to be modified for 10 different people at once and not just the same for a team. Although, that could be interesting in itself. Pick a mascot to replace the Nexus and they grant random powers during the match to your team. Could even go further and have them use abilities from a connection to them, Poro King grants Freijlord abilities. Devil Teemo grants yordle abilities. Not sure who the other mascots would be.","replies":[]}]}
