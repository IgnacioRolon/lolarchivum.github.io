Sanguine Blade is worse than BT in almost every way (especially now that BT has a shield). Dervish Blade is now much worse than Mercurial since Mercurial now gives even more stats (and actual AD). Van Damms is OKAY, but would be nice to probably also have IE in the game just in case and just make their passives unique from each other (like RFC and Shiv do). Duskblade would honestly also be a fairly nice item to see on the map since it is typically full of health stacking bruisers who would either like to use the item (J4 and such) or would be fairly weak to it since their armor values are fairly low and would help deal with their health stacking (since BoRK is in a bad spot and not many BoRK users are very strong since they are almost all ADCs and do not have good items to work with).\n\nAs stated ER is now MUCH better than it used to be and makes a lot of champions much stronger than they would be without it (and have been balanced around the item as well as seen with Lucian and crew).\n\nAlso, the MAIN reason (iirc) B.F. and items built from it (along with NLR) was because B.F. cost 1550+ when TT was reworked and was counter intuitive to save that much money on that map. B.F. has since then been reduced and price and nothing happened, but the second NLR went down in price it and all of its items were instantly put onto TT which seems fairly unfair.\n\nTL;DR TT itemization could use some help and adding B.F. could help a bit since right now it is you are a mage or bruiser/tank and there are no carries really to play since you are stuck with hardly any items to support any sort of crit build (Van Damms only one that gives AD iirc so you will have high crit but no AD so what is the point). This could lead to unnecessarily long games since you cannot seige well without many ranged options (let alone mainly mages) and sometimes causes my team when winning to just run around the map endlessly while we wait for Vile to respawn since diving is too risky for what it is worth (especially 2.5 AS Nexus Turret that takes double inhibs to take down without a clean ace).","replies":[{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2016-03-17T06:08:40.036+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sanguine vs BT is actually kind of complex.

Sanguine certainly loses to BT in late-game slot-efficiency, but that's not the niche it's meant to fill.\n\nAlso, if the enemy team is relying on magic-damage waveclear, Banner of Command is a strong option.

As for Lucian, he doesn't need buffs right now.\n\nShould the meta shift and ADCs fall out of favor, then giving them some new toys might be a good idea. Right now, ADCs are really common in Challenger 3v3 on EUW, at least.\n\nAs for other items, I looked at the list of items not on TT and I don't think there's any pressing need to add anything right now. Thornmail might be nice in order to deal with fed ADCs, though it might be too strong on a 3v3 map, I suppose.\n\nSo: ADCs are strong enough in this meta, introducing Essence Reaver might be an indirect buff to some ADCs, which might push the ADC meta even harder.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2016-03-16T23:04:10.323+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good to hear that mastery in ARAM isn't actually off the table.

I'm not even sure what I could be mad about. I was stating that, objectively, because of the nature of the gametype, that they couldn't base rewarding someone a chest on whether or not they did good with a character. ARAM is 90% luck. \n\n> From the start of this season players make threads that SR became 1sided bloodbath. Where most of games are steamrolled by 1 team. So please enlighten me, where's difference?\n\nPeople make threads about a lot of things. How Swain is OP, how Riven should have another skin, how they should bring back AP Yi. Bringing up the fact that people make threads about something doesn't help your case. However, while that claim does have some merit to it right now due to how the season changes have caused snowballing to be a glaring issue, this can be fixed or changed. The same cannot be said for ARAM. You can't really balance ARAM. The very nature of the game mode prevents this. \n\n> Secondly, saying ARAM is easy is pretty ignorant bullshit to say. You try to act tough, but you just bark like Chihuahua\n\nIgnorant? I mean, look at the gamemode. You have one lane, free XP and gold, and you don't even need to choose your own champion. Compared to SR or even Dominion, yeah, it really is easy. Who do you think populates the ARAM Queues? ARAM is a very casual mode and it's intended to be that way.  \n\nLook, the only one getting mad her is obviously you, for some reason. Why are you getting so defensive over this? \n\n> Yesterday I had 40 minute long ARAM game. Those are pretty rare, but they happen.

Basically, all I said was that Mastery makes ZERO sense in ARAM compared to its very little sense to begin with, and that if they decide to implement Hextech Crafting in ARAM, they cannot do so in the same way they do now, which is something you apparently agree with. There is no need to get so mad and to insult my intelligence, especially when I had to go through your post and correct more than a couple mistakes with your spelling. I could actually be mean if you want me to, it's not something I prefer to do, but I could certainly do so. But if you want to pull an Anita and ignore any opinion that isn't your own, then go ahead. I just don't understand why you managed to get so upset.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
