It really could help immobile mages to live to see another day. But in reality, you'll see this item on mages who already have mobility.

To be honest though, Leblanc and Ekko are already BS to catch up to, and this item won't really make it any different.\n\nAs for no mana/mana regen, one of the points of the upgrade is to completely kill mana regeneration as a stat completely for anyone except supports.

Lee SIn deals more damage than Pantheon. All of Lee SIn's damaging abilities scale of AD. Pantheon has 2 scaling off AP.  Lee Sin also has an execute on his Q, contributing even more damage due to % health missing on the target.\n2. Lee Sin has more CC than Pantheon. Pantheon has 1 single target stun that is also a gap closer.  Lee Sin has an AOE slow, and an AOE knockup / single target stun/knockback.  Yes his ultimate is not a standard displacer, it has a stun effect both before and after the kick which is why you cannot flash it, but you can flash Alistar's headbutt.\n\n> Relies on snowballing hard in early because they're fucking terrible in anything past that.\n\nFalse.  Lee Sin has stronger team utility. He is also a much stronger initiator than Pantheon. \nPantheon has stronger map presence than Lee SIn, but Lee Sin makes up for it by having much more mobility.\n\n\n> Which is why, he doesn't even have 50% winrate in Plat+.\n\nWinrate? Really? We're using winrate as a measure of champion success?\nI guess Pantheon is a significantly better champion than Lee SIn because his winrate is currently 51.99 while Lee Sin is 46.16\nRight?\n\nWait.\nPantheon has a pick rate of 3.19%\nLee SIn has a pickrate of  21.4%\nAverage jungler pickrate is 4.6%\n\n\nSo Lee Sin is 4 to 5 times more popular than Pantheon, than the jungle roster period.\nLee Sin is absolute trash...right...its why his pick rate is 4x higher than the rest of the jungle roster.\nHe is in the top 5 for most played champions.\n\nYou don't find the next Jungler til Gragas, who is #14.\n\n\nBut Lee Sin is trash, that's why they play him much more often than other Junglers.\nAt Plat +, where everyone plays for \"Fun\".

But you stopped making them. In a world of free speech everyone has the right to express their own opinion and in a world of free speech those who don't stop talking and continue to talk on and on about their views are the ones who get the most loyal following. Best example from real life Bernie Sanders (you may be against him, but still hear me out). The things he is talking about for his presidential campaign, he has been talking about them since the 80s and everyone that wants him to win are constantly talking about him around the world and the main reason why is because he didn't give up talking about his view points. Norway is huge example of why the suff he is talking about might work. Everyone has huge wages, huge taxes, and free healthcare and education.\n\nWhat about those who give up or, heck, didn't even try from the beginning. Those guys mostly spew stuff that the populas wants to hear and just by repeating it he over and over again without showing way his way of thinking is the one people should follow. An example being Donald Trump. He says America should build a wall on its border with Mexico and the main reason why he says it will be easy for a thousands of kilometers long wall would be easy to build is because he is a builder (E.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIA_-tf9_qk) Also here is a link of what experts say https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-on-the-us-mexico-border-building-a-wall-is-easy/2015/07/16/9a619668-2b0c-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html\n\nI am sorry I brought politics into this discussion but I wanted to bring up the fact that you gave up showing why you think this and that. I know this probably won't encourage you to start doing it again. But hey this is free speech, just because you say, doesn't mean people should read it.\n\nAlso sorry for calling you a troll.

With this winrate which Lee Sin do you honestly believe he will be nerfed. Yes he is played a lot, but as we can see this doesn't help at all.\n\nThis reminds that I heard Riot wanted to buff Vladimir, because he had a 44% winrate, but there was a bug in the update, which lead him having the same stats as before, but people started playing him and his winrate just went up. So the best way to get information is if more people play someone.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-04-08T19:01:13.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Hey you know how you can tell Riot they fucked up.\n>Not by telling them that they fucked up.\n>But by giving semi-accurate calculations how if this happens it would be bad for the mages. \n\nThey do not fucking understand the concept of thought-through feedback or even acknowledge its existence.\nIf you aren't a Rioter you are going to be immediatelly ignored and even, if for some reason you will get a Red response, it will be just some hypocritical nonsense.","replies":[{"poster":"Smug Yui","date":"2016-04-08T19:05:24.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair the reason I don't voice my opinion that often in this types of conversations is because I wish to wait and see what happens and then complain.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-04-08T19:18:46.096+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was once like that too.\n\nI changed, because in my 4 years of playing this game I have been wrong only once about giving opinions on balance/rework changes before they went live.\n\nThe only way Mage Update won't be an utter failure, would be massive buffs to all champions affected by changes to items involved.","replies":[{"poster":"Smug Yui","date":"2016-04-08T19:28:22.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well to be fair this numbers they gave is are probably not the final version.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/3VyYzbU","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SeargentAnus","date":"2016-04-07T17:24:39.519+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They better not gut {{champion:161}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"NullDragon","date":"2016-04-07T18:59:51.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tear got the mana regeneration removed, but added 25% mana refunded on spell use.

Like in urf, 80% CDR = 5 times as many spells cast. So yes, this is actually a straight up buff to Tear's mana regen, although mana regen was removed from most everything else.","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2016-04-08T10:16:00.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">  in that 50% mana refund = twice as much mana and mana regen\n\nI think I see what you are trying to do but..
