So do i have to completely stop using chat? Is it taking a risk?\n\nEdit 1 : I know i'm not banned if i'm positive. But from what i've seen, i'm terrified of even trying to use chat post 14 day ban, some words could be badly interpreted.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-12-30T22:15:38.756+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"In one of the threads you linked, one player told another to kill himself.

And the system surely does minitor your improvement in posititivity but not in negativity.\nSure it notices if you go [-10;-1] to [+1;+10] but it still punish your after 14 day ban no matter if you went from -10 to -2 or -1, no matter if maybe average players are at -2 on 1 game and at +1 on 9 games, you got -1 On 1 game during the 3 Month post your 14 day ban, you still get a perma.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-12-30T22:27:43.206+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is untrue. You can be reported by all 9 other players in every single game you play, but if you are not behaving poorly you will not be punished. It doesn't just punish players who are reported - it reviews the chat (or gameplay depending on report category) and makes a determination.\n\nYou are correct the system doesn't particularly care if you go from being \"level 10\" negative to only \"level 5\" negative. The system only cares if you are negative or positive. There is no amount of negativity - be it mild or extreme - that is acceptable in League of Legends.\n\nFrom this, it can be said that you can get reported all you want, but if you're not negative in chat, you won't be punished again for it.","replies":[{"poster":"RenekTonsOfDmg","date":"2017-12-30T22:36:37.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok thank you this gives me more precision and that's exactly what i was looking for https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-K8tABb2iC-c/WYpjEo_IroI/AAAAAAAArDE/tCO7Bgzy4lw7EGjokNj6_M72tDAdAytigCLcBGAs/s1600/e7d1898e7349d6a5.png\nBut then i have 2 questions:\n-Can i send a riot ticket to get chat restricted just so i can be sure to improve\n-Do you please have a list of positive words/phrases that i can write ingame and be 100% sure to not get banned for it?","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-12-30T22:43:30.914+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Generally no - Riot does not restrict the chat of accounts as a preventative measure as it was shown to not be effective. Limiting someone's chat does not particularly prevent them from flaming, it just means they can only do so once every 4 minutes.\n\n2. There is no list. If you are positive in your attitude, you are fine. If you are negative in your attitude, you may be punished. What is positive or not depends a lot on the situation, the context, and how it's phrased. The same exact word/group of words can have two completely different meanings given the context of the game and the chat surrounding it.","replies":[{"poster":"RenekTonsOfDmg","date":"2017-12-30T22:51:03.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are [GJ, WP, GG, GG WP] 100% safe and enough to be considered positivity and behavior improvement?","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-12-30T23:08:47.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, if you're saying those they're likely positive.

Seriously.\n\nI'd have to bet that those are taken out of context in some light....like perhaps the player in question was someone who spends the entirety of their games making long winded typing/keyboard warrior paragraphs in the chat, clogging the information that players could actually use to win. Or maybe his first offense was a majour no no like a \"kys\" or racial/homophobic slur. We just don't know.\n\nTo answer your question: Not using the chat isn't a punishable offense. You should still use pings. You could mute all every game and then just put \" gj\" or \" gg\" after every game to bypass a pierced 'dodging' of the problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xurreal","date":"2017-12-31T02:57:54.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not specifically.

If you show extremely negative behavior (racial slurs, homophobic statements, telling someone to harm themselves or others) your punishment can be escalated to an immediate 14-day ban. Once you are at that 14-day, you are on your last chance. Anything that would warrant a punishment (even things that would be a simple chat restriction) will get you banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Butt Ρlug","date":"2017-12-30T22:20:03.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">You can be the most toxic player before your 14 day ban and right after that the casual player who flames a little 1 game out of 10.\n\nThis is the issue, when you've been banned before. RIOT expect you to understand that they don't want you to flame anymore, at all.\n\nI don't get why you say that you don't use the in-game chat but you still flame 1 game out of 10.\nEven one game of dishonorable behavior can derail your progress.\nIf you are being validly reported, it can slow your honor progress, up to virtually no progress being made. If you misbehave in games still, but it's too rare/infrequent for you to deserve a full-on punishment, you may still not be progressing in honor.\n\nBut to answer your question, yeah i'm sure you can be punished even if you don't use the chat at all, like if you spam pings/death timers and so on.\n\nFor me, if you still flame 1 game out of 10, you did not understand the first punishment and you should expect to be permabanned soon. You clicked on \"I Agree\" when you had your first punishment, but you don't seems to get what that means.\n\n>So, what can I do to deal with that? am i forced to not be using chat for 3 months post my ban? and if I do is there any risk of unsportsman conduct because of lack of communication?\n\nYou can still chat without being mean/toxic, it's not that complicated, the majority of players do that without any issues, just don't be mean to anyone. \nThere is plenty of things you can say without any problems.\nI suggest you to read [the summoner's code.](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/)","replies":[]}]}
