I moved my NA account to play on EUW with my friend. I've been here for awhile and I want to change back but I noticed that the cost isn't in USD. Say I bought an RP card in the US (Where im from). Unused. How would I use it on the EUW client?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-16T21:17:44.643+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a quick heads up: those RP cards are region specific, so a US RP card will not work on EUW. \n\nWith that being said, you should still be able to make a payment using PayPal or your normal cards if you'd like and there would be a small currency conversion fee from your bank. If you already bought the RP Card from the US or can't use normal payment methods for some reason, reach out to our billing team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they'll be able to help!","replies":[{"poster":"Add My Myspace","date":"2017-06-17T00:25:35.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two really quick questions! I clicked \"I have a question about purchasing RP\" do I just fill it out asking them to convert the RP I would get from my 25$ Gift Card and send a picture with the code? Also how long would it take for them to verify its unused to give me my RP?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-17T04:17:30.849+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late response, but yea pick that option (or any really) and just let them know that you have an RP card from the wrong region and they should be able to help ^_^!\n\nOnce we get to your ticket we can easily verify that the card hasn't been used, but keep in mind that tickets are answered through a queue so there could be a bit of a wait. Honestly, I would think you should have a response by tomorrow, but please don't hold me to that since I don't answer those tickets xD!","replies":[{"poster":"Add My Myspace","date":"2017-06-17T20:30:38.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its fine!
