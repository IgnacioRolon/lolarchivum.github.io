To try to get better at LoL, I built a match analyzer.  I call it [Echo](http://lolecho.com/).\r\n\r\nIt has graphs and maps so you can see what was going on at any point during the game.  I use it to see how well I farmed in mid compared to my lane mate, or to figure out why at 23 minutes the enemy jungler started kicking my butt.\r\n\r\nThere's lots of data; I've improved a lot from using it.  If you want to learn more, there are detailed instructions on the [about page](http://lolecho.com/about/).\r\n\r\nFor an example match, see [this one](http://lolecho.com/?na:1727670208) or maybe [this nemesis game](http://lolecho.com/?na:1732653804).

As for your lookup failing, it could have been anything from a network hiccup to a temporary API issue.

There are a lot of things that we don't care if you use them, but we don't official approve any of them. If you think it is providing ANY advantage at all, odds are it's not ok. If it is also interacting with the game in any impactful way between when you hit \"play\" and when the end of game screen appears, it's also likely not ok.

The TL;DR is that the match history uses the X-Y cords from the game, and the in-game map is actually a bit larger due to the \"off the map\" space on the borders in the sky boxes beyond the normal game play area. The map image however is cropped down (and different dimension ratios), so the numbers don't line up.
