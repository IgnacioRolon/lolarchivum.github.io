I get that you guys want to stop him from brainlessly poking you down from range, but the Q doesn't deal much damage and is nearly impossible to land. I feel like it may be a top contender for worst ability in the game. If the lock-on was only on this spell, it'd make more sense, but if he lands E, he gets the lock-on for free.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2017-10-11T05:21:31.503+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are looking at some options around Q hittability, yes.
