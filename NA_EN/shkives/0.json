In my quest to ensure that my League of Legends games are both enjoyable and respectful, I sought to purchase the Warden Sivir skin for 750 RP.  It would be the perfect symbol to denote my own personal Code of Order.\n\nHowever, upon reviewing my current available RP; I was dismayed to find that I only possess 738. Which is exactly 12 short  of the required denomination.  Now ordinarily, this would require the purchase of additional RP. Something I have happily done in the past. However, while the Code is of the utmost importance to me, like Sivir I am also a fiscally shrewd man. Especially when the difference is so small. \n\nSo I beseech thee Riot, is there not some task I could perform to earn the 12 RP I require to purchase the latest in a long line of your excellent skins?","replies":[{"poster":"Jeije","date":"2015-02-18T00:24:08.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"*thee\n\nDrawing a picture tends to tickle Riot's fancy, inclining them to award small amounts of RP to the artist.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shkives","date":"2015-02-18T00:35:56.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A small offering. more to follow","replies":[{"poster":"Shkives","date":"2015-02-18T00:37:18.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it's spelled \"Tonnes\"","replies":[{"poster":"gloomyMoron","date":"2015-02-18T09:10:32.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends, actually.
