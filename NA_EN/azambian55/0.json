So I was spectating a game and literally 2 of the players(mid and jg) stopped trying after 15 mins. They didn&#039;t go afk or disconnect, but instead ran around the map, stayed in base and hid in bushes. I would hate to have teammates like that.\r\n\r\nRegarding that, I think it would be great if we as spectators could report people as well, like in this instance. Players like this should get perma banned, no joke. That game was actually winnable, 3v5 and they still got an ace(penta kill as well) but because 2 were messing around, they didn&#039;t win. I do have the names of these people which I can disclose. To add, this was a ranked game, which we all know are important. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m pretty sure there are many players like this, what do I say to that, ban them all.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-04-15T17:52:41.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"If they didn't feed, theres no real reason they should be banned.
