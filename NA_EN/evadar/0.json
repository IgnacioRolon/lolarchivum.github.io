Blue Screens typically happen due to some sort of hardware or driver malfunction that your pc just doesn't know how to deal with.

Once you can get a relatively clear  picture, attach that to a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and send it to our tech guys!","replies":[]}]}
