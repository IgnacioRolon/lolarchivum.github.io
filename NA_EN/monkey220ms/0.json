I have 550k mastery with him and have been playing league for roughly 4 months, he is my ranked OTP and I have around 400 games with him. But I must say that I hate his rework. And I&#039;m really struggling to find a similar champion. Right before the rework I had finally mastered 1v1ing when he hits level 3, as the 5 stack shield would often give a huge advantage early game and I was always good at teamfighting with him so long as I stayed towards the back line. However, his new rework is SO much weaker IMO, and I really hate his ult (it&#039;s so useless at level 1, can be cancelled by enemy attacks, and often times ends up trolling your own team rather than doing anything useful). I found that I had to be alot less aggressive, because his shield is alot worse and his cooldowns are longer now that he no longer gets CDR with 5 stacks. I also think his animation looks like junk, it just doesn&#039;t feel as powerful as it used to he looks like some scrawny doll that has a casting animation similar to cassiopeia. Also, the tribal ryze splash art looks absolutely amazing, but as soon as I got in game I wanted to shoot someone because it looks so DAMN TERRIBLE. And the way he runs? I have never seen such long legs in my life.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I hate the ryze rework, think it is weak and looks terrible and am super sad that I am retiring as a ryze OTP and possibly from league because I cant find another champ I like\r\n\r\nWHY DID YOU HAVE TO DO THIS RIOT??? YOU ALWAYS CHANGE RYZE JUST LET HIM BE","replies":[]}
