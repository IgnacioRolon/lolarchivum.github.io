I click on it and select the option \"Unlock Summoner Icon\". After I do that, a message saying the icon has been added to my inventory appears (I do have enough orange essence for it) but subsequently, another message appears saying Redeem Failed with a subtext with something goofy written first and then asking me to restart the client and check service status. I have done both things to no avail. The account I am trying to unlock this Icon for is DedUnborn on the LAN server.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T22:22:28.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I might be a little late, but I did look over your account and I see the Nightshade Serpent Icon was successfully added to your list of icons. Be sure to look through your icons for it, as they are listed in order or release and not when you obtained them I believe.
