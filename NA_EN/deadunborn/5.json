First, she needs to build a bunch of a stat to get the bonus effects on her abilities, so it's not like she can just jump into invisibility and tons of missiles immediately. She has no CC, and her only self peel is a two second speed boost that prevents her from attacking. She needs to build attack speed to get the invisibility on it. Unless she can snipe or an ally lands CC, she can't start a fight with her ultimate. She seems like she'll be fine, since her only survival tool revolves around losing the ability to attack and having to build a particular stat to get the stealth.","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2018-02-21T02:16:19.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, as long as she doesn’t turn out to be a generic ADC I’ll be picking her up as my new assassin champion.

The thing is she does need to reach 100 bonus AD and 100 bonus AP. So she is going to need both Gunblade and runaan’s at the very least. \n\nI could see a gunblade guinsoo’s runaan’s statikk shiv ie build being busted on her. As expensive as that is. \n\nShe basically has no choice but to build a minimum 2 AP and 2 AD items, be they hybrid or not. So we could have Nashor’s botrk runaan’s, or we could have gunblade guinsoo’s which seems just easier to build overall. \n\nBasically the issue with the generic on hit build is it needs modifications to work on her and trigger her requirements. \n\nSo the other possible build could be gunblade guinsoo’s wits end runaan’s botrk.

Runaan's is also a crucial item, as well as BORK.  You have 100+ AP with Rageblade and Gunblade, so the 4% max health from bloodrazor is better than a wit's end.  Nashor's tooth would be a good item, but I think the two % health items and her passive would work well into a tanky comp.  If the opposing team is all squishy, then build Nashor's tooth instead.  I wouldn't build wit's end, it's just a weak item, and Nashor's Tooth or Bloodrazor would suit her better.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperRiceBoi","date":"2018-02-23T20:26:51.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd start Rageblade if the enemy has a tanky comp, and Gunblade if they have a squishy comp or if you're having lane trouble.","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2018-02-25T04:41:04.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2018-02-25T04:40:38.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wits end reduces MR by a lot while also gaining 40 on hit magic damage and tankiness, hence why it’s such a good item.
