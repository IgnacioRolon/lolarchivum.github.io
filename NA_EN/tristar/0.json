So the obvious age old question which I lack for a better way of saying: \"How do I fix this?\"","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-16T23:27:59.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The client is trying to open, but something like a security setting is blocking it from happening.
