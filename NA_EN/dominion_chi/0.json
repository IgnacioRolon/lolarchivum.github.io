I think if you are AFK for too long in a match it count as a loss even if you do come back. Not sure if what the cut off is, but it feels like if you are gone for 10+ minutes, or maybe a % of the game length, it counts it as a loss regardless of outcome. I've seen that play out a few times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Nocturne God","date":"2018-06-07T09:09:34.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, your MMR must be pretty low if you still lose LP on wins!\n\nJ/k... it might be a bug from earlier when matches were being buggy.
