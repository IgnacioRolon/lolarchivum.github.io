RIOT support just closed my ticket anyway.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So I've been trying to get help from RIOT support and my ISP together to try to fix a routing issue since 7.13 went live and all of a sudden there was a third support guy put on my case who INSTANTLY closed my ticket. It now says solved and I can't reply even though the last thing on the ticket is me asking a few questions. RIOT, I don't know who Tanukii is, but if he wishes to close my ticket, I would hope that he would at least give me a reason why he is closing my ticket and/or answers to my questions. If it helps, my ticket was TICKET #30815923. Please help me. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-11T00:15:50.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and pulled up that ticket, and yea that is a little strange that it was closed out without a response being sent. I did notice your traceroute showed some packet loss which is probably the main problem with you not being able to log in. \n\nUltimately the main reason that you're having issues getting logged in is that your connection is losing most of it's data before it hits our servers. For instance, in the last traceroute you sent in the ticket showed 100% packet loss. It might not be something that can be immediately fixed with the flip of a switch, but those traceroutes can be really good ammo when dealing with your ISP. Honestly, I would suggest reaching back out to your ISP with all the traceroutes you've done and that will show them proof that something is going wrong. You'll have a much easier time getting them to work with you with that data.","replies":[{"poster":"Follower 16","date":"2017-07-11T19:55:03.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My biggest question was the one left unanswered: is it possible to trace back towards me from the IP that I can't connect to in order to find where it falls off. If possible that would be a huge help to be able to show where exactly the route was supposed to go and where I need to tell them there is an issue specifically. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Follower 16","date":"2017-07-11T20:20:16.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just got off the phone with my ISP again and they said their engineer got directly in touch with yours and they traced down the issue and are currently working to find a solution. It happened to be on your end after all was said and done. Something to do with the last patch and an IP not updating correctly leading to an untraceable route to your servers. Hope this helps if anyone from Otelco asks for help.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
