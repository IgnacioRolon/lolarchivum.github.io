Over a week.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so I have a support ticket open and I've been working on getting it fixed for a week but still no answers. When I try to log in on the client (NA), it always fails authentication. I've done everything support has recommended and even tried to use the VPNs suggested to try to get the client to authenticate. I have uninstalled/reinstalled, used the Hextech Tool, updated and restored updates, etc. I have not been able to log in since the new patch and am getting frustrated with my ISP blaming Riot and Riot blaming my ISP. I have run IP traces on the IPs given to me via support ticket and have had fellow summoners and my ISP run the traces as well. The first IP fails for everyone (in multiple states and with multiple ISPs), yet the second one works fine. I can log in on Latin America North, but it's difficult to play a game in another language. Plus I've spent a fair amount of money on my NA account and would love to play in English again. _**Please help me.**_","replies":[{"poster":"Zykath","date":"2017-07-07T01:50:51.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had the same issues, and gotten the same responses. I know I'm not a computer genius, but without changing any computer or router settings problems shouldn't just appear like this. The obvious issue is something caused by patch 7.13, and I'm sure (hopefully) Riot will have a fix within the next patch. I've been having this issue with multiple computers, and changing the internet source by going to McDonalds and using their wifi wasn't a fix either, only thing left is Riot's side.","replies":[{"poster":"Follower 16","date":"2017-07-07T14:12:56.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah to me it was too coincidental timing for it to be with as soon as the patch was made live, I and a few others immediately lost service. (From North Alabama) I've know of a couple others who can't connect either. And running the IP traces showed that only one of the two IPs they sent me were traceable (my ISPs main hub is based in Missouri and I've had people across the US test them as well).","replies":[{"poster":"Zykath","date":"2017-07-07T18:16:45.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I assume you have Otelco Internet as well, because that's where I'm from. Honestly even if it is the ISP they won't listen to us. Maybe if a rioter would reach out to Otelco to work on a solution on our behalf, because they won't listen to us. I've got a lot of friends with the issue, and Otelco is fully aware of the problem, but nobody is working on a solution on either side.","replies":[{"poster":"Follower 16","date":"2017-07-07T22:27:59.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just got off the phone with Otelco again. They claim (up to their boss) that there is NOTHING they can do about it. They have run IP traces on the IP given to me 192.64.170.252 and nobody has been able to successfully connect (again their office is in Missouri and they are on COMPLETELY separate servers). I used a VPN that allowed me to Log in (could \"play\" with very high ping but couldn't do anything else on my computer like discord, etc) and did the trace with the VPN active and ended at a separate IP: 104.160.131.101. Upon tracing that IP without the use of the VPN I got a successful trace with roughly my normal ping. The best I can deduce from all this is that Riot changed (willingly or not) an IP that just happens to be the one that Otelco directs us to and that we can't connect to that IP due to some weird routing issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Zykath","date":"2017-07-07T22:56:22.282+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exact same, the fact that I can tell they're honestly working on a fix but are just stumped makes me want Riot to reach out even more, I can get that Riot isn't having issues with other ISPs so it looks like it's not their fault, but our ISP isn't having troubles connecting to anything else either, it's probably like you said, and that's an issue on both of their parts, that won't get fixed until Riot identifies the reason why it's not getting through, and then tells our ISP how to fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Follower 16","date":"2017-07-07T23:48:55.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump on both comments. I don't think whatever happened was intentional, however I do believe that SOMEONE knows how to fix it. And idc who takes responsibility but I just want to play. Riot is slowly losing a longstanding player and avid purchaser by making it take this long. And I'm not the only one. I love this game and would love to continue to play it, but this is honestly absurd. I don't like people who just point fingers and don't try to get something accomplished.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Follower 16","date":"2017-07-07T19:01:45.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do. And yeah that would be nice. I have asked a few times for my support guy to give me something to work with and in my last message requested specifics. I just want to play in English again. Playing the blame game on both of their ends is extremely childish and since they know (because of logs) what is going wrong, then they need to be in contact and trying to get things resolved. I can only go so far as a customer, whereas employees they should be able to communicate much easier and on higher levels than we are able to approach. Good luck to you as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Zykath","date":"2017-07-07T20:57:18.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly what I've been saying bro! Maybe if we just keep pushing then someone on either side will step forward and create a solution. It's not about who's right and who's wrong, it's that there is an issue that's preventing us from playing that's not being fixed and all we want is a solution!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-06T21:22:22.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might not be ISP or server related, but a more local source blocking your from reaching the authentication server.
