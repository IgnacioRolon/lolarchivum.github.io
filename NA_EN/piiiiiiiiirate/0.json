I'm sorry to hear that you've been experiencing connection issues with the League of Legends client. Based on those logs, it looks like you're having routing issues. If you take a look you'll notice that you're intermittently spiking over 200ms at your router level. This isn't something we can assist with, you'll need to contact your ISP again and have their higher tiered technicians troubleshoot this with you. In the meantime, there are a number of networking issues that can be resolved by performing a quick reset or power cycle of your home network. I have provided some step-by-step instructions to help you perform a power cycle for your home network:\n> \n> Shut down all computers connected to your home network (modem/router/gateway).\n> Power down/unplug your router, if you use one.\n> Power down/unplug your modem. Have both devices off for at least 60 seconds. Note: If your modem has a battery backup you will need to take the battery out for 60 seconds or use the reset button on the modem.\n> Turn on your modem and allow it to completely boot up. Wait until the indicator lights on the device stop blinking and display a steady green connection.\n> Turn on the router (if you have one) and allow to completely boot up as well.\n> Start the computers and allow it to completely boot up and re-establish an internet connection.\n> Let me know if you have any other questions or need more clarification.\n> \n> BowlO'Ramen \n> Tech Support - Fizz OP\n> \"Lunch time!\"***\n\n\n\nSo basically it looks like my ISP is lying to me, can you reconmend any other ISP besides comcast? I just need a better service provider for gaming\n\nand general","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-07-06T23:55:19.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"400 ms. thats exactly what i get when my lag spikes. its a pattern.","replies":[]},{"poster":"H e L L ii s H","date":"2016-07-06T08:03:54.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same","replies":[]},{"poster":"rtbf75873392","date":"2016-07-06T14:38:27.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Same.
