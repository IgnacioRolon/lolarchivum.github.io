I have 120 Chaos tokens and I was hoping I can get 20 more so I can open an Orb of Chaos, however, if they're gonna be branded useless I might as well get myself 3 key fragments before that happens. Would be nice to know. Thanks in advance.\n\nRegards,\nUnchovekable","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-02T20:47:07.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any leftover tokens will be going away on 7/24, so make sure to use them while you can! You should still be able to craft them into icons or hextech loot, and you can also disenchant them into essence at a rate of 10 Tokens = 10 Blue Essence.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chrisztoph","date":"2017-07-06T12:45:11.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this mean we can still earn tokens up until They expire?
