I'm not gonna say TSM/C9 best teams in the world, when they clearly aren't. And, why should I be more biased towards a team cuz they're from my region. I want Na to win, but I'm not gonna root for a team just cuz they're na if I like watching and cheering for a team more interesting in another region.
