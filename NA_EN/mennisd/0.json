I've made a ticket for the first time to go on some ranked games. I was quite frustrated by this. I did not play this game in the game because I do not think it's fair to the other people who play normally too. I made this a ticket and I'm lucky to be a normal one. for the people who read this will think about what you're up to. 1 hour after I received a nice mod, my accout was suspended. Here I have requested another ticket for why. The respondents responded to me and did not give me a clear answer. Meanwhile I'm 2/3 weeks left and I have not had a normal answer. I have answered several questions and yes, of course, I do not know everything I bought first. I shared this account with my cousin who is a bit older than I am. So he bought skins with his paypall account every now and then. Now it has been a while since he used it and he is not using it at all. I tried to explain this to the mods, but they did not get it.In addition, I have received several questions and answered with 100% confidence. I also said that I did not know my first 4800 champ and 6700 champ. so I still knew the last two champs I bought and I added that. Once again I have had an answer with just pure nonsense. that I have to ask my cousin and have to make a ticket. I think this is very funny because I have already mentioned that he has nothing else with league, his paypall has not been used for a while, the first champs we bought do not know we all two long ago. All in all, someone from Mods had a bad day and just suspended my account. For all newcomers, if you have any problems you can already give up these bullies, you do not get it wrong. Hopefully nobody ever gets the same problems with the mods as I have.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-16T01:29:22.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This account was locked because there were heavy signs of a hacker having stolen access to it. In order to make sure the account only goes back to it's *original* owner is why we're asking the questions in your ticket. You mentioned your cousin had given you this account, which is against the ToU and might be why it's locked. We're not looking for who 'owns' the account, we're making sure it only goes back to the one who created it. Feel free to look over those questions again to remember what you can.","replies":[{"poster":"MennisD","date":"2017-10-16T17:23:17.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"To start with, I thank you for finally the answer. The accout is a little older and I have also played a game. The fact that it is about \"hacke\" is actually amazed me. I have already indicated by the mails I've had just do not really know. I actually do not expect any help or anything else for the rest. Unfortunately, this account will stay blank because I just do not know some questions. but I think it's strange that the years / months go well and then suddenly or '' a hacker having to have access to it ''. thanks again for your reply and I do not know for the rest anymore. I feel stolen and irritated.{{champion:103}}","replies":[]}]}]}
