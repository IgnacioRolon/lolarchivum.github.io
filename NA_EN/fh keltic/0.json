If a supermajority (3/4 or 4/5 etc.) of you elect to show mercy, then the other team gets the option to accept mercy or reject it.\n\nIf they accept mercy, the following happens:\n\n* The game immediately ends, similar to surrender\n\n* The team giving mercy gets the same rewards as if they had won normally\n\n* The team receiving mercy gets reduced (~75%) penalties (MMR/LP) and do not have promotion games counted as losses.\n\n* The AFK/DC(s) get increased (~double) penalties.\n\nIf they don't accept mercy (or you don't offer it in the first place), the game continues as it normally would. You do not have to accept mercy if, for example, you are winning the 4v5. But there is generally no good reason to not offer mercy, as all it does is accelerate your win. Now, if you want to play out the 4v5 you're perfectly welcome to, but given the odds of winning you wouldn't generally want to.\n\nTypical objections to systems that handle AFK/DC:\n\n* Actually encourages DCing in bad situations\n\nThis system most certainly doesn't encourage this. I highly doubt anyone would be willing to take double penalties to help out a few strangers, even if said strangers are in their series. \n\n* Encourages flaming in the hopes that someone doing badly will ragequit\n\nThis is a valid argument, but it's really a separate issue from properly handling AFK/DCs. Keep in mind that being granted mercy still results in a significant LP hit, so you wouldn't be trying to get mercy unless the game was seriously unwinnable. At that point, anyone who is going to be flaming in the first place would probably be flaming anyway, so I don't think there would be a significant increase in such behavior (would you really risk a ban for flaming in the hopes that your teammate might ragequit, thus saving you 4 LP?). Nonetheless it is an issue, but one that I think would be far less prevalent than the rampant AFK/DC problem there is now.\n\n* Unfairly punishes players who AFK/DC through circumstances beyond their control\n\nI don't think double penalties are particularly unfair, since if you're DCing more than once in a while that's likely more of your issue than Rito's (this has been less true over recent periods where the servers are collapsing, but even among that period I haven't permanently DCed from a game more than once every couple days). Notably, the institution of this system would allow LeaverBuster to be a bit more lenient (since there are already implicit penalties for disappearing), which would probably be a more welcome to chronic DCers than the current system (I'd sacrifice ~20 LP to get rid of my week-long ban any day). \n\n* Results in MMR/LP inflation\n\nThe losing team loses the exact same amount of LP/MMR in total under this system, so there is no inflation at all. The sole exception MAY be interactions with promotion series. I'm not 100% sure how LP/MMR works in conjunction with those, but the effect would be negligible at best. To put it into context, a single push of the \"Loss forgiven\" button probably results in more inflation than this system would produce in a year.\n\nIn short, this system may not be 100% perfect, but it is far more preferable to the current state of affairs that amount to \"life sucks, move on\". I personally don't think there's any good way to justify *not* implementing it, except obviously technical matters. Of course it shouldn't be a particularly difficult thing to program (it's basically an extension of surrendering), but \"this should be easy to program\" very often turns into a year-long project so I'll refrain from making such a statement :P","replies":[{"poster":"Verandure","date":"2014-12-22T06:01:04.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is not the system suggested.
