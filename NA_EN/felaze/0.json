The particle effects on the base, Tyrant and Northern Front are just so smooth, and, like Evelynn and Galio, it&rsquo;s very much appreciated that even the lesser value skins get some new particles that aren&rsquo;t the same as the base. \r\nI&rsquo;m also so, so excited to see the return of VFX updates that don&rsquo;t come with a full VGU! The new Cho&rsquo;gath FX are just fantastic, and even though I&rsquo;ve owned him for the longest time, I&rsquo;ve never actually played him because I just did not find him visually appealing at all. It&rsquo;s details like these that give me a renewed interest in playing champions that I wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise. I just really appreciate the amount of updates coming to the game. It makes it feel like some champions who have decent kits, but outdated models, and VFX/SFX hope until they&rsquo;re reworked; if at all necessary!\r\nI&rsquo;m hoping and praying that this means MF will be getting a slight texture update to her model to make her design fall more in line with the cinematic. I saw the concept art for her cin&eacute;-model, and the full bodice, laced up pants that don&rsquo;t expose her thighs and the jewelry she wears feels so much more like the MF that should be in the game. I mean, she&rsquo;s more or less bound to be getting a VO overhaul since her current doesn&rsquo;t match with the new lore MF, and I am praying that with a VO update, her model will be tweaked as well. \r\nEither way, I am just here to say thank you, so, so much for keeping this game so new, and fresh! \r\nI&rsquo;ve been hoping to see the return of smaller aesthetic updates for champions for so long, but read quite some time ago that they likely wouldn&rsquo;t be making a return due to the fact that there was such little appreciation for them- but I&rsquo;m here to say thank you! \r\nIt&rsquo;s lovely, and so are all of you! I appreciate you all very much!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Phoenix","date":"2018-01-25T21:39:22.944+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's extra motivating to read comments like yours, thank you for taking the time to write <3","replies":[{"poster":"Felaze","date":"2018-01-26T10:18:29.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ahh!
