This is kinda ridiculous. Had a game we were ahead in, and he got his second item and just walked up to our entire team pressed w with lulu e and everyone just phased out of the game and started an adventure with a gray screen. How is this even cool? How to counter kog, be a fed assassin and end before 30? That can&#039;t be an intended gameplay mechanic.","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2017-09-27T09:23:59.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was this guy that told someone complaining about kog that they shoulda maybe built {{item:3194}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3082}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3047}} {{summoner:3}} {{summoner:21}} {{summoner:7}} before 5 mins and then maybe, just maybe you'll be able to live from the 15 min fed kog,\ntry ending before his late game power spike kappa. xd","replies":[]},{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2017-09-27T07:11:05.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"end before 30? you mean 10'.
