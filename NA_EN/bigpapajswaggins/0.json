If they have the better jungle accept the loss and accept that you will waste your time playing out the lost game for 25 more minutes while try harding and still losing. Don't call that troll out because your whole team will instantly turn on you.\nDo 1 to prevent 3.\n4 Understand getting better at the game is a pipe dream, trolls, afks, and inters will prevent you from learning anything past the 8 minute marker.\n5 4 also applies when the enemy team has the trolls, afks, and inters.\n6 if muting people is a problem, don't spend rp, your accounts going to get banned, teammate will defend a troll before they will defend the person calling out the troll.\n7 9 game loss streaks where you are the only person with a positive score and only turret kill on the map are common. Do not start swearing at people in game 7. This will get you punished. Please refer to rule 1\n8 this is a team game where it benefits your team more to mute them then to communicate with them, because your team is bots. Sometimes you wish your team was bots, and every rare occasion you have a decent team. However in these cases the enemy team is bots and the game is over quickly. Don't ever expect a fun back and forth battle, these don't exist.\n9 Get better at leveling accounts because I'll never resort to 1.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-27T23:34:18.371+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"This should be called \"What i have refused to learn from getting permed twice\".\n\nLuckily the other 99.9% or so of players learn faster.","replies":[{"poster":"BigPapaJSwaggins","date":"2018-03-27T23:36:52.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"That stat is actually a really poorly documented stat.

Uh.. That is not how numbers work, at least in this universe. Dont asspull blatantly fake stats.\n\nThat all assumes riot is lying, and they have no reason to lie about that, especially with so many people insisting on harsher punishments.","replies":[{"poster":"BigPapaJSwaggins","date":"2018-03-28T01:04:06.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly you can't go 5 games without someone raging in this game.
