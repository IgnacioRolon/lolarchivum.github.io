While he does get some free AD from his Q, crit and attack speed are multiplicative stats. What do they multiply the effectiveness of? Your AD (and also on-hits in the case of attack speed).\n\nTryndamere doesn't tend to get as much AD as a Riven or Fiora, but he does need it.\n\n> I tried all of them and the most useful öne was botrk but its too expensive.
