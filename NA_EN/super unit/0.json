It contained windows 10 and all the drivers and software my computer used to have. I am unable to download league of legends now but I could before my new hard drive. The error I'm getting is a visual c++ error code 1935. I have seen some threads about this and tried downloading the visual c++ 2005 right from Microsoft but I get the same error while I try to download that. Any help would be nice I will supply you with any information you need to know about my pc.\r\n\r\nThankyou","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-18T03:19:28.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 1935 C++ Error happens if you're missing certain dependencies that League needs to exist prior to installing League.
