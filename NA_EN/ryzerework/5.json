Idk about that. People are still on the Faker train, and yes; he is that good but so is their adc Bang. Easyhoon is particularly problematic because he is much better at aoe mages ({{champion:69}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:101}} } than Faker and he is also nearly as good as Faker so SKT's team comps can flip 360 depending on who is playing. \n\nBang pretty close to solo carried a game where SKT should have got hard outscaled.\n\nFortunately for tsm, Lustboy is probably the better support, Santorin is the stronger jungler, and I think TSM is slightly ahead in terms of tactics. SKT still has the option of brute force win by pure skill if either Bang or Faker/Easyhoon get fed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ganiklis","date":"2015-05-04T03:52:02.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tsm won iem cause tigers basically shit the bed.
