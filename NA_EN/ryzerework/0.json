Unlike alot of ults which can vary in use, Ekko literally can't use his ult to hurt you, unless you go near his clone (which is completely within your control)\n\n\nEdit: on a side note, wouldn't he suffer from the issue Talon has, where he can get in easily (dash in and then teleport onto you) but can't get out easily? (Bear in mind most problem assassins have a way in AND a way out incase things turn bad, Zed has his second shadow; LeBlanc can teleport back to her glyph, Kassadin has riftwalk, etc; Ekko has none of that, he has to walk away with a short speed boost, thats just asking to get CC'd at point blank range the moment he engages) ","replies":[{"poster":"Apollocliptic","date":"2015-05-29T15:38:48.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3 ways I've landed his ulti in lane phase\n\nRecall next to turret, enemy comes for farm and doesn't expect you to R return, they also don't always see it right away.

If you enemy EVER engages on you, you can land it.\n\nZone. Place a stun in front of them, dash behind them and land Q. They have limited options for escape, chances are they have to walk through one of you zoning skills. (about 50/50, 75/25 if you used terrain or minion waves to your advantage)\n\nBonus, land your stun LOL that's different because it's harder to land than the ulti, but if he's stunned you, good chance he's ulti u too :)\n\nAnd like you mentioned, if you're chasing him, but that's your greed, not his OP :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2015-05-28T20:30:14.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In a teamfight, a lot can happen.

Ekko's cost on his Q is too high for him to reliably spam it for farming (without blue anyway), and he lacks a shield like Diana's without using his highly telegraphed W.\n\nIt seems like he'd again be like Talon and just have a terrible laning phase, only it'd be even harder for Ekko to snowball since his things are all so telegraphed.","replies":[{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2015-05-28T20:50:56.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His Q is approximately as telegraphed as Ori's or Ziggs's.

When I said his \"things\" were telegraphed by the way, I was mostly referring to his W and R, not Q, W takes 3 seconds to activate, in which time the enemy has likely walked back under their turret (making diving without an escape somewhat risky).\n\nAnd R is well, R, 4 second delay with a telegraphed location and all that jazz.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-05-29T02:04:59.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">but I suppose time will tell\n\nHue.
