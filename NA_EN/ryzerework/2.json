You can buy {{item:3255}} early game if you'd like, but you should sell it once you hit 6 items and you can replace it with a more expensive item.\n\nBuy {{item:2139}} for the AP or {{item:2137}} if you need to take towers and want health.\n\n{{item:3115}} Is less effective than you might think, since the CDR is useless, and you aren't going to win a close range fight with anyone unless you chunk them with your ult first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2015-04-05T08:59:13.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see it, so I'll mention it: AP {{champion:41}} .\n\nStart with a {{item:1036}} and pots, and Q as your first ability. Get W at lvl2, because it's important. Rush Lich Bane to make your Qs *really* hurt, and proceed to basically live forever, while clearing whatever waves you want ever 20 seconds.\n\nI like Luden's Echo - though it only procs from ult - and of course Rab Cap. Build the rest to taste.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mirage Seraph","date":"2015-04-05T08:51:24.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have a lane that can 1v2, try {{champion:121}} Jungle. His clear speed and mobility are stupidly fast and since most people are playing things like Ez and Katarina you can just pop into lanes while on your way to the next camp and just pop them out of existence. Late game is kinda iffy and you're better of split pushing because that isolation makes all the difference. Drop the Mobi's and grab a Zephy instead, dunno why people are so intent on buying boots on this mode.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blastermine","date":"2015-04-05T08:40:46.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:59}} {{champion:254}} Hit 6, buy a {{item:3077}} ,and dunk.

Build full ap on her and your poke will hurt. Also, you can spam heals, damage, and mobility. She's fun in URF.\n\n{{champion:120}} There's also the infamous Hecacopter. Hecarim can turn a losing game into a winning one if you snowball correctly. Infinite AoE damage, a little sustain, and mobility off the wazoo make Hec an insta-ban, but a very fun champ\n\n{{champion:222}} Then there's Jinx. Her W is now her auto attack in URF. Sprinkle in some Flamechompers on the ground and you could zone your enemy easily, but URF Jinx's bread and butter is her Ult. Every 18 seconds, you can fire a rocket all the way across the map. With good aim, you could save a teammates life, and look awesome in the process.\n\n{{champion:80}} If I feel like it, I sometimes go Panth. His spears make him an ADC now because of their 0.8 second cool down in URF. You can then stun people for days with your jump thingy. After stabbing and jumping on your enemy a few times, put em out of their misery with the jabby skill. Also, Panth has that block passive, so you can tower dive a little safer. His ult is good for helping a brutha out in another lane. Overall, Panth is fun.\n\nWhenever I URF, these are my top choices.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pucking Purrfect","date":"2015-04-05T06:22:06.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is if you don't pick a champion that can steamroll others will do it so there will be no fun for you.
