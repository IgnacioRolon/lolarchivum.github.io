Especially if your laner has some CC to follow up.  Honestly your first gank is probably just going to force a flash anyways though, so may as well try to get that shortly before 6 so you can come back while it's on cooldown rather than burn it super early though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2015-05-04T15:41:41.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's good pre6, he's just BETTER after 6!","replies":[]},{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2015-05-04T15:39:45.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I wish whoever stole my punctuation keys would return them it makes it difficult to express thoughts in a coherent manner","replies":[]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-05-03T21:30:52.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is an amazing counter gank pre6, even post 6 his counter gank is amazing, it lets him use the bushes for his gap closing. Are there situations where he can gank pre6? Yes but it is more difficult than other JGs (Rek'Sai, Gragas, Nidalee, Lee Sin, J4 etc.) The concept of a pre 6 or post 6 JG is really the ease and effectiveness of ganks at those levels, Vi for example CAN also gank pre 6, but it is much more effective post 6.","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-05-03T17:57:51.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it isn't that he can't, it's more that they are a lot harder to do right. \n\nWith an ult gank, you get free MS, positioning, and guaranteed surprise factor, as well as generating bonus fury for extra damage in your combo.\n\nPre 6, if you miss whatever ability you empower, your basically sunk since you don't generate enough ferocity quickly enough to get them unless you execute it right to begin with.\n","replies":[]}]}
