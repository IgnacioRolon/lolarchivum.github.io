There was NO reason for them to let Origen have that 5th dragon. Everyone on Origen's side was so low that two Jinx rockets would've killed them, not to mention Bjergsen with his low Syndra cds and insane burst. But instead of just standing their ground, they let themselves be zoned out. It's like 'man, look at that 1hp Kennen! I better not get anywhere NEAR him, what if I misclick and fail to auto-attack? Better just let him have 5 dragon buff to be safe.'","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2015-10-10T11:28:11.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With all of the QSS's and the thresh lantern he would have gotten out without too much of an issue, they had to bait a couple of those out before engaging hard and that is where it kinda fell apart.
