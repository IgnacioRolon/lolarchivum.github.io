He gives the adc great sustain, a good damage buff, and a good defense buff, but if they cant  use it right, your screwed.  This is compared to the other supports who have more utility or engage, allowing you to control situations better. \nTaric is still decent though.   Hes good when you need to sustain your adc through harrass and strong engages.  Is also pretty good when there is a mobile adc you need to lock down, like vayne or kalista, but Naut generally does that job a lot better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-08-30T16:33:35.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taric has absolutely 0 poke or ability to help harass in lane. His stun doesn't deal damage. He stands there and does literally nothing the whole laning phase. I'm an adc/jungle main and as an adc i HATE when i have a Taric support. Cuz unless you're going to be trying to fight the enemy the entire laning phase, Taric is of no use. And fighting the enemy the whole time in early game is not where you're attention should be focused as an adc. Having a Taric as your support if you're against Leona or a melee support isn't as bad, but if you pick him against any ranged support, youre almost guaranteed to lose lane or at best, fall behind. Late game Taric is much better but the trade-off for his piss poor laning phase isn't worth it in the slightest in my opinion","replies":[{"poster":"RyzeRework","date":"2015-08-30T19:27:37.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"his stun has a pretty decent range almost the same as an adc auto attack and his heal is amazing considering he can heal himself and another person at the same time and its a pretty strong heal","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-08-30T17:42:44.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because he is boring to play.

I max my E first, Since his Q scales with his HP, so while you're building tank you get sustain. By maxing E you just sit in bush, run around and Stun the ever loving sparkles out of the enemy bot lane, damn near incessantly. Once you put a few points into it, your E actually hits fairly hard, and since both your W and Q, scale with you becoming a better tank, its not like you're overly punished for doing so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2015-08-30T16:08:37.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he only really shines as a lastpick counterpick to certain teamcomps","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-08-30T16:03:23.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is up for a rework, a heavy one.

Everyone else seems to just have more utility and carry potential.","replies":[]}]}
