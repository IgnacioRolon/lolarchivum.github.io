It is valid real world advice. Want proof? Try it out on me. Try to insult me. Give me the abosolute worst words you can imagine. I guarantee there is not a single thing you can say that will hurt me. Seriously, try it. It is impossible for you to hurt me with words. \n\nWhy are you punishing people for harmless words?\n\nDid you know, you are actually making things worst by punishing chat related offenses? You are giving power to the powerless. When people insult you, they are trying to upset you. If you simply ignore the insults, they are harmless. When you punish/report the insults, you are verifying that the insult was successful. Did you catch the wisdom?\n\nReminds me of another saying: &quot;Give a man a fish. Feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish. Feed him for life.&quot;\n\nReport/punish a person and you temporarily solve a problem. Teach people to never get offended in the first place and you solve all future problems as well.\n\nI understand you want people to be nice to each other. That is a noble goal. However, even that has some problems. Have you ever heard of sarcasm? Through sarcasm, I can be insulting while saying seemingly nice things. \n\nNow consider that report/punish is not a preventive measure. It is a reactive deterrent. The true preventive measure is the chat filter. Yet, Riot allows the player to opt out of the preventive measure. Why are people allowed to be offended when they purposefully chose to see offensive speech?\n\nThis leads into the mute button. This quote is directly from the Summoners Code:\n\n\"If someone&#039;s really starting to bother you, the mute and ignore commands are always there to resolve the situation.\"\n\nNotice a particular word, &quot;resolve&quot;. If the situation is resolved, why are you escalating it? Punishment is not needed when a situation has been resolved. This points out the reactive nature of punishment. Aswell as, gives a hint at the toxicity behind punishment. It also leads into behavioral sciences. I don&#039;t have sources prepared. So, I won&#039;t go into that aspect. Let it be noted though, that the current system is not endorsed by behavioral sciences. \n\nWhat should  be done by Riot?\n\nStop all chat related punishment. Encourage use of the mute button. If deemed beneficial, expand on the in game chat filter.","replies":[{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2017-03-17T21:02:41.414+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"Every day, hundreds of people commit suicide due to words.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2017-03-17T21:19:56.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"Really?

It is a reactive deterrent. The true preventive measure is the chat filter. Yet, Riot allows the player to opt out of the preventive measure. Why are people allowed to be offended when they purposefully chose to see offensive speech?\n\n1. It's very difficult to simply expand the chat filter for offensive speech, when quite a bit of what players find offensive is not based on the specific words used, but the context in which they are used.  With racial and homophobic slurs, those are very easy to filter out, but if you spend a lot of time in this section of the Boards, then you'll see that most of the logs people post that got them banned are not that clear cut.  Many people are reported for calling for reports.  Would you expand the filter to block the use of the word report?  It's a harmless word by itself, and there are situations where it would be a needed one, so it's impractical to block it.  People are also reported and punished for constantly listing their teammates scores to highlight feeding.  The only way to stop that would be to filter out numbers, which is equally impractical.  There's a reason why many of the things that are not on the filtered list are NOT on the filtered list.  It is updated periodically, adding words as they need to be filtered out for the benefit of players.    \n\n2. As far as your comment above... that sounds dangerously close to blaming the victims.  The idea of expanding the chat filter, and forcing the players who abide by the rules to utilize an additional muting function, so that the players who are actively breaking the rules can continue to do so, is somewhat backwards in my mind.  Why should the rule-breakers be given special permission to do and say whatever they want, and the players who are conscientious of the rules be saddled with restrictions?  It really is not that hard to play a match without screaming at your teammates, cursing at them, slurring them, or flaming them with any of the various other methods of breaking the rules via chatting.  Hundreds of thousands of players manage to do it every single day.  We should not be punished because the toxics cannot be bothered to follow the damn rules.","replies":[{"poster":"KORGtuners","date":"2017-03-17T23:36:43.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Fair warning.

Riot employees are the only people that can enforce change. \n\nWell, if you want to discuss matters with Riot, then your best bet is to submit a ticket to player support.  This Board is not a direct route of communication with Riot staff, and while they do periodically reply in the threads here, discussions are primarily held between players and the Arbiters.  From this Board's posted description, \"This board is all about fostering a healthy community in which discussions can revolve around player behavior systems, in-game suspensions, or boards moderation. This includes topics on how the systems work, insight into why players were punished, and advice to help players improve moving forward.\"  So, by posting here, you are going to get responses from other players.  The main Riot employee that I have seen reply in these threads is Tantram, and he tends to answer questions players have regarding their punishments.  \n\n> That is a problem right there. The player is choosing to be offended. They could choose not to be offended. They are punishing themselves and then asking Riot to punish others. \n\nPeople cannot necessarily help their initial emotional reactions to something that they encounter, including offense.  What they can do something about is how they act upon those emotions.  Which is exactly what Riot encourages all players to do, and the basis behind something you quoted in your original post: the mute function for when a player is becoming excessively toxic.  Players with more self-control will either not get (as) offended at situations in the game, will not flame teammates when they are offended, or will use the mute button when they are worried that they might flame teammates in response to things said, in comparison to players with less self-control.  \n\n> A chat filter is useful for a toxic person because it gives** instant feedback **on what is and is not acceptable. \n\nThe thing is, the filter isn't actually giving any real feedback to the player who is toxic.  It's just filtering out words for them.  It doesn't tell the player what they cannot say, or should not say.  It removes all consequences for saying anything and everything, by allowing them to say whatever they want.  And it is only as effective as the programming behind it.  Which means it will inherently be behind the trends in conversation, as it will constantly have to be updated with new words and phrases, which takes time and resources.  So there will always be new insults and threats evolved. \n\n> Everyone should have the same freedoms. In regards to your example, this would mean that no one gets special permissions. Anyone could say anything they wanted. Not just the \"bad guys\".\n> \n> When people are free to speak, they show their true personality. This can be useful for determining the honorable players. A player that has the freedom to say whatever they want but chooses to say something honorable. Is more righteous than a player that has no freedom to say whatever they want but simply follows the rules. \n\nI'll address the two above together, as they coincide.  Players are free to show their true personalities right now.  When their true personalities are found to be \"honorable\" (I'm using your word here, not making a statement on my personal opinions of honor) they are allowed to keep playing.  When their true personalities are found to be \"dishonorable\" (again using your word) they are told what actions of theirs cannot continue, and except in the most severe cases, are only issued a temporary punishment.  \n\nWhile Riot does not outright call certain players \"good\" or \"bad\" based on their behavior, they have put into place programs like the Honor Initiative, where players can be rewarded for choosing to act in a manner that makes the gaming experience more enjoyable for their teammates.  \n\n> That is your opinion. Every person has a different temperment.  There are also people with untreated medical conditions. \n\nThere are indeed people with undiagnosed medical and mental conditions.  That however does not make them free from following the Terms of Use and Code of Conduct.  They agree to follow them just the same as every other player.  While this is a game, and not a matter of life and death, the players who play it need to start taking a little responsibility for their actions.  It is no different than expecting a child to behave themselves in school, or an adult to treat their coworkers respectfully.  If they are fully capable of controlling emotional outbursts in other public situations, then there is no reason why they should be allowed to do so in a League match.      \n\n> The worst part in my opinion, is a player can be permanently banned without doing any of your examples. Should \"asking for reports\" carry the same punishment as \"hate speech\"?\n\nNo one will ever be permabanned for asking for a a report one time.  Or even twice.  Or even three times.  That's just not how the punishment system works.  The IFS cannot levy a permanent suspension for that.  Now, if a player has already earned enough infractions to warrant a 14 day suspension, and then calls for reports multiple times in a match, thus harassing a teammate when they are already on their last strike?  Yes, in that case, they can be permanently suspended for any infraction of the rules at that point.  Because the way the IFS works is not by asking \"does this infraction warrant a permaban\" but by asking \"does this infraction warrant a punishment?\"  If the answer is yes, a punishment is issued, and it is automatically the next one on the punishment tier.  Players are punished for repeatedly breaking the rules, but they are given multiple warnings and punishments, except in the cases of hate speech, and those infractions that deal with cheating.  And for those punishments that deal with toxicity, players are given the chance to work themselves back into \"good standing\" by playing games without demonstrating toxic behavior.  Players who are genuinely trying to change their behavior have the opportunity to do so, and many of them do.      \n\n> How are you being punished? It sounds like you are calling freedom of speech a punishment because it allows someone to say something you don't like.\n\nIt's not about whether I like it or not.  I don't have a particularly thin skin.  But allowing toxic players to say whatever toxic things they want, simply because they want to say them is not fair to the players who follow the rules of the game.  And expanding a chat filter is not going to catch everything.  It's not going to catch even half of it, as I've already shown you examples of things you cannot filter out that are considered toxic, reportable and punishable by Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"KORGtuners","date":"2017-03-19T03:32:28.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Well, if you want to discuss matters with Riot, then your best bet is to submit a ticket to player support.\n\nYou are correct. I'm sorry if I was rude. In my defense, I have contacted Riot before. They were not very open for discussion. I should discuss with people that are willing.\n\n> What they can do something about is how they act upon those emotions. \n\nI'm not convinced. I don't know for sure. My current opinion is that emotions influence actions. It is easier to control your emotions than it is to control your actions while under the influence of emotion.\n\nFor example, it is easier for me to avoid anger than it is for me to control my language while I am angry. \n\n> The thing is, the filter isn't actually giving any real feedback to the player who is toxic. It's just filtering out words for them. It doesn't tell the player what they cannot say, or should not say. \n\nI don't agree. Chat filter only filters innappropriate words. If you type a word that is filtered, you should understand that word is not allowed.\n\n> It removes all consequences for saying anything and everything, by allowing them to say whatever they want.\n\nThat is surely not true. Have you ever seen the loading screen tip, \"A chat filter is not an excuse to curse excessively.\"?\n\n>  And it is only as effective as the programming behind it. Which means it will inherently be behind the trends in conversation,\n\nI agree to an extent. I believe customizable chat filters could go a long way towards keeping the filter up to date.\n\n> Players are free to show their true personalities right now. \n\nI disagree. Perhaps I used the wrong word though. In my opinion, freedom means exempt from retaliation. You can't say I am free to speak then punish me for my speech. I feel there is a better word than \"freedom\".\n\n\"Honor\" and \"punishment\" are both used to encourage/discourage a behavior. A system that does not encourage/discourage behavior is more accurate than \"honor/punishment\" systems. (For determining true biases.)\n\n>  the players who play it need to start taking a little responsibility for their actions.\n\nI am not against this idea. However, the quote I responded to said it was \"not hard\".\n\n> It really is not that hard to play a match without screaming at your teammates, cursing at them, slurring them, or flaming them with any of the various other methods of breaking the rules via chatting.\n\nI am just trying to point out, that what is easy for some. is not necessarily easy for others. Nor am I saying anyone should be exempt from the rules.\n\n> No one will ever be permabanned for asking for a a report one time. Or even twice. Or even three times. That's just not how the punishment system works.\n\nThe issue I have is that \"reportable offenses\" do not seem to be differentiated. For example, I can get a 14 day ban for \"hate speech\". Then get perma banned for \"asking for reports\". All offenses seem to stack on top of each other. \n\nAnother example: I go to jail for 10 years for theft. I get out of jail. I commit another crime, \"running a red light\". Then I get 30 years in jail because of \"prior convictions\".\n\n>  But allowing toxic players to say whatever toxic things they want, simply because they want to say them is not fair to the players who follow the rules of the game.\n\nIt is completely fair. In this example, the rules have changed. Toxic people would no longer be breaking rules. Non-toxic people could say toxic things and go unpunished as well. The opposite is true as well. What I call \"freedom of speech\", gives equal rights to every person.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2017-03-18T07:43:02.121+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you act like an ass in real life you get thrown out of a public place.
