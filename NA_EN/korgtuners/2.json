Remember, that by taking on a role you don't normally play, you'll learn more about unfamiliar champions and increase your own skill level.\n\nThat should cover everything. Basically, there is no excuse for \"one trick ponies\" according to the Summoners Code. If someone has gotten all their champions for a specific role banned, I would expect them to ask to trade roles. If no one is willing to trade roles, then by all means they are going to have to play a \"first time\" champion. Or, they could dodge, but I feel that is going over the top.","replies":[{"poster":"PROJECT Fizz","date":"2017-01-04T19:30:02.695+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or, strange thought here, don't be an ass? \n\nPick intent exists for a reason.

Banning a champion should not result in a fight. Sure, I can see where banning your intended champ can make you upset. You have to get over it.
