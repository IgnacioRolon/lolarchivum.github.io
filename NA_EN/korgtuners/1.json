My team, the Player Behavior team, is responsible for the policies and systems.\n\n\nSo you're the new behavior lead, replacing Lyte? Let me give you some advice. Some very serious, very real advice. There are three main things that have caused every behavior team prior to yours to fail, miserably. If you repeat their mistakes, you will effectively kill League of Legends, which is now at an all time low point thanks to the prior teams. So, here is what you should NOT do.\n\n1 - Giving vague, generalized answers that do not answer the questions and concerns the community has. For example, this one:\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Boqd81O0-upcoming-upgrades-to-chat-restrictions?comment=00180000\nThis answer is vague and general. It answers nothing about the question that Starlighte asked. This is pretty normal for past behavior teams, and it drove people away. You look untrustworthy and incompetent when you can't even give the community a straight answer. Even something like \"Unfortunately, quite a bit of the inner workings of our systems are confidential, and if I were to talk about it I could lose my position.\" would be a more acceptable answer than that.\n\n2 - Embracing Orwellian safe spaces and political correctness. This was especially common during the rein of Lyte's behavior team. Here's another quote, again from Lyte's contemporary NeuroCat:\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Boqd81O0-upcoming-upgrades-to-chat-restrictions?comment=00070001\nTell me, how would you/do you justify this post? You really can't. Under Lyte, telling your jungler that he needs to gank more is effectively \"offending the jungler\" and worth a punishment. It doesn't matter how you tell him, what your wording is or how true the statement is. If the jungler says he's offended, then you're screwed. That is straight up Orwellian and that is the last thing you ever want to have in a video game, especially one where the entire game is based around two opposing teams competing on an objective based map. It's also how league has been since the end of season 3, to be absolutely honest.\n\n3 - Most importantly, set your own standards and adhere to them. One of the biggest factors that led to the Tribunal being a complete and utter failure is Riot's decision to allow the community to set the standard for the Tribunal with no checks or balances. For the longest time, you could be banned for practically anything because the community was so varied. I distinctly remember very heated debates on the old forums centered around what exactly constitutes \"verbal abuse\". Some people think the word \"Noob\" is as bad as a racial slur, while others don't mind cursing as long as it's not actively aimed at others in a malicious manner. This community is NOT altruistic, and as the ones running the game it is in fact Riot's responsibility to use the thumb of god and actually make a definite and defined code of conduct, and expect players to adhere to it. Honestly, one of the first things you can do to work towards that is to expect players to use the mute button that everyone has access to and just mute players who are being toxic themselves. You need checks and balances, you need a standard and you need a code of conduct to compare behavior to. The current summoners code is a vague joke with no real meaning behind it.\n\nIf you can accomplish these three things, then you might be able to salvage this game. You might bring back a good chunk of the lost player base, and you might breathe much needed life into the community. Fail to do these things, and League of Legends will go the route of S2Games \"Heroes of Newerth\". Oh and I should probably mention, Riot has failed for about 5 years straight at this. Most players have gotten pretty wise to how Riot works, so people are going to be highly critical of you and not trust you. This is something you are going to have an especially hard time earning since, as I've mentioned, we've had to deal with this for 5 years straight. You are going to have to accept and admit to these failures if you want to earn anyone's trust, and really show that you do intend to fix the problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-01-18T06:21:55.928+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> So you're the new behavior lead, replacing Lyte?\n\nNo no no.\n\nI'm the technical lead for the team.

Starlighte and Vermonster asked very good questions, and properly addressed the terrible answer given by NeuroCat. This is a wonderful example of what is NOT an attempt at transparency. You can claim all day that you are \"attempting to be transparent\" but that does not make your actions or your methods attempts at transparency. The claim alone is irrelevant, the actions are what determine it's validity.\n\nStarlighte first\n> [{quoted}](name=Starlighte,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Boqd81O0,comment-id=0018,timestamp=2015-09-15T20:10:32.445+0000)\n>\n> Let&#x27;s talk a bit more about this specifically. You&#x27;re saying, in an earlier response, that a player doesn&#x27;t simply have 4 strikes. If they show genuine improvement, and have a temporary lapse months or even years later, that Riot isn&#x27;t going to just pick up at whichever strike they left off at prior to reforming? So 2 chat restrictions in October 2015, won&#x27;t mean that if you start being negative in August 2016, you&#x27;ll get an instant suspension?\n\nNow NeuroCat\n> [{quoted}](name=Riot NeuroCat,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Boqd81O0,comment-id=00180000,timestamp=2015-09-15T20:15:58.849+0000)\n>\n> We&#x27;ll have systems in place to show appropriate consideration for players demonstrating long term, genuine reform.\n\nAnd finally Vermonster\n> [{quoted}](name=Vermonster,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Boqd81O0,comment-id=001800000001,timestamp=2015-09-17T00:55:03.339+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;ve said multiple times there will be a system in place but yet are vague and fail to describe any detail or time span on the system.  Care to enlighten us as to what this &quot;appropriate consideration&quot; is and what you consider &quot;long term, genuine reform&quot;.  Your responses haven&#x27;t really been helpful to understand what those mean.\n> \n> Also, has Riot ever considered that perhaps the reporting options and bans have actually made the game more toxic?  I started playing season 1 and had no issues with league having a toxic environment.  Its only continued to become more and more toxic in game as you increase the strictness of your punishments and made reporting a mainstream option.  When a team starts asking the other team to report a player for feeding after they maybe make a bad play, they don&#x27;t try and recover, often decided to just feed if they are getting reported anyways.  I see it over and over.  The toxic game environment is fed by your reporting and ban systems, and too often do I watch 2 or 3 players on my team or the other team (especially in ranked).  Team up on one player and all ask the other team to report them, or all say they are reporting that player and put that player into a complete rage.  Do those player ever get banned? The answer is no.  I have roughly 5 league accounts and from my oldest account to this account and through all the seasons I have seen how toxic the game actually is increase, while you claim your bans are causing the level of toxicity to decrease.  I don&#x27;t see it on any of my accounts which range from pre-lvl 30 to Silver to Gold to one i use only for ranked teams.  \n> \n> I will admit, I have been in every position of toxicity.  The one who causes players to go on tilt (and yet that player will get reported and I will get honors), the player who is harassed to no end by a group of teammates and is then reported after they ruined the game experience (it happens all the time, and you know that those responsible for making the game toxic get off scott free), and the silent bystander (90% of the time) who observes one or two teammates harass a player into a rage there that players game experience is ruined because maybe they took a position somebody else wanted, or made a mistake and gave first blood).\n> \n> I hate to rain on Riots parade, but I don&#x27;t think your systems have been working, and I don&#x27;t think this new system is going to work.  Its going to end with the players who are easily flustered by others being toxic perma banned.  And the players who are creating the toxic environment continuing to ruin games, and pray upon other players while receiving no punishment.  \n> \n> I&#x27;d love to hear what Riots view on this is, and whether you really think you&#x27;re banning the right players.  Because I can tell you first hand, the times I have gotten chat restrictions, and bans, I was not the one creating a toxic playing environment, and the times that I have been the one creating the toxic environment, I have received nothing but honor, and other teammates or players on other teams immediately joining in and harassing players who likely will then get reported.\n\nNone of these questions have anything to do with scripts. Answering these questions does not harm the functionality of your system or it's security. If you won't answer these questions, you are not attempting transparency. You are simply demonstrating the same passive aggressive methodology of previous behavior teams. If you want to claim to be attempting transparency, you can start by answering these questions.\n\n\n> Maybe you can tell me more about what you feel is inappropriate in the response. It&#x27;s sort of a &quot;treat others as you&#x27;d like to be treated&quot; comment.\n\nCertainly. \n1 - NeuroCat makes the claim that when you are talking with people over the internet they do not have the same context you do. That is already false, as you both have the same context within the game you are in. Context does not change between people in the same situation, only perception, but perception does not change the circumstances. \n2 - NeuroCat says \"What you see as 'constructive advice' may come across to others as mean or insulting.\". This is a logical fallacy because is insinuates that the advice is constructive or negative based on how the criticized perceives it. Take a match I played last night, we had a Fiddlesticks who repeatedly engaged the enemy Singed alone. He died every time he tried to do this, because singed is the single best counter to fiddle in the game (and because he was already ahead) and because Fiddle engaged him next to Singed's tower. I told him to stop engaging singed, to go farm and focus on other champs, I told him that singed was his direct counter, and that he was attacking him on singed's tower. I told him that all of these things put him at a massive disadvantage. Fiddle proceeded to get extremely offended that I didn't think he could fight singed and raged at everyone. Under NeuroCat's logic, Fiddle is in the right and I am in the wrong because my criticism, despite being \"Constructive\" is perceived by Fiddle as offensive regardless of circumstance surrounding it. It is impossible to deliver \"Constructive criticism\" under such a thought process because perception does not equal fact and anything can be considered offensive, especially because this process encourages players to engage in the thought process famously satirized in the Simpsons: \"Am I out of touch? No, I can't be to blame. It's the children who are wrong\".\n3 - NeuroCat says \"Properly framing feedback is a pretty useful skill not just in League, but in life.\" which is a loaded statement in the current situation. In real life, you are expected by your peers and co workers to pull your own weight. Properly framing feedback can be summed up in the phrase \"Don't curse at people\" however, in real life whether or not feedback is \"properly framed\" is determined by an unbiased and unattached third party. Properly framing feedback is then completely irrelevant in LoL since the one who determines what is \"properly framing feedback\" is the one being criticized.\n\nAll of these factors make this an inappropriate response to the question preceding it, which was Valenten asking: \"Silly question but how with the new system determine if a person actually deserves a chat restriction. Cause I've been reported for actually giving constructive advice but was reported for what I would assume is \"verbal abuse\". This is a valid question, what stops people from simply \"Being offended\" by valid criticism? What stops people from simply refusing to accept criticism and just assert that everyone else is wrong BECAUSE I am right? How does this system differentiate between someone actually being verbally abusive, and someone just not wanting to take the advice or criticism? This is a great question, and it got a vague, deceptive and inappropriate response.\n\n\n\n> The Tribunal had problems, but this was not one of them.

But if somebody is only used to that word in the context of aggressivity, they will see it as an insult nonetheless.\n\nNo, my issue is that the current system definition according to the current system is not set, making it change drastically based on the perception of the individual being criticized, lumps everything into the same level of alleged \"negativity\" and assumes that no one can be an adult. \nLet's look at your example, and then factor it into the way I view it. \"omfg buy some armor you fucking retards. Can't you morons see they're all AD?\". He could have worded it nicer, but I would say this is not ban worthy. It's not excessive, if someone doesn't like it they can mute him themselves and if they can see this anyway then they willingly disabled the language filter. The game is rated T for Teen, I expect people to be aware of that coming in. Is it constructive? Yes, if the enemy team is all AD then armor is invaluable. If the team is building magic resistance against an all AD team, they are making bad decisions. The subjective perception being there at all is WHY I have an issue with this, a MUCH better method proven by many, many different companies over the years doing it, would be for Riot to make a definitive and concrete list of things you can be banned for, and sticking to it. One of the most important things that keeps these companies communities strong is the company not infantalizing their communities. Allowing the perception of the accused to be the rule and not the exception does in fact create nothing than make the most powerful argument \"Well that offends me in particular\".\n\n> And here&#x27;s the thing: As frustrating as this might be to you, this is how communication works. Not online-communication, just communication in general. There is no objective truth when it comes to language, as all natural languages are ambiguous. As such pretty much everything is subject to interpretation... **especially** when it comes to whether or not something is insulting.\n\nThere is objective truth when it comes to language, in written or spoken. Sarcasm may be harder to grasp, because that is a communication tool that relies on emotion. When dealing with written communication, the problems only start when you start trying to perceive more than what is there. Take the examples \"Initiate please\" and \"INITIATE PLEASE\". These are distinctly different because one has emphasis and one does not. That is the only difference, they still mean the same thing. This is objective truth, subjectivity has to be injected by people trying to create or add meaning that was not there before.\n\n> It&#x27;s funny how you use that Simpsons quote and fail to apply it to yourself.

First, you are begging the question. You've provided the conclusion of the argument as a premise. You are not proving how I have \"failed to apply to it myself\" just claiming that is the sole argument. Second, you've used the bandwagon argument.

Agreeing with a bunch of people who are wrong does not change the fact that they are wrong. If they want to provide some evidence to support a claim such as \"At some point in the past, the colors \"Red\" and \"Green\" had their names switched, so what we have been calling \"Red\" is actually \"Green\" and vice versa\" then this would be a statement that can be objectively analyzed and researched. The problem is that you are ignoring evidence, I am not \"Insisting\" that I am right, I am \"proving\" that I am right. I provide evidence to support my claim, which IS in opposition to your claim, and you simply then use the argument \"well all my friends say you're wrong, so you're wrong\". Tell me, if my claim is \"jumping off the grand canyon will kill you\" and this is supported by the combination of factors including distance, velocity, and gravity resulting in your body being subjected to massive blunt force trauma, and the extremely hard and sharp rocky cliff face will rip, tear and penetrate your body on the way down, resulting in death, but a bunch of other people say \"You can't die jumping off the grand canyon\" are you going to ignore the various objective facts about the human body and believe them? You can ignore the evidence all you want, but I sincerely doubt you are going to go and jump off the grand canyon in real life. So, why are you jumping off the grand canyon intellectually?\n\n> \n> And thanks for supporting my argument indirectly with this bit:\n> \n> To me that answer is an absolutely fine answer to that question.

I don't know how you missed the WALL OF TEXT in the first place honestly.\n\n\"Certainly.\n1 - NeuroCat makes the claim that when you are talking with people over the internet they do not have the same context you do. That is already false, as you both have the same context within the game you are in. Context does not change between people in the same situation, only perception, but perception does not change the circumstances.\n2 - NeuroCat says \"What you see as 'constructive advice' may come across to others as mean or insulting.\". This is a logical fallacy because is insinuates that the advice is constructive or negative based on how the criticized perceives it. Take a match I played last night, we had a Fiddlesticks who repeatedly engaged the enemy Singed alone. He died every time he tried to do this, because singed is the single best counter to fiddle in the game (and because he was already ahead) and because Fiddle engaged him next to Singed's tower. I told him to stop engaging singed, to go farm and focus on other champs, I told him that singed was his direct counter, and that he was attacking him on singed's tower. I told him that all of these things put him at a massive disadvantage. Fiddle proceeded to get extremely offended that I didn't think he could fight singed and raged at everyone. Under NeuroCat's logic, Fiddle is in the right and I am in the wrong because my criticism, despite being \"Constructive\" is perceived by Fiddle as offensive regardless of circumstance surrounding it. It is impossible to deliver \"Constructive criticism\" under such a thought process because perception does not equal fact and anything can be considered offensive, especially because this process encourages players to engage in the thought process famously satirized in the Simpsons: \"Am I out of touch? No, I can't be to blame. It's the children who are wrong\".\n3 - NeuroCat says \"Properly framing feedback is a pretty useful skill not just in League, but in life.\" which is a loaded statement in the current situation. In real life, you are expected by your peers and co workers to pull your own weight. Properly framing feedback can be summed up in the phrase \"Don't curse at people\" however, in real life whether or not feedback is \"properly framed\" is determined by an unbiased and unattached third party. Properly framing feedback is then completely irrelevant in LoL since the one who determines what is \"properly framing feedback\" is the one being criticized.\n\nAll of these factors make this an inappropriate response to the question preceding it, which was Valenten asking: \"Silly question but how with the new system determine if a person actually deserves a chat restriction. Cause I've been reported for actually giving constructive advice but was reported for what I would assume is \"verbal abuse\". This is a valid question, what stops people from simply \"Being offended\" by valid criticism? What stops people from simply refusing to accept criticism and just assert that everyone else is wrong BECAUSE I am right? How does this system differentiate between someone actually being verbally abusive, and someone just not wanting to take the advice or criticism? This is a great question, and it got a vague, deceptive and inappropriate response.\"","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-01-21T06:28:41.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're just creating larger and larger walls of texts to divert from the simple argment I am making:\nLanguage is ambiguous. Period.\n\nThe fact that you can obviously not distinguish between words used to describe a concept and the concept itself is honestly a little bit scary.\n\nSo let's go back to the basics:\n\"I watched the man with the binoculars\" does **not** require a comma, regardless of the meaning.

Only **common** interpretation of words. And if you keep getting reported, then that points at your interpretation being the uncommon one.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Grandis","date":"2017-01-18T18:06:58.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now, I can assure you that the Tribunal was not accurate and was abused very commonly. I can demonstrate this easily.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal was officially stated by Riot on multiple occasions to be ENTIRELY community driven. Riot's policy was to not question or challenge Tribunal punishments, as they believed the community would ultimately use the Tribunal responsibly. This information is still publicly available on the Tribunal F.A.Q. page.\n\nSecond, Riot implemented a system to provide IP to players who used the Tribunal when they were on the WINNING side of a vote. This led to a massive problem where an overwhelming majority of players would simply vote \"punish\" on any and all Tribunal cases without reading or evaluating the subject matter within. There were in fact many players who justified this by saying \"If you got a report, you deserve the punishment. You wouldn't have been reported if you didn't deserve it\". and there were many other players who simply did not care about anything more than the extra IP they could get, because IP is still an extremely scarce commodity in LoL. This is easily proven true by the simple fact that there are NO checks and balances in place. Riot will not reverse ANY Tribunal outcome, this was their official stance, and there is nothing that stops, reprimands or punishes players for false reporting other players in this system. And factually speaking, hoping that players will \"do the right thing\" or demonstrate Altruism is in fact NOT a check or balance.\n\nThird, I will sadly have to demonstrate anecdotal evidence, at least until I can dig up my several year old post on the older forums. I distinctly remember this Tribunal case, because of how blatant an example of false reporting and abuse of the system it was. I was in fact the ONLY person who voted \"Pardon\" on this case as it was my last case of the week I could do, and the only one I did not get IP for. The result was overwhelming majority punish.\n\nIn this case, the reported player was reported in only four matches, and while nothing really ban worthy was in them one single match stood out (the 3rd one). \nIn that match, he was reported by a single member of the enemy team for \"Negative attitude\". \nThe enemy player's report stated \"was spamming the link (link) in the champion select preventing us from talking and then went AFK during the game and watched us fight. Link is highly inappropriate.\" and nothing else.\nThe reported player had a good score and only talked a few times in the chat log.\nThe player who reported him, on the other hand, was constantly cursing in all chat with caps lock, flaming his own team as well as the other team, and had an overwhelmingly negative score.\n\nNow several things should immediately stand out about this report. First, only one single enemy player reported this guy for something that was supposedly linked in pregame chat. This on it's own should prove this players innocence since the enemy team CANNOT see your pregame chat, pre game chat was never included in the Tribunal cases preventing anyone from confirming whether or not this really happened and only one person reported him. Beyond that, the reported player very clearly demonstrated exemplary standards of good behavior during this match, literally nothing he did in any way met the criteria for any of the 7 different report options. So why did the reviewers overwhelmingly voted punish? It was the subject matter in the link. \n\nWhen I clicked the link to see what it was, it led to a 48 second gif of a rather large man in bondage gear participating in an extreme example of \"Sounding\". For those who do not know, sounding is the act of inserting a large, metal rod into your penis for sexual gratification. The man in the gif was inserting a VERY long and thick metal rod very deep into his erect penis, and then drawing it out over 48 seconds. I came to the logical conclusion that most people clicked the link and, upon the shock of seeing the gif image, immediately voted punish without thinking about anything. I pointed this out on the forums by providing the tribunal case number and stated this case, I even directly linked it to Lyte himself. Sadly, nothing ever came of it, because Riot's policy was \"All Tribunal outcomes are final.\". I will try to find this old post it should still be on the forum archives.\n\nEdit: Found it. http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4270866","replies":[{"poster":"swordofsun","date":"2017-01-18T18:42:47.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reading the link that wasn't why the person was banned.

I'm actually kind of annoyed that the Tribunal is still down, I don't know if anyone can access old tribunal cases anymore even, Riot, so we can only see the discussion on the post. The issue I have is that the player hardly ever spoke, and nothing he said was excessive. Someone quoted something he said in game 2 which was:\nMorgana\t[00:24:31]\tGROUP ****IN ******* Instant Punish\n\nMorgana\t[00:28:42]\tomg you guys suck...\n\nMorgana\t[00:36:50]\tgaren get ****in carried ******. Instant punish\n\nWe can't see the curse words thanks to old forum rules, but we can make a very strong guess that \"****IN\" is supposed to be \"FUCKIN\" and by the number of *'s in the second word, I'd assume \"BITCHES\" (Assuming of course the number of dots corresponds to the number of letters in the word). You would have a very difficult time calling this \"Excessive\" or \"Overbearing\". You can easily make the claim of \"negativity\" since it's cursing, but again to that I point out that the only way you will see anything in game besides a series of *'s is if you willingly turned off the language filter, and if you honestly don't like three sentences someone said you CAN mute them. Of course, I am also drawing a very distinct difference in what is said here and, say, racial slurs or death threats. It is not just black and white, it must be measured appropriately on a scale. I am assuming that the people who play this game are for the most part at least 14 years old (T for Teen) and thus I assume that they are capable of understanding and controlling their own actions. I also know that the game is based around competition, specifically between two teams, and there WILL be a clear winner and a clear loser. I also understand that to encounter foul language, one has to willingly disable the language filter or actively refuse to mute other players. Because of this, I would say that racial slurs and death threats, or excessive amounts of targeted verbal assault are ban worthy. By the same token, I would say that this is not banworthy. I also think that chat muting and ban's should be different tiers of punishment for different levels of behavior, I personally would never \"BAN\" someone for language outside of extreme and repeated discriminatory language (Sex, race or religion) or threats of violence.\n\nEDIT: I have no idea why there are italics in that sentence.

Those were not nice sentences.  You can replace fuck with fudge and it&#x27;s still ban worthy.\n> \n\nYou aren't even adhering to your own standard that you just established. You've said \"Slurs are perma ban because slurs\". Yet then you said \"I don't have a problem with using fuck as an emphasis.\" and \"you can replace fuck with fudge and it's still ban worthy\". If slurs are slurs, and slurs are ban worthy because they are slurs, then the use of the word \"Fuck\" does not matter. It is a slur whether it is used as \"Fuck it\" or \"Fuck you\", and therefor it should always result in a ban if it is used. Meanwhile, if someone says \"Fudge\" that is not the word \"Fuck\" and thus should not ever be ban worthy, as it is not a slur. This is why your standard NEEDS TO BE WELL DEFINED AND LOGICAL, and not leave things to perception. Your standard should not falter and change on a whim. As I've pointed out repeatedly, there IS a language filter and there IS a mute button, which every player has access to at all times.\n\n\n> Just because you **can** mute someone doesn&#x27;t mean you **should have to**.  If someone is put in a situation where in order to play a game they have to mute another player, something has gone horribly wrong.  The mute function is how you get through the game, it&#x27;s not the solution.\n> \n\nThis is what you do not understand. The mute button is there so that YOU as a person with agency of your own has to use if you do not want to converse with or listen to another player, when that players actions are not out of line with what is allowable in the system. The same thing applies to the language filter. YOU have agency, if YOU disable the language filter you can see what they are typing, otherwise you get a bunch of asterisks (Thanks I couldn't for the life of me remember what it was called). This is why I am using the word \"Excess\" so much. It means \"an amount of something that is more than necessary, permitted, or desirable.\" So \"Excessive cursing or slurring\" is \"an amount of cursing or slurring that is more than necessary, permitted or desirable\". For that matter, the punishment should fit the crime. If you curse or slur excessively, a chat mute is more than enough of a punishment. You get 3 sentences of dialogue to type at the start of the game, gain another sentence every 4 minutes, and can only hold a maximum of 5 sentences. If you go beyond cursing or slurring excessively, such as using discriminatory insults (Race, Religion or Sex based) then it makes sense for a punishment of suspension or ban to be used. Honestly, this is a T rated game, you should assume you will see some language here. I'm all for keeping it civil and keeping sportsmanship, but most people would agree that you do NOT need to be G rated for it to be civil or keep sportsmanship. And it is the outliers of that opinion, the ones who want it to be continuously G rated, who are the loudest voices in this, but even their opinion is moot because there is no set standard or definition that currently exists.\n\n> It doesn&#x27;t matter how little they say or how well they play.  Harassment is harassment and shouldn&#x27;t be tolerated.  Especially when it&#x27;s clear that it&#x27;s not just an off game, but a pattern across games. \n\nThe definition of the word \"harassment\" is already at odds with your definition with your previous standard. Harassment is \"aggressive pressure or intimidation\" and under the very logic of harassment, it must interfere with your ability to play the game. This is why, again, I am using the word \"EXCESS\" so much. Excessive slurring or cursing can most certainly interfere with your ability to play the game just like spamming pings can interfere with your ability to play the game. While certainly harassment shouldn't be tolerated, do you think everyone who harasses other players in your definition of the word should be perma-banned? You said that you use the word \"Fuck\" for emphasis, well if someone reports you for this, shouldn't you be perma-banned under that same system? Or will it not apply to you? These are legitimate issues and questions that need to be asked when you are trying to use words like \"harassment\" or define a standard, otherwise literally anything becomes harassment as long as a person believes he has been harassed.\n\n> \n> Not to mention the logistics of enforcing some sort of rule by which saying X amount and getting X score meant you wouldn&#x27;t get punished.  \n\nIt's actually really easy to enforce a rule like this. It's called \"totality of the circumstances\". For example, I have had matches where one of our players gets angry at another, and then proceeds to run to a tower and die a few times. Even with his feeding, we dominate the enemy team, and let's assume he's 0-4 at this point. He manages to get a few kills and before we end the game he's 3-4. Would you still say he'd been feeding? Yes, I'd look at the Totality of the Circumstances surrounding his deaths. This requires a certain amount of human interaction, no AI could handle this, but it does in fact remove the issue.\n\n> \n> Agreed.

I mean just look at the 9 points on the Summoners Code\n\n1 - Support Your Team\n2 - Drive Constructive Feedback\n3 - Facilitate Civil Discussion\n4 - Enjoy Yourself, but not at Anyone Else's Expense\n5 - Build Relationships\n6 - Show Humility in Victory, and Grace in Defeat\n7 - Be Resolute, not Indignant\n8 - Leave No Newbie Behind!\n9 - Lead by Example\n\nthe only points you really need are 1, 4 and 9. Points 2, 3, 5 and 6 are all different aspects of point 4 \"Enjoy yourself, but not at Anyone Else's Expense\" Points 7 and 8 are simply aspects of Point 9 \"Lead by Example\" and point 1 \"Support your team\" is the only single point that really stands alone. Even if we make all 9 points separate as they are, the paragraphs explaining them is nothing but a bunch of sophistry. I mean look at this paragraph about point 3:\n\n\"Facilitate Civil Discussion - As we mentioned earlier, we want you to give feedback, but being part of the community doesn't stop there. Whether you're in chat, in a game, or on the forums, there are plenty of people to meet, and plenty of topics to discuss. Whether you're discussing game balance and champion viability, trying to form a premade team, or just want to express your affection for the legendary and infamous Gentleman Cho'gath, we encourage you to share your thoughts with other players.\nWhen you choose to participate in a discussion with the rest of the playerbase, always try to be receptive to another player's point of view. If you keep an open mind, you'd be surprised what valuable information you can glean from your fellow players. Also, be mindful of how you present your point of view. If a player feels strongly on a subject, don't get caught up trying to have the last word. Just state your side and exit the conversation gracefully rather than give them the opportunity to pick a fight.\"\n\nThis is so general that it hurts. It spends two whole paragraphs telling you \"be good\" but it doesn't tell you what it thinks \"being good\" entails. Does it want you to be responsible? Does it entail a zero tolerance policy on foul language? Does it want you to stand up to bullies, or does it think conflict in general is bad? This is not specified. When this isn't specified, you have different opinions from different people. This is normally a good thing, except whenever the power to ban or punish other players is held by the players themselves. Those with the lowest tolerance to different opinions often end up trying to censer or destroy the other opinions. They are the most likely to use the system, and the most frequent abusers of it.","replies":[{"poster":"swordofsun","date":"2017-01-19T14:20:26.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Say it with me: **Cursing in and of itself is not ban worthy.**  It is all in the context of how the curse word is used.

You've given examples for your standard, and they contradict each other. You cannot have your cake and eat it too, it does not work like that. If you say \"I am trying to help you\" while swinging a knife at someone, the behavior contradicts the statement. If someone else is trolling you, and I say to you \"Fuck him you're doing fine\" can you ban me? How about if someone else is trolling you and I say to him \"Fuck you mate, he's doing fine\"? These are two separate situations using a \"Slur\" which under your ruling would make both worthy of a perma ban. You've said the context should matter, well in both of these cases I'm standing up for you, but in one case I'm directly talking to the troll while in the other I'm supporting you directly. So, if we take context into account, shouldn't that make the \"Fuck him mate, you're doing fine\" NOT worthy of a ban? You have to DEFINE this in stone, otherwise both are true.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Grandis","date":"2017-01-18T18:28:56.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This points out, Mr or Ms. Tantram, that false reporting did in fact take place in the Tribunal, and the system of checks and balances either did not exist or was not effective at preventing abuse. Honestly, one big issue I've had since day one with it is the whole \"Community determines what's abusive\" thing. One of the most common reasons to report people is \"They said something rude\" or \"they said something I don't like\", which shouldn't be report able unless it is done in excess. Every player has a mute button available that allows them to mute any other player in any match, and they should be expected to use it. Beyond that, the language filter is by default turned on. If you can see people cursing and not a bunch of the * symbol, you turned off the language filter. I can understand reporting someone who is spouting racial slurs or death threats, but unless they are really going out of their way to hurt other people I see no reason that just clicking the mute button won't solve the problem. If they then start trying to interfere with you, by say trying to steal farm, feeding themselves, following you around and refusing to contribute or anything like that, then that's another reason to report them beyond \"verbal abuse\". I can never support a system that won't even set it's own standard.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KORGtuners","date":"2017-01-18T20:21:16.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The Tribunal had problems, but this was not one of them. **Believe it or not, the penalties were actually very accurate. The main problem the Tribunal had was throughput and time to resolution.\n**\n\nI have a couple of issues with that. \n\nI. In regards to \"_throughput and time to resolution_\". We are talking about humans. Every human deserves a fair trial. If the Tribunal could not keep up with the volume of trials, it is simply a lack of work force problem. \n\nWhy was there a lack of work force? Were the rewards not appealing enough? Was it an undesirable job? Me personally, I spammed \"pardon\". I don't remember getting any rewards. Seems to me, I would rather play a game than be a judge. \n\nII. In regards to \"_the penalties were actually very accurate. The main problem the Tribunal had was throughput_\". There is an imbalance here. The number of \"offended people\" overwhelms the number of \"judges\". Furthermore, we can say the number of \"offenders\" overwhelms the number of \"judges\". \n\nMy question would be, does the number of  \"offenders\" overwhelm the number of \"offended people\"? If your playerbase has more \"toxic\" people than \"good\", why would you discriminate against the majority of your playerbase?\n\nSome anecdotal evidence is the example of Diablo 2. They had a server called \"open b.net\". This was the same game, however, you were allowed to cheat. I had a friend IRL that played on this server, exclusively. In this way, Diablo 2 was able to satisfy both \"toxic\" and \"good\" people.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KORGtuners","date":"2017-01-18T04:26:46.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Sportsmanship is the main focus for us.
