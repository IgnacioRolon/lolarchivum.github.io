To further explain and give you an example as to why:\n\nIf there is a toxic player and they are saying the N word in every game in a derogatory sense to harass someone but only says it once in each game... (you only need to say it once to ruin a game experience) that's why people should be reported even if it has resolved during each game as apparently it only was said once.\n\nWe are not there to observe the behavior of the toxic person in every game. Riot can see them through the reports.","replies":[{"poster":"KORGtuners","date":"2017-01-04T00:15:42.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot can see them through mutes as well.

And once a player has been muted enough times they will receive a punishment. \n\nThen again, that wouldn't be much different from the current report system we already have.\n\nSometimes I run across people who are just annoying in chat. I mute them with no intention of reporting simply because I don't want to have to listen to them. And sometimes I come across players that are purposely trying to ruin the game experience for other players. They might be cheating, raging, or trolling. And for those I will report. Not because of some hate filled quest for revenge. But because I wouldn't want that behaviour to continue into other matches and affect other players. If they were just having a bad day and they don't normally act like that then  they probably won't get punished and I won't get bent out of shape because of it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Awkward Couch","date":"2017-01-03T21:27:39.109+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KORGtuners,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=OlTKQJWI,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-03T21:14:02.698+0000)\n>\n> It also has that pesky word &quot;resolve&quot;. \n> \n> So tell me, if the problem has been resolved, why should I escalate to reporting the person as well?\n\nBecause the issue my not be resolved, look at the SC again:\n\n#3 Facilitate civil discussion\n\n#4 Enjoy Yourself, but not at Anyone Else's Expense\n\nWhen it comes to toxicity, you're not obligated to report or not report someone.  If someone looses their cool but after a while regains their composure, sure that can be the end of it and no report would be given.  However, just because you mute someone, doesn't mean the problem will just go away.

The Summoners Code provides a \"guideline for exemplary gameplay behavior\". The code tells us that exemplary players solve the issue of toxicity in a specific way. First, they ask politely. Lastly, they mute. Reports are not mentioned in a guideline for exemplary players. So what is the reasoning for never mentioning the word \"report\" even once? Is it possible that exemplary players do not report toxic chat?\n\n> However, just because you mute someone, doesn't mean the problem will just go away. The person may flame another teammate\n\nWho are you to say what \"flaming\" is? That is for each individual to decide. \n\n> therefore is going to have a different level of tolerance for frustration\n\nAs far as you are concerned. Muting someone has stopped the abusive language. Not only towards you, but towards your teammates as well. Once you mute them, you do not see anything they say towards others. You would have to ask your teammates if said person is being abusive towards them. However, if that person was being abusive towards them, then they would mute as well.
