And while listening to a few of his quotes and looking at my alignment chart. After what I&#039;ve heard and thought of, even going in line with his background...It seems the Warwick we have today falls squarely under Chaotic Good. The descriptor from the part goes \n\n_Chaotic Good people have absolutely no regard for laws or social structures and will pursue what they think is right at any cost. Their lives are guided by what they think is right and good, and they have little time for those who see the world any differently. They&#039;re also willing to do bad things to bad people._\n\nGiven that and these select quotes directed to Champions and during movements and attacking...\n\n------------------------------\n\n{{champion:254}} &quot;Zaun needed you!&quot; ( Obvious resent for Vi leaving Zaun to rot )\n\n{{champion:245}}  &quot;The one person in Zaun who runs to the past!&quot; ( Obviously he resents Ekko for not trying to better Zaun in a more proactive way )\n\n--------------------------\n\n{{champion:19}} ( Attacking )\n&quot;If you die, how many live?&quot; ( The thought of &#039;One for the good of the many&#039; )\n&quot;The killing stops when Zaun is free&quot; ( Proof is in the pudding here guys )\n&quot;You hurt them, I hurt you&quot; ( His idea of &#039;Eye for an eye&#039; )\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n{{champion:19}} ( Bloodhunt Passive )\n\n&quot;Can&#039;t save you all...Don&#039;t want to&quot; ( My belief is that he struggles with the weight of trying to make Zaun a better place and falling into a murderous rampage )\n\n&quot;I became...Monster&quot; ( Part of his human mind still terrified of what he&#039;s become )\n&quot;In...control!&quot; ( Another part of his human mind that trys to wrestle control from &#039;The Beast&#039; )\n&quot;Try...Hide!&quot; ( My belief that his human mind is trying to tell his target to hide while &#039;The Beast&#039; is wanting a challenge, wanting them to try )\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n{{champion:19}} ( Movement )\n\n&quot;Zaun will watch you bleed, and it will do nothing&quot; ( Zaun, to Warwick, is a being capable of change, so much so that it won&#039;t try and help criminals if they&#039;re dying )\n\n&quot;Zaun will fight back!&quot; ( Leading back to Zaun being alive concept. Zaun wants to be clean and wants to be just as prosperous as Piltover or even Demacia )\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThrough this evidence, what Warwick tries to do for Zaun despite his appearance, I&#039;ve found that without a shadow of a doubt that Warwick _is_ another &quot;Hero&quot; of Zaun","replies":[{"poster":"Epicurus","date":"2017-04-11T06:48:49.246+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I disagree with Warwick being Chaotic Good. Here's why:\n\n> Their lives are guided by what they think is right and good,\n\nWarwick is guided by no such thing. He doesn't think his actions are the right thing to do. He doesn't justify his actions with the idea of one day achieving a peaceful future. He has no endgame.\n\nWarwick does not kill and maim people because he thinks it serves a good purpose. He kills people because that apparatus he wears on his back _forces_ him to. Killing is what he's made for, and he can't stop killing any more than a human can stop eating or drinking.\nHis only redemption is that he tries to aim himself towards those he thinks deserves it (other criminals) and he's not all too reliable at that.\n\nImagine a Zaun that had no criminals for Warwick to hunt. He wouldn't retire. He'd start killing any civilian who crossed his path, because death and violence is what he was made for.\n\n\nMaybe Warwick is lawful evil? A monster who limits himself to hunting other monsters.\nOr perhaps chaotic neutral?\nOr maybe characters like Warwick are too complex to be assigned a single label.\nI am unfamiliar with Pathfinder, but I thought I'd add my two pence.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2017-04-11T10:29:01.372+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well but he does try to aim his violent urges towards criminals,because he wants to do the right thing.\n\nYes the machine makes it hard for him to \"aim\" his actions,but that doesn't change the intention behind them.\n\nHe is like a DND werewolf who has not accepted the curse and whose alignment thus didn't change.He is basically chaotic good(or maybe neutral?)outside of battles and during his frenzies he is chaotic evil","replies":[{"poster":"A Yeti","date":"2017-04-11T15:12:19.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would seem that Warwick is of two minds so that is highly possible.

Warwick, to my belief, would have better knowledge who is inherently bad and who isn't. That's why he doesn't think of Piltover people as 'good' because they only serve themselves rather than their people, being only a byproduct to their own means.

But Warwick's need to kill is a chemical addiction, not a choice. Whether his victims are good or bad people doesn't factor into it. This is why I think he would attack civilians (and why he already has attacked civilians): the blood scent drives him mad, and eventually the human side of him can't hold the beast back.\n\n> Warwick, if Zaun was liberated from gangs, would probably wander Runeterra for the hunt of criminals, most likely finding his way to Noxus where he would either die or be broken as a Hound of War. \n\nI really like this idea. The human part of Warwick, realising he can no longer funnel his rage and hunger into the criminals of Zaun, just fleeing Zaun/Piltover entirely so he doesn't start running amok in the streets. I imagine he would only get worse in the wilderness with such long periods of isolation, but it would ultimately be a noble sacrifice on his part.\n\nBy the way, I really disagree with your comment about Camille and Caitlyn only serving their own needs, but I suppose that is a discussion for another thread.","replies":[{"poster":"A Yeti","date":"2017-04-11T14:38:37.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of Warwick's taunts to Caitlyn is\n\n\"You're so deep in piltovers pockets I can only see your hat\"\n\nCamille is more on the edge of No, but I heavily believe Caitlyn is corrupt in some manner no matter how she acts","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-04-11T15:05:47.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind though that this is from his perspective, not objective fact.","replies":[{"poster":"A Yeti","date":"2017-04-11T15:09:01.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking back on it and really thinking he could be just highly skeptical that any person of the law is good, after all he's still a Zaunite","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-04-11T15:53:51.859+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, did you read his long lore (bio + color story)?\n\nIt's rather explicitly said that Warwick *was* a good guy, but he is now almost completely controlled by the apparatus on his back.

While old WW would be definitely neutral evil, new WW is definitely chaotic good. He's obviously doing what he thinks is right with a good, selfless intention and doesn't give a damn about laws or codes. I'd probably say he's the best example of chaotic good we have right now. For reference, here are the chart of the champions I personally think best represent each type, it makes it easier put him on the CG slot when you compare him with an obvious chaotic neutral like Jinx (who just does what she wants without a care for laws nor if it's good or evil), or any of the evil ones.\n\n{{champion:86}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:19}} \n{{champion:67}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:222}} \n{{champion:30}} {{champion:41}}  {{champion:35}}","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2017-04-11T16:55:31.351+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say Jinx being chaotic neutral isn't that clear at all.\nAfter all causing destruction without a cause is generally considered evil as it still harms others,even if it doesn't inflict physical harm.\n\nSimilar one could say that Vayne falls more into the evil category as it looks more like she hunts dark magic users for her own enjoyment rather than to protect others and Akali probably falls more under lawful neutral,because as far as we know she does follow the teachings of the kinkou.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-11T18:53:58.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What defines neutral is that while they don't put it as a particularly high concern, they do have a moral compass.

The neutral alignment exists exactly because things aren't cut and dry binary. Somebody who kills for fun is evil, but somebody who steals for fun is neutral because while stealing is evil, it's not too evil. It's a scale after all, so we have to consider how far either way the action is.\n\n>But does she really only go after guilty people?Frey,the person who basically adopted Vayne,saved her life and taught her everything to hunt down others was killed by Vayne without any second thoughts.

She is so fanatical about her aversion to dark magicks that anyone who uses it is irrevocably guilty, and Vayne is 100% sure that Frey dealt with it, and willingly at that because she confessed so.

Someone who wants to kill and inflict pain and only uses the fact that the victims are criminals as an excuse would probably be evil. But while she is obviously enjoying the process, I do think her endgoal is definitely actually getting rid of dark magick users, otherwise she wouldn't be so strict about only doing it to people she knows for sure are guilty.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2017-04-11T23:13:35.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Limmie,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=HEVt0Xhb,comment-id=00020000000000000000,timestamp=2017-04-11T20:00:45.435+0000)\n>\n> That&#x27;s what makes her neutral and not good.
