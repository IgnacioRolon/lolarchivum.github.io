Browser works too. \r\n\r\nAt first I thought it was just a little issue that happened occasionally, but now it happens every game at LEAST 3-5 times. This is starting to really piss me off and annoy me, since this has now become a cause for me losing Ranked games since I DC in the middle of the fight or I'm splitting and about to start heading back to base when I get \"Attempting to Reconnect.\"\r\n\r\nA couple of my friends have been saying that other people have been having problems like this too, and that it happens when we drop just one packet in our connection to the Riot servers, after hearing this I can kind of see why my ping doesn't change when it happens, but seriously ONE PACKET?!\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows any fix to this, then please let me know, I am honestly sick and tired of this issue. \r\n(I am playing on a desktop and am using Wi-Fi since an Ethernet cord can't reach my room.)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-13T17:52:07.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network has been gradually weakening and has exasperated into a consistent issue.
