I'm not one of those \"flex doesn't count\" assholes. In the middle of last season for some reason I just found people were way more willing to work as a team to win, rather than the ME ME ME of solo q's and as a support main, that was a much better environment, till toward the end the season when the \"Oh it doesn't matter its just flex\" douchebags showed up in more and more numbers.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FullmuteAll play","date":"2018-02-04T04:07:48.131+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may work in high elo, in low elo nobody knows a shit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2018-02-03T20:32:46.160+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"A statement in the spirit of Captain Jack Sparrow ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"AtomicLovey","date":"2018-02-03T23:48:35.012+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"i am a new chick to gaming my husband games all the time and tired of fighting so i decided to start gaming and now I'm hooked but i hate losing!!!

Even if you play jungle or support, you need to learn wave manipulation. A REALLY important mechanic in League. Can't stress that enough.

Any advice is helpful :)\n\nI think i can help. first, you have to play a variety of champs to get the basic feel of the game ( try to find the ones you like best) and learn things like auto attack resets, jungle paths, and before long for the most trivial things your instincts will kick in and you can focus on other things.  if you want to main jungle, i highly suggest watching Virkayu.  ( I do play a lot of champs though, so if you're interested in any ones reply and ill see if i can help!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lios Ashenblade","date":"2018-02-04T04:50:25.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mechanics are just things you will learn over time, but honestly, and this sounds like shit talking, but just don't feed, I have been autofilled to lanes I do not regularly play, and as long as I just focus on not feeding, we do well lol, and use the frickin trinkets lol vision is a beautiful thing, and literally everyone on the team should buy at least 1 control ward at some point, if only to guard your back","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"theminiom","date":"2018-02-04T03:28:48.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was going to play thresh Mid  but then they banned Thresh So i played jayce not using my usual build.\n\nconsidering i usually play him full tank and this time i did full leathality i can confirm this works.","replies":[{"poster":"Tails9016","date":"2018-02-04T05:29:03.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw that post.\n\nWhy do you play him tank?","replies":[{"poster":"A girl Supp Main","date":"2018-02-04T08:00:58.820+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jayce can push homies away he is best tanker man.","replies":[]},{"poster":"theminiom","date":"2018-02-04T09:06:13.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tails9016,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=7buuXYju,comment-id=00090000,timestamp=2018-02-04T05:29:03.355+0000)\n>\n> I saw that post.\n> \n> Why do you play him tank?\n\nCorrection, I did Play him tank for a while, Full leathality is much better and will be my standard now.\nalso Most of my roster are tanks so \"stick with what you know\" may have been a reason.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Poolparty Sauron","date":"2018-02-03T19:26:08.176+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The Prophet himself!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SupperForPupper","date":"2018-02-04T20:18:41.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats how u play zed vs zed","replies":[]},{"poster":"AgeOfTheMage","date":"2018-02-03T22:41:12.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually too true, I always beat my friends in fighting games by playing people I barely know how to play! :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"13900 Essence","date":"2018-02-04T14:24:33.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmmm I got to plat by muting my monkey teammates and camping bot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ak521","date":"2018-02-04T12:57:18.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got stuck in bronze last season from 8 trolls and 2 afks in my placements.
