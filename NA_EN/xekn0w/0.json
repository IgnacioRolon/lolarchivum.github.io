Don't worry, nothing invasive or crude will be said from me. I respect you and your recent exploits on narrative threads, and I'm euphoric that communication right now is great.\n\nFeel free to skip the first section if you don't want to hear some random player's opinion on Ekko's lore. I'm giving you a free pass there, because while it's not terribly random and this thread is about it, I'm sure you're tired of it by now. I'm no professional here.\n\nFirst, the bad: I'm terribly disappointed in Ekko's lore. It's a summary, there is no story to his lore at all. So much of it could be expanded on, and I'm sad it wasn't. Experimenting with multi-dimensional probability? You mean there's a possibility that if he rewound something, there's always a chance it could happen differently if he doesn't shake things up? Chaos theory, perhaps? He's a prodigy, apparently, and an inventory. How did he invent his machine? How did he get his sword? How does he understand time travel, and how does he make it work? How did he shatter time? Did he shatter the main universe and turn it into a bunch of parallel universes with different branching tales (now *that* would explain the retcon, reminds me of DC)? And with the teases we hear in his taunts and lines, to Vi and Jinx in particular, saying there's not much of a way of a past is disappointing. Are those lines just flavor? I thought they were hinting at developments in Vi and Jinx lore in the future. :/\n\nNow, I do have a question in fact about what you said!\n\n>The future is a different matter.\n\nGreat use of words involving a time traveler, but is there anything you're allowed to share? The comic release a couple weeks ago was amazing, but will we get any form of lore outside of champion releases and teases to develop currently existing champions? If you can't answer that, totally fine. I'm just curious and wanted to tickle the sleeping dragon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darrosh Jewfist","date":"2015-05-31T05:10:04.018+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"But there doesn't seem be any conflict or tension between the three other than Zaun city pride and a ex-crush. It really seems like this is chapter 1 exposition - but time and time again we've failed to see any follow through or follow up.\n\nAnd this response also builds on the \"unknown past, unknown future.\" It's a problem because the lore is so open ended right now that these characters are less characters and more of trope-personalities-coolstuff slapped together and given a voice over and some art. There's no dynamic change in personality or struggle or conflict - at least one we can understand since we just don't know enough about them to care or understand.\n\nLike, what's happening with Freljord? It's been 2 years. Or Shurima. Or Shadow Isles... like, is the current strategy of pinning major lore releases to events, holidays and champ releases wise? It seems to be pretty unstable in timing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GenoXx","date":"2015-05-31T14:40:51.361+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then why would you hint that? I mean what's the point of giving a champion quotes to other champs? Seriously, It's no point.
