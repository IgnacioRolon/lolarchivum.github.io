Nor in quotes, nor in the lore. Thats why I am looking forward for official statement or a very good explanation what he is (political-society-thinking).\n\nIf either one of you can tell me why he is an anarchist and provide useful information or a rioter could tell me if they inteded him to be an anarchist or not would be really helpful!\n\nElse: What do you think about the lol world? Who are democrats? Who are not? What do you think where in lol is upmost freedom?\n\nThanks for helping :)","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2017-09-02T12:52:50.505+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"An anarchist is usually defined as a person who doesn't believe that any form of government is needed.\n\nAnd while Zed disagrees with some ideals of the kinkou and likely with the current leadership of ionia,there isn't really anything that makes it look like he believes in anarchy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-09-04T22:47:33.863+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"No.  He is, if anything, a hardline nationalist and federalist.","replies":[{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2017-09-05T13:11:27.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which makes total sense, considering he's pretty damn sure what he's doing is making Ionia not get its shit kicked in anytime Noxus gets bored lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"MooooooooreDakka","date":"2017-09-05T03:00:08.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you tell us anything about how Zed views Ionia as a country and/or the spirit realm, especially as compared to Shen?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-09-05T01:38:48.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see the \"nationalist\" part, but what do you mean exactly by \"federalist\"?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Epicurus","date":"2017-09-02T12:11:07.256+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So far as the lore has shown us, Ionia has no government or ruling class. People respect the authority of the Kinkou order concerning matters of magic and the spirit world, but for the most part the humans and Vastaya live peaceful lives guided by their cultural philosophies. The reason Ionia is not a state of chaos is because everyone there is so invested in harmony and balance.\n\nIn this way, isn't Ionia already an anarchy? Well I just did a quick Wikipedia search on those names you mentioned (I hadn't heard of them before so I am by no means an expert), and their philosophies seem to match the way of life in Ionia as I understand it.\n\nSo Zed would be an anarchist I suppose, but saying that is meaningless because everyone else in Ionia is technically an anarchist already.","replies":[{"poster":"SteelMankind","date":"2017-09-02T14:09:28.379+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought Ionia had some kind of elder council, with Karma being one of the members","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2017-09-02T12:38:42.546+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhm Ionia does have a government,as Jhins lore mentions ionias ruling council.\n\nhttp://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_GB/story/champion/jhin/","replies":[{"poster":"Epicurus","date":"2017-09-02T13:15:04.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If there is a council in charge of Ionia then I suspect it was incepted only recently, in response to the Noxian invasion (probably by Karma). Otherwise different sects in Ionia just seem to look after themselves.\n\nFrom the Universe page:\n> Its inhabitants, living in scattered settlements across this massive island continent, are a spiritual people who seek to live in harmony and balance with the world. There are many orders and sects across Ionia, each following their own (often conflicting) paths and ideals.\n\nTo me, this passage does not describe a united nation, but instead a land where dozens of small provinces exist independently.\nIn all of the Ionian lore we only hear about leaders who influence their own local homes, like Yasuo's elder, the Vastayan consul, and Karma's monks. If there are people who rule Ionia as a whole, surely we should have heard of them by now.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2017-09-02T13:40:44.969+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps the council consists of these individual rulers?\n\nAnd anyway,there'd be basically a lot smaller governments,so it wouldn't really be anarchy.","replies":[{"poster":"Epicurus","date":"2017-09-02T14:15:44.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe.

His biography about finding a shadow box and killing his master is old; some of might still be true but some of it might not. But we see a biased view of Zed in Jhin's, Kayns' and Xayah's. So we can only speculate what his motivations and philosophies are.\nPersonally I think Zed is a utilitarian who ultimately has good intentions. Judging by Kayn's story, the Order of Shadows seems invested n defending Ionia against Noxus, and I think his secession from the Kinkou happened because the Kinkou's ruling on harmony forbade him from taking a stand to defend his home.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"some degenerate","date":"2017-09-06T11:17:03.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except Ionia does have it share of rulers like the Council of Elders and the Shadow Cabals, and they aren't brimming with good intentions if Jhin's lore is anything to go by...\n\nIn all honesty, with Riot taking the newer lore into darker territory and with so many Ionian champions already having some morally questionable relationships and/or doubts with their country to begin with (Zed, Jhin, Yasuo and Syndra in particular) I wouldn't be surprised at all if their \"peaceful\" ways in the pursuit for \"balance\" is just a cover-up that their government & elite use to mask their true intentions, and it turns out they're just as evil and as malevolent as most of the other prominent Runeterran nations out there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Criomhthann","date":"2017-09-02T18:35:21.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you actually link Zed's philosophy to those dudes?
