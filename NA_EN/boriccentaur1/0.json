I see this used lot when people talk about stacking champions like veigar or recently with senna.\r\n\r\nPeople will say these champions get free ad and stuff WHEN IT'S THERE FUCKING PASSIVE it takes up a spot that would be replaced with something else. Not to mention they have to do stuff to get it. But people will act like they just have a gathering storm built into there kits while also having a passive.\r\n\r\nI also see this lot with pyke saying he gets free healing even though again it's his passive. If pyke didn't have that healing he would have a different type of defensive passive probably more unfun and if you took that away HE HAS NO PASSIVE and is shit then.\r\n\r\nNothing in league is free. If a champion has something it is taking up space in there kit that would be used for something else. They don't just randomly add passives to champions they add what they think the champion needs to not be shit. In cases like pyke his healing is a must or he is shit whereas akali's healing as unneeded because she can get healing from other sources making it too much but akali still needs healing which is why gunblade is a must.\r\n\r\nAlso the people that use \"free\" to describe champions abilities are usually just ranting about a specific type of champion like yas or pyke. You really never see this when people talk about cait it's just champions that are good in low elo and that snowball there.","replies":[]}
