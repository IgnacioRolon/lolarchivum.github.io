Anyways, Can we get some clarity as to why her eyes are surrounded by black? And the scar as well. I imagine the scar is just that, a scar, but maybe not. Anyways, is that the natural color of her skin around her eyes, or is that from something else. I don&#039;t imagine war paint, but it could be.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot c0ttonnz","date":"2019-01-21T21:03:56.822+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice observation.
