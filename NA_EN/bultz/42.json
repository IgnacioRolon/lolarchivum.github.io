Please just no.\n\nYasuo is incredibly boring to fight. Not that strong, but very \"he wins big or he loses big.\" What's the term for that? Feast-or-famine? A design that is widely considered terrible since it results in extreme snowballing and one-sided games?\n\nKalista is a balance black hole that is infuriating for EVERYONE, melee or not. Her infinite dashing and constant bunny-hopping like a mentally challenged kangaroo on speed is perhaps the single biggest mistake for any champion's kit so far. As a whole, she needs to be reworked to have that fixed. Maybe just let her abilities proc it instead of AAs and give her another offensive skillshot on her W.\n\nThresh is actually pretty alright since he has a huge skill expression and can easily be outplayed and outclassed. Ardent Censer users are crowding him out pretty well; he can only do so much to apply it himself. (i.e.: Has literally 1 ability on a huge cooldown that can apply it...To one person.)\n\nCertainlyT has always been a designer that puts his vision of a unique champion ahead of practically and balance. I've never liked his work, and Kalista's release affirmed him as my least favorite person on the Riot development team period. Uniqueness needs to meet practically at least halfway and CT has never quite grasped that concept, so we get stuff like Kalista that's over-designed, over-loaded, unbalanceable messes.\n\nWe need more Namis, Warwicks, and Rakans than we need more Yasuos, Kalistas, and Threshes.","replies":[{"poster":"zero356","date":"2017-09-04T19:31:05.816+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's more that he doesn't know when to stop nor how to add meaningful weakness\n\nIt's like\nCT: So I got this idea, and it's really cool\nRito: Ok, go on\nCT: Ooooooooh, and we can add this too\nRito: Ok\nCT: and this\nRito: Maybe you should stop\nCT: But what the other 5 things I was thinking about?\nRito: *Uggggggggggggggggh* Fine, go ahead\n\nAnd then\nPlayers: So what's Yasuo's weakness?\nCT: He's melee\nPlayers: Ok, but lots of champs are melee and he has plenty of ways of overcoming that (shield, mobility, threat).

He has proven several times that he doesn't have a problem with pushing the boundaries of what can be deemed acceptable/fair just for the sake of creating something unique (and that's not okay).\n\nFurthermore, the only reason why the Warwick rework was released in a decent state is because it was a much smaller rework than most of the other ones. When you fuck with less things, there's a better chance that you won't encounter too many problems down the road. Warwick's rework came out fine because they decided to leave the champion alone for the most part - not because CertainlyT is a particularly skilled designer. He's an asshole and he shouldn't be designing champions.

When you compare it to other reworks such as Sion, Galio and Urgot, you can easily see that the Warwick rework is far smaller in scope. His kit even plays similarly to the old Warwick as well.

The team who reworked Warwick might have intended to implement the rework on a large scale but the final result is something that was very similar to the previous version of the champion. I'm trying to get this point across to you but you just can't seem to put 2 and 2 together. I'm going to repeat myself now for the like the fifth time. Read this next part slowly and imagine that I'm speaking very slowly to you (because I assume that's the only way for you to understand things). The team who reworked Warwick might have set out to create something that felt similar in size to the other large reworks but it ended up being something very similar to how Warwick previously was and that's why the rework appears to be smaller than the others.
