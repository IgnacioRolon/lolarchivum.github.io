But I just can&#039;t enjoy these games anymore. I play a lot of AD squishy champions, like Yasuo. I love ad champions over the very simply put, point and click ap champions. Because let&#039;s be honest, they&#039;re not fun. They are on dimensional and have no need to have skill. I know people love playing them and that&#039;s fine too because that&#039;s what playing video games is about, playing what you love. But i think, from my experience, that ever since the rotating game modes started it has become very clear in the unbalance. \r\n\r\nBefore you hit the downvote button, please finish reading. All of these game modes have become so unfair. It has basically come down to being killed nearly instantly by Ap champions, or stunned to death by anyone with one. I have fought many games in these event modes and each time I think okay i have my opponent dead, I have outplayed them, I jumped them from the bush, used exhaust on them, ignited them, and I am ready for the kill. But what happens more than 90% of the time I play these modes? You have two options, you get 2 to 3 hit by nearly all ap champions, or you get stunned and then 2 to 3 hit. \r\n\r\nAp champions \r\n\r\nLet&#039;s address the ap champions portion first. In these modes nearly all AP champions are so boosted that it&#039;s criminal. Aside from ap items being able to go from 80-120 ap, the scaling on most ap champions is something I cringe at. Take a moment and imagine a Master Yi, or a Yasuo with 120 ad items. Makes you cringe don&#039;t it. So why is it okay for ap items to have them? Look at ap assassins, they do so much damage. And most of them are ad in skill type, so they have huge outplay potential. I mean I have never seen a game where an experienced Akali player hasn&#039;t been fed. and let&#039;s not even address Katrina who has a nearly 100% ban rate in all these modes. \r\n\r\nBut putting aside the fact that ap has a ton more damage, the boost they get in these games is crazy, I was fighting a Mord in a game and he literally two hit me in the early game phase. I got 1 hit by a veigar, he stunned three of us and literally 1 hit three people in hexakill. Same thing with Annie. Considering that most ad champions are late game champions, and most event mode games last under 20 minutes, it becomes rather stupid to play one. It&#039;s just really broken with the ap champions and makes me want to not play at all. \r\n\r\nStunning champions\r\n\r\nIn these game modes, nearly all these champions get a huge boost in power, but get no nerfs to their stun times. I mean i build 40% tenacity in the modes and it does nothing. By the time I&#039;m free from the stun, I have already been killed. There is no counter to it. Even with Quicksilver sash, an activate type item, having to activate it takes more time than it does for them to kill me. And on top of that, it doesn&#039;t debuff all stun, silences, knock up, knock backs, exp. Take Jax for example, he&#039;s fairly broken as is, but in these modes, he is even more so. He stuns you and that&#039;s that you&#039;re dead because by the time you are free there is no outplay chance. Most attack speed champions are broken, and in these games even more so. Jax, Xin, trynd, etc. \r\n\r\nThere isn&#039;t even tenacity in the games, i once built it up to 50% i think in urf mode and i was still stunned to death. There is no chance for a late game, squishy champion, like Yasuo in these modes. I have practiced playing Yasuo for years and have 650k exp with him. I play and out play a lot of people  from having played so long with him. But in these modes the unbalance is so hard core. There isn&#039;t time for outplays, people who are new to their champions, like annie, just out kit and outbalance you.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver all\r\n\r\nI know the modes are meant to be unbalanced, but every mode is unbalanced for the same champions over and over. Imagine If Yasuo suddenly became unbalanced in these mode and his ap build was viable again. How quickly do you think they would nerf that? So why is it so okay for ap champions to still be so op. Katrina has nearly 100% ban rate in these games. Why? because who wants to face someone who is ap with such a mobile kit? no one. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know, but After playing for years on the rift, actually being a decent player, who took the time to learn on champions very well, I just don&#039;t enjoy the game modes anymore. It would be one thing for them to be balanced for one champion in one mode, and another in a different one, but I constantly find the same champions are being picked, over and over, because they are so unbalanced and broken in them does. I just can&#039;t enjoy it. There is no outplay time or potential in these modes, it just comes down to click and point champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-26T08:42:02.477+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1:  You diss targeted skills and talk about outplaying your opponent then say you exhaust + ignite someone as you jump from a bush.\n\n2: AP champs have high AP items and ratios because they don't get 100% AP ratio on EVERY SINGLE AUTO.

Once you play someone who doesn't half ass know their champions, they become op. Trynd, Jax, Xin, I've seen them beat people in 5v1 with pure attack speed. And they were unfed.\n\n> Stopped reading past this point, as you seem to just be complaining about Yasuo not being ideal for these game-modes.

I'm here fighting Garen's, who can literally spin all game with their cd. Karthus who spams the snot out of people, Broken Malzahar, etc. But Yasuo only gets a cd on his W?

I know him better than any other champion, and being squishy I know when someone hits harder than they normally do. It's  a very important thing to know as a Yasuo. Because you are so squishy you have to know every champions max output of damage at their current level and stat. So when I'm being one hit at level three, by champions i know could never one hit anyone until fed, I see a problem with it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2016-06-26T14:12:19.378+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sounds to me like you just don't enjoy urf.

It would be one thing for some champions to be good on one mode and others to be good on other modes, but that's not how it is at all. It's always the same broken champions being played on every game mode. Every game mode is just ap champions running around basically getting pentas. Why is Katrina banned nearly 100% of the time? because she is balanced? She is broken in every mode. The same thing for many other champions. Champions like Yasuo get shat on by them in every mode. I can't enjoy basically any mode.
