Running away isn&#x27;t counterplay, counterbuilding isn&#x27;t counterplay, so is counterplay being able to directly manfight and win the manfight? Is it standing your ground successfully against anything? Where is the line?\n\nEverything under your control can be considered counterplay.  There will always be an upsurge of complaints on various champions about \"no counterplay\" such as Lee Sin, Yasuo, etc., however most of these champions require a specific set of circumstances (or being VERY fed) to be able to \"legit no counterplay\" you (RIP Rush, pls come back).\n\nI encourage everyone to check out Faker's dodging to see tons of counterplay with pure simple mechanics and reaction:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LGbSyxa_jA\n\nEven Karthus' R has counterplay as it requires a long channel time and gives people time to prepare for it.  If it was an instant-cast with no wind-up, there would be no opportunity to counterplay it.  While a lot of champions (Illaoi, Karthus, etc.) generally can be seen as an \"unfun\" way of playing against as the counterplay is to literally run away from them at certain times, that is what is required to survive and actually have an opportunity to use your abilities.  It's a similar trope to separating from a Fiddlesticks' E (or Brand R) when it is bouncing between you and your allies.  These type of abilities create an effective \"zone\" in which you are required to play around in order to survive, lest you take massive damage.  This creates a lot of pressure in an already high-pressure environment where positioning is key.  If Brand pushes R on your Tank and the ADC is the only target nearby them chasing targets down, they are in for a bad time.  The Tank probably won't think anything of it, as he's gotten a massive cooldown burned from the enemy mage, but the ADC positioned themselves in a spot that allows for a swift death.  This is part of the reason the whole \"ADCin2k17LUL\" meme came from, as a small positional error will lead to an instant grey screen.\n\nThat being said, there are champions that almost REQUIRE you to build a certain way to deal with them.  Malzahar and Warwick essentially guarantee the ADC will build a QSS as Mikael's doesn't remove Suppression.  This is absolutely counterplay, regardless of what people want to believe.  It requires you to activate an item ON REACTION to save your life.  This also leads to sinking gold into an item that may or may not be useful to them stat-wise, but will ultimately save their life and devastate the enemy team who likely put themselves in a poor position to make the play happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2017-04-16T23:39:17.803+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"So essentially, counterplay is what I think it is, and the Boards is pretty much just using the term wrong? \n\nAlright, good. I thought I was going crazy or something because \"Lee has no counterplay!\" and the truth is that maybe you're in a situation in which you have no counterplay, but for most of the game he does, in fact, have counterplay. Those situations wherein you lack counterplay, though? That can happen against, well, almost anyone. Stunned by an enemy and Sion starts charging his Slam over your head? Unless you have Flash up and he mistimes his Q so he doesn't connect just before the stun fades away, you have no counterplay to that. Or if you're stunned and Sion charges you and leads that into a slam. Again, no counterplay on your end unless you have a way to cleanse stuns and a quick mobility option available. And that's freaking Sion giving you no option for counterplay in this scenario by capitalizing on a CC. Sometimes, counterplay is simply not available to you, and it sucks, but it's the nature of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2017-04-17T05:27:47.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"from what i saw on that video it looks like faker players on a very fast internet connection and uses movement speed runes. some of those dodges would be impossible without 350 movement  or better and 10ms or less.","replies":[{"poster":"TFBaam","date":"2017-04-17T15:03:56.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"korea itself has at most 10 ms. that is a big reason ezreal is played so much there, a few ms here and there can and will fuck you over on him.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2017-04-17T19:39:22.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, but have you seen those new league of legend style theaters? those would significantly improve local game play here in the states depending on how those are ran.\n\ni hope other companies decide to make a few of those for quite a few pvp games. that'd be pretty sweet and a new age of arcades could be born from it.\n\ni play on a shaky 40 ms ping myself. some people cant tell the difference of 1 ms or 5 ms, but a lot of players can. i can for the most part. my eyes are starting to go bad though so i dont know how long i will be able to detect those changes.\n\nhaving more than 3 buttons on your mouse probably helps a lot too since there are about 14 keys that need to be pressed and only 5-6 are in instant reach.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2017-04-17T09:43:15.604+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Anidan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ofJr0l06,comment-id=0000000000000001,timestamp=2017-04-16T21:33:37.377+0000)\n>\n> ...
