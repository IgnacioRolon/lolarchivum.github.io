I've reported it with the bug tool multiple times.  It's getting very frustrating.  My screen will also randomly black out maybe once per game for about 3-4 seconds.  I'm tired of reporting and re-reporting it every time.  I'm temporarily boycotting spending money on riot points until this issue is resolved.  It's making the game really unenjoyable and your teammates never understand why I'm just standing still for a few seconds during a team fight.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"monsterpizza7","date":"2017-07-13T05:35:25.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my problem is that when i'm in the loading screen, everything is black except the summoner names and spells and icons, the black screen only goes away just as i'm getting into the game, please help me, someone XD thx.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saturnalia9","date":"2017-06-22T17:20:01.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Porocles, I have a nagging suspicion that it has to do with the VS event that's going on right now...

I'm glad those workarounds worked, but it's only temporary.  I'd like us to get a more permanent solution worked out for now.  When you get a chance, run a repair through the client or the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to fix up any potentially bad files causing this.
