Some people may like it, but having 4000 hp with a tankier build and only getting like 25-40 extra ap doesn&#039;t sit well. I know the idea was to allow him to build less bursty items and draw out more tank items, but it&#039;s not working well. Passives like jax, Yasuo, and a few others work well and almost act like a spell, but build a ton of hp for such little ap isn&#039;t pleasing.\r\n\r\nI mean if you build properly with Vlad you get 100-250 ap because you need a shit ton of movement speed, cool down, and hp, leaving no room for damage. And to only get 25 or so extra ap from his passive is not satisfying. If his ap stacked or something okay, but it doesn&#039;t, so buildings hp means less damage and that is very bad when you have a good chance of being bursted into dust by adc, other mages, melee champions like jax, Darius and Yasuo,. I mean Vlad counters tanks well, but no one is bringing tanks too lane because it&#039;s a poor meta now and they are being replaced by Quinn and other adc and such.\r\n\r\nA better passive would do wonders for him. Like maybe a bleed, or spawn bats, or reveal the location of near by enemies like in blood moon, or really anything. Before you hate the idea, give it some thought considering he is so easily beaten and countered these days.","replies":[{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2017-03-03T18:23:59.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The good part of his passive is he gets HP for building AP.

I said the good part is he GETS HP when he BUILDS AP. \nA Vlad with 600 AP is getting +840HP, and THIS is quite good actually, it's worth 2240 gold.\nAlso NO veigar never ever won 5 permanent ap for each minion kill, it's for champion kill or assist.\nPlus veigar has no built in sustain, no +12% damages for the whole team, no built in zonia ...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JustJayson","date":"2017-03-03T19:19:58.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vlad seems balanced at the moment, his sustain is nicely balanced with his damage  output. Playing with his passive ratios  would drastically change his viability. I kind of like the fact you can build full tank on him if your team needs that and stay relevant.
