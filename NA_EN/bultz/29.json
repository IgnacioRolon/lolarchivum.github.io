Easily denied farm. Can't activate his skill shots without a target to hit first. Can't use ultimate without knock ups. Heavily based on players skill and not utility of the kit.

Yasuo's kit is designed around completely denying his opponent's agency. Unless you're lucky enough to counterpick Yasuo with a hard counter, proper use of his kit gives him complete control over the lane to the point where you can't do anything against him but wait for him to mess up. That's exactly the problem with Yasuo.
