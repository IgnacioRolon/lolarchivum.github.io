Its less AD/TD but a better build path(Pickax instead of two BF swords is SO much better) and cheaper(by like a decent chunk of gold); it will be a weaker item but it will feel less problematic for ADC's to build and the lowering of True Damage will also mean Tanks might have an opportunity to come back. :) The less crit chance is also a buff; it means you can cleanly get 100% crit off of two zeal items now without any over cap, especially since they lowered the cost of the items in general. At worse, this is a net neutral, which I will take. It'll make playing ADC's and their build paths feel far less punishing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drakath2002","date":"2018-07-18T23:27:16.732+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sitting here suffocating from the pile of MR items bruisers and Assassins buy to shut down our \"stupid busted damage\"\n{{item:3139}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3194}} \n\nAnd in fact AD items that also offer survivability in general\n{{item:3812}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3026}} \n\nI'm not saying Crit Marksmen deserve more nerfs but if you think AP needs nerfs boy you are looking at the wrong games....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-07-18T23:58:05.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually a buff since the items are cheaper","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2018-07-18T23:17:59.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The items are being made more affordable.
