Braum is played top so is blitz and so is alistar, though alistar is mostly mid.  You build either full tank on braum or full ap on blitz and alister and they shit on you will damage. It's none meta, but strong so good mains of these will bust your ass.\n\n2. Because he's new and most people can't play him. He is actually a busted champion, but because people will only play him as a support no one will ever learn how and will accept the low win rate a support usually gets..","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-05-23T21:33:41.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Their meta roles are supports.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Redesignated","date":"2017-05-23T23:28:43.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

I've looked at some Rakan players who are considered \"Rakan Masters\", and there's a trend. They're playing with a Xayah when they win, or they're playing in an uneven game when they win(one challenger on both sides with the other side having one master and 3 D1 and D2 players while their side has one challenger and all master players as one of the examples). There are some other occasions where they're playing with a Lucian and they win or someone else carries hard. Most of the games though they're all equal in kills(aside from Rakan cuz he's a support) with Rakan having like 11 or so assists, so I wouldn't say it was particularly Rakan who carried the game because of how OP he was, again, unless he's with a Xayah. These are master players btw.\n\nThe problem is how much he depends on Xayah to be as useful as he could, while Xayah doesn't depend on Rakan to be useful at all. This needs to be changed. Lover's Leap is a useful enough ability for them both, they don't need his E to be DOUBLE the range when dashing to Xayah, he needs a little more room to dash to other champions. They should change his E to where it's about 75% or 80% range for all champions with Xayah having no range buff imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jpguy902","date":"2017-05-23T21:39:35.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they just made his heal work off jg camps, he'd be a really fun jungler, imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"One Ashe On","date":"2017-05-23T21:10:37.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rakan kit is strongly straight foward, he have 2 strong engage tool and is pretty mobile.
