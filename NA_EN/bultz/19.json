There should have been like level 1 wind boi, level 2 wind boi, 3, and 4 as well. Like a lot of leaguers have mains. I come here just to play a samurai dude. I don't get to in TFT. Tier 1 wind boi is weak, tier 5 is monstrous. They don't combine into each other, but they can offer a same champion bonus if you collect all the wind bois or something. Seeing tier 5 champions 15 minutes into a game and never being able to level them into 2 star or 3 star is lame.","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-07-17T19:24:53.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The different tiers are critical for keeping some synergies from maxing out early.  If everyone could get Karthus on the first 3 minion stages, for example, everyone would rush phantom and have it by stage 2.  It would likewise be easy to have 6 nobles at level 6, rather than having to wait until late game to have that opportunity.\n\nIt's fine how it is.","replies":[]}]}
