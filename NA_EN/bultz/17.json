All i&#039;m getting is 4 man team pre mades and i&#039;m sick as shit of it. They refuse to mia, ping of any kind, you don&#039;t get any ganks, and when you ask for it they all tell you to fuck yourself. Can we please get a report pre made team feature. I don&#039;t fucking even want to be with or against a 4 or 5 pre made team. That&#039;s why i&#039;m fucking solo queueing. I mean how many games do you guys expect me to keep my cool with these fucking pre mades. And when i get to fucking raging and get in trouble I&#039;m to blame. I&#039;m a fucking person too, how long do you expect me to deal with these shit situations happening every game basically.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-09T02:56:12.572+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your attitude is great evidence as to why a group of premade players wants nothing to do with you.\nMaybe realize you are the problem, shape up, stop blaming them, and people will be more inclined to help you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Its LiuKang","date":"2016-08-09T03:11:39.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a problem along the lines of this today, all for one, we were winning pretty well then at some point past 20 min mark pre-made decides to ff we lose.
