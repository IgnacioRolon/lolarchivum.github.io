Champions like Malphite and tahm are doing too much damage for their class, tanks should tank. Juggernauts should not be allowed to be a class, that is why top is a shit hole. Pyke has been toxic for months and I said he was and got flamed for it and now everyone sees it. All this just leads to champions winning games and not the players. I had a Kayle troll in my game last night who feed on purpose just so she could show off and comeback to win it in minutes.
