It&#039;s created a ton more. One team gets one or more broken champions and shits on the other team, nothing to it. Like why can mundo heal so damn much. Why can kog do so much damage. The only thing that will fix this issue is going to be to nerf them in the urf modes. Like, look at poor poor Kassadin. His ult does 200 damage max. That&#039;s less the ahri&#039;s sphere attacks and charms. and it has a longer cool down as well. SO why nerf champions like him, but make it okay for others to be just as, if not more, oppressive. Nerf them all. that is the only way to fix this issue. You can&#039;t force people to play champions then get shat on because ezreal is a uncatchable spambot. It&#039;s not fair. Nerf them, don&#039;t give us some bullshit random mode.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-26T04:27:56.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or just chill and have fun.\n\nJust about any champion can be good in this, if you think outside the box and adapt your strategies.

Try Fizz or Kayle being present since the former has near infinite troll poll and his W lets him just constantly % burn you if he can't take you down in a instant by using his Q which applies on hit bonus damage, his R to throw out almost before or after that and then likely troll poll you soon as you 'get out of it' to just repeat the cycle again with his Q.\n\nKayle on the other hand will rip apart towers fast and can use her constant W spam and low CD R to keep her from being ruined by someone coming to chase her usually giving her the edge to shred you down with rage blade already built up from striking a turret. Making her hard to trade with her unless you can disengage from her long enough for the ultm to go down then rush her with a super nuke.\n\nBut one of the best sweet counters to these rofl'stomp type of URF mode champions i've went up against is Kindred, especially since her Q also gains +5 base damage per stack now so its pretty easy for my lovely jungle Waifu to snowball kill into some insane damage stacks with her passive giving 1.25% current hp kill per stack and piling up fast with her Q reseting the autos and dishing out damage too, even much faster with her W on. Since she can basically 'orb strut' thanks to her Q's mini 'leap' letting her able to stick to running enemy champions pretty fast and damage them at the same time. Bonus points too if you get so used to it you can dodge skill shots with it too.\n\nHell Kindred's ultimate is the major icing on the cake since by it negating damage taken entirely, it can shut down Kayle's, Fizz and pretty much any ultimate with a telegraph timing just long enough for kindred to quickly resume damage chaining if done right, if your opponent didn't get stupid enough to run out of it and let you finish them off, because otherwise they basically get forced to stick inside it which can lead to your team mates being ready to join in on the massacre to the enemy champion.\n\nOtherwise some of the more annoying types are URF type champions who can go nuts like Zed who can make use of his W shadow to Q spam you even under the turret so your constantly busy dodging and then have to run even further back to have a chance to recall. Kennen might be another good example since you would have to imagine even with his 'diminished stun duration' that is also being hit by tenacity, he would likely be able to keep you under a constant spasm of stuns since he would be able to fire off his Q shuriken and W that auto hits all enemies already marked so he could constantly keep you under a damage repetition by stunning you, firing off Q to remark, W again then again and repeat. \n\nSadly i havent been able to 'test it out' though, it would be nice at times if there was a custom game modes to 'play' URF (aka no rewards) so we could test out what other champions that could be 'OP' in URF but never have a chance to properly test to avoid salt rage from team mates or the limited time schedule we usually have on the weekly game modes.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-09-26T05:44:13.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its just like normals -not important.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Milodic Mellodi","date":"2016-09-26T05:25:55.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*****Flaming Incoming*****","replies":[]}]}
