His could sustain his mana in lane nearly infinitely if he wanted.  Gaining his stacks with Q -  They changed it for what ever reason, (only riot knows) - to this \"touch someone gain AP\"  - \n\nI agree that his new passive makes him annoying as hell - however, it would not be so bad if his AP ratios were low - but they are not - nor is he a \"glass cannon\" outright, you can build him that way and execute anyone with the high skill level R push.\n\nHis Q - does between 70-230 damage + 60% total AP  (not just bonus)\nHis W - 100 - 300 + 100% total AP - and gets a passive 10% reduced CD per 50 stacks\nHis E - is about 1/3 a lane in area (have not measured exactly) \nR - 175-325+75% total AP - increased by targets % missing HP up to 100% at 33% or less. \n\nIn my eyes - his R should be a skill shot not a point and click, (imagine if {{champion:6}} ulti always connected - did that kind of damage - and he could just kill you if he desired - people would flip) \n(So for reference Urgot R is 100-350 +50% **bonus **AD only , not total) \n                     His E should be a smaller area\n                     and his ratios should be dipped to about 1/2 - or 3/4 what they are -\n\nHe would still scale well into mid/late game - he would still destroy Late late game, and he could still pretty much deal true dmg with a {{item:3135}}  later game. \n\nbut of course I am not Riot - these are just opinions","replies":[]},{"poster":"Last LP2 Player","date":"2020-02-17T06:19:11.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=lmakehersquirtle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6szpLnuG,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-29T06:55:50.538+0000)\n>\n> Yeah because the fact that Veigar is a glass cannon and can get blown up in a matter of seconds means nothing.

He also has built in sustain with lifesteal and can 1shot people with his Q, he doesnt need a combo. On top of that he has a ultimate that increases his health and armor and magic resist (the latter 2 of 3 are with enemies nearby i believe) making him even harder to kill. If veigar misses that stun which is actually VERY easy since it only stuns on the outside, he can be effectively kited even within his own stun box.\n\nOh wait, i know what is going to come next \"nasus slow just use quicksilver sash\" guess what?!? Veigar stun can be removed with quicksilver sash as well.  Veigar ultimate can also be wasted by using Zhonyas, talk about countered by items. Nasus just runs up to you and starts whailing on you with his Q that for every hit he has a passive 10% of its damage returned to him as heal not including the boost from visage...... And wait a second, nasus can Q towers as well every 1-2 seconds? But here, lets just complain that veigar can hit his delayed attacks on you because you cant dodge to save your life and dont know how to use a quicksilver sash/zhonyas.\n\nThat ap boost for the squishy veigar that once his stun is down is easy pickings if you just dodge the falling dark matter. You want an ez counter for him? Play ap blitz mid. That is if you can hit your skill shot. Late game you can burst for about 2.5k damage at least, more than enough for all but the tankiest of veigars and he will be unable to cast any skills to save his life.\n\nIts funny how you only said nasus was the one that makes the arguement invalid, sion, thresh, and kindred are the ones i would have personally mentioned to try to kill the commentary with because they were just added in because they also had infinate scaling.\n\nYou dont want to fight any of them late game, its really that simple. Any of them can and will kill you with ease and have no qualms about it. The main one you should worry about is that constant split pushing Nasus that you need your whole team for because he really cant just be outplayed by one or two people very easily even with Quicksilver sash being used.
