He is easily killed by anyone an inch away having 0 ways to counter it or defend himself. I mean you can't give a champion such a huge and obvious weakness. He needs to be ahead the whole game to be useful, but because he is so easily destroyed he never reaches late game on time to be effective. He does no damage. His Stars are super slow with no way of speeding them up.  Etc.
