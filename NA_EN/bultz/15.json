Also his kit countering a lot of champions doesn't mean he is broken, just that he counters a lot of people. Garen building a crit/as build in his new meta leaves him to be destroyed. Darius can't get free kills on Sett because Sett's W counters his bleed. A champion meant to be in the middle of the fight will always have a high winrate or be unusable. It is a damage Meta, either you can fight through it or you get instantly popped which is what is about to happen with this W nerf.\n\n> Which honestly is no wonder if you look at his kit.\n> Like you said, he can semi deal with ADCs. Because his ultimate grants him access to the enemy backline while also weaponizing the enemy frontline for it (dealing more damage to all enemies the more health the primary target has).\n\nWhich he can only do with his W as is.

Him having backline access doesn't mean much if he is going to be kitted and die the second he gets in there. I have tried every build I could on Sett on pbe and live and he isn't darius, him building tanky doesn't do shit for him like it does for Darius.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2020-01-30T00:55:57.924+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bultz,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AbqBeEaB,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2020-01-29T20:53:28.971+0000)\n>\n> That is the dumbest shit I have read in ages. \n\nDo you not read your own posts?","replies":[{"poster":"Bultz","date":"2020-01-30T23:11:59.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NemeBro,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AbqBeEaB,comment-id=000300000001,timestamp=2020-01-30T00:55:57.924+0000)\n>\n> Do you not read your own posts?\n\nYeah and your's was still dumber.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HorseProofBacon","date":"2020-01-29T23:53:19.442+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't we all just read a week ago that Sett was perfectly balanced and not OP at all, now he's OP and being nerfed? \n\nRoit Pls!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-01-29T21:14:47.925+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Sett is completely broken with a winrate through the roof, far beyond any ADC.\n\nYes, there was a bug.

You are taking statics that don't apply to all champions equally and stating them to me as facts. A low win rate on a high mechanical champion like Yasuo or Vayne is always supposed to be low. a 50% win rate on them would be unbalanced. But a champion who is simple with a 49-51% win rate, though high, like Garen who has a simple kit is balanced. Your statistics mean nothing. Absolutely nothing, They don't equate across all champions and are tainted with popularity and favoritism. Why does Yasuo have a high pick rate even with low win rate at times? Because Yasuo is popular, no matter what win rate. You whole argument is off of flawed data so stop presenting it like there isn't more than balance behind those numbers.
