Think about that a moment. \nSustained. \nBurst. \nAn ADC with a 100% crit build will DO THE SAME OR SLIGHTLY LESS alpha damage than a THOUSAND AP BURST MAGE over TEN SECONDS. Thats about two rotations depending on the champion. \n\nArmor is meant to defend against sustained physical damage, not sustained burst.","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2017-03-03T08:42:34.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are you talking about crit?","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2017-03-03T08:45:46.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dynikus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UcH2R21v,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2017-03-03T08:42:34.649+0000)\n>\n> Why are you talking about crit?\n\nRanting mostly.\nMost lethality builds still include at least 50% crit though, and when comparing armor to MR... MR is just a better stat because it does its job. Lethality ADCs are strong because they burst squishies,. have good itemization, and can melt tanks due to sustained burst depending on when in their build they buy crit.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"sobi999","date":"2017-03-03T16:38:29.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the issue you see. The sustained burst comes from AA which items can also reduce unlike mages that have CD issues and also mostly rely on Skill shots that can be dodged unlike AA's. Not to mention lifesteal with all this allows adc's to live longer than mages and hence why lethality has been so dominant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-03T08:46:16.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Armor counters lethality, wth are you on about? Lethality only works against targets with low armor, it's useless against armored targets. \n\nSeriously, the whole point of changing the stat's name to \"lethality\" was because \"armor penetration\" was misleading, and people still think you build lethality against armor instead of the other way around.\n\nWhat counters armor is {{item:3071}} {{item:3035}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3033}} , or % armor penetration/reduction. Flat armor penetration, or lethality, is so you can deal close to deal damage against squishies, not tanks.
