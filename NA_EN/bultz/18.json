By contrast, Fighters (like Vi or Darius) can take a moderate beating as they dish out their own damage, but lack the agility of a Slayer. But what happens if a Slayer gains the tankiness of a Fighter?&quot;\r\n\r\nlolol Yasuo is actually a fighter/assassin. Not a slayer. It&#039;s even under his character bio, that is first trait is a fighter, and has been since release, but ignoring that, Darius nor Vi do damage? lol What fucking world are you living in Riot. lol Darius takes a beating, but does noooo damage.....right. Okayyyyyyyy.  {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \r\n\r\nDarius alone does more damage then all of these &quot;Slayers&quot; put together. That and build with {{item:3044}}  and {{item:3742}}  and{{item:3047}}  on him and he is much more mobile and tankier than them all. Darius does no damage....Fucking OKAY Riot. \r\n\r\n&quot;Tank Yasuo happens. While lacking the explosive offense of a crit build.&quot;\r\n\r\nMaybe stop nerfing {{item:3087}}  and {{item:3031}}  because of you break adc and let Yasuo keep his core build so he doesn&#039;t have to build tank. Or maybe actually put affective tenacity in the game so he doesn&#039;t need to build tanky so he isn&#039;t one shot late game by actually broken champions. Or even possibly stop breaking items and making Yasuo Pay for your mistakes.\r\n\r\n&quot;Tank Yasuo&#039;s damage and mobility remain above average due to his kit, while his items grant him the durability he normally lacks.&quot;\r\nWe&rsquo;re looking to break up the trifecta and force Yasuo to commit to just a few strengths (instead of all of them). Defensive builds will retain their stickiness, but see a sharp drop in damage. We&rsquo;re happy when players adapt their styles to the needs of the game, but when Yasuo (like Ekko and Fizz before him) can cover his weaknesses without making tradeoffs, it&rsquo;s not a fair experience for anyone.&quot;\r\n\r\nOHHhhh lets take about fair. Lets fucking talk about it. Where the fuck was this &quot;fair experience&quot; when Yasuo had the lowest win rate in game. Where was it when he was literally banned because people playing him fed to hard. Where was this when he was crap for season after season. Where was this &quot;fair&quot; when Yasuo was shat on after the adc update, or the juggernaut update, or the mage update? Fucking fair....Okaaaaaaay Riot. \r\n\r\nMaybe don&#039;t break items and call champions broken because of your mistakes. OR nerf core builds and hope no one fking cares. Fucking Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2016-09-07T20:39:01.900+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \"By contrast, Fighters (like Vi or Darius) can take a moderate beating as they dish out their own damage, \"\n\nhow do you quote this and still think Riot said they do no damage?\n\nAnd you are using 1 wrong to justify another wrong/ Just because Yasuo was in a bad spot before doesn't mean it's ok for him to be in the spot he is now. You have literally on decent argument. But hey, you have a lot of salt","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-07T20:38:23.620+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nowhere did riot say that fighters do not do significant damage. Maybe check your reading comprehension before writing walls of nonsense?\n\nDarius is, incidentally, very easy to kite, unless you try to faceroll him and then turn and run at 25% hp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThugWalrus","date":"2016-09-07T21:33:49.534+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you read? Nowhere in the patch notes does it say they do no damage. It says \"they can take a moderate beating while dishing out their own damage\" and then says \"but lack the agility of a slayer.\" It you're going to argue Darius with a phage and DMP is as mobile as Yasuo we might as well stop talking now because you're clearly not capable of advanced cognitive function. Riot is saying Tankiness + mobility + damage is not fair. Darius = Tankiness + Damage - Mobility. Yasuo = Tankiness + Damage + Mobility. See the difference?\n\nYou also clearly have no idea about the internal classes of this game. There are numerous sub-categories to describe each major category. For example fighters have the sub-classes juggernauts, slayers and divers, Mages have sub-classes such as burst mages or battle mages, Tanks have vanguards and wardens etc. The patch notes might be a little poorly worded on this one, so I guess it's understandable.\n\nYour second rant about \"fairness\" is asinine. By your logic because Yasuo had times where he sucked he deserves to be broken for the rest of eternity? Ok, better revert those Gangplank nerfs because he sucked for like 2 seasons before his rework, therefore he needs at least 2 seasons of being busted. If you're going to whine, at least be constructive about it, don't just ramble because you're salty your main got nerfed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"takeZOOOOOO","date":"2016-09-07T20:42:21.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"darius alone does more damage then all these slayers \" EXACTLY LOL also its funny how they mentioned yasuo and fiora's defensive ability mean while fiora's riposte blocks LITERALLY ever single thing in the game then there's yasuo's windwall doesnt block most of the elements that force you to build tank, like a full a armor moakai running at you or a malphite ulting you or any of those stupid tanks that do more damage then damage dealers but build tanky so they are pretty much freelo lmafo","replies":[{"poster":"Serevas","date":"2016-09-07T20:50:51.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiora's riposte doesn't block the base laser.\n\nIn all seriousness all this nerf means is you need to have critical strike in your build again. Just adapt the build. {{item:3031}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3022}} a heavy armor item, a solid MR item, and boots to fit your build appropriately. You keep the stickiness, increase the damage, lose a little tankiness in group scenarios, but gain tankiness in 1v1 scenarios.","replies":[{"poster":"takeZOOOOOO","date":"2016-09-07T20:54:46.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"doesnt block base laser hahah good one yeh dude people will always find ways to make stuff work ill be experimenting alot with random shit","replies":[{"poster":"Serevas","date":"2016-09-07T21:00:13.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing I dislike is that it means the build path will probably be more expensive as far as the build I'm thinking of is concerned as you're literally adding another core item.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
