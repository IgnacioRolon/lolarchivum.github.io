Every event mode, the same champions. Every game, the same fuckign champions. Lux, Morgana, Veigar, Brand, you name it. How is it fucking fair they can stun us and completely counter us, but we can&#039;t do shit about it? All Of the fucking tenacity in game doesn&#039;t help or do shit. QSS is useless when you have cancers such as veigar and Brand who literally stun you, and even when you use qss, you are dead before it takes effect.\r\n\r\nYou give us 35% tenacity, maybe 41% if you use masteries, but it doesn&#039;t do shit. You have fights that last 1 second. Literally 1 fucking second, yet they can stun you for much much longer. Like how is it fair at fucking all? You nerf Yasuo so he can&#039;t tank, but give us no viable tenacity or counter to the stuns. Clease is useless, so is qss, so are merc treads. Like Veigar can stun you, and literally kit you before the stun is up and you are dead, especially late game. \r\n\r\nWtf do you want from fucking us. We can&#039;t get near adcs, most have CC. We can&#039;t get near mages. We can&#039;t get near most tanks, nor supports. So wtf do you want? we can&#039;t tank, can&#039;t have tenacity, you buff all the other cancers in game, and pretend it doesn&#039;t happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-09-13T01:59:43.259+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://67.media.tumblr.com/8bcd6722e248f867f258fdacb0a23b7f/tumblr_inline_nwwf73xSaz1r3okh8_400.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-09-13T02:38:02.339+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"give us back Tank Yasuo\"\n\nYour entire argument is now invalid and dismissed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2016-09-13T02:36:09.970+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo isn't meant to tank, he is a squishy assassin that has high damage.

All of those champions cc are slow moving projectiles. And morgs ulti has a leash range.  As yasuo you have access to windwall and his dash which makes it very easy to dodge/completely negate their cc.  \n\nYou can do shit about it, git gud.\n\nEDIT: Veigar cc isnt a projectile but his main dmg sources of q and ulti can be blocked by windwall and w is so easy to avoid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ExHentai","date":"2016-09-13T02:09:55.722+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MewtwoRisen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TbP7blsL,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-09-13T01:52:00.456+0000)\n>\n> Every game, the same fuckign champions.\n\nYou complain about all these things and somehow its OK for Yasuo to be in every game if he isn't banned?","replies":[]},{"poster":"XinCrin","date":"2016-09-13T03:02:57.225+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do have something called a QSS in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2016-09-13T03:01:52.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh oh, looks like someone got tilted over something that isn't really a problem at all.\n\nTsk tsk.
