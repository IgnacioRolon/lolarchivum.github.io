In lanes where it's required to have mobility over damage, you'll still take E, and overall, it'll likely keep being the main thing to max. But with proper runes, you can go Q and, while not fully able to make up the damage lost on the E, you'll gain more reliable damage, since it's obviously up much more often.","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2017-01-15T02:23:44.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but that's going to mainly be in me lee matchups, where you need to stat check more than outplay.\n\nIn midlane/ranged matchups, I doubt anyone will be maxin q, just due to how much you need fast gapclosers in said lanes","replies":[{"poster":"Reposer","date":"2017-01-15T19:48:58.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well yeah, but that's why I stated top lane as opposed to mid lane.

Finally, we&#x27;d also like to make Q max a little more attractive\n\nThen wouldn't it be best by making maxing his Q be a more desirable option? \nTherefore making people want to max Q because it's the better choice and not because his other abilities aren't as good.\n\nLet's start with Q:\nThe base damage on Yasuo's Q doesn't increase all that much per level, a measly 20 damage per rank, and the cooldown decreases based on attack speed, meaning by building your crit and damage, you get some CDR to go along with it.\n\nAt level 18, Yasuo only needs a little less than 70% bonus attack speed to reach the lowest cooldown possible on his Q, Phantom Dancer gives more than his attack speed growth total at level 18, meaning that he a fair amount of it's cooldown gone with one item. This brings his Q down to a 22~% CDR, and that's excluding his attack speed growth by the time he gets it.\n^ _didn't do exact math here_\n\nSo why would I max an ability for 20 extra damage and... yeah... that's it\n\nDon't forget the 175% damage on crits\n\n**TL;DR**, Yasuo gets too much out of his Q at rank 1, therefore has no need to max it first. \n\nNow his E:\nHis E is a dash with a low cooldown per dash, but a high cooldown on single target dashing. Honestly this is a genius way of balancing it, as it makes it great in some circumstances, and not so great to just use in others.\n\nBut his E, despite this damage nerf, is still strong. Maxing E allows greater mobility, increased mix damage, and integrates well with his Q. Not to mention it works in conjunction with his passive and charges it as distance traveled. Not to mention it's got a lower cooldown allowing for more reliable last hitting, and dodging a skill shot in a trade or fight can make a huge difference in the outcome.\n\n**TL;DR** Maxing his E does more for him than his Q\n\n-------\n\n\nPerhaps by giving his Q a higher CD at rank 1 then lowering to where it is now by leveling it up would give Yasuo's incentive to put points into it.\n\nHis Q is his main damaging tool. and having smaller windows of opportunity may just balance it out well enough that Yasuo players have to choose between mobility and a consistent damage source.\n\nI don't want to see my champion get nerfed into the ground by going at this the wrong way, and I personally believe the problem should be addressed directly at the reason why he doesn't _**need**_ to max Q first. \n\n\n\nP.S: If you hate Yasuo, pick {{champion:58}}, E W Q auto E(away) and you win the trade, if he keeps trying to trade with you, he'll be overextended as he tries to dash to catch up to you. Ward properly, and play somewhat safe till you hit 6 and you'll be golden.\n\nI hate {{champion:58}} >.>\n--------\nP.S.S:\nI'm sick of this \"omg who didnt ban yas\" followed by \"gg\" and want my champion to be more healthy so I can enjoy my champion more without seeing \"OP Champ GG\" every game. I've even had my own team ban Yasuo on me because I was red side's first pick.\n\nNot joking, I've seen variations of this too many times, including some dodgers, afks (thanks remake for not making me have to sit through a 4v5), flamers (thanks mute button for obvious reasons), and more since about the middle of summer.\n\nIn fact, I just had a game the other day with a mid Akali who wanted to ban and not wanting to fight a Yasuo and I just sat there like \"Why? You dominate that match-up so long as soon as you hit level 6\".\n\nNOW LET'S PLAY THE GAME \"How many times did I make a mistake in here?\"\nLet me know and I'll fix / change / answer / whatever as soon as I can.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Negrodamuss","date":"2017-01-18T18:34:49.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since I'm pretty sure you deleted my last post, ill keep this one concise.  Yasuo isn't even a top 5 pick in top or mid based on any metrics.  His winrate decreases the higher elo you get which should be considered the sign for a healthy champion (i.e. the more you understand how the counter him the easier it is to win against him).  Ziggs is currently a glaring problem in the game as he is easily both top 5 in both the marksman and mid lane role.  Why not just give Ziggs a small nerf this patch and see if you need to adjust further from there, instead of worrying about reddit posts about yasuo.

And even if you somehow make It viable to max q and abuse certain matchups because eventually you're going to nerf every other champion down to yasuo's new level, its going to feel even worse when some bronze kid in a melee matchup is getting q poke abused and doesn't know how to handle it.  Yasuo is not even top 5 in either of the solo lanes by any metric you want to look at.  Stop worrying about appealing to low elo players and find a way to stop ziggs (easily top 3 in mid lane and also top 2 at marksman) from destroying solo queue.  Also fix the towers so that either bot lane turret also gets protection in the first couple minutes or that the protection is removed from all other towers too.  Every high plat/low diamond game I play is more or less over in the first 15 minutes based on whose team's bot lane gets ganked by the junglers and roaming mid laners.
