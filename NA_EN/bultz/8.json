The aspects/targonians/Pantheon subdued the Star Forger, not the shurimans. The targonians are the ones that use this magic, and if you read Diana's story there was no sun disc involved with her gaining powers. Targonians are probably a very strong race with magical powers of their own, they are the only race in Runeterra that are able to travel universes. **Aspects** are diana, leona, pantheon, taric, etc. **Ascended** are Azir, Renekton, Xerath, Nasus.\n\nYes, they do worship Aurelion Sol. Maybe not the ascended, but the shurimans sure do. The ascended do respect the sun disc as they had to EARN the ascension, and there's a community of elders who protect/study the disc. It's not just \"some tool\". Read the quote I just said.

It was literally shown in Azir's trailer how Ascended are made. Skip to 1:50\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYyuH1Bp2ZI&t=78s\n\nShurima and Mt. Targon are separate places, you're combining both of the stories. Aurelion's color story is based on him flying over Azir's failed ascension. Also Xerath stands NO chance against Aurelion. At the height of xerath's power he destroyed Shurima, that's pretty strong. Sol creates universes and destroys planets.

When I said ''which is a thing that subdued even the Star Forger'', I wanted to say magic is a universal power that even can subdue a super powerful being. Magic is so strong, it even surpass power of the sun. So they're transformed by a power tool, in other say, magic.\n\nYou can be sure that I know the difference between Aspects and Ascended really well. \n\nYes, Sun Disc is a tool. It is a tool that combines magic and cosmic energy. No one transforms to demigods just because of sunlight. It is clearly mentioned as a magical ritual.\n\nXerath has never been at the height of his power, ever. It was power of the twisted ritual that destroyed Shurima, not Xerath.  Xerath actually fought against Renekton and Nasus in his weakest level as Ascended anyway. No experience on his arcane magic, no experience on his new body, limited by sarcophagus.","replies":[{"poster":"YouCantClickThis","date":"2017-01-19T18:00:52.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Xerath has never been at the height of his power, ever.

I agree Aurelion is susceptible to magic, but you have to remember that he had to be tricked into it, it's not like they were able to go toe-to-toe with him. Also, the people that use this magic are also able to create demigods to service them, Targonians arent some scrubs. Also, the magic doesn't really hold him back, it's the fact that it destroys his stars that aurelion views as children if he disobeys. So it's not like he's being physically restrained by their magic, it's like a magical blackmail, i suppose. \n\nThat's exactly my point. How can Xerath's power exceed the power of the twisted ritual? His power comes from the twisted ritual. I call it the height of his power because the explosion was literally a release of all of the sun disc's power since it was depleted afterwards, and he gained all of that. I don't see how Xerath, even with his knowledge of magic, can become exceptionally more powerful then what created him. Sure, his knowledge of magic he might be able to become slightly stronger. Like you said, 2 ascended beings brought him down, weak or not, he was able to be taken down. Aurelion would never lose to 2 ascended even as a baby dragon. \n\n>Yes, Sun Disc is a tool.

If it doesn't focus on sunlight then can u explain what happened to azir in the video lol. ","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
