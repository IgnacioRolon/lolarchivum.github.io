Everytime it's you complaining about ''x champion is OP plz nerf'' when the rest can clearly see this is a l2p issue. Fiddle and most champions that you are talking about are balanced and even in a weak state. Just because you can't deal with them does not mean they're OP. Just learn to counter them and they're really easy to beat them, which is why they need buffs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-03-21T20:32:50.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Fiddle needing this buff aside, I think he is up for a kit rework but not because it's overpowered.\n\nBut because it's rather boring (except the ult).\n\nTwo of his three abilities are point-and-click while the third is a point-click-praytotheRNG. Riot was trying to avoid the praying aspect by adding the \"dark wind prioritizes targets that are being drained\" bit, but I don't think it's enough.\n\nRiot has shown that they're systematically changing point-and-click kits to something more interactive with many of their reworks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MissingKayo","date":"2017-03-21T19:52:33.952+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"The fuck is this joke post?","replies":[]},{"poster":"YoungFarmer","date":"2017-03-21T19:54:03.245+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"Fiddle sticks is not even good right now lol he needs buffs","replies":[]},{"poster":"SilentBomber","date":"2017-03-21T19:47:58.585+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"Sorry,but i agree with his buffs for one reason only.We will be able to see him in jungle more that trolling and feeding hard on mid like i have seen many times.","replies":[]}]}
