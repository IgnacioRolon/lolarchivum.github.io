Meanwhile, {{champion:107}} will appear and start destroying cities until {{champion:245}} (who is secretly {{champion:122}} 's son) shows up from the future to help defeat him. A little later, {{champion:154}} will be confronted by {{champion:121}} who will then inform him he is an android clone from the future created from the DNA of {{champion:154}} , {{champion:122}} , {{champion:64}} , {{champion:266}} , {{champion:31}} , and a few others. {{champion:154}} then tricks {{champion:121}} into explaining that he has to absorb {{champion:107}} to reach his perfect form. After a fight, {{champion:121}} will escape and spam stealth while absorbing as many people as possible to grow his power. Later on, {{champion:245}} ,{{champion:64}} ,{{champion:154}} ,{{champion:161}} , and {{champion:5}} will discover a way to destroy {{champion:107}} before {{champion:121}} can absorb him and become an unstoppable monster. Just as things finally seem to be looking up, {{champion:107}} appears at {{champion:11}}  's house to destroy the heroes. However, {{champion:107}} is cocky and agrees to fly far away to do battle with {{champion:154}} one on one. During the fight, {{champion:121}} appears and attacks them both. {{champion:154}} and {{champion:107}} briefly team up, as everyone has been feeding {{champion:121}} really hard. However, it doesn't matter and {{champion:121}} easily defeats {{champion:154}} and absorbs {{champion:107}} , evolving his claws afterward (his wings were evolved prior to his first appearance). It is then revealed that there is also a female {{champion:107}} and no one has noticed until now. Five hours of {{champion:161}} and {{champion:86}} (who has been traveling with {{champion:107}} and {{champion:107}} this whole time and briefly did battle with {{champion:121}} ) screaming at the female {{champion:107}} to run pass before {{champion:86}} finally grabs her and runs while {{champion:161}} spams {{item:3078}} (his special attack) to hold off {{champion:121}} , who has now apparently killed {{champion:154}} . {{champion:121}} chases after them before briefly encountering {{champion:62}} (who has been suffering from a heart disease until now, which is why he has no icon), who retrieves {{champion:154}} 's body and returns to the pregame lobby with the rest of the heroes, with the exception of {{champion:64}} who must track down and destroy the female {{champion:107}} before {{champion:121}} can absorb her. While he does that, {{champion:122}} and {{champion:245}} decide to play on the Korean server with 5,000 ping to increase their power. {{champion:64}} finally finds {{champion:86}} and the female {{champion:107}} , but is seemingly late as {{champion:121}} soon appears as well. Normally, {{champion:64}} would be able to destroy {{champion:107}} easily, but he is thirsty as hell and noticed she has \"berry\" in her summoner name, so he instead just stands there asking her to add him after the game. All hope seems to be lost when {{champion:122}} and {{champion:245}} arrive and easily best the semi-evolved {{champion:121}} . Just as {{champion:122}} is about to shut down him down, {{champion:121}} makes a deal that if {{champion:122}} allows him to absorb the female {{champion:107}} , {{champion:122}} will get to see his true power. {{champion:122}} agrees out of arrogance, much to the displeasure of his son, {{champion:245}} . {{champion:121}} then pursues the female {{champion:107}} , while {{champion:122}} stops {{champion:245}} from interfering. {{champion:121}} finally absorbs the female {{champion:107}} , evolving his spikes and reaching his perfect form. {{champion:121}} then stands there punching the air for five minutes before one shotting {{champion:64}} at light speed. Everyone then starts to report {{champion:122}} for throwing the game. {{champion:122}} , however, assures his team that he will still carry. {{champion:122}} then gets dumpstered. The whole time, {{champion:245}} just keeps screaming \"FATHER\". {{champion:121}} then beats the heroes' asses for a few minutes. {{champion:122}} , on his last leg, channels all of his energy into one final sever downing attack that seriously damages {{champion:121}} . Unfortunately, the heroes soon remember that {{champion:121}} was created from the DNA of {{champion:154}} , who has been stacking {{item:3083}} for years. Because of this, {{champion:121}} instantly regenerates. After trashing {{champion:122}} again, {{champion:121}} decides to host a competition where he will battle all of the heroes, who only have a few days to prepare. While {{champion:62}} , {{champion:64}} , {{champion:5}} , {{champion:161}} , {{champion:122}} , {{champion:245}} , {{champion:81}} , and {{champion:154}} (who apparently survived) train, {{champion:121}} creates the Proving Grounds to hold his competition. Meanwhile, {{champion:122}} and {{champion:245}} take their sweet ass time training in Korea at 10,000 ping while {{champion:62}} and {{champion:81}} wait for their turn. Back at the Proving Grounds, Riot shows up to nerf {{champion:121}} , but they are easily destroyed. As {{champion:122}} and {{champion:245}} leave the Korean server, {{champion:62}} notices that {{champion:245}} has become much stronger than {{champion:122}} , but is hiding it because {{champion:122}} is a whiny son of a bitch who likes to talk about how hard he's carrying all the time. In Korea at 10,000 ping, {{champion:81}} finally reaches Gold V. Finally, when all of the training is complete, {{champion:122}} , {{champion:245}} , {{champion:86}} , {{champion:64}} , {{champion:161}} , {{champion:81}} , {{champion:62}} , {{champion:154}} , and even {{champion:5}} for some reason show up to the tournament. {{champion:121}} 1v1s {{champion:62}} and it seems to be even at first, until {{champion:62}} suddenly stops and says he gives up, then gives {{champion:121}} one of their only {{item:2010}} . Everyone starts to report {{champion:62}} for assisting the enemy team, when he assures them that {{champion:81}} will be able to defeat {{champion:121}} . {{champion:81}} get his ass kicked for a couple minutes and then {{champion:121}} uses his {{item:3512}} to spawn voidlings that attack the heroes. The whole time {{champion:121}} is brutally flaming {{champion:81}} and telling him to uninstall. After a few minutes of this, {{champion:81}} becomes enraged and beats the female {{champion:107}} out of {{champion:121}} , causing him to lose his evolved spikes. {{champion:81}} then easily bests {{champion:121}} . However, {{champion:121}} is a sore loser and prepares to DDOS everyone, including himself. {{champion:62}} sacrifices his own computer to take the brunt of the DDOS and is killed along with {{champion:121}} . Just as everyone begins the bittersweet celebration, {{champion:121}} returns with all of his evolutions, including his ult. He explains that he actually had so many {{item:3083}} that he regenerated from a single cell, and because he was dead for a few moments, he was able to buy 300 {{item:3072}} . {{champion:121}} then one shots {{champion:245}} and destroys {{champion:81}} so badly that {{champion:81}} rages and breaks his keyboard. {{champion:121}} is finished playing games and prepares an attack so powerful that it will not only destroy the NA server, but the entire global framework. Just as all hope seems lost, {{champion:62}} contacts {{champion:81}} through {{champion:223}} 's telepathy. He tells him to stop being a dumbass and just click his abilities with his mouse. {{champion:81}} remembers that that is a thing that exists and goes all out, nearly matching {{champion:121}} . However, it is not enough. {{champion:121}} is about to destroy the entire global framework when {{champion:81}} screams in all chat...\n\n**_\"WHERE'S MY TEAM?!?!?!\"_**\n\nSuddenly, {{champion:154}} jumps into action, followed by the 0/22/2 {{champion:64}} and level 2 {{champion:5}} that has been AFK for the last few hours, as well as {{champion:161}} who everyone forgot even existed. Finally, even the toxic {{champion:122}} joins in and they all attack {{champion:121}} , distracting him enough for {{champion:81}} to gain the upper hand and finally destroy {{champion:121}} once and for all. As the monster disintegrates at a molecular level, a faint roar can be heard...\n\n\"_Always 1v5, report my garbage team, always in my God damned promos..._\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, and {{champion:62}} got banned for assisting the enemy team and takes like seven years to make a new account.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2016-01-25T05:26:37.469+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"who has been suffering from a heart disease until now, which is why he has no icon\"\n\nYOU LITTLE-","replies":[]},{"poster":"guguy123","date":"2016-01-25T00:19:01.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was beautiful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Garentheon","date":"2016-01-24T01:29:53.361+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good laugh.
