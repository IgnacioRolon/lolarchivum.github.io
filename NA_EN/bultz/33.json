She has speed and power. She buys one life steal item and it gives her to much life. I mean I&#039;ve fought her with grievous wound and lifesteal and still she beat me in a lifesteal contest. The rest of her build is just pure tank. Like I don&#039;t see how her kit is any less mobile in a fight then yasuo&#039;s. She isn&#039;t a late game champion so she will easily fight well off the bat. Like She does a shit ton of  damage and remains just as tanky as yasuo was. easy and free trade without fear.","replies":[{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2016-11-26T19:29:19.050+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except she is a late game champion, she doesn't build tank, and she only has a 51% win rate with people with over 125 games on her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brain Errör 404","date":"2016-11-26T19:29:59.105+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find fiora a tad bit on the weak side right now.

I'm a shit Fiora with 2 games on her and the last time I played her, I did kinda alright considering I had no idea what I was doing. If I do that on a non-broken champion I don't know, I feed like there's no tomorrow.","replies":[{"poster":"Brain Errör 404","date":"2016-11-26T20:15:55.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay?
