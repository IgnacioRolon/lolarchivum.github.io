The levels he&#039;s doing with just hp items and tank items is ridiculous. I&#039;ve fought one last week who took 2 ignites, mortal reminder, borks, etc. and didn&#039;t lose almost any health. It&#039;s disgusting.\n\n{{champion:105}} Fizz is just toxic at this point\n\n{{champion:7}}  revert her fucking revert. Wtf who thought 1 shot leblanc is okay.\n\n{{champion:77}} \n\nUdyr needs to be addressed too. Not overpowered, but just toxic at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"FabWarlock","date":"2018-05-24T04:06:47.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swain should be added to that list.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-05-24T03:11:38.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Udyr's only good if you give him an early game 3/0. Otherwise he's gutter trash. He's kind of always been that way. His kit is really weak vs other duelers. I haven't carried hard with him since Season 6. I used to love him. Now it's either Feast or Famine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DODGEORLOSE","date":"2018-05-24T03:30:55.788+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Brand does a lot of damage because his 2 main damage abilities in lane are skillshots, 1 of which is his only form of hard cc and can be blocked by minions. Mundo can easily be kiting or countered by certain bruisers. Fizz can also be kited. LeBlanc is op. Udyr is only good if he gets an early lead.","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2018-05-24T03:58:47.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I thought I could kite fizz, then his shark bit me from the other side of the lane.

Brand mid ... OK - but Brand Support should not.\nLeBlanc ... Yeah .... champion is redic right now.\nMundo ... can 1 v 1 Yi while building full tank.  And still does massive damage.  Very few tanks currently can 1 v 1 a Yi that is fed ( mundo can tho )","replies":[]}]}
