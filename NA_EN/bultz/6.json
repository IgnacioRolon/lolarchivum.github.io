Yes.\n\nNot specifically the magic, but the fact that it is light. Does that affect them? Darkin, sort of demonic beings vs light, the accustomed herald of good. \n\n> 4) I mean... yes? They are fallen god-warriors. Probably easier to just consume the host and find a new one, though!\n\nA healing factor like Venom has from the movie where it is instant, or does it take them time to heal?\n \n> 5) Are you that eager for Runeterra to end, and all storytelling and gameplay along with it?

Yes I would like to see another Darkin Arise and a new event of epic proportion which is just a giant war of 4 Darkin players vs the masses.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"klavborn","date":"2019-06-20T18:53:40.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"apostrophes do not denote plurality","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2019-06-18T21:32:15.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Considering the fact the Void feed on magic, it would likely consume them.\n2) Unlikely as Naga seems god status and would kill them.\n3) Yes, it does damage, doesn't it?\n4) I presume the healing they have is a form of the blood magic they mention.\n5) With only 3 dudes in malformed bodies against gods and armies of Runeterra?

I don't think its a weakness at all. The darkin are not immune to magic, so it can probably damage them though.\n\n4.)  In the lore they healed their regular bodies using blood magic, but I think Scathlocke is saying that it isn't instant like you see in anime. Aatrox sees the bodies he takes as a mockery to his original form, so that makes me think he (or the others) wont care for their vessels the same way they once cared for themselves unless they have to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2019-06-21T18:38:07.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"My favorite darkin theory is my own theory that fishbones is a darkin who wants to be good but jinx is crazy and trying to recorrupt him, and all the talking is real","replies":[]},{"poster":"RyzeTheSmurfMage","date":"2019-06-18T21:06:41.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"1.
