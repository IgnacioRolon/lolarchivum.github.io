EC stops lifesteal by a percentage. An Item to drain mages of mana should exist. Let&#039;s be serious, at not even half an item, {{item:3802}}, mages get a shit ton of mana, 300, mana restore, and 10% cd. With 1 item such as, {{item:3285}} , mages can get a 35% cd with a 15% ult cd to that. That&#039;s ridiculous. Mages aren&#039;t even gated by mana how they should be. Back in the early days of this game, mages did hella damage, but paid in mana restrictions. Now champions like brand can go 5 to 6 fights without needing mana restores. That is not okay. Mages have a load of option to build mana restore items and just flat mana as well. An item to drain them should exist.","replies":[{"poster":"Proxy345","date":"2018-04-09T04:24:37.756+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wits End used to do that WAY back in the day lol but it was broken so yeah.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2018-04-09T12:37:17.729+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"it wasn't broken\n\nit fucked bruisers that had 500 mana more than mages that had 3000 mana \n\nwit's end was literally useless against mages because they would never get out of mana from you attacking them, you would kill them before wit's end did anything to their mana\n\non the opposite, it fucked bruisers totally who could not cast a single spell, were tanky, and relied on their spells to exist unlike ADCS who can rightclick\n\nimagine {{champion:122}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:77}} without mana","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zacktootall","date":"2018-04-09T04:20:04.331+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"yes because i totally want more problems with mana...... no i actually don't please delete this before riot make this terrible idea a thing","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnyperWulff","date":"2018-04-09T12:27:28.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, because there are Champs that are mana hungry in the early game because their abilities cost quite a bit. Mage would become useless until they could make up the difference in items.
