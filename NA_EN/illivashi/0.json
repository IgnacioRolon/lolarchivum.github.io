But when I close the client, suddenly im getting 148 fps. It is getting really annoying logging in and out every game, help please?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-20T04:18:54.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some hardware configurations encounter a harder time when running the Beta client in the background. If this is what's happening with you, try **enabling** \"Low Spec Mode\" and **disabling** \"Animation\" in your client settings (cog button, top-right).\n\nhttp://image.prntscr.com/image/598e949fe2904c85b3220875cf13760f.png\n\nLet me know if this caused any change in your framerate.","replies":[{"poster":"Vathriel","date":"2017-02-20T19:12:23.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wanted to note, I also experience this. Oddly enough it's not consistent for me. It only starts occurring after leaving it open for a few matches. I presume this has more to do with a memory leak than an inability to run the animations, considering usually for the first match it being open is fine with no loss in framerate. I'll try what you've said but I just wanted to bring this to your attention. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-21T22:13:43.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate that. ^.^\n\nIf you see any issues with memory leaks, definitely report this on the [**Client Discussion Boards**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) so our teams are aware!","replies":[{"poster":"Vathriel","date":"2017-02-23T21:42:19.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wanted to notify you that as of now the patch has seemed to fix my client's issues with staying open and the potential memory leak (as far as I can tell the client essentially closes during match, avoiding the problem) But whatever is going on, you guys fixed my issues. Thanks rito!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
