Kennen mid/top.  Lissandra mid/top.  Ekko jungle/mid/top.  Kayle jungle/mid/top.  Nautilus top/jungle/support.  On and on and on.  \n\nYou're banning a champion for one role when in reality you're banning it for two or three, so your neat little system of keeping every champion ban segregated into its own \"primary\" role fails epicly.\n\nStill haven't addressed my point, which is that if 3 dedicated midlaners are broken I support banning every single one of them.","replies":[{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2016-10-18T06:37:30.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">You're banning a champion for one role when in reality you're banning it for two or three\n\nHow is that any different from now? \n\n>Still haven't addressed my point, which is that if 3 dedicated mid laners are broken I support banning every single one of them.\n\nIf a limit is not set somehow, than what stops a team form using all 5 bans against say the MID or ADC and then first pick the next best one?

Also your 5 bans assumes we accept your system from the offset.  3 bans when you have 20+ champions to choose from for each role is only a handicap if you're: \n\n1.  A meta slave upset that your broken picks were banned.\n2.  In a competitive setting where the opposing team has an idea of what your team's composition is like and tries to ban a specific set of champions that you're good with to give them an edge.\n\nThis doesn't happen in the regular game.  This doesn't even happen in premades.  What you're asking for is a complete redesign of the ban system to specifically address a problem only encountered by a handful of professional players.  It still doesn't address my objection, which is that most champions don't have primary roles.  They have two roles that they can perform equally.","replies":[{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2016-10-18T19:29:13.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You do know that the majority of League is balanced around Diamond tier and up with a bit of focus on the professional level because they have to be able to play without a LCS specific handicap. There has always been a constant requesting for more bans (usually 1 per player / 5 per side) so I assumed no one would complain with the 5 bans.\n\n> most champions don't have primary roles\n\nEVERY CHAMPION HAS 1 MAIN ROLE. Yes they can be effective in another role, but every champion has 1 primary role even if it is only 0.1% more played than their other. And if it is such a hard concept to understand, then why not make it have a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly update for the role which has been played the most over that past week, 2 weeks, or month. That role will become the current Primary and the second most played will become the current Secondary.\n\nI looked through the list [here](http://na.op.gg/champion/statistics), and could not find one where they had 2 roles of equal %. Sure there are a few close ones like {{champion:84}} {{champion:157}} and {{champion:50}} but they still have a Primary and a Secondary. This site takes the data from ranked games Platinum and higher and compiles it into percentages and statistics. This should be close enough to the skill tier the game is balanced around to be an acceptable projection of a champion's role preference. \n\nIf your concern is more for the word \"Primary\", would the phrase \"current highest played role\" work better?\n\n\n>That's only a phenomenon seen in competitive play.\n\nA \"[phenomenon](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/phenomenon)\" is something (such as an interesting fact or event) that can be observed and studied and that typically is _**unusual or difficult to understand or explain fully**_. I am fairly sure we understand it and fully realize why it happens. You even said so in your second bullet point. If anything it is a pattern or a consistency, and could even be argued as being fully factual.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WukongMain","date":"2016-10-18T03:57:59.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2016-10-18T05:30:27.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the thought that went into this, but I am not in agreement with it.","replies":[]}]}
