Are you serious RIOT? It is bad enough if they are in one of the 2 bot roles, that at least is somewhat manageable, especially if their lane partner is not as good as them, but a solo lane with that much level gap is insanely one-sided. You likely just gave the diamond player a free lane unless the Silver&#039;s Jungler camps their ass, which is not really helpful to any other lanes who might need a gank or 2 as well. If you are gonna have a diamond player on a team, please try to place them against a platinum at least (another diamond is preferred though).","replies":[{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2017-01-23T06:43:13.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could just laneswap if it bothers ya.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MadManApocalypse","date":"2017-01-23T06:31:07.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The team MMRs' are the same, so in the end they just suck really bad.","replies":[{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2017-01-23T06:37:15.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While true sometimes, according to OP.GG, the team's avg MMR difference was around 300.
