I like the idea behind forced entrapment, it is kinda unique and changes a lot of how fights can play out. But having it 100% inescapable is kinda OP for some one like Camille to have. Someone who has a LOT of mobility and easily can get to back-lines while still dealing above average damage. So why not make it escapable with flash only?? This way her ult either forces a very long SS or works as it does currently. She already has a stun, a slow, and a whole bunch of other things to make your day harder when facing her. So why not just give this one escape opportunity for us when she uses her ult?","replies":[{"poster":"Drizzt17","date":"2016-12-22T14:05:02.247+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"@JavelinJoe Man I don't know why you are getting so many downvotes but you are 100% true. Every ability in the game who offers no counterplay should be removed imo. It is frustrating as hell when a camille with his ultra long range abilities just gets on to you(she doesnt even have to land her q just flash+ult you), then you are 1v1 vs a fiora than can dodge everything until she gets to you(invulnerability when she cast ult). Don't forget she has a shield+a heal+slow(overloaded kit as ekko). At least let me out by flashing jesus it is a 5 minute cd, and her ult is 2 mins with no cdr, at level 16 up to  1 minute with 40 cdr at 16. I don't know about you guys but the amount of times I've seen a camille get out of her ult in a 1v1 after a lot of games is 0. Right now her only counterplay is permaban her and hope riot give us our 10 bans for the season, and dodge if it slips through champ select.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Torgal","date":"2016-12-19T12:18:33.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fuck Flash.\n\nMissplay with your position ?

Kench eating you shuts down flash 100%. Cassiopeia's Miasma shuts down flash 100%. The difference between these and Hextech Ultimatum is that while you are in a pickle, you will not be instantly deleted because you can fight back and potentially kill Camille. She is trapped in the Ultimatum with you, and if you force her to flee, you're free. Fight her instead of trying to run, and you might actually find that it's not as horrible as like a stun or Yasuo ult.","replies":[{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2016-12-21T21:41:17.108+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She knocks all other enemy champions out of it, but her allies are unaffected.

It pretty much ruins the ability.  It becomse a zero damage jarvan ulti that can only trap one person.  You can already stop it by either just stunning and focus firing like any other bruiser assassin (irelia ,j4, renekton) or you can knock her out of it with gragas, lee, alistar etc.","replies":[{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2016-12-21T20:42:22.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I meant that having something that abilities and items could not get out of was a good idea, but also having summoner spells included is too much imo. {{summoner:4}}  has a 5 minute or so cooldown.

Stunning her does nothing. _I am pretty sure the ult remains if she dies within the area too, until the 4 seconds are up, but I am not positive on this one_.\n\n>It becomse a zero damage jarvan ulti that can only trap one person.\n\nWhile the ult itself does no damage, it has a knockback of all champions besides the target, and gives Camille 5/10/15 (+ 4/6/8% of targets current health) as bonus magic damage on her basic attacks. That Knockback can proc abilities like Yasuo's ult and can stop channels/stationary abilities like Nunu's, Fiddlestick's, and Jhin's ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rainbowlazars","date":"2016-12-19T12:09:25.335+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"It also pushes all the other enemies out at first, which is alot of bonus utility.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-12-19T07:17:55.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Camomille tea has 45% win rate.\n\nShe does not need massive nerfs like you are requesting.","replies":[{"poster":"Rainbowlazars","date":"2016-12-19T12:10:07.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Shes not super strong, people super dont know how to play her, but her ult IS oppressive.
