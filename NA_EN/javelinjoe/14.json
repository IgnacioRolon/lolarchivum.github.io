For the entire history of the item, the only time it was truly a problem was when it was being used by ranged champions like Vayne, and subsequently quickly nerfed for them. The only people that had a problem with it were the people that should be kept away from any game balance with a 10 foot poll.\n\nThe reason devourer junglers became a problem now is due to a few things. First, the general snowbally nature of the season. Second: rageblade giving them all the damage they needed to then build defensively and still wreck teams, something that wasn't possible before. Third: the juggernaut items allowed devourer junglers to build defensive minded items while still maintaining durability.\n\nNone of these were due to Sated (as a champion could still just build rageblade and get the same result from a lane)","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2016-04-22T12:18:17.933+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"The reason why Sated Devourer was changed for ranged champions was because of {{champion:203}} \n\nWhile it's true that {{champion:10}} and {{champion:67}} (and to a lesser extent, {{champion:4}}) were abusing it, they didn't got Devourer nerfed.

Kog will probably get a specific clause just for him due to %max damage out the wazoo but I doubt they will change it back to 4 hits for all ranged.\n\nSated needed the change since it was an accessible item on more champions. Kindred, Vayne, and others would've lost nothing for eventually getting Sated since it was a cost effective item on its own before phantom hit that had no wasted stats for most champions. Rageblade not only costs a lot more $$$$ but has AP and little AS to make it a never buy on most of the ranged Champions that would've abused the Phantom hit.\n\nSo let's look at the ranged Rageblade buyers now. I already addressed Kog and Kayle will probably get a nerf for it anyway (she already synergizes too well with live variant so Nerfing the item for her won't do anything since it'll just put her on live standards which is already pretty strong). Tristana MIGHT get her E off faster but I don't think she will continue to buy the item with its new cost (or that her E will stack with phantom hits). There aren't many other ranged champions that traditionally buy Rageblade so Nerfing the item for everyone is rather silly in case someone wants to mess around and do off Meta stuff and if it DOES become a problem they can easily either A) just change it after 1 cycle (oh no 2 weeks it is the end of the world!) or B) straight up hotfix it since it isn't a difficult change if it REALLY is a problem.\n\nKeep in mind champions will also have to auto attack 8 times to experience the FIRST phantom hit so if a Kayle got 8 autos on you in that time you are PROBABLY already almost dead.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-04-24T08:52:45.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, their are a few ADCs..{{champion:18}} , the briefly notorious {{champion:67}} , {{champion:42}} {{champion:81}} (nice bonus effect for Ez, for those who want to), {{champion:222}} \n\nThe updated Rageblade was the most efficient item in the game at the time of the rework. Post Rageblade cost increase it was still good.\n\nNow someone could do a cost efficiency chart for how good the new new Rageblade is, but that depends on the impact.\n\nKayle HAD been nerfed on PBE, but it was reverted.\n\nI honestly think Kog needs nerfs. He abuses the tank items, he shts on squishies and tanks still, and has been sitting at the highest winrate for a couple of patches now. No one has yet to complain about him. Yes you can cclock him down, but that's only way later, and it's negated often due to sterak's and a team that knows what they are doing. Even using WW, he's still untouchable, even in laning, if he has a support with any form of peel. But yeah, Kog has had a couple of smallbuffs \"recently\"\n\nRiot is really slow on decisions, tends to often ignore PBE, and often poor changes do hit live(there have been a lot of those recently). Yes, but the champs that buy Rageblade have enough attack speed so, by the time you were to, say even finish channeling a Darius Q, they end up with basically 8 attacks already. \n\nI also do believe Runanns (which pairs up with Rageblade a lot) also makes the stack gaining even faster.","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2016-04-24T09:16:19.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Kog is in dire need of nerfs but he will with new Rageblade or at least a clause on W that says \"no phantom hits allowed\" or some shit.\n\nAlso, Hurricane does not help you stack Rageblade faster with the bolts, but it does synergize well with it since it will also proc all of your phantom hits and melee champs and Kog were the only ones able to stack it in a decent speed (and Trist to an extent since she hits 2.5 with 2 items).","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-04-24T20:21:30.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Onhit effects in general have been...strong for a while","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"kile147","date":"2016-04-22T18:11:57.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was a problem not because the champs who used it were broken, but because they were forced to be balanced around it.
