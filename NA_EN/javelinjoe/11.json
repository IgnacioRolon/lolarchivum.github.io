Lots of burst, built in escape (kinda), healing, pretty good back line access. Sounds like your usually burst mage/assassin. But he builds minimal to no AP heavy items, and prioritizes defensive and utility passive and active items. \r\n\r\nIn no way is Vlad super weak or broken. But he is leaning a little bit to close to the OP side of the balance spectrum. Like on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being today&#039;s Yasuo video, balanced being between 4-7, and 1 being Lee Sin if he had to be played with no visuals (since he is blind), I would rank him a 6.5/10. Just near being borderline OP. Thing is, it does not take too much to move him past 7 in games. This is likely due to the &quot;assassin meta&quot; we are somewhat in. Vlad is a good counter to assassins because of his pool and sustain, making that lead fairly easy to get. \r\n\r\nBecause of the likelihood of him getting ahead in games if fairly high, I would say a slight numbers tweak or rearrangement in the future would be good. Just so he does not get past that point of OP-ness because of an unrelated change that he unintentionally benefited from. But as he is now, I would just monitor him or just lower his burst by a small amount so he still can get a lead, but he has to work at maintaining it slightly more.","replies":[{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2017-04-01T21:44:28.727+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"Hi.

I just am noticing a potential future issue since the tank rework is coming. He may have some unintended benefits from the item changes given his build does not rely on having a lot of AP heavy items. I clearly stated that currently he is fine, just a bit on the strong side. I was more thinking about his future is all, and suggested he could afford a small tweak to compensate, OR just be monitored a bit more so if he does cross that line, he does not stay there for too long.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-02T01:13:44.970+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If anything Vlad is UP.

I'm just concerned with how Vlad will do once the tank update eventually comes since his build can be moderately tanky (usually health based items like Protobelt and Spirit Visage and RCS) and not all AP heavy items (like Luden's, Morello, and RDC). \n\nSo if other health items were to be buffed a bit, it could have an impact on him where he would choose them over an item he would choose today because of the passive, or because the AP his passive would give him would be worth it. This is mostly just a concern of mine. I do not see much as of yet which would break him, but it would certainly be possible if the item synergized well enough. Just like how likely no one thought tank Ekko would ever be his best build (for a time) when he came out. Sometimes good item synergies come around for unintended champions.","replies":[]}]}]}
