I don't understand why people insist they can come back when one or more persons on the team has already given up in their mind. Keeping them stuck in your game isn't going to make them try harder, just accept the surrender.\n\nAlso there's currently no potential to out scale. Play anything other than an early game carry and watch as you and your team get shredded and get pushed into your base in all lanes. \n\nIn my opinion, the chance to out scale is invalidated if A) the enemy laners are all 30+ CS ahead, or B) less than two people are even grouping to contest dragon.\n\nIf you're just going to give up dragons, you're not going to out scale.
