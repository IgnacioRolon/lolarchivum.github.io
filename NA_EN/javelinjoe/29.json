But this last promo failure dropped me to 62 LP. Is there a reason for this somewhere that I missed? if this is intended then wtf. Now I have to win at least 2 games to be in promos again guaranteed. At 75 there was that low chance of gaining 25 LP on a win and re-qualifying right away which was rare but nice. I also had less threat of loosing 3 games in a row (which is quite common) and being at 0 LP since looses rarely dropped more than 20-21 LP. So did I miss an update for this or what?","replies":[{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2016-08-28T08:00:05.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause u lost 2 in a row. When u are on 100 LP and u win promo game, u dont get LP. But u lose it. So if u go like 1 loss 1 win 1 loss, u will end up on 75. But if u win 1 then lose 2 in a row, u will go under 75.","replies":[{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2016-08-28T15:51:38.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, that makes more sense.
