If anything it just changed the second dragon buff which shredded towers which you were guaranteed to get at second dragon into buff which could come from any dragon in the first 35 min or not at all.\n\nJust my two cents.","replies":[{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2016-04-19T22:43:22.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ziggs now executes towers with his satchel","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Skill Tank","date":"2016-04-19T22:52:13.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well this is just one champion, who used to shred towers anyways.
