Simple as that. That way bot lane can&#039;t just win lane just by getting an auto or 2 off every chance they get or have the minions chip it down every time they push the enemy under tower. It wont be enough. That way the team that is forced under tower by a bad wave or something random, wont just lose half their towers health from minion damage with little they can do about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-06T03:22:41.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would force the laning phase to stagnate until someone got enough power to plow through a turret all at once, at which point they would be able to plow through turrets easily.
