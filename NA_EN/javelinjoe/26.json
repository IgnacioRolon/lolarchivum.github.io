So they more or less have to fight with only 4 of their 5 &quot;skills&quot; in order to keep the stack count increasing, so losing only 8/10 (4/5) of the stacks would be fair in my opinion. Also since these passives do not somehow revive them, they always lose stacks (unlike say Zac, Zilean, or Anivia).\n\n_Edit: If it was not clear, I am talking about {{item:3041}} ._","replies":[{"poster":"Leanus Crain","date":"2016-07-07T04:16:55.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stacks on what though?","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-07T04:20:28.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd assume Mejai's.\nMaking an item work differently for 2 out of over 100 champs seems a little silly though.
