Maybe for every dragon you get you gain a % of your death timer reduced. \nEx: first dragon get you 2.5% off, second gets 5%, third gets 7.5%, fourth gets 10%, and fifth gives 20% to each player alive (does become reduced back to 10% once the buff ends but applies the buffed 20% to that death if they had it when they died). Note that the percentages are just for example purposes only, and I have dont have a strong idea of what would be considered balanced in this aspect.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-02T18:09:31.214+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, Dragon is contested pretty heavily already.  Also that fifth dragon buff is already really hard to play against as the losing team.  It would already pretty much guarantees a lossif the enemy has any poke whatsoever.  If you manage to lose a teamfight when you have the 5th dragon buff on you then you deserve a loss.  Reducing the death timerst would simply give the team an extra chance that they shouldn't get.\n\nOn the whole though I think messing with the death timers is a bad idea just for the sake of clarity.  I know roughly how long the enemy is going to be down at most points in the game and how much I can press my advantage (1 tower, 2 towers, maybe an inhib then dragon etc).  Adding this would just fuck a me up.\n\nIf we are going to buff a neutral mob I want rift herald buffed a little.  Make it more worthwhile to get and contest so you have 2 large monsters to contest to balance out the map.  Right now if you are a jungler then you pretty much are going to stay close to bot side most of the time unless dragon is already gone.\n\nJust my 2 cents.","replies":[{"poster":"HadesBlades","date":"2016-04-02T18:56:43.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dragon is rarely contested in my games, hell I forget that it's there until it either pops up on me or on my lane opponent. Sure it's nice to have, but why get dragon when I can snowball my lane and just shove down towers?  I can't even remember a time when I got 5th drag that wasn't over 40mins into the game... which rarely happens now. Dragon and Rift Herald are both nice benefits for sated junglers, but overall lack strategic engagement for the lanes near them, and dragon doesn't feel decent until the 3rd buff. \n\nWho needs a burn to towers when your jungler or adc can rotate with Red buff after you killed your laner? It doesn't have armor or mr so it's just more icing on the cake if you want dragon to deal magic damage to towers. This is why Riot is addressing both buffs, because they lack any ability for teams to make plays.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-02T19:24:32.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe I just see it contested more often idk.  But I wish ganking top and getting rift herald was at least a little more rewarding than ganking bot and getting dragon.  Yeah sure there are more people bot side but I wouldn't mind rift herald getting a buff maybe on combat stats or gold gain or exp gane for its duration. \n\nJust off the top of my head maybe it could give x amount more gold or exp for killing minions and monsters for its duration or gives 25 ad and ap, or gives 2 free green wards to help with the whole pushing buff it gives to stop you from getting caught or something else entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2016-04-05T03:30:31.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe buffed minions generate gold (like 1-3) per minion they kill for the holder.
