Sure we might be pushed out from being directly under our tower, you can still gank. Every lane has many ways from where to enter it. Get creative, maybe gank from behind their own tower and knock them forward or something. But don&#039;t just afk farm the entire match because it is a better use of your time according to you. Even Yi, a champion famous for the &quot;AFK farm till 6&quot; routine, has pressure if he shows in a lane before hand. if suddenly the bot lane has 3 champions on a team, usually the other side backs off or changes their play style. Sometimes just making them miss a few CS is enough to take a solid lead. Just because you may not get a kill, does not mean it is not worth ganking the lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2017-05-12T06:41:21.330+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"In yi's case, it's sometimes just a waste of time to even bother popping in the lane, unless they do something really, really out of line","replies":[]},{"poster":"kurthl33t","date":"2017-05-12T20:29:31.639+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totes.  Showing up can force them to burn a summoner.  It can make them back off, giving your laner a chance to breath and get some cs.  It can reveal where they do (or do not) have vision.  It can reveal where the enemy jungler is (or isn't), opening up a chance to take an objective.  I absolutely agree that a gank does not have to end in a kill to be valuable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-05-12T04:50:14.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"then you get the junglers who don't ping or say anything and just appear in your lane","replies":[{"poster":"Mizuki Zahra","date":"2017-05-12T05:20:02.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Watch the map?
