But the issue is that many of them can also play solo or supporting roles in the team outside of the jg. The 5 I mentioned are {{champion:32}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:77}}. With the exception of Udyr and Shyvana who both almost always go in the jungle, I have seen these champions a lot in the top lane and support since their tankiness and hard cc/sustain is very strong. The issue arises when we no longer can determine who is going where in champion select. Junglers that can become a bully in lane as well is a scary thing (thanks for the sort of {{champion:111}} nerf because that was broken as hell in lane and damage output). Yes every champion can solo lane to an extent, but they all should have a 95% probability of going to a specific role (i hardly ever see a Nasus anywhere but top lane, but i might get that one guy who goes mid for example). But with the current limited cluster of champions that are OP right now (or META), almost all of that comes from jungle champs since they don&#039;t always go jungle, but when they do they tend to snowball very easily with either Sated Devourer-Rageblade or Runic Echoes and one of those is VERY broken balance wise. The ability to decide a game&#039;s outcome should not rest on one role, yet it does with the current meta and that role is Jungler. Every game I see most if not all of the bans go to jungle based champs and within that those champs are the ones who could dominate a solo lane like Voli or Naut. Just pointing this out, not really sure if this is intended or just what is currently meta.","replies":[{"poster":"darkmatchwaldo","date":"2016-03-11T20:41:42.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait what.....Flex picks are a huge part of champ select.
