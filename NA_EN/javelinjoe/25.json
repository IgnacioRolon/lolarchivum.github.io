But since season 6, everyone more or less got use to playing only 2-3 roles and avoided 1-2 of them.

Are you seriously going to quit the game because once in a while you have to play Support?\n\nMy having to play support is not why I quit playing, it is because it takes a half hour or more to get into a match because autofilled players queue dodge.  I like playing the game, not playing the lobby ban phase over and over again.\n\nThe reason they introduced role queue in the first place was to reduce the number of queue dodges, now they have a system that fights itself.\n\nBeside all of that, do you want a weak support on your team who does not know how to ward river, the timing of the skills on their champ and so on?  I played several thousand normal games in support, top, and jungle before I went into ranked with those roles.  If I get out in ADC by autofill at some point it will likely be an auto loss for my team.\n\n In short, a team is only as strong as its weakest link, that weakest link will often be the autofilled player.  I do not enjoy playing a game where the choices are out of our hands and left to chance.  Autofill is RNG, there is already enough of that in the game with crit.","replies":[{"poster":"Verdade","date":"2016-11-26T13:14:24.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Autofill is not RNG if you know how to \"abuse it\".\nIf you queue as support, your next 4 games will be \"autofill protected\", which means you can't get autofilled and you will get your primary or secondary role.\nIf everyone did this, nobody would ever get autofilled and there would be enough supports for near instant queues","replies":[{"poster":"Ðelofasht","date":"2016-11-26T13:24:42.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Verdade,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RydwTH4X,comment-id=0007000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-26T13:14:24.642+0000)\n>\n> Autofill is not RNG if you know how to &quot;abuse it&quot;.\n> If you queue as support, your next 4 games will be &quot;autofill protected&quot;, which means you can&#x27;t get autofilled and you will get your primary or secondary role.\n> If everyone did this, nobody would ever get autofilled and there would be enough supports for near instant queues\n\nYOU may be protected, but not everyone else on your team is, that is the RNG element, you never know if someone in your team is put in a position that they are terrible at.  As long as autofill exists we will always be running a risk of having a terrible feeding support who never buys sight stones or places wards.\n\nI play the system already, queuing for support to avoid being filled into it when I would much prefer not to be.  I actually do not mind playing support overall, but do not like playing it often or all the time, as half of the time the ADC is a big steaming pile of poo (does not follow up on my engages, no damage, positions poorly, blames or does not communicate at all).  I prefer a game where I can feel my contribution to a game was more than keeping an ADC alive through laning only to watch them just play terribly in mid and late game.  At least in solo positions you are mostly only responsible for the impact you have on the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ManiacalCoyote","date":"2016-11-25T18:47:21.368+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Does \"once in a while\" mean every other game?

Think about this however, I may not be autofilled this game, but someone else on my team might, and if they are not confident or strong in that role they are going to play worse at it, thus increasing the chance to lose.  We cannot tell whether an enemy is autofilled or not, but either way, it is all random chance, which is unhealthy for a game really (thus why they took out things like dodge mechanism).\n\nSo. . .    as I said, autofill is a problem on a magnitude that cannot be stated often or clearly enough.  Once you start caring about winning at all you do not want to put yourself at the mercy of chance, especially when one could easily track the number of autofill games and start to calculate the losses of players involved in matches where autofill took place.  It will be higher by a large enough percentage to cause issues, the system is flawed, designed to fix long queue times, at the expense of the quality of the matches, and thus the fun of the game, the same can really be said of the MMR system as well, but it's been around and ingrained for so long now that it cannot really be removed or changed without irreparable damage to the system as a whole.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wolftastic33","date":"2016-11-25T08:59:55.097+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":14,"body":"You'd rather have the old system with pick order, where you could only choose from the roles the teammates above you hadn't chosen yet?\nI mean, if you're last pick now, you can counter pick.
