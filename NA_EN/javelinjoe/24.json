The reason Vayne can get away with every 3 basics she deals %health is because she is very squishy and has short range. Kindred has her potential damage output (arguably more) but does not have her crutch. She heals by moving (and the next attack although only by a small flat amount, it still can be what decides a fight early on), better burst (quicker damage dealing), and her ult makes her able to 1v1 anyone and possibly win, even if behind. This is because while her ult is active she and her opponent can&#039;t die, but still take damage. So regardless of level, defensive stats or DPS 1v1 in her ult almost always ends in her favor 1v1. \r\nAn unkillable, tank shredding, assassin, who can (far more than any other champion) win 1v1 against any opponent is just slightly unbalanced (not game breaking but definitely not balanced) .\r\n\r\nMy idea for how to balance her would be to:\r\n\r\n- Cap her passive %hp damage, maybe around 12-15% max because Blade of the Ruined King and sated devourer add to that damage. At 12% cap with BotRK and sated, she deals 18% current health every basic. and every other it is 32% (second hit does less % damage but I did not want to calculate the exact amount so I overestimated)\r\n- Scale the Ult duration by level. ex: 6 = 2s 11 = 2.5s 16 = 3s. Having a full 3 seconds at lvl 6 makes any opponent who is in the circle a potential kill, not to mention if her E is also activated and the opponent is slowed for 70% and taking more %health damage on the third hit.\r\n- Alternative to the prior suggestion would be to reduce its radius making it not as large of a foothold for Kindred to fight in.\r\n- Lower her %health scaling but raise her base damage and AD scaling. \r\n- Just an idea but what if some forms of cc (like Lissandra&#039;s ult or a silence) took her (or anyone it is used on) out of her ult&#039;s invincible buff for its duration. Does not cancel the ult, if used on kindred, but for the cc&#039;s duration she (or the recipient of the cc) will not be invincible. of course once the cc is over and if her ult is still active the invincibility will resume for the remainder of the ult. CC like knockups and fears won&#039;t stop it, but silences and suppresses (or encasings/ being turned to stone) do. Again just a thought.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-11-07T08:22:46.176+0000","up_votes":60,"down_votes":2,"body":"We're with you on Kindred being too strong, we've got a couple of other things we want to hit in 5.22 before considering whether further nerfs are needed though.

Soraka should be able to heal you, but it's gated by using her own health and also mana. I saw a Kindred and Soraka lane, and that entire laning phase Kindred never dropped below 75% health. \n\nWhile sure you could all in or pick her out with blitz/thresh, it's too much of a safety cushion.

That's why she's the exception to the rule that you focus the carry, not the support. As long as she's alive, damage to her carry is half as effective as damage to her. Also, Kindred have low base AD and low range. Most of their early damage comes from spamming Q. If you can bait the W and wait for it to run out, then you can go in on Soraka with little worry.\n\nAs for Hunter's Vigor itself, you CAN out-harass the sustain. Just don't let them charge it with impunity. Again, their range is low (like actually; that's said of Vayne, but at least her AA range is average; not Kindred). If they wander too close, poke them. If they last hit, poke them again. If they stop moving to attack even a high-health minion to get the heal, throw whatever skillshot you have at them. You don't even have to kill them. If you out-CS them and they don't get any stacks, you win, and you come out of the laning phase in a much stronger position. They don't scale very well with items unless they have stacks.\n\nBy the way, Nami is pretty terrible at sustain early on, because W costs a LOT of mana. I've heard \"Why so few heals, Nami?\" from a carry taking a lot of poke, but rarely being in range for the bounce. It's because I'll go OoM and we'll lose. She's much better at winning trades (kind of a mix between poke and sustain). Soraka or Sona will out-sustain her, and it could become a pretty frustrating lane for both sides.

I've been playing kindred like crazy so actually stopping by to put in my opinion on her (I'm not challenger level, but at least I know the basics in other words).\n\nKindred's passive damaged could be capped against monsters, but at the same time as an ADC style jungler I think it's ok that they take away dragons quickly.  Not unlike a Vi or similar characters.\n\nIn my experience so far Kindred really is not too powerful, she is very susceptible to being jumped on and focused.  She needs high damage to lend to her assassination style.\n\nSo, really what I'm saying here is that if she is going to do less damage against champions she will need more range or Hp or something to not just get jumped on by every kha'zix/vi/j4 out there and killed.  However, I'm totally ok with the idea of capping the passive damage versus monsters.  It seems like if I've built up enough stacks in game to really do some damage to the enemy I had to work for it.\n\nI'm really enjoying Kindred and is my favorite champion released this year.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-11-09T04:55:52.946+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Glad to hear you're enjoying Kindred.

Her passive cap isn't fixed (ie a super fast solo dragon at 4 stacks adds a lot of power to her)\n2. Her regen or her passive W regen? (if it's her w regen, tweak it vs lane minions) That will cut\nthe power of it for Lanered's sustain, but keep it the purpose of jungle.\n\nNow as for her other things.\nPeople need to understand a few things for a jungle marksman vs lane.\nA lanered has a  low chance of getting marks. She can't really wonder the map for her jungle camp marks.\nShe can mark the two bot, but that becomes longer as longer pre kill. So if she kills both she's locked out for along time.\nExample you can easily get 8 marks before lanered gets 4. \n\nBut jungle kindred will suffer via gold, while the lanered will have more gold as expected in lane vs jungle roles.\n\nThis brings up another point.\n\nJungle kindred will most likely be more gold starved then a lane marksman, meaning her items will not be as quickly advanced, her damage lower. Add in counter jungling to.... jarvan and shaco's shut her down very easily.... (such nightmares when playing against good ones)\n\nAlso jungle kin is more likely to duel then lane kin. Due to the jungles nature. Which means to get her jungle marks she has to invade... and being a marksman if she's overly weak there's no way she can get her marks. CAuse she sacrifices gold income to walk to the enemy jungle to get it. Which means she may or may not get it. Wasted time walking, not farming, and dying adding to her downtime.\n\nNow moving to damage. Stop comparing her to vayne. Vayne has a lot more damage in every way. A lot more useful abilities. *I love playing kindred as well*\n\nVayne has true dmg every 3 hits. %hp true damage. EVERY three hits....say it with me EVERY three hits, no cool down. THARRUEEE damage.\nShe shred tanks ands squishies like no tomarrow. She can stealth, roll and stun as well as a knock back, and a passive plus a ulti that increases her movement speed to rape you when you try to run.\nAlso seen her go 1v5 teams before.\n\nNow for kindred.\n1. Her damage is all PHYSICAL. Meaning armor reduces the effect. Say it with me. Armor reduces the effect. True damage from vayne is..... not able to be mitigated in any way. \nResult hp% true dmg > hp% kindred.\n\n2.  Her Q is a small dash and 3 targets, she can't control which targets, it doesn't stack her E mark. it has a 9 second cooldown. Is not effected by CDR, only W reduces it to 2 seconds WHILE in the field. Also the damage on it is so so.\nVayne increases her ad on her auto, when ulti is active it stealths meaning she can reposition stealthly.\nEvery see how much health is lost on a vayne rank 5 Q auto.\n\n3. W Gives a field, that attacks things in it, gives her a regen at 100 stacks, causes her Q to go to 2 seconds for the duration of the field.\nNerf the W via lane minions and that will shut lane kindred down for endless sustain. The damage off wolves' W is pretty lame unless you got lots of marks. Also PHYSICAL DAMAGE..get armor.\nVayne W hp% true damage, already explained...... armor won't save you.\n\n4. Kins E, is a mark that slows for 1 seconds, after 3 hits does x damage plus mark damage plus % damage.\nYou have to land 3 autos, the Q damage will not add a stack meaning if you W and Q spam you won't add any stacks to it. (gotten me killed a few times) Also most of her damage comes from this ability... Which means... she has to wait for a cool down to use it again. Also armor reduces the effect of this ability.\nVayne has a knock back/stun. So she can keep you in place to apply 3 stacks of her silverbolts which has NO mitigation on it... while kindred can not stop you from damaging her or running away. While vayne can also stun knock back and chase you down with her passive.\n\n5. Ulti Stop bitching about this. It's easily countered has a low hp heal on it. Plus it heals you, so if it lands wrong you just wait and wack. But lets look at what can screw her over. Blitz grab, nautilus grab, lee sin ulti, vayne's E (try dualing when she can just knock you out of it.) Darius E,Trist ulti,  Rammus taunt, Azir ulti, Gragas ulti, Thresh Q, and so on. Even draven's E can knock you out of it. Also it effects you and not just her.\nTake Tryn. His ulti countered how?\nVaynes ulti. Gives massive AD to a truedmg %hp damage marksman, and stealth and increased movement speed towards an enemy... Add in the stun and dash and she just hurts. Counter her damage how?\n\nlast part.\n\nKin will be gold starved so most standard builds she has to snow ball hard to build. \nVayne easily destroys tanks and squishies and can 1v5 if they are good. Has a dash, knock back, stun true damage %hp, movement speed and a stealth. She doesn't need abilities to shred tanks.\n\nKin needs abilities to shred tanks. Her base stats are very low. Also a few champs destroy her outright.\nJarvan, le'blanc, jax, shaco, vayne, trist, xin. If your dying to her, find out why. Even olaf can tear her a new one.\n\nIf your crying about her sustain, fix the W vs lane minions.\n\nBut you must touch her careful as she will be more gold deprived when played her in designed role. It's the case of lulu\nLulu is a support, abused when played solo lane. There's careful tweaks one must do. But outright calling her op is just stupid.\n\nI suggest riot fix her Monster passive damage cap and her sustain vs lane minions.\nBefore touching anything about her. That alone will take out a lot of power.\nAlso with the new changes coming out Riot should wait to see how it plays out or her.\n\nSide note. Kindred doesn't use crit very well like most marksman. She's also down one item slot for a jungle item which isn't fully efficient damage item like a pure damage item is. So that right there has to be taken into effect.\n\nLearn to play around her before crying foul. I've seen a lot more over powered champs released, she can can be 1 shotted easily... also... she very team comp oriented. meaning she can't 1v5, she needs a front line VERY badly due to her range... and abilities.\n\nShe's very much high risk, high reward.\nBut I enjoy her....\n\nVayne is still a bane. Now If they took vayne to hp% damage only. Then I'd maybe accept a few tweaks to kindred beyond the suggest 2.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Myrkrvaldyr","date":"2016-03-18T18:19:41.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is kindred's range 500 and not 550?

Honestly I am kind of curious as to what I am going to build on kindred with the updates. From what I can tell gold costs of finished jungle items are going up, but its compensated by gold value of monsters going up, but later gold from monsters is technically going to be lower thanks to the change from extra gold granted from jungle items being removed along side it, But XP gains increasing (especially after first back) all in all gold increase acrossed the board is making me think games are intended to be faster which makes me think devourer is going to be even less of a good item to buy on most junglers. Then there is the changes to Warrior which removes the armor pen from it, but also increases its AD which means for kindred it may be stronger early, but still pretty useless late. BotRK is Nerfed, the bow lost 40% attack speed for crit, which I havent been able to tell if that's good on kindred, it doesnt feel like it. Masteries have changed, several other items lost attack speed, or the ones that had attack speed were nerfed in some way..... I think the only one this is not the case for was Berserker greaves.... technically other items werent really \"nerfed\" they just lost attack speed and usually gained crit or something else Kindred didnt care for as far as I can tell, but basically land scape of items changed heavy.\n\nThen their is the armor pen nerfs on Last Whisper build paths (It actually makes me think about picking up the changed Y. Ghostblade... that thing looks sick...), since some one would have to build pretty high armor for it to be as effective as old, still that much armor will affect some one even if you pierce it some what, but so far best I have been able to figure since so many items have attack speed and Crit on them could go something like Rapid Fire Canon, Phantom Dancer, Trinity Force, Zerker grieves... Kind of just theory crafting now, but seriously there is a lot of things changing and the dust has not even come close to settling on where Kindred lands, oh and to every one who thinks \"Stop pinging your symble in the enemy jungle your marks arent a team objective\" Remember, Kindred is a member of your team..... those marks are an objective... that makes it a team objective. Its no different then blue buff or the new Rift Herald, it is something you kill that gives ONE member of your team a buff, the difference between blue and rift and Kindred's marks is... THE blue and rift goes to any one and is TEMPORARY, while the Kindred Mark always goes to one of your carries (Kindred) and is PERMANENT, why would you not want to help one of your carries snow ball the game makes no sense to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yuumi or Lose","date":"2015-11-07T20:24:56.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One thing I found very surprising is how there isn't a monster cap on her passive.

All you have left afterwards is an extremely squishy auto attacker with no crits attached who can barely lifesteal because it is reduced drastically by armor. \n\ntl;dr Not all tanks aren't completely shut down by Kindred, because she's not a dedicated tank buster like Vayne or Kog'maw; Kindred's damage output is COMPLETELY PHYSICAL, so all you need is armor for counter-building.","replies":[{"poster":"FastAsHeck","date":"2015-11-07T17:45:43.452+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"PREACH\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Trash MammaI","date":"2015-11-07T12:36:12.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"1) Tanks are garbage anyway and are becoming worse with the preseason\n2) I go warrior so idk about always going Sated* also the beef you have is with the item sated, which a large selection of the champion pool can easily abuse, blame the item not the champ\n3) You're bad if you're losing to her is the correct way to put it\n\nYou're just as bad as those people who bitched about Ekko's ult doing too much damage when he was released when the reality is you have no business standing on top of his afterimage like a dingus","replies":[{"poster":"Zlysium","date":"2015-11-07T15:01:19.686+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Simple Tora,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yrOG8uEA,comment-id=000000010002,timestamp=2015-11-07T12:36:12.238+0000)\n>\n> 1) Tanks are garbage anyway and are becoming worse with the preseason\n> 2) I go warrior so idk about always going Sated* also the beef you have is with the item sated, which a large selection of the champion pool can easily abuse, blame the item not the champ\n> 3) You're bad if you're losing to her is the correct way to put it\n> \n> You're just as bad as those people who bitched about Ekko's ult doing too much damage when he was released when the reality is you have no business standing on top of his afterimage like a dingus\n\nAt some point in time you will end up being near the image when he presses R. Sometimes it's completely unavoidable.  If any time you ever got into a bad spot you got deleted, then even though you're only in that spot a small amount of times. It's still enough especially in late game to win. You can say \"no business standing on top of his afterimage\" when in reality it's meaningless to say that. Nidalee spears got nerfed because even if she missed 80+% of them in a game. the 20% she landed got kills. The counterplay? Dodge them. The actual play? You still get hit eventually. If at any point in time she landed a single spear. Someone had to recall. Same concept. Not difficult to understand.

I don't think a rework should be done, but simply changing around numbers won't work.\n----\nHis passive: His strength is his HP tank shredding potential, and objective taking ability, on the other side of the spectrum from Kalista, instead of securing an objective that is contested at an exact moment, he has the ability to pressure them by taking them at any point when given enough resources, but at the same time unmatched sustained damage against tanks through sustained damage (again, opposite of Kalista, who uses a burst of damage to finish off champions).\n\nCap the damage - lose half the passive's ability. I guess it could work if the max damage increased per stack, but Kindred's strength really lies in late game objective pressure. \n\nAuto range is too short, requiring him to stand dangerously close to the enemy, which means either all fights require ulti usage to get the enemy to low health, or simply staying back and not doing anything until an assassin dives. Way too defensive, considering the fact Kindred is an offense-based-counter jungling champion. Make this larger, and he beats a lot of ADCs in viability.\n\nAlso, the passive puts a lot of pressure on Kindred to build full Attack speed and armour penetration, at least until he gets ridiculous amounts of it\n------\nAbilities: generally turns Kindred into a \"just right click when needed champion\", which is what the marksman update is trying to fix\n----\nQ: Lowers DPS at high amounts of AS, and is really limited late game due to bad scaling and range. It's great to avoid taking damage from camps. Also lowers mobility at high amounts of MS. I know Vayne does this too, but she's not limited to an area to do so.\n\nI actually wished the modified 2 second cooldown scaled with CDR, I really like using it. Unfortunately, it's mad crazy in power early on due to the fact camps don't move around while teamfights do. Later on, it deals miniscule amounts of damage and is only used for mobility\n----\nW: \n\nPassive: I don't really like the lack of scaling on W, having 1 rank in W then never needing to touch it again is kinda annoying. I wish it scaled with a stat dependant on rank or at least _something_ that makes it worth taking\n\nActive: Amazing zoning, but activating it's just an activate and forget ability, and it puts pressure on the team to keep the teamfight in the zone or lose a lot of damage.\n----\nE: It's fun to use, but only becomes a finisher later on\n\nSo 5% max HP at all ranks, and a pretty mediocre amount of damage, at a short ish range, but with an amazing slow. It works great against buffs, but is capped for dragon and baron. The slow is what stops it from being completely forgotten about.\n----\nR: The passive and ultimate are what everything about Kindred's effectiveness revolve around. The heal is kinda bad later on due to no scaling but that's not the main point of the ultimate. Not dying is a huge thing, but Kindred's range forces him to stay in a range similar to a burst based champ for enough time for a sustained damage champ to kill, so the ultimate is pretty much required\n----\n\nThis is what I propose for some of these problems, only : \nThe amount of damage each stack can do is capped, but more stacks still equals more, potentially infinite damage to camps.\nE base damage is lowered and scales very lightly with stacks, but still max HP damage and not current HP damage. Probably 0.25% per stack or something.\nCan auto attack while moving from Q, and Q damage scales very very very extremely lightly with stacks, maybe 0.1% damage per stack or something, and base damage is lowered a bit. Also the speed of movement scales with movement speed a bit because it's so slow.\nKindred starts with one stack (So Kindred can't be killed by the first few camps due to terrible damage)\nLower amount of damage per stack\nLower AD scalings even further, to Tristana levels.\nQ prioritzes champions (god it's so annoying to gank with that thing)\n\nNow instead of relying on items, Kindred can rely on a balance of counter jungling and ganks, but still scale off items as a backup plan if counterpicked.","replies":[{"poster":"Divewing","date":"2015-11-07T10:32:28.944+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"Kindred.\nIs.\nA.\nTHEY!\nITS NOT DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Omiwom","date":"2015-11-08T06:56:50.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason she's unfair is because if she's ahead, you can't attack her.

She has high bases and poorish scaling, armor stacking is good against her, she also kinda struggles to force aggression in her own but teammates help with that. \n\nMaking w only proc in jungle or nerfing it substantially is entirely unnecessary and would just remove her from viability in lane. She's only 500 range (stop comparing her to 550 range vayne) and lacks ways to extend beyond that easily like sivir Q and doesn't have anything like a spell shield. Without it she just loses her niche as an adc and isn't worthwhile top. The removal of mana potions is actually a fairly significant nerf to lane kindred as is. She has to commit to her engages fairly heavily (blowing w early is required, have to commit 70 mana to a cruddy version of silver bolts) and any half decent disengage (please just don't fight in her w) or just proper use of the bushes can kinda throw her into farm mode. In bot lane most adcs easily outscale her and in top lane a bruiser will have way more map presence through the mid game (shes pretty easy to shove in).  Shes really a snowbally champion due to her passive and early game strength, and if you just treat her as such they're really not too threatening in lane.\n\nKindred + azir is freaking busted.
