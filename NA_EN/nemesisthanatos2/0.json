In a recent game i made a thing i really wanted to add into the guide to prove it works (1 shot with ult penta) but after the game i saw that the replay wont be recorded due to the issue riot has with it. Is there any way i can somehow download or find a program that can help me get the replay for a finished game?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-24T23:37:35.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really sucks to hear that this caused a delay in creating your stream content, a streamer already has a lot to deal with!  I don't really have context towards the current issues with some replays not saving, or know of any way to force it back.  My hope is that once the issue is resolved per the [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page, that those missing replays could make a come back though it's unlikely.  \n\nIf not, I hope you might find another clip asap!  If it might help, try asking around the boards to see if other players might have highlights of what you're looking for.   Sorry for the hassle, but good luck!","replies":[]}]}
