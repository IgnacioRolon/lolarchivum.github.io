We are interested in working with Riot Games to create an online blood drive in which in-game rewards such as RP and an exclusive blood donation themed skin for Vladimir would be given to players who donate blood or refer others for blood donation. What would you guys think about a blood donation themed Vlad? Do you have any ideas on what he might look like?\r\n\r\nWe are also trying to figure out how much of the LoL playerbase is eligible for blood donation, and what kind of rewards they would like for doing so. With the size of this game&#039;s playerbase, this is something which has the potential to save a lot of lives. If this is something you would like to see happen (or even if it&#039;s not), please take the survey above and let us know.

With the number of players League has now, I fully expect the amount of blood we collect from this drive to be record breaking.\n\nI'd love to talk more with you about this.

It shouldn't leave my body from any means other than natural. Not to mention the pain and suffering of having to donate... I don't hate on the Red Cross or any other blood donor groups, but a lot of their people are under-trained for finding veins.
