It&#039;s like a stop-motion capture of Gangplank being painted onto wood that morphs into a animation where the paint shifts to make his image seem magical and alive. It&#039;s unbelievably awesome and the music just magnifies its awesomeness.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to make it and if you can, please continue to come up with creative stuff like that. The art aspect of this game is a major part of what draws me to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Pabro","date":"2015-07-23T02:38:21.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad you dig it!
