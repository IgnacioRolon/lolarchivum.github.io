The one saving grace of this patch is the ADC changes.","url":"https://youtu.be/2fv47DG9jQo?t=1448","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2fv47DG9jQo/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":28,"down_votes":25,"body":"He starts going on about it at about 24:08 and I linked the video at that time. \r\n\r\nHe essentially says that after all the brutal nerfing to ANY mid lane champ that even thinks about showing up in the meta, its gotten to the point where \"no mid laners really deal any damage anymore\" compared to ADC. He believes champions like orianna, karma, liss or lulu may start showing up mid just to stat check protect the crit ADC (the 1v9 damage dealer) and how the new PD has completely nullified any hope for assassins (on a personal note, if you think about BT shield + PD + overshield rune + GA how disgusting + the support shielding returning, how disgusting). He also talks about how so many champions are so incredibly bad compared to the \"good\" champions and how mid lane has none of them. Talks about how league always goes through this cycle of how mid and jungle start sucking and top is just top and the entire game just becomes crit ADCs and their protection from other roles. He called the ADC changes \"a bomb\" into the game and defines \"a bomb\" as something that is overtuned and doesnt get hotfixed and just thrown into the game unchecked which proceeds to \"warp the meta\" around it, he does state bombs are interesting.\r\n\r\nHe goes on about it for like 10 mins , I suggest everyone check it out, its very eye-opening. I do find it odd that anytime a champion becomes interesting or popular in the mid lane, its instantly nerfed. But ADC mains who continue this repeating cycle of demanding buffs have normalized the game's climate/culture to expect ADCs to be running around as the most important member of the team as the \"norm\" where as whenever a mid lane champ becomes the most important character on the team its insta nerfed. I do agree with him on midlaners dealing no dmg anymore, why land your abilities to deal like 500-600 dmg when a vayne or something can just stand and auto attack for 800-900 Qs or 500 phys+500 true dmg hits coming at very high sustained unavoidable dps. \r\n\r\nA good example is how zed (a champion that people generally dont like to deal with and a champion that is often regarded to have really high damage) will often have his ult pop for 800-1200 dmg which is alot but when you realize draven can literally auto once with an axe and the new IE shiv BT LW conqueror etc for nearly that amount or when vayne can press Q , proc the 3 hit true dmg, and get a crit to do what like 1200 dmg? Its pretty insane. When riot initially reworked IE , they also changed up Cait's headshot and _**buffed it significantly**_ to make up for the loss of crit multi on IE , which cait's headshot had a unique interaction with. Now they have reintroduced the old IE and cait's headshot is still left as it is. The end result is seeing leblancs lose 70% of their hp if they step on a trap to late game caitlyn. Is that fair? especially when traps can be placed underneath you when you are hard cc'd by like a sej or something.","replies":[{"poster":"boricCentaur1","date":"2019-02-08T12:35:09.223+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":5,"body":"Ummmmmm why is this getting up votes???

I agree that burst damage is in a crazy state at the moment. Unless the champ is specifically designed to one shot something, I don't feel that is appropriate. The problem comes in with this wave balancing. Riot has been taking short passes at things that are too strong, which is typically a good thing. I personally feel that things that are under performing now, may be fine once everything else is tuned down to the same level... Until then it feels really bad. I'm not sure if there's a better way to get to the damage point they want.\n\nSpecifically around mid the meta has shaken more around burst tanks and long range poke/safety. This doesn't leave much room for the mid range control mages, assassins, or things that need to scale in the game. I think these roles have been nerfed over time, but as other things have risen up, they haven't been addressed due to not wanting to \"increase damage in the game.\" That's where I get frustrated as a mid main.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OtterlyLost","date":"2019-02-08T12:15:48.946+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":9,"body":"Brutal nerfs?

Adcs have great single target damage, but Annie (who isn't even that strong of a mid right now) can burst an adc near instantly while cc'ing and heavily damaging the remainder of the enemy team. \n\nAlso, no dominant mid champs got nerfed except for the two everyone bitched about - Akali and irelia. Granted, Cass got nerfed as well, but that was bc of her dominance in other lanes. \n\nAre we about to enter a meta where adcs are overbearing? Maybe.

Yes but it is still satisfying to go back and forth hitting my Q following my enemy to let it snap back just for poke or get that Q in for an all in and still get him when he flashes. There is so much that is fun and satisfying about that champ. \n\nSame reason i still play GP even when he is absolute dogshit because i love that character and there is so many things fun about him even when he doesn'T even barrel oneshot anymore. \n\nThen there is adcs and all you can hope for is rightclick someone for 1/3 of their hp bar and that is pretty much all the excitement. Atleast when we are talking about the typical crit ADCs. Varus, ashe, ezreal are champs and even jhin who have more around their kit that make them fun to play even if they don't rightclick really hard. \n\nBut twitch, draven, caitlyn, jinx, tristana. What do they bring in excitement? Throw a W on someone as twitch and slow them abit. Is that exciting? \nCaitlyn? Wow i autowon laning phase because i picked caitlyn yeeeee. Draven's entire existing is \"i rightclick really hard\". Jinx maybe has her resets in teamfights i think? Or hitting her ult okay, i guess? \n\n\nAnd the worst thing is as u mentioned that the entire rift has to bow down whenever adcs are strong. 8/10 players have to play around one player.

He would happily sacrifice low elo if it meant pro play remained intact. He speaks about how weak all champions are, then goes on to talk about how it should be a mechanical game where you win due to your own actions as opposed to just playing the best champions in any given role that are simply overpowered. In this video he speaks about how Zoe should be buffed, something Riot would never do, otherwise she will simply go back to being a 90% ban rate, because he simply does not give a sh*t about solo queue players below Challenger. \n\nHe loses his mind when things get nerfed because they're strong in low elo/have an extremely high ban rate, despite not being super high priority in competitive or high elo. He seems to completely forget that pro play will only exist so long as people are willing to watch it. If people lose interest in League, then they'll stop watching pro play, meaning the prize pool for competitive will shrink, meaning pros leave the game for a more profitable game. \n\nI think LS is a brilliant coach and his understanding of the game is scarily good at times, but only in the pro scene. He talks about how Lissandra isn't strong, she just gets picked as everything else is so weak, which simply isn't true at all. She is strong because of how safe she is with Aftershock. Point and click stun that damages all enemies around the target/free zhonyas that heals her up, whilst also damages all enemies around her. Not to mention how if she cc's anyone she becomes virtually unkillable for a couple of seconds, whilst dishing out fairly substantial damage to you in return.

He believes champions like orianna, karma, liss or lulu may start showing up mid just to stat check protect the crit ADC (the 1v9 damage dealer) and how the new PD has completely nullified any hope for assassins (on a personal note, if you think about BT shield + PD + overshield rune + GA how disgusting + the support shielding returning, how disgusting). He also talks about how so many champions are so incredibly bad compared to the &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; champions and how mid lane has none of them. Talks about how league always goes through this cycle of how mid and jungle start sucking and top is just top and the entire game just becomes crit ADCs and their protection from other roles. He called the ADC changes &amp;quot;a bomb&amp;quot; into the game and defines &amp;quot;a bomb&amp;quot; as something that is overtuned and doesnt get hotfixed and just thrown into the game unchecked which proceeds to &amp;quot;warp the meta&amp;quot; around it, he does state bombs are interesting.\n> \n> He goes on about it for like 10 mins , I suggest everyone check it out, its very eye-opening. I do find it odd that anytime a champion becomes interesting or popular in the mid lane, its instantly nerfed. But ADC mains who continue this repeating cycle of demanding buffs have normalized the game&amp;#039;s climate/culture to expect ADCs to be running around as the most important member of the team as the &amp;quot;norm&amp;quot; where as whenever a mid lane champ becomes the most important character on the team its insta nerfed. I do agree with him on midlaners dealing no dmg anymore, why land your abilities to deal like 500-600 dmg when a vayne or something can just stand and auto attack for 800-900 Qs or 500 phys+500 true dmg hits coming at very high sustained unavoidable dps. \n> \n> A good example is how zed (a champion that people generally dont like to deal with and a champion that is often regarded to have really high damage) will often have his ult pop for 800-1200 dmg which is alot but when you realize draven can literally auto once with an axe and the new IE shiv BT LW conqueror etc for nearly that amount or when vayne can press Q , proc the 3 hit true dmg, and get a crit to do what like 1200 dmg? Its pretty insane. When riot initially reworked IE , they also changed up Cait&amp;#039;s headshot and _**buffed it significantly**_ to make up for the loss of crit multi on IE , which cait&amp;#039;s headshot had a unique interaction with. Now they have reintroduced the old IE and cait&amp;#039;s headshot is still left as it is. The end result is seeing leblancs lose 70% of their hp if they step on a trap to late game caitlyn. Is that fair? especially when traps can be placed underneath you when you are hard cc&amp;#039;d by like a sej or something.\n\n\nADC still are 100% reliant on their team to survive and 100% the weakest champion on the map for first 20mins of the game.\nExploit that window if you are so scared of them.\nADC has literally been in the dumpster for the last 8+ months.\nHeaven forbid they can actually be allowed do their role properly now..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jinzo best card","date":"2019-02-08T15:29:54.839+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed, buff every immobile mage (except Ori).","replies":[{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2019-02-08T18:17:35.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, instead of that nerf or gut ADCs so game wont be warped around them.

Nerfed reverts? Are likely to just immediately bring back his main counters and weaken him right away.\n\nI do agree that this will affect the rest of the game though. \n\nThen he goes and calls every midlane champ weak and shit and states that lissandra is only good because no one can kill her when she procs aftershock and the solution to this is to buff her old counters damage.......does he not really realize that if those counters got their damage buffed to the point of breaking through aftershock those counters would be insanely OP and oppressive towards everyone else? Non tank melee and marksmen wouldnt exist at all, no matter what they do, it would a game completely centered around midlane and potentially tanks, mages would probably be picked botlane.\n\n\n\nFurthermore any champ that becomes popular in midlane to the point of standing out is usually so because they perform miles ahead of everyone else, like arcane comet cassiopeia for a recent example, when the people playing her were good she did insane amounts of damage, especially combined with the liandry buffs earlier on.\n\nLike sure,it would have been possible to buff her opponents instead but i am fairly sure this would easily result in them being broken as well, like malzahar would have his latest nerfs reverted and then go back to being the nr 1 midlaner due to insane AP ratios combied with a point and click stun that also does high max health AOE damage. \n\n\nBut OP you do raise a good point on the Caitlyn passive but it is worth noting that the current IE only adds 25% bonus crit damage instead of the old 50%, so while Cait will probably end up needing a nerf it wont be that much. .....and we she got those buffs in the first place because she was too damn terrible without them, and even with them she couldnt handle Lucian who was supposed to be easy. \n\nBut then you being to compare Zed to lategame marksmen which comes out as odd, like sure Zed has nowhere near the damage of the marksmen at that point......but how can you ignore the fact that Zed with a good ult can basically kill anyone from 6 onwards while most marksmen need like 3 items to even get into the game properly? .....Emphasis on most. \n\nFurthermore what the heck is a LB doing getting caught by a Sejuani?  This example is all manners of strange, if a LB gets caught like that for so long that a cait can manage to walk up, place her trap and have it activate before LB gets to move again then that LB has goofed badly. \n\nAnd given that LB also has the privilege of being able to just instantly crush most marksmen easily before 3-4 items she kinda deserves dying that fast if caught later. \n\n\nThen this you wrote : \n\n>.

While buffing champions will solve problems of abuse, such as Lissandra abusing Aftershock, it also shoves those answers into a position of power in and of themselves. Their power won't be limited to dealing with Lissandra, they themselves will take over the meta with their new strength. Following that trend, the answers to those champions get buffed, and so on and so forth. Nerfing what is too strong and saving buffs for those who are blatantly underperforming is how balance should work. There are always going to be strong picks in the meta, but his method of dealing with it just enforces a different, more damage heavy meta rather than going around the issue and nerfing things that need to be tuned down, such as Aftershock making champions nearly unkillable in the early game, in all lanes (Lissandra, Galio, Alistar, Thresh, etc).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tychusfindlay918","date":"2019-02-08T19:36:47.835+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"give A B C D and E more damage and lissandra won't be a problem\"\n\nLS is a fucking 10-year old sounding airhead.\n\nTHE GAME DOESN'T NEED MORE DAMAGE.","replies":[]}]}
