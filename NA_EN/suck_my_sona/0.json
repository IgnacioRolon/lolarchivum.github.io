This denies Elements on getting more cs and more kills , which in fact hurts their fantasy LCS score. If you are one of the few teams playing in the splits, you should not be here to surrender. I think it shows poor sportsmanship and they should not be allowed to do that. Did this surrender hurt anyone? If it did do you think they should be allowed to surrender? Why or why not.","replies":[{"poster":"WD40PyRO","date":"2015-03-03T20:13:01.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with this discussion is the concept of professional gaming organizations. The word professional has certain societal constructs that build upon us all. The idea that a professional athlete (whether in physical or electronic sports) in any aspect surrenders is demoralizing for fans as well as an insult to the profession itself. Even against all of the odds, individuals/teams should endure losses even at a high cost. I have seen teams come back from the most unrealistic odds. It occurs in the LCS every year. Point given 1980 USA vs USSR Olympic Hockey. They lost a game like 13-2, but learned from it and came back later that year to win 4-3. These are moments fans and players all look forward too..\n\nGiving teams the ability to surrender does not promote eSports in any shape or form. It may save time, but enduring through the hardships only assist these teams like MYM and Coast to understand their mistakes. Clearly, surrendering and going over film has not helped. They are still bottom of the standings. \n\nYes, Fantasy LCS was constructed to further explore the passion of the fans with the players of the game. I lost this past week by 4 points. These points would have been made up if Froggen would have been able to play longer than 20-25 minutes against MYM. No one raises an eye brow when their poor decision making in drafting for players that end up in games that go 70 minutes long complain. Let's be honest. No one wants to watch 8th and 9th place fight for 80 minutes to find out they are still facing relegation. The issue still remains the same that surrenders should never be allowed. \n\nIf surrendering is to be allowed. Out of respect for the fans and the sport...certain criteria should be met. Time. Gold Discrepancy. Objective Control. Etc. No one will surrender in baseball unless forced to by run rule. No one will surrender in basketball regardless if they lose by 50 points. No one will surrender in Super Bowl 48 even if they lose 43 - 8 and have to watch their entire season down the drain. They learn and build from losing with honor. \n\nThanks,\n\nWD","replies":[]},{"poster":"SÃ½ndra Bot","date":"2015-03-02T21:55:45.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There should not be surrendering in eSports. It doesn't happen in physical sports and it shouldn't happen here. It is obviously an important mechanic in regular league, but with hundreds of thousands of people watching, it's bad showmanship.

People complained about the same thing last year when SK surrendered to Alliance, and they missed out on fantasy points. I'm pretty sure that's the main reason riot added the >30min wins bonus. Still, the teams should have the right to surrender if they see there is no possible outcome in which they are victorious. For one thing, it saves fantasy points for anyone who started them. For two, if they couldn't surrender, what's to stop a team from trolling and drawing out the game just to demoralize their opponents.","replies":[{"poster":"Suck My Sona","date":"2015-02-26T22:47:14.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point.

I feel like I'm being trolled. This whole conversation is ridiculous.\n\nBetting on Fantasy LoL with money aside (that's just, stupid), Fantasy League was provided to the community based on a fun competition outside of actually playing league. It's a gimmick by Riot to promote NA/EU LCS even more.\n\nHaving a Winning team stall out a game they could have won 20-30 minutes sooner is not entertaining at all. I don't believe Fantasy Points should mean more than the actual game, if the games are boring people will lose interest (regardless of the points). Same thing for losing teams having to face against teams stalling for fantasy points, a loss is a detriment to morale as it is. Having to play possibly an hour long game twice a week with the added possibility of being trolled in such a way could ruin teams (Looking at you Dig and MYM).\n\nSo get off your short sighted and completely troll attitude that Fantasy should be anything more than fun for people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smart Kitty","date":"2015-02-26T23:41:38.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Suck My Sona,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=azOLNwEi,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-02-26T22:47:14.839+0000)\n>\n> Good point.

At the most they should make it 35. If they surrender later than that, you're not really missing out on too many points. I doubt teams would surrender past 35 mins anyways. Either that, or keep the 30 min limit, but add another points option for surrenders (since they are really rare).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Amosdragon","date":"2015-02-26T22:29:11.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you get money if you win your Fantasy match?

Surrendering is a mechanic that is part of the game. It is part of many other games where it is common (Chess, tennis etc.). It does not hurt elements, nor does it hurt LCS. \n\nIn this game MYM found a near perfect engage. Solar Flare and fish on rekkles, but they were too far behind so it wasn't enough. They can't (and won't) fight anymore. There is no point. They have 2 options. 1. Play extremely passive and give up every objective to Elements and hope they make a gigantic blunder or 2. surrender.\n\nFantasy does not matter. It has no bearing on actual LCS, professional teams are not concerned with fantasy scores while they are playing.\n\nThe only real argument to prevent surrendering would be because of the fans present at the game. They are the only people who are hurt by a surrender.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Strommsawyer","date":"2015-02-26T22:05:33.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dislike the surrender mechanic in games like League quite a bit, but I understand why they have it.
