The story goes like this. I was playing Nasus into Jayce and i fed mega hard because i was tilted and couldn't concentrate, the reason i said that about cait is because she seriously refused to leash our jungler so that's that, then i continued to get one shot early game by Jayce and i didn't know what to do anymore. I wasn't about to give up though, i tried grouping with my team to take him out and we actually fought back pretty damn hard but i digress.\r\n\r\nSo all i can think of is i got a chat restriction for saying ''yes i fed''\r\nI MEANT FED AS IN YES I DIED FOR NO REASON\r\nBut i didn't LITERALLY run it down into the enemy team, i even got commended by a team mate for not giving up and not quiting. And i get this..\r\nI'm honestly upset over this shit\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nZ is cool: im wondering if their bot is a duo\r\nZ is cool: i like singing for fun not because im good\r\nZ is cool: cait?\r\nZ is cool: NO SHES A CLOWN\r\nZ is cool: WTF\r\nZ is cool: POOR J4\r\nZ is cool: this is depressing\r\nZ is cool: that's great jayce, i'm muting you now\r\nZ is cool: i was full health\r\nZ is cool: alright\r\nZ is cool: gg my lane\r\nZ is cool: i fucked it\r\nZ is cool: its fine\r\nZ is cool: it's my fault he's fed\r\nZ is cool: I GOT FUCKING ONE SHIT\r\nZ is cool: WHAT\r\nZ is cool: i cant do shit in lane with nami\r\nZ is cool: fuck\r\nZ is cool: even without nami\r\nZ is cool: all i can do is farm but you guys will be dealing with that fucking jayce\r\nZ is cool: ....\r\nZ is cool: you didnt leash your j4\r\nZ is cool: go ahead\r\nZ is cool: you'll just die\r\nZ is cool: im about to mute your ass\r\nZ is cool: jesus you're annoying\r\nZ is cool: yes i fed\r\nZ is cool: get over it\r\nZ is cool: ????\r\nZ is cool: what\r\nZ is cool: i didnt feed on purpose\r\nZ is cool: lux stop feeding\r\nZ is cool: can you just play\r\nZ is cool: instead of typing\r\nZ is cool: we scale\r\nZ is cool: incase you didnt notice\r\nZ is cool: ^\r\nZ is cool: what mistake am i making huh\r\nZ is cool: want me to walk into jg blind\r\nZ is cool: caitlyn is literally sitting here trash talking me\r\nZ is cool: telling us to give up\r\nZ is cool: can we get a 9x report\r\nZ is cool: stop pinging i heard it\r\nZ is cool: chill\r\nZ is cool: he replaces me\r\nZ is cool: dw i'm out cs'ing him\r\nZ is cool: pog\r\nZ is cool: j4 is a gamer\r\nZ is cool: i cant do much here\r\nZ is cool: cait keeps calling me shit\r\nZ is cool: she's literally just running it down\r\nZ is cool: what do you want me to do about it\r\nZ is cool: no\r\nZ is cool: literally\r\nZ is cool: tell me what to do\r\nZ is cool: if you're so wise\r\nZ is cool: tell me\r\nZ is cool: thats what i thought\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's it, place your judgements, can anyone relate? etc etc","replies":[{"poster":"Quiet Dude","date":"2019-12-03T22:20:17.957+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overly critical of your team, constant criticism, asking for reports, calling folks clowns, etc. But I do have some advice to help prevent this in the future:\n\n\"Z is cool: can you just play\nZ is cool: instead of typing\"","replies":[{"poster":"Z is cool","date":"2019-12-03T22:22:05.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is there nothing like a permanent mute all so i won't forget to mute everyone, if there was that option i'd definitely do it and never talk in chat again, i'm tired of the auto response bot","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-12-03T22:28:43.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Disabling chat makes you a liability to your team, especially if they dont know you did it.

That is not punishable. It isn't punishable to mute pings (even if you're muting pings from the get-go), and it isn't punishable to disable/mute chat - in point of fact, I'm pretty sure Riot straight-up added that feature semi-recently (with the Mute Allied Chat feature).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Quiet Dude","date":"2019-12-03T22:24:12.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is, actually.
