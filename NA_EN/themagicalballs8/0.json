I play fiddle quite frequently and it's fairly easy to outplay him. \n1. When he's low on mana, he's a sitting duck-he's quite ability reliant\n2. Focus him in teamfights and he gets melted in a couple seconds\n3. Ward bushes near lanes so he can't ult in\n4. If you see him channeling his ult, almost any form of CC will cancel it\n5. Again, he's quite ability reliant, so if you know his Q and E are on cool down, he can fear or silence you while draining, making it that easier to kill him\n6. If you're playing ranked, pick champions with high burst damage to counter him. He easily counters almost all sustain damage champs because he can just sit there and drain them. Burst damage champs can easily melt him in a few seconds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cheekynorth","date":"2016-06-26T13:39:42.384+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's your fault you try to engage him. What you should be doing is not engaging. Fiddle is in no way overpowered, and you begging for nerfs because you aren't as skilled as your opponent/don't know how to outplay him is not gonna help you win. Play against a friend, ask him to play Fiddle while you Katarina. You'll learn the counterplay when fighting him","replies":[]},{"poster":"spombjop","date":"2016-06-26T13:40:43.322+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:32}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Carry Together","date":"2016-06-26T13:42:19.707+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fiddle is a shitty champ actually, you have to understand the game 10 times better than your opponent to win the game in current meta.

Let's see...\nRank 3 (being really generous with that) magic damage per second: 325\nFidd's ult ap ratio: 0.45\nFidd's quoted ap: 100\nActual damage from one second in ult: 370\n\nOkay now for a real analysis: I know this was early/mid game because the fidd had only 100 ap and you were talking about winning/losing lane so he probably had just rank 1 ult.\n\nFidd's rank 1 ult base damage per second: 125\nsame ap and ratio\nactual damage per second from fidd: 170\n\nSo now we know you were in that ult for the entire duration because it would take the full 5 seconds to inflict that much damage and kill you simply based on raw damage numbers and not even calculating defenses","replies":[]},{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2016-06-26T14:01:08.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best joke post of the day IMO","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2016-06-26T13:54:06.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Super squishy and probably one of the easiest champs to counter jungle. His silence has a low duration, you can cleanse or QSS out of his fear, and his heal is easy to interupt. Fiddle has been nerfed multiple times. His R does do a crap ton of damage, but it is very telegraphed and you can easily kill him before it ends if you focus him. That's why he isn't a big threat until he gets {{item:3157}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrPharmD","date":"2016-06-26T13:41:33.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is bait","replies":[]}]}
