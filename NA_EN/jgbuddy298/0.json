When a game is about to launch, i get a \"Bad Image\" error saying d3dx9_39.dll is not designed to run on windows, or contains an error.\r\n\r\nThings I've Tried:\r\n- Re-installed League three times\r\n- Re-downloaded DirectX 9\r\n- Downloaded and replaced d3dx9_39.dll\r\n- Updated graphics drivers\r\n- Updated windows\r\n- Ran as administrator\r\n- Used league Repair function\r\n- Tried with and without alpha client\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated, i'm not sure what to try next. If I don't find a solution soon i may just have to uninstall, constant crashes are such a nuisance. My computer exceeds the recommended specs, and ran the game fine until a recent update.
