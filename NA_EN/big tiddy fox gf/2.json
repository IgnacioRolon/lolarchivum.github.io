Since you sent the gift last night, with IP, you should still be getting the icon! It doesn't really matter when she 'opened' the gift, as that notification is just that, a notification. Rakan was added to her account before the event ended, so you should still be getting it within 2 weeks!","replies":[{"poster":"Big Tiddy Fox GF","date":"2017-04-28T03:08:17.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, I was just afraid, cuz imo this is the best icon along with Koi Nami icon so far ;u;\n\nTy Broporo !","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-28T04:03:24.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries Edenn!
