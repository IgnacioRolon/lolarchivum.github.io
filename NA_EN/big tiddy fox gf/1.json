I tried to repair it from the new client, but it did nothing :/\nShould I download the missing files? If yes, where should I put them?","replies":[{"poster":"Flayne","date":"2017-04-03T02:03:39.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi have you tried launching the new client and at the bottom right corner tried clicking on the \"Launch Legacy Client\" I do this all the time to gain access to the legacy client.
