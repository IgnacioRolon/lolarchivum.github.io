I&#039;ve been noticing it every time I play into Galio but he can literally out-damage me as Aatrox (Aatrox, yes I know he&#039;s a meme but Aatrox is legitimately one of the best first blood champions in the game, his early trades and damage spikes are very strong) and continue to do so without building any damage whatsoever. \nI&#039;m no Galio expert so I don&#039;t really know his champion or even gameplay weaknesses that well but besides the fact that he has some cooldowns and mana costs (albeit very small) what really holds this guy back from doing some insane burst throughout the entire game? \n\nIn my game yesterday where I played Galio (which was my first normal game with him), I went toe to toe with fizz who I think is a pretty decent laner and despite scrapping with him and not watching my hp go down by minions I took him to 10hp in our lvl 1-3 trade before going down. \nLater on in that game, I legitimately took him down to 20-30%hp with just a skill rotation and passive weaving whilst only having Iceborn + Abyssal Mask and also only receiving almost minimum damage in return.\n\nIs this meant to be right? Because it just seems like he&#039;s a wee bit over-tuned.\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}\n\nEdit: Okay, so after managing to find another game against Galio utilizing a different strategy I've found some success. Basically, going back to the routes of split-pushing and primarily focusing on pure DPS and Defence, I managed to back Galio into a corner where he couldn't leave top to assist his team nullifying half his kit and then by stacking MR items alongside taking exhaust I managed to outsustain his frequent Q bursts and enable myself to go in for the kill.\n\nEdit 2: To the person who told that I was \"bad\" at dodging, I'm just going to say that after that game I'm very sure my dodging ability improved, HOWEVER, dodging Galio's Q as a melee champion is ridiculously hard unless you've zoned yourself off the minions. The hitbox on that ability is extremely big and comes from two places before chunking you on the initial hit. One of those abilities and it took off a potions worth of hp in no time - and that shit is on a low c/d. \n\nEdit 3: I still think he does a bit too much damage but at least now, I have a strategy against him.","replies":[{"poster":"DemainaNyx","date":"2017-09-27T11:21:59.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something you have to remember is that CC is basically extra tanky stats, because people aren't doing damage to you when they are CC'd.  So, if a Caitlyn is autoing you for 100 damage a second, but you CC her for 2 seconds, that CC basically gave you 200 hp.\n\nAdditionally, Galio has AP, bonus MR, and Max health scalings on his abilities, vs someone like Fizz who only has AP ratios.  So if Galio builds Banshee, he gets bonus stats from both the MR and the AP, while Fizz only gets it from the AP.  Same if Galio builds Abyssal Mask, he benefits from all three plus the 10% aura, while Fizz would use just the AP in scaling and the 10% aura (not that Fizz would build that item).\n\nLastly, Galio has damage reduction in his taunt, so that gives him even more durability without needing items.\n\nSo your items not only benefit your abilities in multiple ways, but give you health and resistances that negate some of Fizz's damage, while most items Fizz would buy offer no resistances or health to counter your damage.  If you built Luden's and Lich Bane on Galio, you would still be somewhat tanky due to your abilities, but probably die to a Fizz combo.","replies":[{"poster":"Slave Knight","date":"2017-09-27T12:29:52.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the analysis!\nI can definitely see why I was out-trading fizz. I just kinda wrote this up because I felt Galio does his damage in such a safe manner that it felt a little 'cheap' to me but if anything, I got some idea of fighting him next time we square up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2017-09-27T10:44:23.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't stand in his q, and force him to either q you OR the minion wave -- not both. Dodge his e as best you can. Get some sustain and voila, he is useless vs you in toplane. He's really not overtuned compared to most toplaners as long as you play it right. If you are an ap squishy top like rumble... then, you might not have so much fun. But you can definitely still farm just fine and look for teamfights - which is mostly what rumble does anyways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2017-09-27T10:07:38.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who Galileo? Nah, he's always been the big intellectual anti mage brute he is, It's prob his extra ability passive since early game he can cheese cause he has more abilities than you like {{champion:122}}  lvl 1 and his passive.
