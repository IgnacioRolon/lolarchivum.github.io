Yeah well, that's all I've been feeling ever since the Aatrox rework.\n\nI don't think I've ever been a competitive person when it came to ranked queues but when I had Aatrox in my hands, my drive and passion was solely devoted on being the best that I could be on that champion even if all I played was predominantly norms. From my humble beginnings in S3 where I first discovered Aatrox to the peaks of S5 and S7 (where major changes occurred, including the Aatrox light rework), somewhere down the line playing Aatrox was synonymous to playing LoL itself to me. As my passion waned over the years and my jealousy and hatred towards reworks and releases pushing out more and more powerful kits grew, I was super hyped for the rework when I heard about it early this year. Although I heard the words of the devs and knew Aatrox was going on a big departure to what I knew and loved, I still wanted to believe that it could instill the satisfaction of the champion whom I spent all these years enjoying and mastering. Unfortunately to this day, it still doesn't scratch my itch. I've tried other champions in the meantime but there's just nothing. It's amazing to think about but seriously, within the 142 champion roster there is not ONE champion that makes me feel like I did playing old Aatrox, not one. Despite how similar some champions get, they just never resonated with me and it's pretty interesting to think about how Riot Jag actually hit the nail on the head with why I enjoyed Aatrox in the first place. \n\nIt's not just me, a lot of us other Aatrox mains are just here... waiting for something to happen. Maybe we're just the old breed needing to die out but damn, I miss old Aatrox man.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuWsa8IJblw\n\nRIP AATROX.","replies":[{"poster":"FullmuteAll play","date":"2018-12-28T15:57:35.727+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same for old {{champion:6}} \nI am not saying new one is bad, but old one had absolutely different playstyle and was way more unique.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OtakuBurrito","date":"2018-12-29T01:16:54.922+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I loved Aatrox before and I had to learn him after.

A lot of the times they struggle to capture the same feel for the champion. Gp, Soraka, Yorick, and Warwick are all pretty good examples of a rework done right imo as they keep a similar feel. As for Raka and GP it's mostly in part of their most iconic parts being kept the same which isn't always great as seen with how Zac mains handled his.   \n\nWhen we compare Old Sion, Swain, Aatrox, Galio, and maybe Poppy(I can't input on Poppy as I rarely played Old Poppy) they playstyle has changed drastically.  \n\nWas a Sion OTP up until his rework. Old Sion was a sustain fighter or a burst mage based on how you played him. New Sion is a CC tank. While full AD/AP are options there's little reason to go for them outside of the occasional cheese gameplay. The only thing Sion has when compared to old Sion is his exploding shield, 100% lifesteal, and infinite health scaling. New Sion also has much more personality, diversity, skill expression, etc. While the champion is great and brought a lot more people to the champion it had the same issue as a lot of reworks in that it isolated part of the community who enjoyed the old champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Jerry SeinfeId","date":"2018-12-28T21:17:23.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> When we compare Old Sion, Swain, Aatrox, Galio, and maybe Poppy(I can&#x27;t input on Poppy as I rarely played Old Poppy) they playstyle has changed drastically.  \n\nThe only problem poppy's rework has is that she's most often meta being full tank. with old poppy ppl mostly went assassin or bruiser.

His ultimate was on a 20 second cooldown, and if there was a minion wave when you all-inned him, even with ignite it was pretty much guaranteed that he'd beat you since his ult was a toggled spell, and he could easily replenish his mana with the AoE effects of his spell killing minions around him and restoring 9+mana (that is at level 1 mind you, Swain had some of the best mana sustain right next to Karthus and Malzahar).\n\nCouple this with the fact that e+q could melt ANYTHING because his E was literally a built in Death Fire Grasp that increased all damage dealt, including damage dealt by ignite, and it didn't matter how ahead you were, because you unless stacked an obnoxious amount of magic resist, there was no real way to beat him other than using a kite champ, and then the range of his root was surprisingly big, meaning you had to constantly fall back as you fought him and get turret dove with him healing off the minions that were supposed to be protecting you.\n\nThe new iteration of Swain requires a lot more skill this time around, so while still does hammer people into the ground with his tankiness, he actually has to work harder to earn it now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sewer Side","date":"2018-12-28T19:40:00.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play Tryndamere.

Because he cannot handle a champion that takes precision and timing to play properly.

There is a difference between a champion being \"not hard to learn\", and a champion being a straight up no-brainer. Old Aatrox was a no-brainer stat check champion, and Riot knew that the moment he was buffed, he would become far too obnoxious, which is why he got reworked into the well rounded champion he is today. \n\nNew Aatrox is an amazing example of what a modern well designed fighter should play like. Old Aatrox was an example of a failed, rushed and poorly thought out design.\n\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/dpoula9d885.png","replies":[{"poster":"Bisaknosp","date":"2018-12-29T13:25:01.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"well rounded haha he is a broken piece of shit\nplus hes basically riven just easier +harder to fuck up with","replies":[{"poster":"Tin Obliterates","date":"2018-12-29T17:04:44.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Öskan,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ni02AA2s,comment-id=00150001,timestamp=2018-12-29T13:25:01.298+0000)\n>\n> well rounded haha he is a broken piece of shit\n> plus hes basically riven just easier +harder to fuck up with\n\nExcept that if he fucks up his Q rotation even once in a scenario when there's more than one person on him he's pretty much fucked.
