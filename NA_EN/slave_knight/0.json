It&#039;s been a wild ride guys.

Do you see this list? Guess what? You&#039;re not on it.

A lot has changed since you first seen entered this building. So much history... so much work. Now I presume you know why I called you here?\r\n\r\n{{champion:3}} : S-sir! I&#039;ve been informed that I was to receive my large scale VGU?\r\n\r\n{{champion:17}} : So you&#039;ve been informed... good, good! This makes it much easier. As you already know, here at Riot Games we strive to deliver the BEST experience to our players and patrons and to do this, sometimes we need to re-pave our own roads and re-build our own structures. You Galio, are the new face of grand rework project and are representing us on our latest and greatest champion rework. Here&#039;s the champion road map and skill set we&#039;ve devised... what do you think son?\r\n\r\n{{champion:3}} : It- It&#039;s beautiful...! I&#039;m truly honored sir. These two skills especially! I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen anyone with a double lined skill shot closing into the target location.... and THIS! The ability to fly high into the heavens and slam down with the force of mighty wings... how did you come up with this?!\r\n\r\n{{champion:17}} : *Cough*... Why, we&#039;ve designed them specifically for you son! Think about it, how many other handsome warriors can er... express their sheer amounts of uh... VOLUME that&#039;s right, volume through their ability to absolutely pulverise and smite their foes from the sky?\r\n\r\n{{champion:3}} I... I don&#039;t know how to thank you sir! If there&#039;s anything you need I&#039;ll gladly-\r\n\r\n{{champion:17}} : Shhh. Now, now child. It&#039;s okay. Here at Riot Games, we not only look out for the summoners but also our INVALUABLE assets, you champions. Now, I think I&#039;ve bored you with my talking long enough. Please Galio, step into the rework machine.\r\n\r\n{{champion:3}} : (Well... I guess this is it. This is my turning point. No longer will be I known as Galio the unpicked...  this time, I&#039;ll build my own legacy. Mordekaiser, Nunu, Urgot... I won&#039;t forget you guys! Let&#039;s meet again as reworked champions in the future!)\r\n\r\n*Back at the undesirable lounge*\r\n\r\n{{champion:266}} : Huff... huff.

Hehehe, get it Willump? *Hee hee hee, master you funny!*\r\n\r\n{{champion:82}} : Scorch marks and black lashes... what exactly happened there Aatrox?\r\n\r\n{{champion:266}} : You... you were right Morderkaiser.
