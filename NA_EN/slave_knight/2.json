I also feel, as an Aatrox main, completely betrayed with how they handled his kit. It feels incomplete, clunky beyond comprehension and, irredeemably sloppy. I KNOW that the devs behind this had difficulty finding a direction for Aatrox, but was this really the answer that they came to? This abomination of a rework?\n\nNot only have you destroyed 90% of what I knew and came to love as my champion, alienating me and my fellow mains, but you&#039;ve also succeeded into making him so insufferably not Aatrox that it infuriates me. This kit was clearly not aimed to please previous Aatrox players and mains.\n\nHere&#039;s a list of what some Aatrox mains loved in the champion before he became what he is now.\n1. His simplicity, because not every champion needs to be unnecessarily complicated or have annoying mechanics to manage\n2. His ability to adapt and play from behind. Contrary to popular and ignorant belief, Aatrox was one of the few true &#039;jack of all trades&#039; champions, most likely due to his nature as a &#039;Stat-check&#039; champion.\n3. His promotion of smart, aggressive playstyles and tactics. You didn&#039;t pick Aatrox to merely scale, you picked him because you wanted to really fuck shit up. It didn&#039;t matter who you played against, there was always a chance, no matter how slim, that Aatrox could turn lanes around with proper management of his abilities and passive power spikes.\n4. His ability to 1v1 and 1v2. Similarly to the point previously mentioned, his aggressive playstyle forced him into difficult situations, however, with a proper understanding of your champion and theirs, it was possible to turn ganks into favourable double kills.\n5. His use of auto attacks and ability to choose weapon stances. I understand that at certain points this ability was problematic, but it can&#039;t have been that bad because how much of an impact has this champion really had on the differing metas? Typically, he would ride the beneficial metas at a sleeper tier 2 with the current meta being an outlier, allowing him to come up to tier 1 with the nerfs to marksmans and tanks which kept him down. \n6. His reliable HEALING factor (which understandably is a point of contention)\n7. His revive (which is another point of contention with most Aatrox mains agreeing that&#039;d it be better to just scrap it for straight up, better defensive stats/steroids).\n8. His ult transformation and extension of attack range. It was a neat little mechanic that helped Aatrox get around being super kited whilest not necessarily making him ADC in melee form.\n\nOut of that entire list, Riot chose to take 3 points. With his healing factor and his revive being two of the most criticised components of his kit since his release. If I&#039;m going to be honest, those two were probably my least needed components of his kit with the healing being much more valuable than the passive but alas, here we are.\n\nLet&#039;s talk about the current Aatrox.\n\nFirst of all, I&#039;m just going to be brutally honest and say this - New Aatrox is FUNDAMENTALLY flawed. Despite Riot stating they&#039;ve figured out what direction to take him, I&#039;m not seeing it at all. \n\nWHAT DOES THIS CHAMPION WANT TO DO? HIS THEME AND GAMEPLAY ARE IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.\n\nYou&#039;re telling me this enraged, vengeful, fallen god-warrior seeks the oblivion of everyone and everything YET CANNOT SEEM TO HOLD HIS OWN AGAINST ANYONE IN LANE OR BETTER YET, TEAMFIGHT? What a bunch of crap.\n\n**The biggest sin that Riot has done to this rework, is put all their eggs in one basket and not even deliver on that.** 90% of Aatrox&#039;s damage resides in his Q ability and thus, if this ability doesn&#039;t deliver, his entire kit doesn&#039;t deliver. They&#039;ve funneled so much &#039;power&#039; into this ability that every single ability after it seems like an afterthought. Don&#039;t get me wrong, he has potential, but seriously, if EVERY SINGLE ability needs work than there&#039;s a serious underlying issue with the care and development of a rework. \n\nI&#039;ll just list it as I see it.\n\nStats: Mostly okay after the hotfix but 60 AD feels fucking dreadful, going to have to relearn last hitting with this potato AD value. \n\nPassive: Long as fuck cooldown with a cooldown resetting mechanic that promotes spamming abilities that have long cooldowns as well. Harder to use to initiate a fight, mostly used for hitting minions or ending a combo. \n\nQ - Self-roots you, slow, telegraphed, is inconsistent with its fighting range, long cooldown, has 1-second fucking delay per cast and the biggest joke of them all, has some of the most laughable base damages of any main ability I&#039;ve seen outside of its 3rd cast. What the fuck were you guys thinking when you made this ability? You&#039;ve put so many weaknesses on this ability that there&#039;s no possible way for it to ever be good like this.\n\nW - Not a bad ability but has very limited application as it is severely cock-blocked by minion collision, forcing players to use this at point blank range to guarantee the slow (not the pullback) or gamble at a distance. Oh, it also has a decently long cooldown 18 / 17 / 16 / 15 / 14.\n\nE - This ability feels like the epitome of tacked on. Tacked on healing, tacked on AD steroid, tacked on &#039;mobility&#039; but in reality, it&#039;s just a glorified positioning 0.2 casted hextech flash used to reposition your Q because god knows, that shit isn&#039;t going to land without this. Also, long as fuck cooldown after charges used.\n\nR - Probably the most anticipated ability alongside Aatrox&#039;s Q and the 2nd biggest disappointment. While I appreciate the return of the transformation ult, what does it actually accomplish? The revive could have been replaced with any other defensive steroid to make it actually more threatening and useful in a fight and the movement speed buff is a joke because WHAT JUGGERNAUT SEEKS TO RUN AWAY FROM A FIGHT, ESPECIALLY WITH A REVIVE PROMOTING HIM TO DIE IN BATTLE? While the AD buff is nice, it feels totally uninspired and like many others have said, lazy. His ult could have done so much more... empower his abilities, shorten his c/ds, increase his aoe range, make him a much more mobile fighter but no, it&#039;s just another steroid buff. \n\nI think I could keep going on but I realise I&#039;m just getting burnt out at this point. I&#039;ll take a break from him and hopefully, Aatrox gets an improvement somewhere down the line. I&#039;d like to acknowledge and appreciate the visual changes, teaser trailers and work done on his lore (especially twilight of the gods) but man, his gameplay has severely let me down.\n\nGood luck fixing this champion devs and good luck to me in finding and fixing all my grammatical errors lol.\n\nP.S Thanks for taking your time in reading and commenting guys, I do really appreciate it.

If auto-attacking is inherently a problem, this game needs to be turned into HoTS but with low c/d abilities and no way to right click lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2018-06-28T14:44:55.212+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":13,"body":"It's toxic because it's pure autoattack statchecking like Yi and Tryndamere.

He just autoattacks. All the time. That's the vast majority of what he's doing. He weaves in abilities even less than Trynd and Yi, both notorious autoattack based statcheckers. The pure reliance on just autoattacking and rightclicking people to death(and still outdueling with autoattacks) is what makes it toxic.\n\nIt is also not the only element of his kit that's toxic (zombie in lane, ability to enable super early dives (not exclusive to him at this point, however).\n\nAutoattacking champs like Aatrox, Yi, and Trynd are toxic because it's relatively low skill with high payoff. Yi, Trynd, Aatrox will outduel many champs with or without cooldowns. Those champs wind up destroying in teamfights or being complete crap (on account of being melee autoattackers) which isn't fun for either party involved. \n\nJax, Yi, Trynd, and old Aatrox were antiquated.","replies":[{"poster":"Slave Knight","date":"2018-06-28T14:54:43.170+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Okay, I see your point, but allow me to ask a couple of questions back. \n\nIf we kept his auto-attacking style yes, but gave him abilities to weave in more frequently, is that better? \n\nBecause if you think about it like this, isn't that simply just GIVING him more things? Going back to the Darius discussion, Darius is still promoted to auto-attack because it guarantees him a bleed stack.

Autoattacking styles by default rely on attack speed. You can't weave spells because they lower dps, so autoattack champs never weave spells unless they are autoattack resets or have no cast time, the former exemplifying the issue and the latter usually being hard to balance.\n\nThere is literally no way to balance an autoattack reliant playstyle. None of those champs(yi, kayle, trynda, pre-rework aatrox, udyr, pre-rework WW, jax, pre-rework fio) have ever been in a state where people actively enjoy both playing as and against them. \n\nRegarding the hypothetical darius scenario:\nIt would make him toxic but it would make him worse too since none of his abilities really synergize with autos. If he were ever buffed in that state, he would probably be overbearing. If it were just a flat-out nerf, he'd be terrible and never see play. Either way, he would be an autoattack statchecker who would need a rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2018-06-28T16:01:32.437+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ðownright Darius,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=u5RIevyN,comment-id=0004000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-28T15:55:14.347+0000)\n> There is literally no way to balance an autoattack reliant playstyle\n\n\nIt's called an ADC.\nIt's been a part of every game since season 1.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2018-06-28T17:30:31.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Hey you'll notice I said \"melee\"","replies":[{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2018-06-28T17:38:49.403+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ðownright Darius,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=u5RIevyN,comment-id=000400000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-28T17:30:31.896+0000)\n>\n> Hey you&#x27;ll notice I said &quot;melee&quot;\n\nWhat you didn't notice is that an auto attack scaling champion is an auto attack champion regardless of whether they are melee or ranged.\nThe same damage output and item usage is there. \n\nExcept melee ADCs are at a huge disadvantage compared with marksmen, which is why they aren't that viable at high elo and see no pro play.\nSo there's no reason for you to lose your mind over melee ADCs existing.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2018-06-28T17:39:59.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Err, the difference between ranged autoattacks and melee autoattacks is huge.\n\nTrying playing Kayle without her E on.","replies":[{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2018-06-28T19:44:45.436+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ðownright Darius,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=u5RIevyN,comment-id=00040000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-28T17:39:59.173+0000)\n>\n> Err, the difference between ranged autoattacks and melee autoattacks is huge.\n> \n> Trying playing Kayle without her E on.\n\nSaying the difference is huge doesn't even mean anything.

You make it sound like he had multiple \"weapon stances\". Which he didnt. He had a toggle. A toggle that didnt have much though behind no matter how much you try to prove me wrong. You had the healing on when you wanted to heal OR didnt want to stack your passive. You had the extra damage on when you wanted to deal extra damage or stack your passive. Period.

His W was a switch on/off ability that could heal him or increase his damage. The mini game of Aatrox was master those stances, knowing when to heal and when to toggle the bonus damage, and together with the management of his blood well, it was surprisingly hard to play with him.\n\nSure, when you managed to stack your shit, it was simple to cheese in a duel, but throw that in a team fight where you need to dodge shit and pay attention to your positioning and the position of your team and opponents: that's where it was really hard. If you toggled the heal without charging your blood well, you would probably die without doing nothing. If you toggled just for a second the bonus damage in the wrong time, you would blow up. But when used well, you could become a monster in the teamfight. The W mechanic was really hard to master and satisfying, in all aspects: the sound effect, the visual effect, animations, and mostly the gameplay satisfaction.\n\nSo, before talking about a champ that you played once or twice, maybe try to research how it worked first?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Skeletons Grave","date":"2018-06-28T20:04:25.774+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Welcome to the club.

At least that's what a lot of players on the boards claim.\n\nNonetheless it's the same shit different story. Champ who was underwhelming for prolonged periods of time, community asks for rework, Riot takes the rework to a different level than what the community expects (mainly Aatrox mains and OTPs), and the whiners make posts non-stop to omit the rework, thousands of posts about how players would rework them instead of Riot's version, \"good-byes\" are posted all over the boards, the rework comes out and there's so many, \"this is so wrong\" posts.\" \n\nEveryone's bickering is the same. Rhaast would agree, \"You're not special, just one of many.\" \n\nMeanwhile there are players who have a more positive approach and appreciate the reworks regardless, whether they're new to the champ in general or old OTPs. I know of many veteran Talon players who would kill for Cuttrhroat to come back and others who are absolutely satisfied with his rework. Same goes for the rest of the reworked champs. There's always going to be the players who refuse to go on and 'grieve' hoping that one day Riot will revert. And there are players who will go about there day and see what's next in store for the champion that just got their makeover.","replies":[{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2018-06-29T13:51:56.525+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pffts you should see the most replaced {{champion:3}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2018-06-28T13:22:58.117+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rip","replies":[{"poster":"Slave Knight","date":"2018-06-28T14:57:04.714+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry, I wasn't there for you bro when your rework hit, now it's my turn to face the crowd.","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Homie busta","date":"2018-06-29T01:46:28.557+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKhpE-oNoGY","replies":[{"poster":"Slave Knight","date":"2018-06-29T02:08:10.858+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"JESUS CHRIST.\n\nI thought you sent me a fucking ISIS decapitation LMAO.\n\nFalse alarmed folks, it was just metal gear.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2018-06-29T00:21:14.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As an Aatrox main, it's your own fault for choosing to be different instead of effective, since until Conqeuror every single AA based fighter did the job better than Aatrox, even during the Sated meta when he should've shined.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-06-29T03:41:09.706+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually, back in the sated devourer meta (which only worked so high up the ladder),  Aatrox was the most effective user of it...it's why they changed his kit to  that weird stacking passive\n\nwith guardian angel, he basically had 3 lives and with sated devourer, could kill anyone in moments, forcing a situation where the team either had to kill him (as a high priority target that was durable)  or kill his team mates (which left him still a high priority target with your cooldowns down as he mauled you)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2018-06-28T17:13:33.967+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Slave Knight,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=u5RIevyN,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-06-28T11:58:50.622+0000)\n> \n> WHAT DOES THIS CHAMPION WANT TO DO? \n\nIf you look closely, his kit is currently more akin to an AD version of Galio than anything Aatrox main/players are thinking of him at the moment by watching the champion reveal/spotlight/old Aatrox play style/what they want Aatrox to become\n\nHe released in an underpowered state, but is basically to early to make such bold claims when most of the players have not even understood how every ability in his kit interact with each other\n\nAlso no \"smart and aggressive tactics\" is not a thing that fit the description of old Aatrox, he was a stat-check champ like you said, he was either so strong on his spike to default dominate the lane or you were a splitpush bot in a tie/lost and a knocku-up bot in teamfights (Q in then die)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jackom1","date":"2018-06-28T17:19:57.168+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wow, you Aatrox mains are popping like mushrooms in these last 48 hours\n\nWhere were you hiding all this time?","replies":[]}]}
