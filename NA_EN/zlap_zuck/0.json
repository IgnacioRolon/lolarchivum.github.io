I am located in Los Angeles and I am the only person using the internet via Ethernet. Its not a problem with the router either because i'm getting about 58 mbps download and I have a beefy asus monitor I bought a few years back. I'm wondering if that's normal or not because this internet isn't cheap and I expect more for the price. And if you do know can you help me fix this problem. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-20T05:11:12.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm I would think you should have a lower ping than that. It might be that your ISP is just routing your connection is a rather odd way to our servers, so let's check for that first. Grab a tool like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to run a traceroute to our NA servers at 104.160.131.1 and post the results here!","replies":[]}]}
