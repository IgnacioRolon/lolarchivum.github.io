You may receive a notice that the name is available, when it actually isn't.  If that's the case for you, try making your name on the legacy client:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nHope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
