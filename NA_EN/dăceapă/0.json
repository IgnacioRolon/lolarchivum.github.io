In general, while playing, i get arround 100-150 fps on max settings, but it doesent feel so smooth. If i cap the fps at 60, it&#039;ll be 60 or 59 fps, but its not so smooth. Im seeing videos on ytb with ppl playing on 60 fps but it doesent feel everywhere near it. Any idea why or a solution?","replies":[{"poster":"nm1010","date":"2018-03-20T22:50:38.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I vaguely remember having this issue back when I first built this computer. I couldn't play uncapped or I got massive screen tearing, but if I capped at 60 fps the game felt super sluggish. I can't remember if it was a vsync problem, but now I just cap it at 120 fps and it feels fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-20T22:26:31.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Define \"smooth\"?\n\nWhat is your monitor refresh rate, and what are you seeing that looks wrong? flickering/screentear? input delay? movement delay?","replies":[]}]}
