If i would send a mystery gift to the one with only draven then would it be 100%  a draven skin? And is there a chance for me to get Draven Draven?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-03T21:45:19.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll need atleast a champion pool of 10 to get a mystery gift, and keep it a mystery.  Having a smaller pool would kind of defeat that purpose, so it's not possible to guarantee a skin.  Sorry for the confusion!","replies":[{"poster":"DravenNiceChamp","date":"2017-11-03T21:56:12.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, but is there a possibility to get Draven Draven?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-03T22:05:47.182+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In general, yes because he's a[ legacy skin](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944-Guide-to-Legacy-and-Limited-Skins).
