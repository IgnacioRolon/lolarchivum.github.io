And the ones we see are mostly cinder junglers.\n\nAP Junglers are too blue buff dependent. Yet Blue buff remains best, in the hands of your mid laner. I may have taken an AP Jungler if our mid, was a Yasuo, a Vlad, a Zed, anyone who doesn't need the mana. Also because of AP midlaners, having magic heavy Junglers doesn't help round out the team comp. \n\nMy Original though for magus was to give it the % mana restore on Kill/assist passive that Athene's has. Rewarding AP Junglers for a successful gank. But this works to. Also With RuneGlaives spellblade passive, Their might be even more mages that become viable for Jungling. Not Just Diana or ekko. \n\nAlso, Cinderhulk isn't as dominant as it use to be. It's just a late game scaling item. While Warrior gives your the faster clear and the early damage. Choosing one over the other for no other purpose than when it spike is perfectly fine. And we have been seeing warrior on Rek'sai and Evelynn in the LCS.\n\nThe only thing Devourer needs is to not be reliant on AFK farming, As riot clearly does not support that tacktic. \n\nAll in all, with CinderHulk and RuneGlaive I would predict that Warrior and Devourer will be looked at next. Probably reworked into something with a much cooler name.","replies":[{"poster":"Taredom","date":"2015-06-13T00:21:12.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems as though you and I share opinions and have the same decision making process for champ select, you managed to articulate my exact thoughts.

And the ones we see are mostly cinder junglers.\n\nBiggest reason being is AP casters need mana, and generally speaking, AP casters can't sustain themselves in the jungle due to heavy mana costs. Magnus is without a doubt, an incredibly cost efficient item, but unfortunately, there aren't many AP users with the kit needed to do well in the jungle and are viable in the current meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Taredom","date":"2015-06-13T00:16:04.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kind of this, another issue is that most of them don't have sustain outside of shields. Blue buff naturally really shores up the issue of needing mana and also helps with cooldowns. The problem with the jungler needing blue buff is that if your jungler takes every blue buff, your mid can't push out as hard and roam, which leaves us with the idea that the only efficient time to have an AP Jungler is when we have a resourceless mid or an energy based mid, or someone that is simply really efficient, then you have to ask the question, does your team have enough bulk? So ideally you would need a team comp like Mao or Shen top, Zed mid, leona and an adc bot and then in these circumstances, you can strategically play an AP JG. This is a problem as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Taredom","date":"2015-06-12T23:20:11.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Healthy doesn't mean overpowered, cinderhulk will likely always be overpowered because of the 25% health, which overshadows this.","replies":[{"poster":"Kãtãrinã","date":"2015-06-12T23:24:16.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"before cinder there was a different item in season 4 i believe that gave 25% as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Taredom","date":"2015-06-13T00:05:16.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're referring to Spirit of the Ancient Golem, it had less health on it and a little bit of CDR (Which as a tank, you generally get 40% from other things without too much trouble.) The only real reason to buy that item was for the 25% health as the other two benefits (not counting the general jungle things) were pretty irrelevant. In the case of Cinderhulk, the 25% health is the reason to build it but the other things that come on it are fantastic.\n\ntl:dr, the item gives quite a bit more, if you wanna go the route of spellblade on magus, buff warrior and devourer too.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
