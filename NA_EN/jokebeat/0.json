I tried everything and cannot find it. Yes, we do have 5 members in it.\r\nThank you for any advice.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-28T17:44:21.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clubs options are available in the update client's profile area, where you can find a section called Clubs.  Some features are still in testing, though, so if you run into any trouble you can still use the legacy client to make modifications:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Heterosexual","date":"2017-09-23T17:12:46.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://imgur.com/a/yVkzq\n\nThis is my view of both clients and neither of those work. I hit play on the legacy client and it opens the new one.\nThe new one does not have a \"Launch Legacy Client\" option.\nThe profiles section only allows toggling club tag visibility.\n\nI am having the same issue, I want to set my club tag (it has none, and way more than 5 members)\n\nEdit: Solution found in other thread posting here for solution visibility: \nIn the new client go to your profile, clubs, then click the PADLOCK next to your club name","replies":[]}]}]}
