I know its not where ya go for the best games but their usually mixed up and more entertaining when your just getting railed in draft. But literally every game i play in that mode now comes with a troll... EVERY.... FREAKING... GAME. They usually screw up the comp, run into and feed other lanes, or just ghost farm the whole game, avoiding fights and badmouthing the team. For as bad as this toxic stuff is I&#039;m amazed riot doesn&#039;t try to curb it anymore. Sure maybe it might have been unfair in the past but cant they do something like secretly check the friends list of those ppl reporting others to be sure that they just arent getting backup to abuse the failing system?\r\n\r\nI hope they do some about it before it turns into another wow. When that game started you had to work towards things (and I mean really work at it) and your social standing on your server and with guilds meant something, plus you actually needed to wonder the world if you wanted something. Now look at it. You can literally just stand in a capital city literally all day and do almost anything. It doesn&#039;t matter what you say and do anymore, your just a faceless player in a sea of servers all intermingled. Blizz took a great game a balanced person could enjoy and tailored it too and to produce lazy trolls who can do just about anything. That game was (not sure if it still is) used as a real time model for real world economic situations since the gold always had in game value. Now, to people who were there in the beginning, I&#039;m sure it feels worn out and dragging its coffin behind it.\r\n\r\nThe point to that long rant is more or less lol is heading down the same road. Streamlining things is good and all but it opens the door to those lazy, toxic players looking for an easy outlet to push others buttons trying the play the game for what its meant for when it just needs someone looking after it to at least deter or slow down the frequency of these occurrences. Think of it this way riot, if trolls get banned and all they have to do is make another account to play they&#039;d have to spend they&#039;re money on content they once had.\r\n\r\nHave at it forum trolls, I probably won&#039;t look at this post again, very bad at checking.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-17T02:22:19.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Always was, nothing new.\n\nOnly reason to play it is when you dont care and just want to watch 9 people feed and scream into the void for 20 minutes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CaptainAntiHeroz","date":"2018-07-17T03:05:49.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You go to blind pick to play {{summoner:7}} {{summoner:4}} {{champion:157}} jungle and go 3/1/3 and win the game because in blind pick ANYTHING is possible","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-07-17T02:53:49.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes blind pick is a huge clown fiesta.
