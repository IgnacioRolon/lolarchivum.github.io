I want to see a champion made that can use trapping as their primary tactic and contribution to their team.  Dota has a hero that is basically 3 goblins who&#039;s entire lives mission is to put stuff down and blow themselves up and I absolutely loved them and their kit (except for maybe the suicide skill)\r\n\r\nThe reason I haven&#039;t offered to champ concept for this is because i&#039;ve made two different champ concepts for trappers already as I&#039;ve played lol and I&#039;m not putting that much thought into it anymore until I get some sort of impressive response for it.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2017-01-12T23:19:52.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want the Yul Archer from Lineage 2.

I personally don't think League should have goblins, but I could see the idea of a goblin-y Yordle champion. But that's part of the design process. Who is this champion? Why do they use traps? What about their visuals strengthens that concept? How does their kit and visuals stand out from others in the roster? Etc.
