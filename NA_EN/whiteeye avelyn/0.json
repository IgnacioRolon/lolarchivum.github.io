He's only stuck doing this because the spirits of his ancestors in the Mori family didn't think he had done enough \"gravedigging\" (As literal or non-literal as that may be), so he awoke, undead, after burying himself, with the instructions to go fill his quota by burying more bodies.\n\nYorick's not a hero, he's not a villain, he doesn't think he's either of those things.  He's just a guy who wants to finally get some peace and fulfill the expectations set upon him by his family name.  He's a total underdog, and I kinda have to root for the poor bastard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-10-29T00:02:19.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's been basically nerfed into unviability for forever, and no reworker has been able to fix him.
