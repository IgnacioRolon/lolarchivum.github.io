Is it the fact that each level is this XOR that instead of this OR that? I personally like them since it means each mastery on its own can be more impactful rather than masteries being a tiny bit of several stats since you don't have the chance to stack different masteries with the same stats.\n\nBut really, why do people hate the new masteries so much? They didn't lose anything important (well, maybe spellblade, but that's not much compared to DFT.) except you can't go TANKTANKTANK or DAMAGEDAMAGEDAMAGE.","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2015-11-16T22:46:43.809+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"The over simplification of them is a major turn-off.  This was advertised as a way to make every champion feel unique, but because everything is cookie cutter \"take this or this, that's it\" and lack of ability to devote more than 18 points into the so-called tree is creating an environment where everything is the same, in a much worse way than the last mastery set.\n\nIt also forces you to invest points into things you don't want just to get the one talent you feel is necessary.  If I'm going for a scaling damage build, why would I want scaling AP to go with my AD?  If I want to play an AP champion, I literally have one option for a keystone...gee thanks. The keystones themselves are terrible just because everyone has the same thing.  If you're building crit, you go warlords - every ADC champ, if you go utility support, you go Windseaker...I'm really feeling the unique diversity here. And what happens when you want to try and invest points elsewhere to make some kind of mixed tree?  You're stuck trying to get past the \"you need to put 5 points in this level or leave it alone\" part of the tree, and then you've just gimped yourself because you don't have a keystone.\n\nWhat I miss about the old ones, as I've stated above is the ability to have a lot of control over what you're selecting in a system that makes sense.  I'm an AP mage, and If I want damage, there's the offensive tree - no brainer, but I also want some defense with my leftover points - oh; I can use the _defensive_ tree...hmm but on second thought, I don't really need that, I can keep myself safe enough, so I can either go for more damage, or get some mana regen or speed from the utility tree.  But you know what?  I don't feel safe at all, so I'm going to go for a control mage instead and sacrifice some of my offesnive tree points and therefore damage to help my team and I survive by putting more points into utility and defense.  It's not meta, but it will help me survive, I'm not looking to carry - just trying to help and trying not to die.\n\nSee how much control I have?  And at no point does the fact that I may not hit the bottom point in the tree cripple me so hard it's as if I'm automatically underleveled. That last point you made about people not being able to go TANKTANKTANK or DAMAGEDAMAGEDAMAGE is why I think a lot of people are upset with this.  You don't have the freedom to do what you want with the masteries, ruining the feeling that what you can do with them can actually make each champion feel unique and play the way you want them to be played.  If Riot's goal was to create that, they fixed what wasn't broken...._again_.","replies":[{"poster":"MohawkBird","date":"2015-11-17T02:13:02.527+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"MrWasjig","date":"2015-11-17T11:55:12.204+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If by \"quite a bit if options\" you mean:\n\"A or B?\" with no variance within one tree. \nAnd when we get to the keystones you have an innovative 3rd option:\n\"A, B, or C!?\"\nThen yes plenty of choices to be made there!\n\nThe problem with the new masteries is they're very restrictive and don't provide much nuance or variety in your choices. \n\nWhile I won't purport that the old system was perfect, what it did have was choice. And yes as it stands the old masteries may have only been smaller changes they at least felt varied, and you actually had options. Not this illusion of choice that the new ones have. \n\nIf you ask me, a combination of elements from the old tree, and the new \"tree\" would likely result in a pretty solid mastery system. \n-Keep the more impactful masteries\n-But make them more varied\n-Allow more choice and variety\n-Allow for far more specialization\n-Actually make the system a damn tree again\n-Make the system more coherent by changing the trees back to \"Offense\", \"Defense\" and \"Utility\".

I see a lot of difference in keystone choices as far as, say, Riven, Talon, Xin, etc players go, and they all seem to work pretty well.\n\nBut on the other hand, Mages, ADC, Supports, Junglers and Tanks are pretty limited i.e. it's always the same thing, really.\n\nAlso, to me, his point was not necessarily about the keystones, but the points you have to spend to reach the keystones. The keystone masteries are so strong that you cannot pass up on them. That wasn't the case last season. The last mastery of each tree was certainly good, but it wasn't to the point of completely removing the option of not taking them. I remember using a 0/14/16 page for a while for some tank supports that didn't needed the last 5 points in utility. I also played around with 0/30/0 Leona for a while, which while not necessarily the best, did get me some laughs.\n\nThe current masteries force you to go 18 in one thing and then either 12 in another or 6/6. You can't put more than 18 points in a tree and specialize in that three, nor can you spread your points around a bit more freely as keystones are too strong.\n\nAnd the worst to me, is having to choose X or Y, rather than X and Y. This is one of the most limiting changes (althouth the severe reduction in amount of masteries per tree is also up there).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"eaglei3","date":"2015-11-16T21:53:02.272+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"My main problem is they have some balancing to do to make the keystone masteries benefit more champs right now and not be as overpowering on certain ones.

It's something no one in this game with a WoW background wants to see.\n\nWell, you're wrong about that.  As a past and current WoW player (as well as League and other games ofc), I think the new talent system was a positive change for WoW and I think the new mastery system is potentially a positive change for LoL (once some power outliers are cleaned up, Warlord's Bloodlust for example).  Too many old talents were powerful without being interesting, so they didn't offer meaningful choice, just \"take this or be bad\".  Now they at least lead up to something playstyle-impacting with real tradeoffs.\n\nThe talent change (a lot less points, a lot more importance per point, more specific strengths and less \"you do everything X% better\") was certainly a *divisive* change for WoW, but don't make the mistake of thinking every one of a million other players agrees with *you*.\n\nAny sufficiently large playerbase disagrees with itself about practically everything, and no matter what the devs do or don't do, someone complains.  That definitely *is* something Riot has in common with Blizzard, but it doesn't say much about what direction they should take with game balance -- only that the existence of complaints gives them 0 information because it was preordained.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WooBeeWoo","date":"2015-11-17T21:38:33.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly right","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2015-11-16T13:40:30.299+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":2,"body":"i can confirm that it wasn't this negative, it was fairly tamed when compared to this preseason.

This as well as champs having the ability to have damage in their kit, as well as building tanky with a tank support is how the teamfights can get by easier, because if you have some strong tanky fighters, they can survive long enough to get a few rotations in their abilities to help kill the important targets and keep the important teammates alive.\n\nHowever, what happened to the days when a Heimerdinger couldn't half-health a tower within 30 seconds?\nLeague used to be so diverse with the tank changes and juggernaut (shudder) changes, that there was a unique choice in champ selection that didn't make it a win for either team based on who you picked, but more so how you played that match, and how the rest of your team played.\nPlus, League isn't Smite.\nWe shouldn't have to make these Smite similarities during champ select to help us actually win lane.\n\nI apologize for speaking out of turn, or if anything I am saying is untrue about what the game has turned into at the moment.\nI'm also not having fun when my games are either really close wins that are really good games, or just pure stomps that have uncontrollable snowball champs in almost every lane.\nMakes it hard to play with my friends when we are all trying to play as our favorite champs in the preseason, but it just doesn't work because the other team just seems to play as better champs in almost every lane and position.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-11-16T17:01:51.309+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes, it was like this last Preseason, except last Preseason only changed Junglers so instead of a % of each role complaining (except most ADCs), the entire Jungler role complained for a bit.

For sure, it's always exciting and welcomed to have a few new additions here and there; Scuttle Crab, Dragon powers, some neat items with actives, etc., but too much at the same time leaves the game in an unbalanced state and the kind of unbalance state that is hard to work in since Riot might not tackle the right thing in the right order. I really hope they manage to prioritize their upcoming changes, nerfs and buffs in a way that is gonna help the game quickly. \n\nFor instance, Pre Season 6 could have added its different aspects (Masteries, AD itemizations, AD Carry mini-reworks, etc.) in 2 patches or 3 maybe instead of a big one. This would have let some time between each updates to adjust everything along the way.\n\nIn my opinion, the new changes aren't this much broken when you look at them individually (with the exception of certain REALLY OP things). When thrown all at the same time in one patch, it's easy to blame a specific change for the mess while the reality might be even more complex since every single change in League of Legends, even the slightest change, has the power to buff or nerf something else indirectly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lost In Time","date":"2015-11-16T14:05:47.933+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Season 3 on the other hand with Cleaver stacking and mass changes invoked similar reactions.\n\n\"GG riot changed too much, im quitting\" etc","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yormaughm","date":"2015-11-16T17:48:48.215+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Welcome to League of Legends, where we invent an entirely new game every year starting now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RisenDarkKnight","date":"2015-11-16T15:27:07.818+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I didn't have any problem with the last 3 preseasons, but then again, I didn't spend nearly as much time on the boards either so I can't be sure people weren't upset.

For instance Deathfire touch is incredibly OP on Brand and Malzahar, while quite weak on most other champions (hence Brand and Malz's high winrates despite the cost increases of their core items).  Rageblade is also too strong on certain champions (like Jax).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-11-17T04:36:18.095+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last years preseason was nowhere near as bad as this.
