Can be cast 3 times (spends 10 mana for every cast). The third cast makes the enemies bleed for 3 seconds dealing 5/8/11/14/17 (+50% bonus ad, +65% bonus ap) physical damage per second. Neutral monsters, are stunned for 1 second instead. Can be cast while moving or using HURDLE.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/3kYw1I8 W: HURDLE\n RANGE 350, COST 10/15/20/25/30 MANA, COOLDOWN 17/15/13/11/9\nPASSIVE: Raptor gains 8/12/16/20/24 flat movement speed.\nACTIVE: Raptor hurdles to target location dealing 30/40/50/60/70 (+15% bonus ad, +45% bonus ap) physical damage to nearby enemies.

During this state, he gains 30/40/50 flat movement speed and 30%/40%/50% attack speed. His Q and W casts are increased from 3 to 6, and have no mana cost. When Raptor deals damage to bleeding enemies he steals 5/10/15 flat movement speed from them.\n\nSUGGESTED ITEMS\n{{item:3710}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3172}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3117}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3087}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-07-15T19:04:30.340+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Passive is very unique, fun and thematically appropriate.  I'm not sold on all of these \"can be used three times\" moves, though.  Especially having three leaps on a non-ultimate ability.  The name, title and visuals are pretty generic and uninspired, too.  Surely there's a better name for this guy than \"Raptor\"!","replies":[{"poster":"Caraméla","date":"2015-07-16T05:57:45.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your comment, would you mind explaining to me why you dont like the 3 times cast moves? I made it some kind of a motiv, 3 q, 3 w 3 raptorlings etc. But if you notice, the q damage is relatively low compared to other champions' Qs and they are skillshots. Plus the w, yes its a 3 time jump but if you notice, the range is really small and the mana cost is relatively high. Also, i know the name and moves' names are not inspired enough but i was so excited to show this champion that i couldnt wait to think of better names!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheFirstGokun","date":"2015-07-18T13:46:57.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The passive is good, and the E also ties in solidly to fit his concept. There's clear counterplay and interesting interaction behind both of those. One thing you may want to consider changing is his Q bleed. I don't think it's super neccessary to have an extra bit of damage that 1) scales with AP, making it useless in most builds and then 2) doesn't scale with anything at all. Seriously, most you get out of this is 81 damage plus a measly 30% AP ratio. It's not impactful enough to make the third strike feel different. If you want to make it feel interesting, perhaps adding a brief but heavy slow (like Trundle Q or Talon E) would work better, or making the bleed scale a lot with AP and removing the initial magic damage or vice versa. Don't distribute his power budget too much, or his strengths will be spread so thin he won't be effective at all.\nAs for the W, there are a few ways to make it more interesting. Instead of having a really low slow, why not make the third hurdle steal flat movement speed (he's diving into the enemy team, so he needs something to raise his slow survivability)? Or maybe, with his movement speed based kit, the hurdle can have increased range based on his movement speed, so his escape isn't as spammable when faced with slowing abilities.\nAs for his ultimate, it's pretty crazy, but why does a presumably assassination centric champion grant vision control, ally defenses and other supporty features, along with DoT within a certain area? There's a lot of features tacked on to this skill, but they don't neccessarily suit a constantly moving Raptor who is always hunting for a new victim. You might want to replace this with something different.\nAll in all, a cool concept, and I'd like to see this taken a step further. Keep on working hard :)\nReviewer, away!{{summoner:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"Caraméla","date":"2015-08-05T07:59:10.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i changed his ulti see if u want :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Caraméla","date":"2015-07-20T07:35:28.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for your beautiful review, i'll work on the things u pointed out and i'll let you know when i edit it :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kaeblen","date":"2015-07-15T19:11:44.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:121}}","replies":[{"poster":"Caraméla","date":"2015-07-16T05:59:38.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're implying its a copy of kha'zix, just take a look at {{champion:107}}  :) almost same kit as {{champion:121}} riot already makes similar champions i dont refuse Raptor looks like {{champion:121}} I would appreciate a real review instead of just {{champion:121}} icon.
