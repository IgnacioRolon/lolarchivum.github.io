Sit in Draft Mode all day while people look up stats and summoner information to ban their best champions or whomever is the most OP at the time, and then after a 15 minute queue and a 5 minute pick/ban phase, somebody dodges and it repeats over and over.  Last night I had three games in Draft and spent at least 35 minutes waiting to play the games, not including the actual pick/ban phase and loading screen.  I got my primary one out of three times.\r\n\r\n2. Go blind pick and hope you can type your lane quicker than the other people.  Even then, it doesn&#039;t mean someone won&#039;t go into that lane anyway.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve never seen the logic behind removing Team Builder as it cured the toxicity of solo queue substantially, it granted you 100% chance of role and champion and it allowed you to kick out anybody who seemed trollish (aka, zilean jungle or skarner adc!) and the new champ select is actually far worse than Team Builder.  It is as if you guys went out of your way to make a product worse than three years ago, and I&#039;m unsure why this was considered a good idea.\r\n\r\nInstead of another disastrous solo queue, can we just have our team builder mode back for blind picks?  Choose champ, choose role, choose mastery/runes and skin and off we go.  Whatever you had planned for solo queue, Team Builder will be better anyway if Champ Select and Dynamic Queue are any indicators.\r\n\r\nBRING BACK TEAM BUILDER!

New Champion Select   does both better. Just this past Sunday I got to play 3 games on jungle Morgana in the span of around 3 hours including champ select. In Team Builder I MIGHT get to play one game in that time frame. In particular I remember queueing up for jungle Lux after Runeglaive was released and had to wait close to 20-30 minutes to find a game, and I wasn't about to try and queue up for another game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aikata","date":"2016-04-29T18:09:09.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss Team Builder so much. I don't play League anymore because its gone. Every time I want to play I just think of getting stuck in my secondary for 5 games (support) and going through an annoying pick-ban phase or having to fight for my role in standard blind.\n\nI love to play League casually, but I don't have the time or energy to try to get my favorite role with my favorite champs unsuccessfully three games straight for three hours. It just isn't fun.

It's kind of cheating. But other than that, yeah, I agree with you completely. I miss Team Builder, but I'm enjoying dynamic more than I expected to. Something that people completely overlook is that Team Builder has the exact same problem that Dynamic Queue has; there were a ton of 3 and 4 man teams.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AbyssionKnight","date":"2016-04-29T03:33:49.534+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue with teambuilder is that it doesn't work in a draft format really.  I personally think the solution would have been you pick your role, two or three champions you want to play, same team builder team set up, and you can see peoples pick intent. Find people you like, then find a match, pick ban happens, and based on bans, the you move down the persons pick intent tier.  Might be a little complicated, but it'd work.\n\nAt the very least, TB should be in normals again. Seems like the only reason they removed it was so that on release they could brag about the popularity of Dynamic Queue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Theft","date":"2016-04-28T19:39:18.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2016-04-28T18:32:01.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"team builder makes more sense than normal draft...i mean if the idea is to just play whoever for fun, then what the shit is normal draft? bans only make sense if its some sort of competitive mode...if its for giggles, then let the ridiculousness begin","replies":[{"poster":"Chrissxy1989","date":"2016-04-29T11:34:47.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i do understand, why some people would want a draftmode that doesnt impact their ranked stats. that way they can \"practice for ranked\". if you only had blindpick (or TB) in normals, you would have to face those 2 must ban champs too often.\n\nbut why cant they exchange blindpick for TB? i never understood why riot didnt do that. maybe add an option to queue for multiple roles/champs for those who want to play different stuff or want to change their champ according to the teamcomb. i dont see a real downside to this option","replies":[{"poster":"Riprox","date":"2016-04-29T12:10:39.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chrissxy1989,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=b5IJd7cE,comment-id=00160000,timestamp=2016-04-29T11:34:47.570+0000)\n>\n> i do understand, why some people would want a draftmode that doesnt impact their ranked stats. that way they can &quot;practice for ranked&quot;. if you only had blindpick (or TB) in normals, you would have to face those 2 must ban champs too often.\n> \n> but why cant they exchange blindpick for TB? i never understood why riot didnt do that. maybe add an option to queue for multiple roles/champs for those who want to play different stuff or want to change their champ according to the teamcomb. i dont see a real downside to this option\n\nWell my friend, you just (kinda) described DynamicQueue.....
