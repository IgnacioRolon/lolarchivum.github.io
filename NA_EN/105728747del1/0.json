Client says my account is currently disabled and that I should contact support\r\nBUT when i try to login it just says my user/pass combination is not good, BUT that is impossible!\r\n\r\nI am using this other account so that I am able to write this. I am so confused right now. What's happening?\r\n\r\nI asked for an account deletion for this account that I am writing from. Then I made a new account using the same email that this one has. Did the account deletion get mixed up somehow?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-20T17:31:13.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll want to make sure you're using the username for the correct account, the other one slated for deletion would be disabled pending removal.
