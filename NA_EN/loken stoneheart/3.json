While a skill having counterplay is great and all, we can&#039;t just tag counterplay on everything that isn&#039;t an ADC (Autoattacks only counter**play** is blind, and that is available on two champions-- One of which shall not be spoken of, and the other is the fairly buggy mess that is Quinn). This would pretty obviously make ADCs king.\n\nWhat does matter is that the ability is fair in context with the champion kit, and other champions.\nYeah, point and click spells are easy to use and have \"no counterplay\" as some whine. First off-- how is this different than an autoattack? Second, they are typically balanced with lower range, longer CD, lower damage, or put on a champion whose kit has that as its primary move or something of the sort-- they paid for it in their power budget.\n\nAnd with other champions-- unless we&#039;re ready for Riot to rework roughly 120 champions +/- the rest of the champions in the game, simultaneously, this isn&#039;t fair to the champions that are reworked. \nThey get all the counterplay-- See Sion, for instance. Mostly good just because of the sheer bulk his W brings, his Q, W, and R are all loaded with counterplay (Just walk out of Q, you have a whole second. W you have three seconds to pop it. R, you just sidestep and he runs 500 units away before he can stop).\nNow, why is it fair for Sion that he has all the counterplay in his kit, and something along the lines of Nidalee or such-and-such exist? Champions that have little-to-no counterplay, but continue to exist because Riot can&#039;t possibly get around to reworking all the champions in the game.\n\nMaybe we just focus more on it being \"fair.\" Again, a champion having a good point and click move is more than fair if they pay for it somewhere else in their budget. Not everything needs to be a skillshot or have a 2-3 second delay, and truth be told until autoattacks are skillshots too (counterplay, its only fair), this shouldn&#039;t even be a complaint or buzzword.","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2015-05-02T06:29:22.003+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":19,"body":"*cough* {{champion:1}} point and click instaburst *cough*","replies":[{"poster":"Loken Stoneheart","date":"2015-05-02T06:38:05.117+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":10,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DarkenedAuras,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=U2cg6kA7,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-02T06:29:22.003+0000)\n>\n> *cough* {{champion:1}} point and click instaburst *cough*\n\n*cough* Lack of mobility *cough*\n*cough* Predictable stun pattern *cough*\n*cough* Much less annoying than LB, Nidalee, or Zed *cough*","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-05-02T08:14:59.458+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":2,"body":"*cough* Low range *cough*\n*cough* everyone can flash and ult *cough*\n*cough* even Zed outranges her with spells *cough*\n*cough* banshee's veil can block her tibbers ult stun *cough*\n*cough* if pushed to tower, needs to use Q or W or risk losing farm, therefore keeping track of her passive is easier *cough*\n*cough* point and click doesn't lack counterplay *cough*\n*cough* Zed's ult is point-and-click and is at the max range of Annie's spells *cough*\n*cough* isn't Leblanc's Q point and click and her W insta-burst like Annie's ult and W? *cough*\n*cough* how is Annie unique again? *cough*","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-05-02T14:48:11.189+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=tombdragon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=U2cg6kA7,comment-id=000100000001,timestamp=2015-05-02T08:14:59.458+0000)\n>\n> *cough* Low range *cough*\n> *cough* everyone can flash and ult *cough*\n> *cough* even Zed outranges her with spells *cough*\n> *cough* banshee's veil can block her tibbers ult stun *cough*\n> *cough* if pushed to tower, needs to use Q or W or risk losing farm, therefore keeping track of her passive is easier *cough*\n> *cough* point and click doesn't lack counterplay *cough*\n> *cough* Zed's ult is point-and-click and is at the max range of Annie's spells *cough*\n> *cough* isn't Leblanc's Q point and click and her W insta-burst like Annie's ult and W? *cough*\n> *cough* how is Annie unique again? *cough*\n\nBro, you sound terrible.

I hope it helps.\n\nI've many a-times broken apart what the meta means on the forums for others to see. I am aware of the state of the game, I was already aware of essentially everything you just typed out.\n\nNidalee doesn't have an identity. She is whatever the current best item is, because her rework was a total failure that made her all around stronger at absolutely every role. She isn't weak at teamfighting-- she can build bruiser very well and still do tons of damage. The only thing she is weak at is direct crowd control, but since she has such intense zoning with spears she more than compensated for it.\nWhere is her counterplay?\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nThese changes still make no sense. Sion doesn't make his intentions clear to allies. **HE MAKES HIS INTENTIONS CLEAR TO THE ENEMIES WHICH INSTANTLY PUTS HIM AND HIS TEAM AT A DISADVANTAGE**. His W is his only half-decent skill, and you have 3 seconds to ruin it. He is only good because he gets so damn tanky, and they're probably going to nerf that next. It sucks not having working abilities.\n\nVeigar is a pile of trash now, in the name of counterplay. His E is borderline useless, his W is actually useless, and his Q is the only thing that improved in the slightest. No longer is he a burst mage, he's a poke/farm mage that has one, maybe two skills if you count his ult. Same deal, it sucks not having working abilities.\n\nCassio got the same treatment. Riot didn't like her DOTs because there is \"no counterplay to a dot\" so they removed her entire poison aspect and loaded all the power on her kit into her E. In the name of counterplay! Again, same deal.\n\nRyze's rework? Also god-awful. His winrate is plummeting (we can give this some time to work itself out, but ... ). They reduced his scaling early/mid game, made his reliable damage unreliable (Q, _**COUNTERPLAY!**_), reduced the power of his root, and reduced the effect of CDR on his kit. They destroyed him so that they can say he has counterplay. Do you know what his counterplay was before? Not being an idiot. But, that's too hard for some people, so lets all jump on the counterplay bandwagon and ruin yet another champion.\n\nThey load so much importance into \"counterplay\" that they ruin the champion lately.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Emperor Kyoka","date":"2015-05-03T10:04:32.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not a counterplay issue.

The real questions is how does Riot plan to \"fix\" how people are placed in matches.
