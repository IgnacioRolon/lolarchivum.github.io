I would like to receive your feedback on this one. ^.^\r\n\r\nThanks for taking your time to read this and good luck in your games! ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-06-03T23:22:39.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Locking this necro.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GotauiaGamesBr","date":"2019-06-03T04:23:23.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good idea, riot wont add it","replies":[{"poster":"XioKi","date":"2019-06-03T16:24:20.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GotauiaGamesBr,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=Y188tF7l,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-06-03T04:23:23.887+0000)\n>\n> Good idea, riot wont add it\n\nLol so truu","replies":[]}]}]}
