I play Lux all the time specifically into assassins because I think she counters them.\n\nThis isn't late Season 3, assassins only have a small edge right now due to the mana changes and the fact assassins are mostly manaless. That, and LeBlanc doesn't usually -need- to build mana regen but can anyway with a morellos and hits a powerspike while also gaining good waveclear/manaregen.\n\nIn any event, this isn't like season 3 where you could get one pick and take two towers off of it because the mid game death timers were so long. Or just completely stomp your lane because of the way minions gave experience. Again, I feel all options are viable right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-01-13T05:27:37.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I play Lux all the time specifically into assassins because I think she counters them.\n\nyeah and i think im preety good at twitch despite him being utter crap since nerfs \n\ndont take skill into account because you play lux \"all the time\"\n\nalso the mana regen nerfs","replies":[{"poster":"Stonington","date":"2015-01-13T05:32:16.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hagane No Arashi,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2OFkgAAQ,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-13T05:27:37.225+0000)\n>\n> yeah and i think im preety good at twitch despite him being utter crap since nerfs \n> \n> dont take skill into account because you play lux \"all the time\"\n> \n> also the mana regen nerfs\n\nWell, I actually feel that Lux counters them for everyone.

They all in and kill single targets very effectively. Lux is no exception to the rule. Although her burst damage is quicker and her escape mechanics probably a little better or more reliable than Ziggs/Xerath.\n\nI think you've made a good point about poking down the enemy. Of course Xerath is the god of poke. Ziggs not so much. He can't reliable poke an assassin because he needs to stay out of their gap closer range. The thing is, you don't -need- to poke the enemy. There's a weird conception about laning phase where people believe you're required to attack the enemy. You're not.
