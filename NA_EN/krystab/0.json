Do you think it's possible to never be within flash-auto range? Especially when the enemy just threw a hook at you and probably pulled himself to a wall or a minion close by.\nEven if you have your Flash ready you aren't going to be able to use it between when he blows Flash and queues up an auto attack. And flashing after the auto attack's begun doesn't stop it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DartExplosion10","date":"2019-11-08T04:07:21.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"RavageRose","date":"2019-11-08T04:03:20.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"see that isnt my issue with Naut... my issue is how absurdly tanky he gets with minimal investment. literally one incomplete item of armor and mag  res and hes nearly unkillable in a group","replies":[]},{"poster":"86400","date":"2019-11-08T03:58:06.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He'd be dead in the water without it.
