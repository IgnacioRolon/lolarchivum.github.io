DON'T PLAY THAT CARD, LET ME EXPLAIN.\n\nVarus's story is BASED on the fact that he lost his family, his wife and his child. Him having a wife and a child was based on how he gained his ability's. It showed the distance he would go to avenge his family, that was his whole purpose.\n\n\nChanging him to being gay completely throws characters away from being canon. Your throwing away his wife, and his child. This just does not feel right. It feels like Riot sat down and was like \"hey we need a gay character to show diversity. Let's just change one of our character's back story COMPLETELY and make him gay! Fixed!\"\n\nNow, if this was a character like, let's be stereo typical, Vi. If she was announced as gay, I would have no problem with it, why? because nothing in her story or lore is based on her sexuality or her choices. If Ryze was announced gay, whatever, he is a protector of a scroll, what does his sexuality have to do with that? Nothing. \n\nBut  Varus's original  story was based on the fact that he lost his wife and child. The depths that he would go to avenge them. Your throwing those characters out for diversity reasons? why couldn't they just release a new champion with Varus's new story? Why did they have to take an established character that no one asked to be changed and just rewrite his story? Because reasons?\n\n\nI get that they wanted to make him a Darkin, but why could they not just go \"He lost his family so he gave himself to a darkin so that he could have the power to avenge them\" Simple, easily done.\n\n(braces for public impact and people not reading full post and getting angry)\n\nEDIT: I understand the Varus (the darkin) is not Gay, but the people that inhabit him are. It STILL doesn't change the fact that we are tossing away characters for the sake of \"We need a more diverse cast of characters\"\n\nEDIT #2: Some people just CANNOT get it through their heads so let my clarify it again. Varus's Old lore was based on the fact that he had a wife and child. They were killed, driving him to gain powers to avenge them. That Varus is now COMPLETELY dead. It was not adjusted or changed. It's been thrown out the window, in a wood chipper and blasted into a fire. Not even the same character anymore. Him being straight was apart of his lore and his defining reason of gaining powers. Why would you take one of the few champions in league that SPECIFY'S that he straight (and it's one of the bases of his character) and retcon him to being gay and throwing out what meant the most to him? They could have simply fleshed out a character where their sexuality means nothing to their story and mentioned \"Hey, they are X\" and (other then real homophobes) no one would have cared.\n\nVarus was the vengeful husband. A moral grey area that people could relate to. Now he's a murderous machine with 2 gay lovers trying to stop him internally, with the vengeful thought of \"kill all humans\"","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-11-30T16:32:19.165+0000","up_votes":98,"down_votes":18,"body":"Maybe Varus found out that he's gay and he didn't love his wife and child, and so he murdered them and ran away. Then he came into contact with the Darkin and fell in love with the supposed male Darkin and they joined into 1.\n\nHehehehehehehehehe\n\nHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE\n\nNo.\n\nHonestly, the old set up really was pretty good to ring the new Darkin stuff onto. All the stuff you need is already there, you just needed to fill the Darkin's name in and put it somewhere in there, basically.\n\nWhy they have to re-write the entire character, I am not too sure.\n\nI mean, despite how much shit people gave for Galio, I actually think it makes perfect sense for the character because the old Galio literally has 0 personality, or rather, having 0 personality WAS his personality; which was very unworkable, hence they had to change it. And for the most part, they did gave him a pretty good characterisation, where his shining smile is just there to hide how trouble he really is, very reminiscent of the old Galio and pretty cool.\n\nBut then this... idk, it doesn't seem like it fits really, and seems like a complete waste of who Varus has been and the potential of that story because it was some pretty interesting stuff; sure it was some typical revenge story, but it's the struggle and the allusion of \"falling\" and \"how far are you willing to go to satisfy that thirst for vengeance\" was nevertheless a great touch and theme to look at. I really hope they aren't gonna just drop the ball here.\n\nI mean, the name \"Varus\" is not even referring to the arrow man anymore isn't it. It will take some time getting used to I suppose.","replies":[{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2017-11-30T16:33:22.618+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like I'm one of the few people that like both iterations of Galio.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-11-30T16:38:41.274+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FurorDivinus27,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Jumtus1c,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-11-30T16:33:22.618+0000)\n>\n> I feel like I&#x27;m one of the few people that like both iterations of Galio.\n\nI like both versions too, I just don't fault the lore change because it makes a lot sense to me.

If Varus had a husband and child before giving himself to the darkin, the story would be the exact same save for wife being husband. I think what you're more frustrated with is that the core to Varus's old story was that _he lost his family_. He lost the love of his life and the family they raised together, which broke him and drove him to the point of revenge.\n\nIn the new lore, Varus lost his love...buuuuuuuut is then rezzed as a ghost-voice in his head and he now shares the body as a trio. That's the more radical change to Varus's personality. Plus Varus isn't \"Varus\" alone anymore. He's three people that are all trying to control one body. That's the important change and I think you'd be upset by it no matter if this new Varus was a man and a woman, two women, two men, whatever.

I dunno, Varus himself may not be gay but he's got gay(s) inside him (Shit is way too confusing for me. I am a straight white man I have no opinion)\n\nFirstly, As a husband and a father, the old lore always used to make me think. \"What would I do if something happened to my family.\" I have always felt, as most fathers do, that I would likely go on a spree like Gerald Butler in Law Abiding Citizen. Understanding that I am a little older than most here that people may think losing a spouse may cause this level of fury, but (maybe I am just a traditionalist) it is a father's sole responsibility to protect his children.  As Columbus says in Zombieland: \"Take away a man's son, you've truly given him nothing left to lose. \"\n\nSecond, As a Marine, I understand original lore Varus' tear between saving his family and fulfilling his duty. This brought me closer to him, there is no worse feeling on a \"Soldiers\" mind while deployed than not being there to protect and aide his or her family. I feel this way even now, although I am no longer on active duty my job requires me to travel around the country, and sometimes internationally. The thought that always crosses my mind is what if I am not there to save my wife and kids because of a job. \n\nThese were the things people related to about Varus' lore.\n\nHowever, I do like the new story and understand why they made the choice. Watching the behind the scenes, I feel like they wanted to go with this love conquers all vibe. I feel like this missed a chance for a human to overpower a darkin in will. Aatrox fell to the Darkin, Kayn battles with the darkin. Feels like they could have made Varus [Valmir doesn't make sense] (vengeful the darkin bow didn't save Kai) make the bow his bitch.

It feels like a very safe way to try and throw a bone to the LGBT community but not really at the same time because Varus technically isn't gay if you follow that Varus is the Darkin and Val and Kai are the two gay guys.\n\nRetconning a 5 year old champ is very safe for them. Theyv'e already gotten the revenue from his release and his skins. It's been over a year since the last skin and people who spent money on him most likely already did... which makes it feel like a really cheap money grab from the LGBT demographic. They're going to try and get people to jump on the Varus train and spend money on skins because they probably don't have a shard.\n\nI don't see this as really progressive even though I want it to be.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AbyssionKnight","date":"2017-11-30T21:08:18.303+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree that this change is unnecessary.  I mean, in his original lore the corruption within the pit was purposefully left vague, so they easily could have just taken their lore about the Darkin, and tacked that on the existing story.  If they really wanted the Darkin's name to be Varus that's fine. Just have the human in the original story have a different name, then after his family has died he does the classic 'My life as [human name] is over, now I am Varus.' kind of shtick. \n\nI personally find this new lore a lot worse than the old one. The whole gay for the sake of diversity thing does annoy me, but if they had taken the old lore, but instead of 'wife and child' had changed it to 'husband and child' I wouldn't have been nearly as annoyed. Mainly what frustrates me about it is that it's not two meaningless hunters with no real backstory that are the human characters. They don't even really exist anymore, so it's not like they can be interesting characters and experience development. The old lore at least had a human that mattered, and who still had partial control of his mind and  body, which meant he had chances to develop. What would happen after he got his revenge? How would he deal with his betrayed oaths? The power corrupting him? There was a ton of potential there to tell the story of the Darkin AND the Human, and to do so in a morally grey position.  Now though Varus is definitively evil, and has no human component that really matters, so he feels a lot more 1 dimensional.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sensei Hentaii","date":"2017-11-30T17:46:00.517+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"What bothers me as a Varus player is that he now makes no sense, according to the lore there should be 3 beings struggling inside Varus to gain control - the darkin Varus and the 2 hunters have different goals yet share the same body - like kayn and rhaast, his lines now make 0 sense with who he's supposted to be (unless they'll give him a full new voice over which I doubt)\nSo meh, I wished they made a new darkin with a story similar to this one and kept Varus as that 1 guy that lost his family","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vampire Jesus","date":"2017-11-30T18:21:48.761+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":30,"body":"I find it silly that a man can't be tragic if he loses his gay lover, that losing a wife and a child is somehow a better tragedy?
