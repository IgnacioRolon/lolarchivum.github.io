Her concept was hit well and the point was made that she is suppose to be this succubus that feeds off of the pain and torment her victims feel.  Then I started to listen to her V/O and special interactions and felt confused. The actress and sounds themselves were fine, I just felt that the lines themselves were quite mature.\r\n\r\nNow I have no problems with it, its fine to me, but (to those who don&#039;t know I put the link in the post) A few Years ago when Slay Belle Katarina was released, her recall was initially a candy cane go-go pole. Then Morello came on to say that it was too much and changed it to her chopping the candy cane pole in half (this is one of the lamest recalls on a skin in a long time in my opinion, but that&#039;s besides the point) another point later was made saying &quot;It didn&#039;t match her character&quot;. Really? That&#039;s the excuse? I could name SO many skins that were released where the recalls don&#039;t match the character AT ALL. It&#039;s a fun skin, that&#039;s the point. Look at Moo Cow Alistar, would Alistar, a giant Minotaur wear a cow suit and feed Maokai&#039;s cats? NO! But it&#039;s funny! It&#039;s Great! So I kinda feel the excuse of it not fitting with the character was a cop out. Same with Singed turning into a giant bee, Or Braum elbow dropping a chair (since hes suppose to be a protector/defender) Or better yet, would a war leader who wants to feed her boar with the blood of her victims, ride a giant poro with her recall being her playing with the poro. I&#039;m not against any of these skins, in fact these are some of the best skins in the game.  \r\n\r\nBut it&#039;s okay for Eve to have these blatant sexual references (and whore insults to Ahri)  but a go go pole is too much?","replies":[{"poster":"Mews99","date":"2017-09-27T20:08:14.564+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wait that was too much but meanwhile Nidalee's dance animation\nlol wot?{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}\n\nEdit: Found out animation isn't exclusive to French Maid skin","replies":[{"poster":"Spank the Fox","date":"2017-09-27T22:43:51.775+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Nidalee's dance got nerfed when she got updated though.","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2017-09-28T06:50:58.355+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"She used to only spin around the pole. \n\nNow she spins around, rubs her tits and down it, and rubs her legs along it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mews99","date":"2017-09-28T01:10:50.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You call this nerfed? https://youtu.be/JkspuRQfUDQ?t=16s?noredirect","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"inplane","date":"2017-09-27T22:21:16.654+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe their standards have changed over the years?

Evelynn's release made all the sexist guys come out from their hole. Since Evelynn's announcements, they feel enabled, so I've seen a spawn of people claiming that women don't play videogames anyway and asking for more sexualization of the female cast.\n\nI am afraid Riot went full-circle and returned to the sexist female design.
