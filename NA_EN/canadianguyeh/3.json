What are your plans?","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":32,"down_votes":10,"body":"Hi!\r\n\r\nThis is a message directly to Riot Dyquill, you are one of the few rioters that actually braved the boards and answered people's questions about the state of Varus's new lore and how people feel about it. I have to give you respect for being one of the few that actually came onto the boards to discuss this subject.\r\n\r\nI am responsible for these three threads that have collected a total of 474 up votes (at the time of writing this thread)\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/AynzcA3s-as-a-husband-changing-varuss-story-has-broken-my-heart-open-letter-to-riot\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/Webxe5fE-riot-wont-ever-change-varus-because-of-the-music-video\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/Jumtus1c-varus-being-changed-to-gay-feels-wrong-for-his-character\r\n\r\nSo as you could tell I am very passionate about Varus's character, and if you have seen these threads I don't need to get into my opinion of what I think of the new lore. TL ;DR I think it pales in comparison to his original and im not the only one who thinks that\r\n\r\nSo, since you are on the team and one of the few that will actually reach out and talk to people about it. I want to ask, what are your plans? ARE there plans? What has happened internally to the reaction on the boards?\r\n\r\nJust please, we want to hear what your next plans are? Or if you are planning on doing anything at all?","replies":[{"poster":"Revive Dominion","date":"2017-12-04T23:18:57.249+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":29,"body":"I think he's rather fine how he is now.

This is gonna be my last post in this thread, but we’re still working on more Narrative communication to come.\n\nI tried to answer questions as best I can without launching into essays for each, combining similar questions where possible but omitting loaded or entirely subjective ones (e.g. “Why the deception when the PBE story leaked” and “Do you plan to address the lore update that was uncalled for and extremely poor in it's creation”). I also didn’t pin it because this is really just following thru on a promise I made to this small group of dedicated Varus mains on Boards, and not meant to be a big announcement. That being said, feel free to link this comment if you see others bring it up who haven’t read it.\n\nThanks for sticking with me on this wild ride - hope we deliver something that resonates with you more in the next one.\n\n\n**WHY DO THIS AT ALL? WHY VARUS SPECIFICALLY?** Super simply put, our philosophy is to keep evolving League - not just the game, but the story and world. In most respects (based on gameplay data + affinity and sentiment surveys), Varus was middling (check out 3m20s mark of the /dev video: https://youtu.be/KnI4es0Bv8I?t=3m20s). If we did our job right, players will now feel a lot more strongly about Varus either way - love or hate - and far less will find him just “ok.” \n\nI’ll note that it’s totally conceivable to have done this story with a completely new champ; however, our plan is generally to update older champs like Varus regardless, and we thought this story could be a good fit for him.\n\n\n**HOW DID YOU DECIDE? WHAT IS THE PROCESS LIKE?** This is a good example of the kind of question i think is better answered holistically, about our process for all champion updates of this nature. But I’ll try to be more specific. \n\nSome of you have asked for specific arguments for and against updating Varus, which I’m not gonna replicate, because we have meetings, emails, messages, random conversations over lunch, survey data, etc. that all contribute to the “argument.” There was never a “final debate” where one side “won” and the other “lost;” in the end, the team (specifically the writing and creative leads) made a decision on what they thought - given everything i’ve just listed above - was the one to do.\n\nThat being said - there was a ton of debate internally, among the core team but also Rioters in general. Virtually all the arguments that have come up on Boards and beyond came up during that process.\n\n(This next bit is more on the holistic side, and really oversimplified, but for what it’s worth…) we generally view champion updates through the lens of “pain versus gain: how many narrative and character possibilities are we gaining at the cost of losing some of the things players already love? We’re still collecting feedback and sentiment, but so far we think we achieved more gain than pain when it comes to Varus. \n\n\n**WHAT DID THE TEAM CONSIDER \"CORE\" TO VARUS' CHARACTER? **“The core of the character, to us, was the tragic loss of a loved one, the desperation that leads to a \"deal with the devil,\" and obviously the corruption stemming from a weapon.” First answered here: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7gn1yo/varus_as_we_fall_official_music_video_league_of/dql4545/ \n\n\n**WHY REMOVE THE FATHER ASPECT? THAT FELT CORE TO ME.** Originally answered here: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/z1dTsaQ6-so-lore-update-means-throwing-away-champions?comment=000000000002001c0000000100000000000000010001\n\nBut yeah, we agree this is fair feedback. Ultimately, we felt that romantic love would be a stronger motivator and bond for this particular story - see the next answer.\n\n\n**DID YOU TALK TO VARUS PLAYERS ABOUT THIS?** We have ongoing surveys that ask about favorite champions, as well as “Player Labs” where we invite mains of champs (among many other participants) to give us feedback on work in progress. For Varus specifically, we looked at existing data for sentiment on his backstory and affinity for his character. \n\nEvery champion has diehard mains, either of that champ’s gameplay or story or both. We’re fully aware that changing champs always runs the risk of leaving those mains feeling betrayed, and so we apply the “pain versus gain” framework I mentioned above in addition to trying to capture as much of their “core” character aspects as possible - but while still trying to push the bar creatively. \n\nThere’s a ton (and I mean a ton) of work behind the scenes that goes along with making decisions like this. This article on naming a champ (https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/12/naming-new-champions/) gives a good peek behind the scenes. You may not see the surveys, or the conversations, or the “arguments,” but trust me, they happen. \n\n\n**WHY MAKE VAL AND KAI GAY? WAS THIS A PR STUNT OR MOTIVATED BY SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE STORY ITSELF?** Val and Kai and their relationship was 100% a product of creative story decisions, and nothing more. The /dev video goes into some more detail at 5m11s mark (https://youtu.be/KnI4es0Bv8I?t=5m11s), but essentially we knew that for this story, they would need to have a super strong bond that would both bring them to desperation and then allow them to overcome the darkin presence; they would need to be partners on the battlefield and in life. While that suggested to us romantic love, rather than familial, the particular genders wouldn’t change anything about their heartlight relationship. So from there, the first draft of the script was written, and featured two warriors named Val and Kai. Simple as that.\n\n\n**WHY DOES YOUR COMMUNICATION SUCK? WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT TIME THERE'S BACKLASH LIKE THIS?**We’d like to think we suck a lot less now, but there’s always room for improvement. You can expect more Nexus articles and /dev diary videos (which have some of the best reach versus cost-to-make ratios), and the usual smattering of comments on forums like reddit and Boards. If you have other ideas of things you’d like to see, like a podcast or more regular blog, let us know so we can point to your comment and say “LET US GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT.”\n\nAs for handling backlash - we’ll keep listening and communicating, and take action based on those two-way conversations. But it always starts with the conversations. \n\n\n**HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE OUR PLEASURE/DISPLEASURE WITH YOUR DECISIONS?** Honestly, the way you’re doing it now is fine. I think what this question really is getting at is, how do we have more of an impact on the things Riot does? Which is a fair question as well. \n\nMy best piece of advice is to be proactive, saying what you’d like to see from X champ long before we’ve locked in the story. Feedback after the fact is still helpful and super encouraged, but we’ve likely made our final decision already, and it's more likely to inform our next decision than the current one - whereas proactive feedback about what you'd like to see can be taken into account during the actual development cycle. Obviously there are cases where we revert those changes, but it takes a ton of strong, accurate, and consistently negative feedback for that to happen.\n\n\n**DO YOU INTEND TO CHANGE/REVERT THE LORE? WHAT WOULD IT TAKE?** I know this isn't the answer this group wants, but no, we don’t. There’s no magic formula that has to happen or threshold that has to be reached for decisions to be changed, but as mentioned above, we’d have to see some major negative backlash before totally reverting a decision that’s been in motion for some time.\n\n\n**AT THE END OF THE DAY - DO YOU GET WHY WE'RE STILL FRUSTRATED AND ASKING YOU ALL THESE QUESTIONS?** Yeah, we totally get it. Wouldn’t still be talking if we didn’t. \n\n\n**WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU SAY?** I can’t answer this for you, but I hope as we continue to communicate about our decisions and update League, you’ll see what we’re saying is truthful and that we’re not here to bullshit you. Even when we disagree with one another, we’ll talk it out and keep it real.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2018-01-13T03:30:22.825+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DyQuill,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=WJKTWhlI,comment-id=0011,timestamp=2018-01-13T02:23:59.031+0000)\n> **WHY DO THIS AT ALL?

When i said \"stronger motivator,\" i meant more like \"what kind of motivation is the strongest for this story,\" not \"what's the strongest emotion there is.\" \n\nNo doubt that familial love ranks right up there with romantic love (maybe even higher?). But when we thought about what motivation makes sense for a story where the crux is a character making an incredibly desperate, risky, and frankly dumb decision, sacrificing everything in a headstrong, hasty bid to avoid losing the person they can't possibly imagine life without, we felt like romantic love matched the particular brand of desperation we were looking for (not to mention the common idiom of \"soulmate\" fit perfectly with what we planned for the tripartite darkin). \n\nUltimately it's a creative (and subjective) decision on which works best for the story, and it could have potentially gone either way.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2018-01-13T18:16:21.366+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DyQuill,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=WJKTWhlI,comment-id=001100000000,timestamp=2018-01-13T03:29:10.366+0000)\n>\n> Ultimately it&#x27;s a creative (and subjective) decision on which works best for the story, and it could have potentially gone either way.\n\nExcept one way matches the old story and the other way is something very different which distances the new character from Varus.

I just completely disagree because my entire life experience and all major media I've seen suggests otherwise. I completely agree that romantic love works fine in the story and makes complete sense. But I don't think it's by any means a \"stronger motivator for this story.\" I can see it making for a more 'poetic' ending with all 3 combined because if it were father and son sharing a body with a darkin that could be kind of creepy. But that's not a stronger motivator for the character to go down that path, that's a stronger motivator for the author (and probably to most of the audience's benefit, which means it's a fine choice).","replies":[{"poster":"B0OM","date":"2018-01-13T21:13:44.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think what DyQuill is getting at (correct me if I'm wrong) is that the motivator in Val and Kai's story is almost selfish, versus the selflessness of a father/son story. Val was unable to accept the thought of experiencing life without Kai (the sacrificial action was focused on being able to continue their heartlight relationship in life _together_), versus a father being unable to accept the thought of his son not experiencing life for himself (the sacrificial action would be focused on the son being able to continue living his life _at the expense of the father's_). Both are strong and valid motivators in different contexts, and I don't think it's fair or accurate to say that one is always stronger than the other based solely on personal experience (especially when there are plenty of examples available for both sides).","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2018-01-13T23:58:06.694+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":">I don't think it's fair or accurate to say that one is always stronger than the other based solely on personal experience (especially when there are plenty of examples available for both sides).\n\nI do think it's fair, because it isn't just personal experience, it's also the experience of everyone and everything I've ever seen. I don't just mean like close friends and family I've talked to, I mean every piece of storytelling I've ever seen that's related, which is a lot, and which means it's probably a fairly common thing throughout humanity. The very thing you spoke of, one being selfish vs the other being selfless is likely part of why that is.\n\nReally the point here is that I didn't see anything in the story that said the story needed to be about a romantic relationship. The whole heartlight thing didn't need to be at all, or could've been written to be a family thing. Also I agree with the criticism others have levied that it decreases the impact of his backstory, which is because it's a step down in importance to go from that parent/child relationship to a romantic one. His old backstory had that higher importance and was more about pain and suffering because of his loss and regret, whereas the current story feels more like an ongoing struggle with room for hope. People who identified with that pain and regret probably don't connect as well to the new story.\n\nI wouldn't want a world with just the parent/child relationship stories and no romantic ones though, and personally I connect with both. The problem is that Riot still hasn't actually publicly justified swapping his story from one to the other. They essentially said \"because we wanted to tell this story and saw that we could here.\" That doesn't justify it at all to people who liked the old story and have asked \"why not tell it somewhere else that doesn't require killing the old story?\" Riot's best answer so far seems to be \"we came up with the 3 person shared body thing which requires a darkin and that's creepy if it's family, poetic if it's lovers.\"\n\nIf that had been their answer from the start people could just decide that's good enough or not for them, but even now that's largely me just inferring, not an actual answer given. I'll give Riot the benefit of the doubt that that's just because they haven't figured out how to articulate it well enough yet but I hope you can see how to some it seems like they're trying not to answer it because they're afraid of the reaction. I think people are justified in being upset about it because I think it was a mistake to do the change they did. I think a family based story would've fit well and felt more appropriate to the character and the attachment people had to his old story. But I also don't think Riot is trying to cover it up with false excuses or anything, so I get annoyed when I see claims like that or that it was just to have a gay character.

Before, I was like, \"meh.\" Now I'm more, \"meh\" because it feels...\"flatter\".\n\nI agree with just about everything Dyquill tried to explain, and I fully understand his reasoning.\n\nHell, the stronger you feel about something, the less satisfied you are with any answer that isn't a full on admission to failure or whatever you're accusing them of. Unless Riot says,\"yes, we did a horrible crime, forgive us,\" most people who are complaining won't be satisfied with any answer, even if it's to a question they demand an answer for that have been answered over and over.\n\nWith that being said, the story, once again falls flat.  I can understand the romantic bond. I can understand wishing to tell a story with a twist. I can understand trying to make it provocative and polarizing. Hell, I understand that gay or straight, it can still work out or whatnot.  My main gripe of it is that neither Val nor Kai had enough individual characterization before the assimilation for us to differentiate between the two.  Not only that, but as you said, the amount of \"loss\" in this variation doesn't feel as strong because they are still able to communicate with each other.  At the very least, make it so one of them shows stronger signs of corruption.  Maybe that'll show up later, but they both have their minds despite not being able to fully restrain Varus. The full set of tragedy won't come about until one of them grows...silent.\n\n_____\n\n\nAlso, also, being proactive. He's no saying things like, \"guess what we're doing next, so we can fix it.\"  He's referring to moments like when we spoke about \"who would be better in a fight, Jax or Fiora?\"  Said it so much, Jax crossed Fiora over a bridge.\n\nWe need women who properly show muscle. Why is Sejuani in a bikini? Talk about it to the point that when Sej finally got her splash updates, whoa and behold. Her traditional splash now has muscle definition.\n\nThe best example of being pro-active I can think of is us talking about Kayle and Morgana right now. Kayle and Morgana are on the VGU list, but hey haven't been definitively added as THIS IS HAPPENING!  We had several threads of people discussing Kayle and Morgana's place in Runeterra.  There's been enough discussion where Riot could rely on some of what has been said before finalizing something.\n\nIf there's a character you feel passionate about still (other than the currently deceased), mention them now.  Even if it's something small like, \"I hope Jayce finds a new friend,\" or something bigger like, \"What if, when Noxus invades Demacia, the first person to run into Sion is not Galio but Fiora?\"\n\nIt's about just voicing your desire for the future before it occurs not just predict what will happen unless it's actual theory-crafting.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2018-01-15T05:50:59.014+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Valaran Nara,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=WJKTWhlI,comment-id=0011000d0000,timestamp=2018-01-15T02:43:34.701+0000)\n>\n> Unless Riot says,&quot;yes, we did a horrible crime, forgive us,&quot;\n\nIs there a crime worse than taking something that fans like and simply deleting it for no reason?

The answer is either \"sufficient\" or \"awful.\"  And if you find the answer to \"why\" as awful, you will demand a better explanation, but if there is no better explanation, then your question will never be answered.

Because you refused the answers that already came.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2018-01-17T16:36:11.036+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I kill someone you love and you ask why and I tell you I did it because it made me money are you going to stop there? Of course not. Telling you that I did it because I valued the life of your loved one less than I valued the money killing them made me wouldn't and shouldn't bring about any kind of peace or resolution there. You might want to know how I got to be the kind of person who felt that way and you'd damn sure want either me to be punished and/or me to apologize and admit I was wrong to make the decision.\n\nAs long as people are convinced it was a mistake they'll want Riot to admit it and apologize, which is exactly what they should do if they made a mistake. Your point seems to be that Riot doesn't view it as a mistake so people shouldn't expect an apology. And for some of us our point is that means Riot needs to be told it was a mistake and why until they understand and agree because it was a mistake and a big one at that. And if they ever do agree that it was they ought to apologize. As long as they don't agree it was a mistake we're going to be left with serious doubts about the decision making of whoever came up with replacing his old lore like this and anyone who approved it. How can I care about any other stories as well if that which most connects me to them could just be deleted for no good reason at any moment?\n\nI think a huge disconnect for Riot here is that they see the new lore as better than the old lore, in totality (so video included, ect.), and thus that it was the correct decision. But I think that's missing the real mistake. They could've used the new cool stuff they came up with (either as part of updating Varus or elsewhere) _and_ kept the good stuff from the old lore. They likely didn't in part due to time constraints of needing to publish _something_ within X amount of time and maybe just not really seeing the full problem until it was too far along (or maybe even published) or still don't fully get the issue. Those are understandable reasons to go through with it despite not being the best case scenario. But those reasons still don't negate it being an overall mistake and thus don't negate the need for Riot to admit it and apologize.\n\nIf Riot doesn't see that they messed up here they won't learn from it and will likely repeat the same mistake again. If anyone, Riot or otherwise, wants to argue that no mistake was made here they're welcome to try, but I have yet to see any remotely convincing attempts yet.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2018-01-13T18:53:11.500+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DyQuill,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=WJKTWhlI,comment-id=0011,timestamp=2018-01-13T02:23:59.031+0000)\n>\n> My best piece of advice is to be proactive, saying what you’d like to see from X champ long before we’ve locked in the story.\n\nAre you legitimately trying to troll us with this comment?

It honestly makes me angry to read this.\n\nNo, I wasn't but seeing reactions makes me think I could have worded it much better - my bad.\n\nI'm not asking you to be a mind-reader, obviously. What I meant was that it's easier to look at (and potentially incorporate) comments and theories from the community in advance of working on something than after it's mostly finished. \n\nFor example, if a champ like Galio is on the update schedule and there's a bunch of community threads about what you're hoping/wishing for, that's something we can consider as we develop. Threads after the release are still great feedback, but even if we see something we hadn't thought of/really like, it's a lot more complicated to make a change at that point. (Obviously Varus wasn't on any schedule, so I get that this is mostly moot...just trying to give some insight in general/for the future).\n\nThe realest answer is that video games are a weird medium where the expectation is that the audience gives feedback on the something as its being created, in real-time, with potential to revert decisions on work that they don't directly make. There's few other forms of art/creative products that function like that, and it's crazy hard to balance our own individual instincts around what will be awesome, the capabilities and plans we have as a company, and what the community (and various sub-communities) want. \n\nSo the realest answer is we're gonna try our best, listen (and listen, and listen, and keep listening) to your feedback, and make changes when we think it's the right call, but that's it. I know a lot of the community (especially on Boards) wants to have way more involvement/control over that decision-making, but it's just not realistic. We already have hundreds of Rioters trying to make these calls, and I promise your views are represented, even if you're not the one in the meeting.","replies":[{"poster":"Aku0ni","date":"2018-01-29T08:45:39.840+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You probably won't read this since I'd imagine you're still being swamped but this is something I really need to get off my chest and I can't go to sleep until I do. This is a bit of a long read, and I've seen the length of other comments like this one, I'm sorry but even though this won't change anything it'd be nice if my words were read. \n\nFor the last few months I struggled to get League to work. It kept shutting down before I even made it to the login screen and nothing I did fixed it, even after hours spent desperately looking for solutions. I gave up, and then I checked my email today and saw an \"important update\". I was excited, because maybe I could get back on and start playing again. I redownloaded for what might have been the tenth time, and I was back in League! And then I saw Varus' splash art had been updated and was even more thrilled. I know I'm very late, but what I saw in his lore stunned me. \n\nWhen I first started playing League it was back around the time when Braum had been released. I found the champions' lore and was OBSESSED in all caps. I read literally every single bit of lore and memorized it all. My sister would ask me questions about different champions and I had a snipet or two for all of them. And out of all those champions, Varus' lore was my absolute favorite. Why? \n\nTo me it was the rawest emotional backstory of them all. Varus' entire character was built upon a man who lost literally everything. His family, his village, his past and future, and in his rage he threw himself into the one thing he had left, the thing that cost him everything else to protect, and became an unstoppable force. A lot of people think this backstory was too shallow, too simple, too straight forward (ironically, given the arrow symbolism that I guess flew over a few people's heads, har har), too overdone \"father bent on revenge for dead family\", but his character was complex. It wasn't the corruption that drove him to kill. Every arrow he fired was by his own hand, and his in-game quotes make that very clear. His character had questionable morals, he killed out of rage and grief, and he showed no signs of regretting his decision. There was no going back. His purpose was clear. He had no remorse, but his potential to change was still there in his past, before he lost it all. His character arc still had plenty of room to be expanded, and I was always thrilled to find a new piece of fanart or fanfiction that reflected this. \n\nWhen I read his new lore I was devastated. Then I read what other people felt about it. There were some positive reviews, and I quickly discovered why when I learned about the gay lovers, loads of people love to support representation, but it didn't sit well with me, because why waste such a good story on a preexisting character? Then I read your justification for the changes, and I have some opinions that you may not like but I feel need to be heard and I haven't seen them addressed in any of the threads I've read, of which I read way too many.\n\nThe new lore does not reflect the old lore in any way. Yes, people died, yes a darkin corrupted and possessed people, and yes it's sad. There is loss, sure, but it isn't the same tragedy, and it shouldn't be described as such. It's too soft for the Varus I obsessed over. Varus was a character who lost everything and was on the path for his own destruction. \n\nWhat did the lovers loose? Some people died, but from what I've seen it wasn't the same level of destruction as what happened in the original lore which had no survivors. And they didn't loose each other, they almost did and sure their bodies are fused and a darkin is slaughtering everyone but their love is strong and together they can keep the darkin in relative check. _Together_. They still have each other, not everyone died, there's still hope and that isn't what Varus was originally about. He was a force of revenge, the corruption ate at him like a candle at a wick. He was a man on borrowed time. He had no one. That level of tragedy was powerful. It was blunt and straightforward but by god it was powerful. \n\nThis new lore was wasted on Varus who was very well established as someone with nothing left to loose. This new lore has a theme of love and a sliver of hope that can easily be crushed but still fights to prevail. In what way does that relate to the original Varus? It's been repeatedly discussed how easily the darkin plot could have been added to Varus' preexisting lore. Hell, I remember making the connection of Pallas=darkin and having my mind fricken blown back when I first started playing. \n\nNow though, Varus doesn't even have his name. Fans like myself can't even apply his name to what he was anymore, despite being told otherwise. Varus was the name of the human who lost everything. Now it's the name of a monster whose destruction is so aimless it's a disgrace to the bow it wields. Turning the human element of the character into the thing that corrupted him is literally a 180 from the original, it cannot be described as similar in any way other than archery and possession of a darkin, which has already been done anyway. This new lore should never have been applied to Varus. It deserved to be given to a brand new character, and I know full well how fond League is of pumping out new characters. Two lovers trapped together with a monster? That's great stuff! There's so much you can do with that! But Varus was the worst character to choose to carry that mantle. This is not Varus, and trying to pass it off as Varus repulsed me. You cannot honestly say that a pair of lovers who still have each other can match the level of loss Varus experienced in the original lore. Say what you will, but this is not the same story, and it is not the same character. \n\nIt seemed the majority of long-time Varus fans agree with me when I say this, and I've seen similar opinions among those less emotionally invested with the old lore, despite what you may say regarding the new lore's popularity. I can already tell none of this will change anything. It is disheartening, to say the least, that RIOT puts so little weight on the opinions of those who play League. We have no power. What we say or feel doesn't matter, because the decision has been made without our input and the people who made it are solidly convinced that what they did was the best decision despite evidence of the contrary. \n\nI have taken numerous classes in storytelling, creative writing, and character design. It's the profession I aim for. A good story makes the audience invest themselves in it, and I did that fully with the original Varus. I know what makes a story work, and what makes characters compelling, and both of these stories are absolutely amazing in their own right, but RIOT wasted each of them by doing what they did and I have yet to see them show any signs of considering that. \n\nFans cannot invest themselves in stories that can be changed with a wave of an invisible hand. All I've seen is assurance that what they've done was right, because they wrote it after all, so how could it be wrong, besides it's too late anyway, and sure some people will disagree but that's just how things are. And that's fine, everyone is entitled to their own opinions and of course it isn't reasonable to expect everyone to adhere to one opinion in particular. But when the vast majority of people who were deeply attached to this character say what was done to him was wrong? And they might acknowledge those opinions, but do they apologize? Do they offer any bit of regret other than \"yeah, it's a shame, maybe we should have asked for your input but what's done is done and this lore is much better anyway\"? Not from what I've seen, which maybe is just how companies work, but it's still a pretty sucky thing to do regardless. \n\nWe were blindsided by a total rewrite of a beloved character and were given absolutely no say in it whatsoever. By the time we could give our thoughts, the decision had already been made and now nothing can change it. This wasn't them updating the lore, this was them writing a entirely new character and slapping it onto an older one. They didn't even expect us to be okay with it. They knew there would be backlash and they did it anyway, because \"pain<gain\", and the loyal fans don't matter when they can get new fans out of this I suppose. Our pain is worth less to them than the potential gain of people drawn in by the new lore, which a new character would have provided without any pain. I just feel like they've forgotten who they're meant to be appealing to with their decision making. \n\nAnd it's too late. Varus' old lore is gone. All that raw grief and tragedy is gone. After all the hype spent on the new lore, and the way RIOT responds to complaints about lore changes in the past, the old Varus won't come back, and that is a damn shame, even if he was destined to die. \n\nI'm not sure I can keep playing League when the character whose story compelled me to play in the first place has been so disrespectfully cast aside in favor of a tale better suited to a fresh new character. It's clear RIOT has no investment in it's stories, so why should I? What could have been two equally compelling stories in their own unique ways have been lost. \n\nI'd been tetering on the edge of this decision during the frustrating months of struggling to get League to work, and watching as the lores I'd so painstakingly memorized were chopped in half, changed, and forgotten. What's been done to Varus has made up my mind. I have no other reason to keep playing now that the story that drove me to play is gone, shocking given how many stories there are in League. I know, believe me I know. And I expect this comment will either be ignored or receive a reply that amounts to \"I've read your comment and will respond when time allows\" or \"I'm sorry you feel that way\", or \"I acknowledge your opinion\" and nothing else, but this is something that I really needed to say, regardless of whether or not it earns a response fundamentally different from the others that I've read.\n\nThank you for your time. I wish I could be told the same.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Baron Von Bangin","date":"2018-01-14T00:00:18.944+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"Pathetic.

After the initial leak people were complaining that you deleted Varus and replaced him with a new character. Red posts started appearing to reassure players that this would make sense with the full lore drop, but the full lore drop made this new character even less like Varus than what we saw from the initial leak. It was like the Reds were posting either without reading the feedback or just blatantly ignoring it to buy time.\n\nIf something like this happens in the future and Riot says to wait a few days before giving feedback, I will point to this event as a reason to not listen to that request.\n> **WHY DO THIS AT ALL? WHY VARUS SPECIFICALLY?** Super simply put, our philosophy is to keep evolving League - not just the game, but the story and world. In most respects (based on gameplay data + affinity and sentiment surveys), Varus was middling (check out 3m20s mark of the /dev video: https://youtu.be/KnI4es0Bv8I?t=3m20s). If we did our job right, players will now feel a lot more strongly about Varus either way - love or hate - and far less will find him just “ok.” \n\nAnd for the people who liked him before and end up hating him now thanks to your intent to make the character more polarizing, it basically feels like being a fan of anything Riot has made earns you massive disrespect from Riot itself. I see the reasoning behind trying to constantly evolve the gameplay and story of the game, but not the BACKstory of characters.\n> **WHAT DID THE TEAM CONSIDER &quot;CORE&quot; TO VARUS&#x27; CHARACTER? **“The core of the character, to us, was the tragic loss of a loved one, the desperation that leads to a &quot;deal with the devil,&quot; and obviously the corruption stemming from a weapon.” First answered here: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7gn1yo/varus_as_we_fall_official_music_video_league_of/dql4545/ \n\nVal and Kai haven't lost each other and they didn't make a deal of any kind. Those things you claim were recognized as core to the old Varus are completely absent from the new one.\n> DO YOU INTEND TO CHANGE/REVERT THE LORE? WHAT WOULD IT TAKE? I know this isn't the answer this group wants, but no, we don’t. There’s no magic formula that has to happen or threshold that has to be reached for decisions to be changed, but as mentioned above, we’d have to see some major negative backlash before totally reverting a decision that’s been in motion for some time.\n\nTwo complaint threads about Varus are on the front page of the \"Best\" filter for Story, Art, and Sound, putting this topic up there with the Fiora visual update, removing Graves' cigar, and disabling Gangplank for story reasons.

This whole lore change is a disgrace and damn well certainly made me worry about future endeavors that the lore team makes on older champions. God help aatrox with your team on the loose because his concept is almost certainly going to be ruined so you can have more 'character possibilities' when your never going to touch that character for years after the bloody change like every other character you made in this game. The only one you sort of expanded on was mf and that literally brought nothing to the plot other than a tiney bit of personality development which will proberbly only bear fruit late this or next year which is a shame because even though it didn't expand anything it was a good read. Look at jhin for another prime example (this lore is excellent). You guys said you would expand on his story with shen and zed.  Nope been 2 years since that was promised any hope of you guys expanding it has been long gone until you rework akali or some bs so you can fit another character in that storyline. Also dont even try to deny that you couldnt change varus's lore back even if you wanted too because of the animation simply invested too much into this crap so the potential waste will never override the fact that anyone who objectively looks at this lore sees that its horrible both from a story point of view and a character view. You pulled another fken panth but instead of one interesting character being randomly taken over by a being we know nothing about its two bland characters instead.

So here we go even though i know its not going to do much because im pretty sure you screwed it up anyway after you tried to humanise the darkin with the new varus lore. Aatrox is a god damn monster. His saving of people is a act which hides his underlining theme which is turning people into monsters by saving or destroying there lives so that they commit atrocities to other people. Hell its not like you have nothing to work with here, he literally set up runeterra in its current form with proof of his influence everywhere. Also his name is a literal pun on atrocity. Dont make him a hero he is not one. He is a messed up being that derives pleasure from turning people against eachother and commiting horrid acts. Hell he refrences tryndamere as his greatest creation a man he screwed up so much that its rage wont let it die.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProphetMano","date":"2018-01-13T05:24:29.976+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm sorry, but, pardon me? \n>  DO YOU INTEND TO CHANGE/REVERT THE LORE? WHAT WOULD IT TAKE? I know this isn't the answer this group wants, but no, we don’t. There’s no magic formula that has to happen or threshold that has to be reached for decisions to be changed, but as mentioned above, we’d have to see some major negative backlash before totally reverting a decision that’s been in motion for some time.\n\n    You say here that we would need a major negative backlash before reverting a decision that has been in motion. However, as seen on Reddit, the Boards, and to an extent, Twitter, we have seen that the backlash has been more than a \"to this small group of dedicated Varus mains on Boards\". I usually never comment, but the fact that the negative backlash has been major, and by I mean multiple high voted posts (see above on CandianGuyEh's post). You also said earlier that \"echo chambers are real (not just Boards, but reddit and Twitter and everywhere),\" . If we're talking about echo chambers being real, I wouldn't say they are echo chambers. The negativity and backlash on this, and everywhere, isn't an echo chamber. It's a stadium, filled with a roaring crowd, one bigger than the echo chambers of \"positivity\". You may deny this, but the evidence is there. Have you seen a post, filled with appreciation for the new lore anywhere? (No meme posts, such as the Abs post.) Me neither.\n\n> Val and Kai and their relationship was 100% a product of creative story decisions\n\n   Another point I have to say is here is, if Val and Kai are a product of creative story decisions, why make them in the first place? In many other lore updates, we see that the character is kept the same. What stops this from being the same? If you wanted to keep Varus' lore relative to the new lore being pumped out, you could have kept his character, but expanded on his bow, not two new characters who fuse with the darkin. The story itself it great, but it doesn't fit the theme of who Varus is. You (and the Narrative Team) write stories for a living, you (guys) should know this. I'm not disrespecting your work, but I feel a disattachment from this new lore and the theme of the old Varus. Kai and Val are not needed, the story could have worked perfectly fine without them. In the story, they (Just Val) makes the deal with the devil. Another point is that why need 3 people inside one body? It would make the VO a worse version of Rhaast and Kayn. Also, if you wanted a strong bond, brotherhood or son/father would have worked. My personal favorite brotherhood bond is from Fullmetal Alchemist, which shows how strong a family bond can go. Romantic Love is not needed for this, nor is a sexual orientation change.\n\n> There’s no magic formula that has to happen or threshold that has to be reached for decisions to be changed\n\n  There is however, and it's called backlash. Lets go back in time for a bit, \"The Piltover/Zaun Update\". In this update for lore, champions from Zaun and Piltover had updated lores, including Jayce and Viktor, the two genius rivals. The first lore update Viktor recieved painted him as a black knight, which the community was heavily upset with. The backlash was actually weaker than what you see here. Heck, some of the boards hated the backlash, and it was shown. However, the lore was retconned and redone to paint Viktor as the \"Grey Knight\" and not a villain. Why am I bringing this up? The backlash here is greater than the one seen on Viktor's, so why the decision not to retcon it? The lore doesn't fit Varus, multiple instances of backlash, and more hate than I've seen than positivity. It's a weird world we live in, huh?\n\n> My best piece of advice is to be proactive, saying what you’d like to see from X champ long before we’ve locked in the story\n\n We didn't get this choice here, it was given to us out of the blue. The lore update in the client was hit with negativity, where you said that once we saw the full lore, we'd be happy. We weren't. \n\nSorry for this long rant my dear Rioter, but I, like the rest of Varus' fanbase, am genuinely upset with the new lore and how the Narrative Team decided to handle it. Of course this rant isn't even a dent within the steel surface of your minds, but hopefully it'll leave a scratch deep enough to show you how we as a community feel, and how we are dissapointed. Not mad, dissapointed. \n\nI hope you actually take in consideration the community next time. I really do enjoy your guy's works, but this one work hits me deeper as it erased one of my favorite champions. Not reworked, erased.\n\n\nEdit 1:\n> Feedback after the fact is still helpful and super encouraged, but we’ve likely made our final decision already, and it's more likely to inform our next decision than the current one - whereas proactive feedback about what you'd like to see can be taken into account during the actual development cycle. Obviously there are cases where we revert those changes, but it takes a ton of strong, accurate, and consistently negative feedback for that to happen.\n\nWhy bother responding to us if you made the final decision? What's with the pity?  How long does these \"consist forms of negative feedback\" have to last? Two months to me sounds like a pretty long time, as since the video, lore, and comic was released, a constant stream of negativity was hitting your team like a rapid river, drowning you in negative comments. \nYou, and your team, cannot deny the amount of hate on this lore change. Please, I beg of thy, release a dev-blog post or an official post to gain more attention, and not be stuck in this small, dragged on board forum post.

(Varus old lore sucked tho, old lore was cliche tho, ur a homophobe, ROFL you liked the cliche old lore lol what a LOSER, etc.)\n\nModerate people read the lore and enjoy it, but don't have a strong tie to it, meaning they are less biased, but at the cost of perhaps having less insight regarding a particular lore piece compared to the passionate fans.\n\nPassionate people got pulled into some part of the lore and really enjoy it, and these are the people that bother putting in effort to make long complaints about changes.  Depending on the magnitude of the changes, these people's deep interest can be easily turned into hostility, since it will feel like heartless betrayal.\n\n\nI don't know how you guys are judging reception regarding something subjective like lore, but if it's through some anonymous polling then you're getting worthless opinions from people who _really_ could not care less.\n\nAn indifferent person sees an update, music video, gets asked \"Hey do you like this update?\" and that person will answer yes even though they haven't read a single word of Varus' old lore, and won't read his new lore either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CanadianGuyEh","date":"2017-12-07T19:38:26.079+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DyQuill,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=WJKTWhlI,comment-id=000800040000,timestamp=2017-12-07T18:57:11.415+0000)\n>\n> i disagree with this a little - since the new narrative dropped, we&#x27;ve posted comments across forums almost every day, and have definitely been reading all the threads. \n> \n> I can give you some answers about overall reception, but to be honest, I feel like posting that kind of update will be taken as argumentative or defensive, because it&#x27;s definitely not the view Boards often seems to have.

If someone who does not care so much about the lore or the characters and only want to play the game, they could care less about the story/lore.\n\nIn all things that are hobbies and interests there will be more people dedicated to certain aspects of anything then others.  im going to use cars and driving for my example.\n\nyou have 3 people, they all own cars and they all like driving/don't mind it. Person 1 knows nothing about their car, they know that gas is go and brake is stop. Person 2 may know how to change their oil and maybe how to change tires. Person 3 knows how to fix anything on a car, they read the manual, they understand every part about it and can repair a car with their eyes closed.\n\nSo if someone took each person's car and altered something in it and told them afterwards (car still works), what would the reaction be? (Not the best example, but im at work and its the only thing I could come up with)\n\nSee, gameplay is the action of driving and the car itself is the lore. Some people hop onto league, hit the yellow L and click play. Thats it. Others however go deeper, much deeper. If someone who is indifferent to what they do to the character (as long as they don't touch the gameplay) then wouldn't the person who really cares about the lore have a bit more of a valued opinion then the other? If I had something wrong with my car who would I ask?\n\n\nAll in all I don't think we are being heard. I have had many conversations with a bunch of people and none of them like the New Varus lore either, down right ruins the character in my opinion. Yet we are literally just told \"Well other people like it!\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tendrian","date":"2017-12-08T00:44:37.283+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">One thing I do want to ask about, because I think it's relevant and something you can give us insight about: what do you see as the difference between \"people actually involved with the lore\" and those \"who only casually care?\" I don't disagree there's a difference, but I want to know how you all differentiate between those groups.\n\nWell, first of all, one would think that if you put out new lore for an existing champion, it is mainly aimed at the people who are already attached to that champion. No doubt it's great if new people get interested as well, but I would assume your core audience for this stuff is the already existing community of fans. You might have different priorities of course, but I would think if a rewritten lore is disliked by most of the character's fanbase then it's not a very successful project, even if the greater majority is mostly indifferent.\n\nSecondly, many of those who dislike the new stuff, me included, haven't argued that it's crap in isolation. One of the things I've read the most in the last days is \"it would have been fine on a new champion\". I'm personally not the biggest fan of the new lore even on it's own, but I don't think it's really terrible. I wouldn't have cared if this weird three-in-one dude was just the newest addition to the roster.\nFor many people it just failed to be in any way related to Varus, or resonate with them for the same reasons his old story did. That's by far the biggest point of criticism I have seen. So to discuss the area where your new lore arguably failed completely, you kind of need the people who give a crap about Varus, or have at least read his old bio. I can perfectly imagine that a lot of people just watch the video and comic and are like \"oh, Riot did something like that for one of their champs? Neat.\" without knowing or caring about the context of a character from the lore that many people liked having to die for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2017-12-07T23:42:32.941+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DyQuill,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=WJKTWhlI,comment-id=000800040000,timestamp=2017-12-07T18:57:11.415+0000)\n>\n> i disagree with this a little - since the new narrative dropped, we&#x27;ve posted comments across forums almost every day, and have definitely been reading all the threads. \n\nSince \"Heartsworn Varus\" dropped, you've practically been the only person from Riot responding about Varus.

Wenseslaus has been liking, retweeting, and responding only to positive comments on twitter (save one accusation that the lore change was politically motivated).\n\nI believe changing \"we've\" to \"I've\" is more appropriate since I get the feeling you're the only Rioter remotely involved with Varus that wants to have the conversation right now.\n\n> The situation in general is that the community (Boards and beyond) could probably use some more insight into how we think about champions and their stories. I&#x27;m working on that now. \n\nWill it be as hyped and promoted like the Varus story?  Will it include answers and replies from those involved in the Varus rework?  Will anyone else from Riot involved in the rework apologize to old Varus fans or will they just label anyone still upset as \"homophobic\" and hide behind the armed officers at the gates of Riot HQ?\n\nAn article on Narrative's insight and process would be nice, but I'd rather see something explaining why the \"Heartsworn\" story HAD to involve Varus and why a family man had to be killed to in order for this \"politically positive\" romance to exist.  I would so hope that the actual writers and producers had the courage to answer their critics, but I can't expect everything can I?\n \n> One thing I do want to ask about, because I think it&#x27;s relevant and something you can give us insight about: what do you see as the difference between &quot;people actually involved with the lore&quot; and those &quot;who only casually care?&quot; I don&#x27;t disagree there&#x27;s a difference, but I want to know how you all differentiate between those groups.\n\nThe vast majority of players are \"indifferent.\"  They only care about the game and the mechanics.  These are the people who have heard of a thing called _Star Wars_ and may have seen snippets of a movie here and there, but wouldn't know \"The Force\" from an \"Ewok.\"\n\nThe next group, \"casuals,\" are aware that there is a story for every champ, but only read the ones that pique their curiosity or the ones that they play on a regular basis.  These are the ones who may have seen the films and really liked Han Solo, but generally treat the movies like entertainment.\n\n\"Invested\" players have read every story Riot has produced, from the old Journals of Justice to the current reworked stories.  They may be writers themselves or just have a deep love of the game and it's world.  These are the people who have read more than four _Star Wars_ novels and may have purchased more than one high-priced lightsaber for their Jedi cosplay costume.\n\n\"Passionate\" lore fans usually devour every bit of content that comes out and hungers for more.  They actively look for hooks for their own internal stories and try to predict future stories from what was written, looking carefully for hints and clues that may or may not be there.  These are the fans that make other fans look sideways at them with concern.  This is the _Star Wars_ fan who knows what David Prowse _actually_ said to Mark Hamill in the \"I am your father\" scene from _The Empire Strikes Back._\n\n(Note:  I was going to make a comparison to cars, but someone else beat me to it!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"333lom","date":"2017-12-07T22:18:36.967+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"May I alter a bit the direction of the thread?

The LGBT aspects, while worth being applauded, are divorced from Varus. You could have pleased the same crowd of people by releasing a new champion who was LGBT. Praise for LGBT inclusion is not praise for Varus&#x27;s lore.\n> \n> To that end, I also have issues with the handling of LGBT representation in this event as League&#x27;s very first LGBT characters are defined by their relationship to one another and nothing more. I find this more than a little reductive. There also seems to be an aggressive amount of marketing posturing. As if Riot wants to be applauded for taking this progressive step. To that end I find that this is a step that should have happened a LONG time ago. Players deserve MUCH more than a single token LGBT character to identify with. - This however, has nothing to do with Varus or the erasure of his lore.\n\n\nI mean, no offence but I highly disagree with that the relationship is reductive. Honestly I don't know what straight people want from us (gay people) when it comes to representation. I'm genuinely baffled. I mean tell me, really, how is a story about love, a love that happens to be between two men, suddenly a bad story because.... it's only about their love? Have you read the comics? Do you understand the basics of the new Varus lore, that human love is the only thing that can truly oppose a darkin's bloodlust??? The characters are defined by their love and by their resitance to Varus. And honestly, the problem is not with the gay couple, it comes with Varus being a darkin in the first place.\n\nAnd I, someone who actively follows LoL lore and has read all the lore entries and actually raged quite hard when they changed Soraka's lore, can tell you that the old Varus story was one of the most boring pieces of lore I've read (compared to old Soraka, for example). Like, it just is, I'm sorry. I can see how people can relate to the character seeking revenge after losing his family - that is a very well established trope. It's a very emotional trope. It's also boring. I prefer the schizophrenic mix of darkin and two humans in constant struggle for that unholy body they created.","replies":[{"poster":"JacctheInsomniac","date":"2017-12-08T00:34:53.540+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Dobyk","date":"2017-12-08T15:03:05.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JacctheInsomniac,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=WJKTWhlI,comment-id=0008000800000002,timestamp=2017-12-08T00:34:53.540+0000)\n>\n> Because they&#x27;re not allowed to be actual characters.

But neither Valmar nor Kai have personalities or characters.\n> \n> Which is something that you can&#x27;t say about old Varus for a number of reasons but one huge one. _He made decisions._ When Varus chooses to stay at the temple to guard Pallas instead of defending his village and family what does that tell you about his values? When he chooses to unleash the Corruption he sacrificed everything to guard what does that tell you about how he&#x27;s changed?\n\n The problem with old Varus was/is that the story was too linear without an ongoing struggle or development - his only goal is to avenge his family (aka kill Noxians) while he still has time before the corruption takes him over. I strongly disagree with your points on Valmar and Kai not having personalities - both the comics and the video present two very different temperaments. Valmar is very spontaneous, impulsive and prone to anger and prejudice - this is why he is more likely to die first and be absorbed completely by Varus. Kai is very disciplined, serene and forgiving - this is why he is able to maintain the status quo within the body by calming Valmar. I don't think it's fair to compare Rakan and Xayah to Valmar and Kai, since the humans were deliberately designed to be two normal dudes. Had they had more prominent/flashy/fabulous personalities that would have taken more focus away from Varus the darkin. The point is for them to be different enough,  yet overall \"regular dudes\" in order to contrast both the darkin and the new Varus body. They are not designed to have a detailed or special story like the vestayans, who are interesting already by virtue of not being humans.\n\nI think the thought process behind the Varus update went something like this:\n\n1. They wanted to focus on the bow, so they got the idea it could be a darkin.\n2. They immediately thought of making the old Varus the host for that bow, but they thought it's a story very similar to Kayne, since the old Varus would be fighting off the bow's corruption like Kayn is resisting Rhaast.\n3. They thought it would be cool if instead they introduced two hosts for the darkin.\n4. They thought about a straight couple but then they realized that the female presence could be confusing given the resulting body is unambiguously male.\n5. Then they thought it could be two brothers or comrades, until someone said \"why not a gay couple?\".  Then they realized that romantic love could be a compelling narrative element.\n6. Finally, they realized they would hit two birds with one stone - make a crazy weird and unique darkin character and also have a gay couple. \n7. They tried to preserve the Old Varus themes as much as possible.\n\nThe end result is the first darkin champion with a \"complex\" motivation beyond mere bloodshed. Also a multiple personality champion. Varus is now an inhumanly beautiful and sadistic monster whose bloodlust is curbed only by an unlikely (and unlucky) gay couple. The power balance, however, is definitely on Varus' side. It's not about love winning. It's about love surviving until it will most likely lose to that which is inhuman. And the inhuman part happens to be pretty badass.\n","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CanadianGuyEh","date":"2017-12-06T16:14:13.923+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DyQuill,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=WJKTWhlI,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2017-12-06T00:47:12.770+0000)\n>\n> Yo sorry I didn&#x27;t see this until now - unfortunately Boards only notifies us if someone replies to a comment, not if they just mention a red name. \n> \n> I&#x27;ve been talking with Rioters not just on the team behind Varus, but Narrative in general, and while I promise this is not the last you&#x27;ll hear from us, I don&#x27;t know what the next time looks like yet (i.e. Nexus post, more comments on Boards/reddit, etc.) \n> \n> Feel free to keep hitting us up here for now.\n\nThank you for coming\n\nBut im sorry it sounds like the excuse of \"we are talking internally and will get back to you soon\" then never hear of it again.
