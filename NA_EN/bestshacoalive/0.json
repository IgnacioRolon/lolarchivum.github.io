You cant tell other players to report someone? I mean i been playing for years same as you and remember when we didnt have this auto ban system? Your point is fair but, fire + fire (two people arguing) shouldnt = riot adding more gas (both accounts getting banned.) Both players getting banned gets dosnt fix anything so **IMO** reports should be negated by other reports.. if 2 people argue in a game and they report each other the reports should get dropped as it was between them. Some situations where ppl have friends and can get more reports on 1 person should be looked at. Thats just how I feel and I personally will never see this system as anything other than harmful to player attitude. To some it may help reform them but to most it will do nothing but make them more toxic and angry. I see the auto system as nothing more than a lazy way to go through all the reports without an actual person looking at it... a cheaper way to have less employees. The sooner you ppl see this and stop turning a blind eye the sooner it can get fixed. There is something called playful banter that me and my friend and lots of other people do...   this is when you joke a tease a little about things they can improve on. It made me better.. hearing those jokes helped me to see my mistakes and strive to fix them and get better but... most of you players take a lot of words personal and are so quick to just press the report button not realizing at all what its doing to them or caring for that matter. Its pointless and you are no better for doing that than the person who said a few unkind words. I want you ppl to realize this is the INTERNET and unkind words exchanged everyday and it is not unusual! and by any means worth account suspending / ban punishment. Being chat ban is one thing... if they cant talk that fixes the problem dont ya think?... or if riot would add and actually disable chat button?... I WAS BORN IN THE USA AND WE HAVE FREEDOM TO SAY WHAT WE WANT! but are dictated this game?!.. Look at tyler1 people. Has been banned and yet still plays over and over still saying what he wants because of the system. This is a free to play game and there is nothing anyone can do about someone making a new account and playing again.. So why do you feel the need to ban them? and be so rude about it on top of it... A good amount of ppl I see on here act like their S**T dosnt stink. Well it does.. and  you are no better than the rest.. we all have bad days and are human.\r\n Keep this in mind","replies":[{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-09-14T18:57:55.020+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Asking someone to report someone along with you doesn't change anything.

This is mainly bc of the autoban system.\n\nThe system only punishes if it detects a pattern of consistent negative behavior. Manual reviews are occasionally done though for more extreme cases. If you've done nothing wrong then you don't have to worry about being punished. From [Riot Tantram](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/unobngtr-how-player-behavior-penalties-affect-hextech-crafting?show=rundown): \n\n>Actually, Erdrik is correct here.\n\n>A report flags a game for review. They do not establish guilt. The game is then reviewed for harassment, feeding, etc. This is why 'troll reporting' or 'gang reporting' do not work. False or inaccurate reports are thrown out.\n\n>You cannot ever be punished for saying nothing .. unless of course it's for something gameplay related like feeding, afking or cheating. But, you can never be punished for offensive language, hate speech or verbal abuse if you said nothing.\n\nAlso, many other game companies are following Riots lead and implementing systems to help better combat toxicity within their games. In LoL at least retaliation will not allow you to get off scott free. If someone refuses to stop acting up then muting them rather than flaming them will prevent you from being punished alongside them. From [Understanding the Tribunal](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2726400): \n\n>**4) That player in my game was far worse than me. Why am I banned???**\na) I'll keep this one simple: retaliation isn't OK. Reacting to a toxic player by being toxic just incites that player to be even worse--it also ruins the game for up to 8 other players. It is far, far worse to watch two people yelling at each other all game than it is to watch 1 player ranting into blank space. Almost everyone in the game can find someone out there that behaves worse than they do--but so what? Finding someone worse doesn't justify your behavior or justify retaliation. We expect more out of our players. What players often don't realize is... those other players in your game that you thought were worse? Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on. If you retaliate, both of you will be banned. It's really that simple.\n\nP.S. As far as Freedom of Speech goes, from [Ulanopo's Knowledge Base](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4086541&page=1#post43465469): \n\n>**Freedom of Speech!!!!!Â**\n\n>DoesnÂt apply. No really. If weÂre talking about American law, the First Amendment only applies to the government making laws that prohibit speech and, even then, freedom of speech isnÂt absolute. For example, you canÂt incite a riot, plan to kill the president or yell fire in a crowded theater.\n\n>Also, thereÂs nothing in the First Amendment that protects you from the consequences of your speech. People are fired all the time for making derogatory comments about their employer. My workplace, for example, has a social media policy that says that I can be terminated for badmouthing the company. They donÂt ask for passwords and access as some companies have been known to do, but it wouldnÂt be all that difficult to find me on the internet, knowing my real name, phone number and address.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AstÃ´lfo","date":"2016-09-14T18:57:06.726+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Joke threads go in M&G.","replies":[{"poster":"S0kaX","date":"2016-09-14T18:58:09.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=nep2une,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=xrp0E16q,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-09-14T18:57:06.726+0000)\n>\n> Joke threads go in M&amp;G.\n\n:))","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2016-09-14T18:53:44.345+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too long to read...","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-14T19:51:25.241+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"_ I WAS BORN IN THE USA AND WE HAVE FREEDOM TO SAY WHAT WE WANT!_\n\nWrong. Sorry to shock you like this, but freedom of speech does not mean you get to defame, threaten or verbally assault others. \n\nIt means you have the right to voice your political, religious, scientific and other opinions without the government or other people being able to restrict them, unless they violate other laws. Riot games is A; not the government, and B: i am fairly sure a vomit of threads and stupidity is not something you can defend with freedom of speech.\n\nSince you take such pride in being a US citizen, maybe learn what freedom actually means, instead of being a disgrace to your country and using it as an excuse to justify your behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"S0kaX","date":"2016-09-14T18:57:45.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooor you can simply mute him.","replies":[{"poster":"BestShacoAlive","date":"2016-09-14T19:04:06.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"this","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eisenhammer","date":"2017-02-23T07:33:40.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is broken...I had 3 Games with dudes that troll hard and flame on me and want to Report me.What i said was...\"i will Report them\".No bad word...no flame etc.And exactly those 3 games was mention when i got a auto-permabann.Again,i was not flaming or \"extreme toxic\"..no even toxic.\nPermaban just i tell some really extreme toxic dudes that i will Report them is a bit hard in my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-09-14T19:31:55.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> if 2 people argue in a game and they report each other the reports should get dropped as it was between them.\n\nThe argument may have been between those 2 people, but the argument affects more than just the 2 people. It affects everyone on their team as well, bringing down team morale. Both players were exhibiting unacceptable behavior, so I don't see why reports the should cancel each other out.\n\n> Some situations where ppl have friends and can get more reports on 1 person should be looked at.\n\nI don't really agree with this. Riot has specifically made the system to make sure that players in a premade group don't have any extra power than solo players when it comes to reports. Now, if the multiple reports come from players that aren't in a premade group together, I can see something like this having some effect.,\n\nHowever, something to keep in mind is that Riot isn't looking to punish players for a single bad game/day, they're more looking to punish players who exhibit consistent negative behavior. Unless, of course, the behavior shown in the single bad game is quite severe and deserving of an escalated punishment.\n\n> There is something called playful banter that me and my friend and lots of other people do... this is when you joke a tease a little about things they can improve on.\n\nPersonally, I'm all for playful banter. It can keep the game interesting and fun for me. However, there comes a point where playful banter crosses over to simply being a jerk. Saying something like \"Wow, nice try :P\" after an opponent barely failed a tower dive I personally would say is acceptable, but saying \"Damn, get rekt bitch\" isn't. That is simply poor sportsmanship.\n\nAs for constructive criticism, it's pretty much the same thing. There's constructive criticism, and then there's simply being a jerk. There are plenty of ways to offer advice on how to improve without being negative. Saying \"Could you please play safer and not overextend\" is acceptable, saying \"OMG, stop overextending, fucking feeder\" isn't.\n\n> I WAS BORN IN THE USA AND WE HAVE FREEDOM TO SAY WHAT WE WANT!\n\nYes, you do have the freedom to say what you want, but Riot also has the freedom to decide what is acceptable in their own game. The Freedom of Speech granted to us by the First Amendment only protects us from the government. It does not apply to private entities, like Riot Games.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2016-09-14T20:11:07.644+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zombiemaster,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=xrp0E16q,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-09-14T19:31:55.678+0000)\n>\n\n>There are plenty of ways to offer advice on how to improve with being negative.\n\nI think you meant to say \"without being negative\" here ;).","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-09-14T20:26:25.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why yes, yes I did.
