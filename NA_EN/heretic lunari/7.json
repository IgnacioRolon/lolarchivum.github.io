It's a high-fantasy series, starring the eponymous Elric. He's an albino/emperor/rockstar/drug-addict who wields a sentient vampiric sword (the bloodlust of which he struggles to control). \n\nIt was published during the 70's. Although I found the premise interesting, I couldn't finish it because the author wrote on a 6th-grade level. I guess Tolkien spoiled me. It wouldn't surprise me if Elric were indeed the inspiration. Riot has a long record of making obscure referrences. E.g. Ekko was clearly inspired by _The Girl Who Leapt Through Time_.
