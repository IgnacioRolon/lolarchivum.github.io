It's elaborating on what comedy is. You can't walk into a night club, shout \"car\" and think you told a joke. That's not humor on any level. **There is no sense to it.** No punchline.\nSure, young children might get a giggle out of it because it's something wacky and spontaneous like what you'd see in a 2000's Nickelodeon cartoon, but it's not true comedy. Like penis jokes, it's lazy and a genuine insult to the craft.\nWhile many forms of comedy exist, of course everyone won't like them all. Liked or hated, they are still acknowledged as forms of comedy. However, if it's not comedy whatsoever, it can't be subjective.\n\nThat is what the newest generation doesn't understand.\n\nBlatant observations clue into what the next generation has become. It's really not a mystery. I wouldn't be surprised if Spongebob's laugh was echoing in your head as you typed your comment to me on your iPhone.\n\nAll that said, I'll certainly do my best to grow up with the mouth of a sailor and resorting to name-calling, just like you, ma'am.\n\nI like how you decided to stalk my comment history to find my post here with intent to personally harass me, though.

Like I get the joke, even if it did take me a moment to fully grasp what was being said but I don't find it funny, or amusing. It doesn't make me giggle, I don't know I just don't find it funny. \n\nAs for the second thread, it does make sense? Like I get what they are trying to say and I even find it kind of amusing. Mostly because I've been in the situation before. I mean it's not like heart stopping hilarious but it's cute, it's amusing. It's pokemon which is something I grew up with so it already warms me up to the thread. Even if it's Arceus which is a pokemon I'm not super familiar with. (Original 150 for the win.)\n\nThe third thread I didn't get at all until it was explained. Once I understood I found it kinda cute but not hilarious. It could honestly be because I play Diana and adore her as a character and her terrible jokes. So I just have a bit of an affinity for it in general. \n\nTo be clear I wouldn't downvote any of the threads but I'd likely only upvote the middle thread. Humor is subjective, and it really just depends on what sort of audience you are catering to. These are just my thoughts on the threads, there are hundreds of people in these boards so you can imagine that's hundreds of different opinions and thoughts. \n\nRegardless of how old you are or how young what you find funny is going to vary from person to person not necessarily age to age. There are a number of things my generation finds hilarious that I don't find all that funny. To be perfectly clear, what you find clever, or what makes sense to you, might not be clever or make sense to someone else. I've never watched Spongebob, I don't find it funny either. It's a little rude to condemn a whole generation because a group of people whom you don't know the age of didn't find your joke funny. Humor is relative, what's funny is relative, what's fun is relative, you can't force what you consider funny onto someone else. Sometimes you need to just let it go and try again. People didn't find that joke funny but it doesn't mean they won't find your next joke funny. Instead of getting upset about it you should just try again! Post something else, if at first you don't succeed try try again!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-07-19T11:51:18.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rivini,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=EPgu0Lz8,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-07-19T04:59:21.744+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s not even just M&amp;G.

I want to say this generation has rotted their brains out from Spongebob and staring at their phones all day, but that seems too extreme to be true.\n\nIn those 3 examples you listed, only the Arceus one was truly humorous.\n The first one, your post about Jhin, it wasn't readily apparent what exactly you were talking about, and you had to explain what the joke was. That's not humor, because most people playing Jhin have seen his rope sash belt and wouldn't have made the connection you were trying to make.\nThe second link was actually amusing, because ithe conveyed the disregard that the player has when someone is begging them to not kill an enemy they've clearly worked to near death.\nThe third one is equally as bad as the first because whoever posted it had to explain it. Mundo can be pronounced with slight nuances that most players wouldn't right off the bat get a moon reference, so again, it was a bad joke. \n\nIt's indicative of an inability to write witty jokes when the joke isn't outwardly apparent or at least apparent after a brief look. If it's still an unknown because of a very limited frame of reference, it's safe to say the joke fell flat.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"King Odin","date":"2016-07-19T05:43:52.434+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/676/217/412.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raj Te Lag Comp","date":"2016-07-19T01:42:56.204+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cuz people are #Triggered\n\n/s or is it not?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBot666","date":"2016-07-19T01:46:36.860+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NfhdQtmPx7s/UL6eqSLl8VI/AAAAAAAADQg/SlTeBSYuGyw/s1600/i-haz-a-sad-lolcat.jpg](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NfhdQtmPx7s/UL6eqSLl8VI/AAAAAAAADQg/SlTeBSYuGyw/s1600/i-haz-a-sad-lolcat.jpg)","replies":[{"poster":"Heretic Lunari","date":"2016-07-19T01:47:49.846+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Oh, why u has a sad :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2016-07-19T11:53:40.242+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because sometimes the pun is just THAT bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"morayshark","date":"2016-07-19T20:55:47.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.M914b4cf4fa25936aa0b408f4c54f02c5o0&pid=15.1","replies":[]},{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2016-07-19T13:45:53.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:26}} Some cats just want to watch the world bur-\n{{champion:107}} Shutup Alfred.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Carnage","date":"2016-07-19T06:48:22.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"VivaLaKitten","date":"2016-07-19T01:43:51.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"KITTY! sooooooo cute!!!!","replies":[]}]}
