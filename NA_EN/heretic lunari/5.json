His original ability is that he was able to understand how things work (which allowed him to be very good at his original job, repairing timepieces), coupled with a hunger to have more, specifically the abilities of others. He exposes the brain, finds a particular part of it, touches it, and... poof? In season 1 it's mentioned that repeated alterations to his DNA could be making him unstable, so somehow this touch causes a mutation in him. And it can't involve any sort of telekinetic manipulation of his own body to force the change, or he wouldn't have been able to acquire telekinesis in the first place.\nThere's also the case of Elle, where he gains her ability via proximity and empathy, almost exactly like Peter. He never does this again, though admittedly by the time he becomes more or less \"good\" he doesn't really need any more abilities. Perhaps he can still gain abilities that way, but simply doesn't have a reason to acquire more.\n\nTL;DR He cuts people's heads open and messes with their brains to steal their ability. No one knows exactly why/how this works.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1HvNiEO.png?noredirect","replies":[{"poster":"Thunderspam","date":"2016-07-30T01:28:32.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His power is that he UNDERSTANDS things by looking and feeling them, that was how he could fix watches, because he understood how and why they worked. Same with powers, he is able to look at the center of control for these powers (I.e. the brain) and understand and replicate them. Some powers are actually scientifically possible. Nikki's husband DL for example can walk through walls. This is actually a plausible thing, if the electrons of our bodies vibrate at exactly the same frequency as the wall or object then they pass through each other. Or Peter's power to copy and store powers via proximity can be explained using a microbiological phenomenon known as transformation, in which a living cell is able to extract the genetic code from a dead cell and add it to its own DNA. So Peter (and presumably his cells :p) are in the vicinity of another human with powers, and this person is constantly having dead cells rub\\blow off his body and Peters cells find the genetic code(after all the show directly says that the powers are genetic) and is able to replicate them among his other cells via conjugation.\n\nYEAH SCIENCE :)\n\n(By the way I have way too much free time on my hands.)\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \nMinds officially blown\n\nUpvote this for dah hard work :) :) :)","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-07-30T01:36:37.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's Sylar's replication of abilities that I've never quite nailed down. His ability to understand doesn't appear to explain how he actually manages to replicate/steal the abilities of others. If he's basically the same as Peter (close proximity/contact causes replication), then why is Elle the first time he was able to do that without all the mess of slicing off the top of her head? Is empathy and perhaps chemicals released in the brain by that type of emotion a requirement which Sylar was getting around by cutting straight to the \"source code\", so to speak?\n\nEdit: Off-topic, it seems I've made someone mad.
