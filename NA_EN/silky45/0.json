I just downloaded and installed the game. While I'm trying to play, it tells me to play the tutorial, but that I have to wait for the game to finish downloading. There's no percentage bar or anything. My download speed is well over 100 mbp/s. Is this working properly and it just takes a while? I've been waiting about 15 minutes. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-17T21:57:19.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, if this is still happening then there could be some network instability that's having problems grabbing files from the patching server.  Let League run its updates, and run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure any blocks or instability are cleared up.
