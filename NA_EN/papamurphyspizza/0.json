I don't believe that my account (DarcyTheFrog on OCE) is worthy of a permanent ban, esp after playing for 4 years, there's bound to be a couple of toxic games and I'm sorry for that, but I only ever received one warning and that was because I used the very bad (kys) word. I don't mind if you don't have the time, because I'm almost resigned to the fact that my ~$400 account is lost, I'd just like 1 manual look into it if that's ok. Anyway, thanks for your time. Have a good one, and happy Australia Day (if you wanted an excuse to have a better day) cheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-01-26T13:07:47.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, \"kys\" falls into their zero tolerance that usually escalates to an immediate 14 day ban.

If the system had some kind of \"hey, knock it off, here's a warning\" that was in fact _just_ a warning, it might be ok, but it doesn't. A chat restriction is very much a punishment, especially with the honor level system and even the first chat restriction knocking you to level 0.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poolparty Sauron","date":"2018-01-25T09:11:15.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Jesus Christ Tan calm down dont want you to get carried away and permaban everyone.

Mass reports do not mean anything.  They carry no more weight than a single report.  The system is designed such that every report is reviewed by the Instant Feedback System, so there is never a need to call for extra reports, and having more than one does not increase the value of the report.  \n\nFrom the [Instant Feedback System FAQs:](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286)\n> PUNISHMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW A BASIC ESCALATION PATH:\n> \n> * First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n> * Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n> \n> However, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.\n\nThis is how it generally works, which is why we ask if you've had prior punishments on the account.  Typically, these logs would not have bumped you up to the level of a permaban.  But, if you had already served a prior 14 day suspension, any further rule breaking would have caused a permaban.  \n\nTo submit a ticket to Player Support appealing your ban, you would need to go [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and select the request type for \"I have a question about a suspension or restriction on my account.\"  Fill in all the information that the ticket asks for, and try to be as polite as possible.  I know it's a very frustrating situation, and it's really tempting to want to snap at Riot and demand that they \"fix this now!\" but yelling at the Support Specialist is definitely not a way to encourage them to work with you.  Try to explain the situation as clearly as possible, and ask if there is anything that can be done to reduce the penalty on your account.  It may take them 24-48 hours to reply to your ticket, depending on how many tickets they have at the moment, but try to be patient.  Don't bump your ticket with additional information unless it's absolutely necessary, as that will drop it to the end of their queue.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Purejoyce","date":"2018-01-24T21:30:07.153+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's **not** spelled \"moran\". :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-01-24T21:21:30.969+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"although this is grounds for punishment, I disagree that this was banworthy. imo this dosent look like it should be more then a 10 game chat restriction. you should open a support ticket and plead your case with a rioter.\n\njust you better hope these logs aren't fake, because support has the real ones if it is, and a certain someone we know may come and {{summoner:11}}","replies":[{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2018-01-24T22:48:11.992+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that didn't take long....
