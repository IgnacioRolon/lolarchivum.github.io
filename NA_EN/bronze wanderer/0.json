Choose Ashe and select the Heartseeker Ashe skin.\r\n2. Reach level 6\r\n3. Fire Ultimate, observe that the arrow is not visible and only the particle effects of the ult are visible.\r\n\r\nThis makes the skin unbalanced from the normal default skin since it is hard to see and is unfair.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Issisoul","date":"2015-05-22T15:04:23.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Riot KateyKhaos  its kinda a disgrace that you posted that comment 4 months ago en that the bug is still there.
