When it finally loaded and I hit [PLAY], it took me to the log in animation, but instead of epic music playing and a cool animation, all I saw was a black screen with no sound, but everything else seemed fine. Weird, huh? It didn't stop there. As soon as I clicked to sign in my password, the whole launcher looks like it was highlighted, but instead of blue it was white. It also moved up and to the left a bit. I was very confused, and a second or two later, a window popped up saying that the lol client has stopped working, and it asked whether to wait for it or just close it completely. I tried, tried, and tried again to no avail. I resorted to re-installing it, and guess what? It didn't fix it :( I was just wondering if this is a known bug/error and if there is a fix. I never heard of this bug before, and even after googling for a while, nothing remotely similar was shown. It's very peculiar why this is happening when my whole computer is fine, and other big games/programs are running fine. Again, I would greatly appreciate any help. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and have a good day! \r\n\r\nP.S. I would like to point out one time during my \"quest\" in trying to fix this issue, I even tried to let it load up to the username/password screen, and waited 5-10 minutes, and then it let me put in my password, and very slowly let me log in. When I got logged in, it was just as bad. The whole launcher was laggy, and when I attempted to look at my profile, it crashed again. It immediately went back to what it has been doing after that.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-02-04T02:19:00.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Dom44519,\n\nHave you tried running the game in administrator mode? \n\nHow to: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#wq4","replies":[{"poster":"Dom44519","date":"2015-02-04T04:12:24.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello! \nYes, I tried that quite a lot, andstill, that didn't work.
