I've had a lot of people say they have improved greatly after I helped them and went over replays  and practiced 1v1 in customs with them. (One dude went from bronze to high gold in about three weeks, was decent player honestly just needed to learn to trade in lane.)\n\nSo I hop on the forums and make a post saying I'm a coach looking for a few interested players...\n\nPost gets deleted, saying that it is against the ToS.\n\nNow I get that you wouldn't want a bunch of spam threads... but why is the stance so anti coach... you can't even say you are a coaching looking for players but there is a low fee without drawing hate from mods.\n\nIdk what is your opinion.","replies":[]}
