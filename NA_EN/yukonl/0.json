Yes, that Malphite is an idiot and deserves a long ban, but wishing anyone death over a FUCKING VIDEO GAME is ban worthy. I always had a sour taste in my mouth when I saw dunkey flaming players in his videos, but let it slide because I'm not aware of the context. But if he seriously thinks telling a stranger (which he never met and probably will never meet again) that he hopes he will be gunned down then I don't know, it's just a toxic nature.\n\n_TL;DR_\nWhat I do agree on with dunkey:\n1. Riot is way too slow when it comes to dealing with toxic players (kind of ironic because he got banned)\n2. Riot doesn't provide enough support to the people who promoted their game for years (they actually did make the Content Lab but that's not enough).\n3. Riot is an incompetent company that many times takes the wrong approach when it comes to maintaining its only game.\n\nWhat I disagree on with dunkey:\n1.

Lyte said that the trigger game for his ban wasn't even the game with the malphite so that means there are other games. Plus people have said hes been chat restricted several times before and bragged about it in his videos.\n\nIts a pretty ridiculous summation of the situation to say that dunkeys comment was just \"pointing out the truth that he is a fuckhead\".

Someone posted that malphs profile yesterday and I went through his history and couldn't find anything so its not like hes doing it all the time. Everything everyone thinks about that malphite is based on like a 3 second clip where he dies and the statement of a historically known to be toxic person. Like I said, I think he probably should have been punished but that isn't based on much.\n\nDunkey wasn't punished for that one game. He has a history of punishments and lyte posted that the game with the malphite wasn't even the final game that triggered his ban.","replies":[{"poster":"LaceUp23","date":"2015-09-13T18:53:19.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not trying to say this dunkey dude isn't toxic or doesn't deserved to be punished.

It is certainly a factor, I don't see it as that large of a factor. \n\nPersonally Id say the biggest contribute is the snowball nature of the game. Its a doubled edged sword. Its what makes the game so frustrating at times, but its also what makes it so satisfying. This is also what causes many games to be one sided. Which most people blame matchmaking for.\n\nReducing toxicity also reduces trolling because trolls feed on the reactions. Reacting to trolls reinforces their behavior because it is giving them exactly what they want. If you give a dog a treat every time he shits on the carpet it's gonna keep doing it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jari","date":"2015-09-13T17:38:59.755+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Should Malphite be punished if he's intentionally feeding games? Yes.\n\nDoes that mean Dunkey had every right to say he wishes him dead, despite the ToS you agree to every time a patch happens stating you can't? No.\n\nDoes being a YouTuber give him the special treatment? No.\n\nWas he a good example of the game? Opinion's for this part, but for me no.\n\nI got nothing against a bit of trash talk. That was no trash talk. If you think what he said was justified, you basically say that it's okay to be as toxic as you want. Not to mention they don't just start off with bans. He has had many chat restrictions before this, and Riot decided he's not going to learn unless they completely lock him away for a while.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikmints","date":"2015-09-13T18:02:22.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Note: I'm not one of the people that downvoted you\n\nIf you look at the way that the game handles bans, things start to look a little funny. First, it's basically impossible for someone to get banned from a single game's reports so Dunkey probably had some other reports of toxicity before that game. If this were a first offense or his other reports weren't significant, he'd most likely have received just a chat ban instead of a game ban.\n\nSecondly, the way the game looks at bannable situations changes based on the offense. Chat bans have a lot of automation to them so it's possible that once he was reported the game went through his chat backlogs, looked for key words or scenarios and banned him quickly. Something like intentional feeding can't be scanned in quite the same way as intentional feeding can look a lot like someone having a bad game, so banning them through automation can result in banning people for doing poorly which adds a lot of insult to injury. So intentional feeding almost always needs a human to look at and evaluate the situation which takes more time and typically has more gray area to prevent banning people for trying but failing. \n\nBearing in mind that a single game's reports are rather difficult to get banned from, it's possible that if the Malphite in question had no/insignificant previous reports that he'd be able to avoid getting banned from the one game shown. Even if he did have previous reports, it would take more time for him to get banned than Dunkey.\n\nWhile most people agree that intentional feeding is worse than verbal abuse, both people performed reportable actions and were treated accordingly. Just because one player was banned doesn't mean that the other player automatically meets the criteria for also being banned in regards to their specific offense. Going afk because someone is being verbally abusive means both players should be reported, assisting the enemy team because someone is afk means that both people should be reported, and each case should be treated in isolation to see whether that case combined with their previous cases warrant action.\n\nI think it may be a bit much for him to say that he's not going to be making League videos any more, but I would understand if this left a sour taste in his mouth, causing him to take a League hiatus, upload League less frequently, or only be in League videos via being in other Youtuber's videos as he didn't say he would stop playing, just stop making videos himself.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BuzzinTate","date":"2015-09-14T12:14:05.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Youpoop comments","replies":[]},{"poster":"ihaveapotion","date":"2015-09-14T06:35:37.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idiocracy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zeurth","date":"2015-09-14T05:24:51.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice witch hunt.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SunriseSkaterKid","date":"2015-09-14T01:16:50.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find it funny how Riot implements a button to stop toxicity but no one uses it and toxic players are the most banned yet you can't block a troller and they barely get banned. The excuse of \"Well you can prove through chat logs that he was toxic but u cant prove a troller\" Uhh yes you can. In the video when he dies to Darius you can see the chat log and malphite basically says \"I called support bard is dyslexic gave my team ample time to dodge (He wanted someone else to lose LP instead of himself cause he was being a dickhead) they didnt dodge so im feeding, enjoy free win.\" The chat logs clearly show that this guy had trolling intentions. Also if a guy has 9 deaths pre 15 mins and isnt farming, getting assists, or kills im pretty sure its clear the guy is trolling. \n\nNow im not saying dunkey is right, he is very wrong and he was toxic but there are a few things we need to address.\n\n1) Riot needs to stop babying their customers, in the real world are you going to go to the police cause someone called you a fucktard? No. \nIm talking about minor toxicity, dunkeys level was beyond bad but if someone says \"You are retarded\" they shouldn't be banned, sorry but they just shouldn't. \n\n2) Riot needs to fix their report system drastically.
