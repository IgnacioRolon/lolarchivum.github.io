I just recently won my 999th normal game, and I could never be happier! As you all know, 1000 wins is a pretty big milestone (at least in my opinion anyways) and I know that Riot happens to like to play with people who are going to be hitting that big win. I currently have 2 friends that will be already joining me, so I got 2 slots open for any awesome Rioters that want to experience my 1000th win with me. Can't wait, however I can't play during the weekday afternoons due to school so if you guys want to join, I hate to say it but it would either have to be sometime soon or sometime after 3:30 CST.\r\n\r\nThanks Riot for possibly joining me on the experience, and if not, I totally get it. You guys have busy lives. :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-09T01:25:51.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya! \n\nWould you be free to play tomorrow at 4 PM PST, so 6 PM your time?","replies":[{"poster":"BlazingLegendEX","date":"2015-04-09T22:44:32.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=tyFE6sK6,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-04-09T01:25:51.280+0000)\n>\n> Heya! \n> \n> Would you be free to play tomorrow at 4 PM PST, so 6 PM your time?\n\nAble to play now seeing as it's about 4 PM PST.

Would you still be willing to play if it's not exactly my 1000th win?  I do apologize for the inconvenience, my friends really wanted to play with me.  Hope you are still willing to possibly play.  <3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BlazingLegendEX","date":"2015-04-09T01:51:18.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I think we lost this game lol.
