The Overwatch lets the CS:GO community regulate itself by allowing qualified and experienced members of the community (' investigators ') to review reports of disruptive behavior, determine whether those reports are valid, and apply temporary bans if appropriate. How does the Overwatch work?","url":"https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/overwatch/","image":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/csgo/images/footer_esrb_big.jpg"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":14,"body":"TLDR: League needs third-party players to judge the toxicity. This system is proven, simple and effective. It also does not cost a lot to develop.\n\n_**Introduction**_\n\nA lot of people claim that this game is filled with trolls, afks, toxic players, over-classed players who paid for smurfing and all different kinds of behaviours that tilt the casual player. On the other side, Riot claims that it's impossible to ban those players since it would cost too much to do so. I do have to agree with this mindset: watching every game where a report has been filled would cost millions(which they definitely have, but that's not the point). I do believe that most of their systems to detect afks and flamers are straight up shit and too easy to abuse. Instead of verifying that a player moves at least every minute, the system should verify that the players gets exp or active gold every 2 minute 40(aka the jungle spawns). However, a much simpler system, which has been proven effective in CSGO, its the overwatch system.\n\n_**The main point**_\n\nThis system consists of players judging other players for their actions. Of course it's not just a simple report page after the game. This CSGO tribunal is completely player driven. The way it works is that when a player gets reported during a game, or has at least a few reports, his game Replay video is sent to a player, who will analyze it and determine if he was cheating or not. Of course, secrecy is key and no real player name are revealed in the replay, only fake names such as \"Sheep\", \"Apple\" and \"Suspect\". In league, the entire voice logs could be sent to this third-party player, which could determine is the player was simply tricked into saying the n-word, while two other players are actually giving him death threats(I actually saw this in a game, I was quite uncomfortable). The judge could also easily see that the suspect is moving every now and then in his base. \n\n_**To make it viable**_\n\nI do not think this system requires a lot to be viable. Basically, the Replays would be sent to Gold ranked players and above, who can choose to watch them or not. The secrecy part is the tricky thing to not forget, as a player shouldn't get bullied by someone who watched him play. The judge would also get access to all chat logs, which he could filter to get only blue-side, red-side or all chat. Of course many players would want a reward for their time. Once the entire replay is seen, while he can speed up the game up to twice the regular speed, he would receive a potential reward. That reward does not have to be big. As a matter of fact, there doesn't event need to be a reward. I strongly believe that many players would willingly use a bit of their time, sometimes, to get justice against someone who wrongs others. Otherwise, if there would be a reward, it could be 2-3 prestige points or 10 RP(idk the currencies).\n\n_**Conclusion**_\n\nI really don't understand how such a system isn't already in the game. I really hope this will be in Riot's 10 year anniversary stream, instead or announcing the arrival of the new Mega Prestige skins. Feel free to tell me what you think about this system. If I forgot something to add, tell me.\n\nEdit:\nThe tribunal failed because the players judging others were only looking at stats and also had the ability to spam buttons. The system I had in mind wouldn’t allow them to do that, which is something that I mentioned in my post. **The judges would have to look at the replay and then say their verdict.** Therefore, random kids annoy spam bans to strangers without knowing anything.\n\nEdit 2: the current software used to determine if a player should get banned is not machine learning. It’s a simple word detection software that handpicks word here and there and decides that a player is flaming another. I agree that the Teibunal sucked and is basically no batter than the IFS, but the IFS sucks so much too. Riot pretends that they had this machine learning for years but, for such a straight forward task, it’s absolutely impossible it’s not already a perfectly functional system yet(machine learning doesn’t take years, only a few hours for something so simple). Basically, that was just a lie to make players feel safe while no initiative was being taken.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-09-21T22:13:16.420+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Many years ago, LoL's behavior system used something called the Tribunal, comprising player volunteers who logged into a system that showed them chat logs from reported players. Those volunteers would then vote on whether to punish or pardon the reported player's case. This system's main flaw was that it simply took far too long due to LoL's huge playerbase. Participants would often be reviewing chat logs that were several months old, with a growing backlog. In addition to that, not every participant took the task seriously: some would spam the same verdict for every case without even reading the chat log, or even invert their verdicts on purpose.\n\nThe current system, called the Instant Feedback System, or IFS, is automated software that uses machine learning to determine what behavior should be punishable and when a player's behavior should be punished. It started with data from the Tribunal, and has been learning and adapting for years. It operates on the same basic principles as a spam filter: get a corpus of data (emails/chat logs), have humans categorize each item as acceptable or unacceptable, find patterns within each category, and then finally look for those patterns to automatically categorize new items without direct human evaluation. Each report is like clicking the \"spam\" button. When a new pattern starts to get lots of reports, the IFS recognizes it as a new form of toxicity.\n\nThe IFS is efficient and unbiased. The Tribunal was not.\n\nTL;DR: Tried, didn't work.","replies":[{"poster":"LaceUpXX","date":"2019-09-21T23:58:35.141+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"I say we keep the IFS system and bring

That would at least double the time required to review a case, and that's just to watch zero seconds of the corresponding match. So we're starting with doubling the time investment, and possibly going up to tripling it, quadrupling it, or more, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nTribunal participation took too much effort and was too slow. Do you think that increasing the investment of effort and time would alleviate those problems or exacerbate them?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-09-22T00:19:12.177+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Midg3t","date":"2019-09-22T00:21:26.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GatekeeperTDS,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=F2x6hjUp,comment-id=00030000000000000000,timestamp=2019-09-22T00:19:12.177+0000)\n>\n> Lol...can't handle when people don't agree with you, so you result to middle-school insults?\n\nNo im just telling you to not be passive-agressive, thats all.\nI simply asked you a question and you replied like I pissed you off or something.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"IShowerWithUrDad","date":"2019-09-22T06:13:54.906+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GatekeeperTDS,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=F2x6hjUp,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2019-09-22T00:11:24.547+0000)\n>\n> Just because one thing works somewhere doesn't mean it works in other situations.

Griefing others can take many different forms, including some that are very difficult to pin down just looking at a single moment of the game. Sometimes somebody's intent is only really apparent when looking at the player's behaviour across multiple games.\n\nShooters are less nuanced in that aspect. If you want to grief you usually also want people to know that you are responsible for ruining their game (even if you might not want them to be able to prove your intention). There are only so many ways you can pull that off in a shooter… and they tend to be not exactly subtle.\n\nThe most subtle way of griefing in CS I can think of would be intentionally screwing up a flashbang throw so it bounces back (been super long since I played, though, to be fair). But even that is obvious in comparison to some of the things you can do in LoL.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-21T23:44:30.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Remember the tribunal?\n\nIt worked about as well as the system in CSGO, which is not at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Midg3t","date":"2019-09-22T00:11:41.530+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"I personally agree with this. \nI used OW myself and while it is sometimes clunky to use, it does its job.\nThe only issue is that idk how can riot ensure that players wont abuse it.

These are vastly different systems.\n\nThe Tribunal basically listed stats of the game, quoted the Comments from players who reported an individual, and you had to evaluate what happened.\n\nOverwatch uses AI to pick relevant clips from the match from the players perspective, you have to watch for several minutes (10?) before you're able to submit a recommendation.\n\nI think for those willing to put in the time, the Tribunal could be effectively resurrected by making someone watch 5-10 minutes worth of clips from the match from the accused players perspective.","replies":[]}]}]}
