Its really ackward to play against, because he always has an ideal target on the enemy team, while he can still get away with ulting most other champs. Btw QSS is just unfun to buy against him.\r\nSo, a few ideas could restrict his options and help his enemies play around his kit:\r\n1. He may only ult someone from his level and below. This, way, the 0/9 Morde won't ult your ADC and win even if he doesn't have either gold or exp.\r\n2. His ult goes on a CD for each champion he ulted, like Sylas. This way, he can't keep ulting the Taric support over and over in team fights.\r\n3. His ult acts as Kindred's passive. He must select a champion at least 3 seconds before ulting him.\r\n4. His ult acts as a Garen R passive. He can only ult the enemy who matches a certain criteria.\r\n\r\nDo you have other ideas? Which of these do you like the most?","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2019-06-15T19:25:29.789+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If anything they should remove the QSS interaction and call it a day.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-06-15T19:49:32.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Stars Shaper,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=N5HZkQL1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-06-15T19:25:29.789+0000)\n>\n> If anything they should remove the QSS interaction and call it a day.\n\nNah he needs that or proplay will cause him to be gutted, since he would just ult the enemy jg and his team take the objective. What they need to do is make his ult still go off still if enemy goes into stealth or becomes untargetable, or not make it go on CD when that happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2019-06-15T20:10:49.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to clarify:\n\nQSS should be able to cancel the cast and the cast should be more clearly visible. But once the Ult has been cast and you are in the Death Realm you should not be able to freely get out of it for 1300g.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2019-06-15T20:12:07.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the way, the Sylas-like CD doesn't seem so bad but it should trigger only if Morde fails to kill the enemy in the Death Realm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-06-15T19:45:22.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you added these you would have to remove the ability to QSS it or Morde would become absolute trash.

WHAT IS THAT HITBOX --> easier version of swain root that _grabs everything_ with 5 times the hitbox , and you can't even run from him cuz he'll just ult your for 6 seconds from a quite big range , I think they should shorten his ult and decrease it's range to melee so that he just doesn't delete your poor adc , tl;dr his kit has too much waveclear and his ult needs to get shorter with lower range","replies":[]}]}
