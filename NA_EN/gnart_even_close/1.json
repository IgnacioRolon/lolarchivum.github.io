This is really obvious and looks bad once you realize it&#039;s there.  The Mega Gnar Q also just pops into existence without any lead-in animation to the object&#039;s formation.  These two parts look pretty bad for Gnar&#039;s Q, and I hope they are fixed quickly.  I know that the lack of a proper Mega Gnar recall animation is because it&#039;s so early in the PBE cycle, so I&#039;m not gonna question that.  \r\n\r\nThe skin could also use some touchups to the coloring, and the tails aren&#039;t exactly amazing atm.  They bulge too much at the ends and don&#039;t look natural like a lion tail.  There should be more of a gradient tying the end of the tail to the rest of it, and it should be a smoother transition with less of a bulge.  The reds on Mini Gnar should also be closer to the oranges on Mega Gnar.\r\n\r\nThis is the third Gnar skin without changes to his base Hyper marks.  The only skin with changes is the legacy skin Snow Day Gnar.  Recently, an update was created for Draven&#039;s skins to give them all unique axe catching indicators, and I believe Gnar deserves a similar treatment.  The base marks do not fit in well with the skins besides the classic and maybe Dino Gnar.  \r\n\r\nLast point I want to make is that Gnar needs the new turn tech in all of his skins.  It was recently implemented in Shyvana and Ahri is getting it on the PBE.  I&#039;m assuming it all comes from Aurelion Sol, but Gnar is definitely one of the champions that needs it.  It would be great to hear if/when Gnar will be getting it, and a patch where he gets a new skin would certainly make sense.\r\n\r\nAs you can probably guess, I&#039;m a pretty big Gnar fan, and it would mean a lot to me to see that you guys at Rito are taking care to fix some of these issues.

He will be using the base recall. \n\n> The skin could also use some touchups to the coloring, and the tails aren't exactly amazing atm.

Mega Gnar, we did want to have a bit of color difference, so this is intended. \n\n> This is the third Gnar skin without changes to his base Hyper marks.

Since this is a 750 RP skin, it won't receive new particles, and we are comfortable with the base particles for this skin. \n\n> Last point I want to make is that Gnar needs the new turn tech in all of his skins.

Out of curiosity, has there been any talk at all of potentially planning to add turn tech and unique marks to Gnar at some point?  Or is that simply way too low priority to even be considered at the time?\n\nEdit:  Wouldn't it make more sense for Mega Gnar to be the redder, brighter one since he is so angry?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-23T17:10:37.736+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I don't have a PBE account unfortunately, so I could not post it there.
