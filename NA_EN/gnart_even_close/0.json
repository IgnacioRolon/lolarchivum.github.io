After the rework, he just became the Amumu of ADCs. His [skillfloor is extremely low ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/N2sOdRAh-make-kog-more-than-a-w-bot)compared to before since kiting is less of a factor and Runaan's also reduces the importance of target selection. Even bad positioning isn't THAT punishing because as long as he gets off his W, he'll still have contributed a lot to the fight and his passive packs a punch too. If he lives, it's nice but not a huge deal since by the time his W would be up again, the fight is already decided.\n\nI think the main reason behind his winrate (which is actually quite a bit lower in Korea) is poor comps not designed to deal with a Kog, his extremely low skillfloor post-rework and his low pick rate (Twitch actually has a higher winrate in KR but he isn't considered OP.). Every team in competitive has at one point or another run a Kog comp but he is almost never picked these days and that suggests that he isn't an objectively strong pick. He is just quite good if you are mindless vs him (not baiting W, not drafting much enage/displacement)/not flanking/split-pushing much... just running straight at him etc. So before you nerf a champion completely out of competitive (he's already a very low priority for an ADC compared to Sivir, Ezreal, Lucian, Ashe etc.), think about tweaking him instead. \n\nMake him less of a W bot and give him back the versatility he had pre-rework at the expense of some W damage. I'd love for the ult. to be useful as poke again or his Q to matter more. Right now, he feels like an ADC version of Cass. where his entire kit is basically one skill. In any case, balance decisions should be based on how champions perform when played optimally not based on DQ winrates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOMalphas","date":"2016-04-01T05:18:32.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is his AP play style going to be looked at?
