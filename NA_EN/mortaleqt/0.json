I was told by more than a few people it was to help newer people get into the game easier because they wouldn't have to buy runes, but that makes no sense because you can't unlock switching runes until I don't remember when, you can't slightly customize them until like a few levels higher and you can't customize them even more slightly until 15. On top of that, you are missing an entire page of runes, where is inspiration? How is this new player friendly? Wouldn't you want them to have the runes so you could spend their time getting to level 30, which I imagine is when they can start doing ranked, learning them? Or do you just want them to continue not understanding what to take and follow cookie cutter builds they find online. In short, what is the point of the new runes? Not looking for some idiot to flame me by the way, looking for an actual answer I can be satisfied with.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-19T01:19:34.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are a bit easier for everyone to use, if not just due to them all being free. Everyone should start with at least one or two editable rune pages, and while inspiration unlocks a little later (because those choices are a bit more complicated) everyone still has access to all the runes which wasn't the case with the old runes. Players had to spend currency just to be on the same level as others.","replies":[{"poster":"Mortaleqt","date":"2017-12-19T02:26:37.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I agree they are easier to use, getting enough LP to buy the old ones really wasn't that difficult, but you do make a good point, as good as one I am expecting to get at least.
