I can see the cursor moving on the screen and I can hover over things and see the descriptions but when I click nothing happens. My keyboard won't work either, and if I just keep pressing keys the game eventually just freezes and I have to force close it. After reconnecting this still persist. This is only in game and only in LoL. Already restarted the client and my computer several times and now I'm running the game repair tool to see if that helps. Any ideas on why this is happening or any help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-26T16:51:55.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on windows 10?  The freezing has been an issue for some players after an update auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) game bar.  That should help, but test it out in a custom game to be sure.
