It certainly does _not feel_ like a skin that was:\n\n1. Worth the four year wait (especially at 975 RP)\n2. Fitting with a \"time lord\" concept.  (\"Moon\" barely relates to time, and especially NOT in this instance)\n3. All that interesting compared to other ideas floating around (A Dr. Who)\n\nIt honestly feels like the skins team, supposedly some of the best artists and modelers in the video game industry, said \"let's make a Zilean skin,\" brainstormed for 10 short minutes, and just chose the best idea out of a pile of very half-assed ideas instead of taking the time to develop a truly awesome concept that would fit a broken rig.\n\nSeriously, that skin feels like a chroma / palette swap with some red effects and a recycled mask.","replies":[{"poster":"DynamiteGazelle","date":"2015-06-28T03:52:50.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Evelyn waited the same amount of time and got a 750rp black body suit and no particles.\n\nThere's worse things that can happen then Blood Moon Zilean..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-06-26T21:58:15.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sad face.
