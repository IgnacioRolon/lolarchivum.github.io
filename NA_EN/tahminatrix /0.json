Let me know.\n\nLeague is stored on my primary internal drive.\n\n\nThere is no apparent error notification.\n\n When I open the client to login screen I get a message saying that the client detected that my computer has low specs and I have been provided additional options along with some of my settings being changed automatically. \n\nAt least that is a general summary of the message, not leaving out any important details... I just dont know it exactly word for word.\n\nThe only settings that I have found to be changed is the \"close client during game\" and \"enable low specs mode\"\n\n\nNow...based on the option saying close client during game...well my in game client is closing everytime it starts up and I`m always looking at a reconnect button without even getting a glimpse of the loading screen, just the afterimage of something going into full screen and quickly being closed.\n\n\nThere may or may not be correlation between this option and the ingame client force closing, its turned off for me now but so far I have issues as long as its been enabled atleast once.\n\n\nThanks for the quick response.\n\n\nAlso last bit of info that you are gonna have to trust me on..... just to save you from having to ask due to the nature of your job.\n\nI have changed nothing with my network, I have changed nothing with my pc, I have not tampered with anything, my network is fine, Ping testing reveals no issues. I have followed through the riot trouble shoot guides for networking issues the first time I had this problem (hence the 4 hours spent trying to fix this)......and so far only deleting the game entirely and reinstalling has worked. I am now insisting that something within my client`s files are changing when I receive this pop-up that originated from my client.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-19T23:55:36.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your detailed info here.
