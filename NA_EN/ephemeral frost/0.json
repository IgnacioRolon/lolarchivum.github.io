I also feel like I should be banned from this game because I am the worst player alive and should have my computer brutally smashed against my face lol but that's not point. Maybe I take league too seriously idk but then again we all kinda do because every loss makes you feel like your soul is being ripped out or maybe that's just me. I also don't feel like I could physically make myself stop playing, I have no ability to restrain myself so I guess the question is why do I play? Idk maybe because I think hey maybe this game will be different or maybe i'll do better or maybe i'll enjoy this but then i miss one cs and I feel my life crumbling apart and then I lose. I am very bad at this game...no one likes me, no one wants to play with me because I suck. What do I do? Keep playing and hope I improve and try to get better? Or smash my computer and destroy it to stop myself from playing i have no idea. I just wanted some advice lol I have no idea when league became my life...I just wanna be better so my friends aren't always losing cause I make them lose cause I'm a loser.\r\n[Thank you to anyone who reads this] \r\n-Ephemeral Frost","replies":[{"poster":"luke bjelica","date":"2017-06-25T04:51:37.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try not to take League too seriously. At the end of the day, it's just a game. But don't quit because you're bad, try to improve. Consider picking up a coach. leaguecoaching.gg is a great site to find them on. A lot of them are free too, so that's a plus.","replies":[{"poster":"Ephemeral Frost","date":"2017-06-26T03:48:13.385+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, thanks for replying also! I have picked up a coach before and I usually get the same advice which I follow but I guess in game when its just me its different. I'll try not to take it too seriously though even though its difficult at times when everyone else is doing good but you arent, its this sense of worthlessness and trashiness I just feel like I'm a burden to my team.","replies":[{"poster":"luke bjelica","date":"2017-06-26T04:08:21.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to tilt pretty hard a while back as well, but I found that by switching games for a bit, for me it was Overwatch, I cared a lot less. When i switched back to league I was fine. Could also help if you got yourself a smurf, you might care a bit less on there.\n\nEDIT: I read through the comments and noticed the you feel bad that your friends are much better than you, but imo that should be even more reason for you to want to improve yourself. Strive to be greater than they are.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ranmaru","date":"2017-06-25T05:06:58.214+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do not beat ur self up over it im bad to","replies":[{"poster":"Ephemeral Frost","date":"2017-06-26T03:45:24.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi!

You will drop in MMR and Riot's matchmaker will eventually match people against you who are equally as bad, and then you'll be able to do well and feel good about it. League of Legends is meant to be enjoyed by people of all skill levels, even the worst of the worst (if you really are that bad, which I doubt). If you cannot deal with losses however, League of Legends might not be the right game for you, because _everyone_ has lost at some point in their lives, and everyone will lose eventually, even the best players alive. You could also play bots though. Unless you are worse than beginner bots, then you should be able to win consistently against them at least.\nMost players on League won't see the extraordinary, wonderful side of you that makes you _you_, but you can disregard those people. Make friendships with people who do in fact understand you and your gaming experience will be better.","replies":[{"poster":"Ephemeral Frost","date":"2017-06-25T04:45:42.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the advice and reply! It's not really the losses most of the time, I just feel bad cause my friends are so good and when they play with me I feel like I was the reason for defeat. I refuse to play alone either cause I wouldn't be able to handle the harassment I get from my team if I'm not doing that well.","replies":[{"poster":"Jorencice","date":"2017-06-25T04:54:32.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude I'm silver.
