I know there are issues with the skin however I just want know if this is a bug. I purchased the skin but when I see the skin during champion select (in ranked), it has a padlock in it. It is also the padlock to the thresh skins I do not have. I&#039;m just wondering if that only means Dark Star Thresh is unavailable or not?
