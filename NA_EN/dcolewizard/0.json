So I am looking for someone at Riot to help answer this question for me. I sent in a request to refund a champion skin but was unable to do so since I used the skin in a game and it was classified as \"Used Content\". This is extremely peculiar to me as I thought used content was things like IP and XP boosts. Can someone enlighten me as I have scoured the great big web of mystery and can not find the light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-11T16:30:38.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Each account is provided 3 refunds tokens to return unintended content within 90 days, per our [Refund Guidelines](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ).

If he would of told me upfront that I didn't have any refund tokens, which I still don't know where to access that information, it would of been a lot better, however the way the message was written, seemed that I still have a token or tokens but since I used the skin in a game, it is refundable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oh Look Kaede","date":"2016-10-11T16:29:28.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you still have a token?","replies":[]}]}
