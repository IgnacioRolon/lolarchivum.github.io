Soon as clans became a thing. I have to watch everything i say. # matters stfu and stop lying to ure players. Ffs you even state it in the fucking summary. Also. Just to vent at you weak pathetic kids, the fcking client is auto censored. If you dont like bad words. Dont turn it off. REALLLYYY high level IQ required there. \r\n\r\nThe biggest issues in the game are afk's feeders and inters but fuck it, punish people trying to win and typing stuff to help the team win the games. I actually laughed at a rioters explanation of \" you were negative toward a teammate who messed up\" Im like yea. No fucking shit. He fcked up, now lets rally, focus and not do it again.  If riots willing to pay me sure ill spend 5 minutes explaining to people but if not get over yourself and maybe make a meaninful fucking guide yourselves. \r\n\r\nLong story short. YES # of reports matters you lying fucks you literally say it yourselves.  Clans skew the fuck out of this because being held hostage in league is one of the main things killing the desire to play or people. You have the balls to ban players like your games fcking immortal. Stop lying blantly. It fucking pathetic. \r\n\r\nAlso. more lux skins. $$$$$$ p.s u are the worse players ive ever seen. Shield doesnt do damage. Stop throwing it at the enemy. \r\n\r\n( side note ive never used or  think racism hate speech or the such is ok under any circumstance )","replies":[{"poster":"LordRedStone Nr1","date":"2019-06-30T23:41:46.255+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really don't know why I was expecting a PSA instead of an (incorrect) rant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChaosLordMadis","date":"2019-07-01T00:05:37.121+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a difference between saying something  constructive and flaming.

Thats just a personal preference thing maybe for parents who lettheir kids play, or just people who dont like profanity. You will never get banned for a swear word alone. If you spam it, youll get punished for spam. If you call someone a fucking ass, you'll get punished for insulting people. Its not about the profanity. \n\nNow, the crucial thing you seem to have missed, is that its \"number of reports in a single game\" dont matter. So if 9 people report you in a game, it has the same effect as 1. Its about mass reporting or gang reporting. Hope that clears that up for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-01T00:11:38.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/rant","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Apathy","date":"2019-07-01T00:23:18.339+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Report numbers infact DO matter, I remember Riot Tantram and others specifically manually banning someone for heavy report numbers, so yeah contradicitng themselves and on the perm ban \"reform card\" it says you were in fact \"HEAVILY\" reported.
