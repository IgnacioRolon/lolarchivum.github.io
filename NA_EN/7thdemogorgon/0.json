I recently opened a box and got a legendary skin shard. It was my third legendary skin shard, so as I&#039;ve read multiple times, I combined the 3 legendary shards so I can unlock a permanent skin of the same type. Not only did I not receive a skin of the same type, but it was not even unlocked. It was a 520 RP skin for irelia, the skins I used to combine were project ashe, snowday corki and alien invader heimerdinger. So at this point, I combined the irelia skin with another two skins and it did unlock a dryed soraka skin in my inventory. \r\n\r\nMy concern is either the first case is not supposed to happen or the latter case is not supposed happen, so how can I bring this up to riot&#039;s attention and get the skins either back or get a new skin for the 3 skins I burnt?? I already filled a bug report but I didn&#039;t receive an answer. Please advise thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2017-01-11T01:38:38.698+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I combined the 3 legendary shards so I can unlock a permanent skin of the same type\n\nI don't know where you read this, but but I'm guessing wherever you did read it, you misunderstood the information. When you are re-rolling shards, you need 3 of the same type shard (champion, skin, ward) and then you are guaranteed to get a piece of content you do not own of the same type (champion, skin, ward). This does not mean that if you re-roll 3 legendary skin shards that you are guaranteed to get an unowned legendary skin. Doing so is only guaranteed to give you a skin of any value that you don't own.\n\nAs for the Irelia skin not unlocking, do you currently own Irelia? If not, that would be why. When re-rolling skin shards, you are also not guaranteed to get skin for a champion you own. You are only guaranteed a skin you do not own (non-limited skins only, though), and this can be a skin for a champion you do not own. If you get a skin for a champion you do not own, you will need to unlock the champion first before it is permanently added to your account.\n\nSince the Soraka skin was unlocked, I'm going to guess that you own Soraka.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-11T18:22:10.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for providing context here. :) \n\n*This does not mean that if you re-roll 3 legendary skin shards that you are guaranteed to get an unowned legendary skin.
