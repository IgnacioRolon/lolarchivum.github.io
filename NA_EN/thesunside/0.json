But you are not completely wrong. In order to pick testers, Riot will watch for someone or those which are experienced with champions they need to test if that's the case. Obviously, it's not the only criterion. In order to receive an invite you must be, like we said an experienced player with \"clear past\" (no bans or punishments for any reason), be an active player and a bunch of luck because we are few millions and the system is picking just some of us when they need to fill up. I'm sure there is even more, but Riot doesn't tell us that. I had applied for the PBE 2 years ago and I still don't have an invite. Recently a friend of my brother gives me access to his account in the PBE. I had created even a Google Alert for PBE singup, so I can follow any news about PBE open signups etc. Actually, that's how I get to know about this topic :) \n\nI don't know what to tell you. Just be patient, be a nice person, have a great attitude, don't flame but have a fun and good luck :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-19T22:19:29.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have any information on how to get accepted into the PBE, aside from having an account in good standing or beyond our [PBE FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ).
