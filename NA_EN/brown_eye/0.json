As somebody who has played and supported and loved this game for the last 3 years this is very off putting. I've also sunk around $300 dollars or so into this game over the years. I expect better than this. There was once a time when you received a near immediate response from Riot. This just feels cold and corporate and i am very disappointed and sad and frankly just let down by a company i once really looked up to and admired. How is that kind of response time justified or ok? Not to mention it is still increasing. Riot once felt like a family/community centric environment and company now....idk. If you forget about the long time players and supporters than we might just forget about you back. League is in a near unplayable state for me currently and i might just walk away for good now. What an absolute let down these last 3 days have been.","replies":[{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-07-26T19:05:40.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you continued to try and \"bump\" your ticket this would of continued to set you to the back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-26T20:47:44.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I promise we're not trying to be cold or dismiss your ticket, and our tech team will respond as soon as they can.

Regardless i gave it 24 hours before again requesting a response. Riot has always been quick and courteous in the past not sure what the deal is currently. At this point though it has been 72 hours which is an unacceptable amount of time to leave someone with pressing issues waiting without so much as a \"Hey sorry were busy and we will get to you as soon as possible\" 24 hours ok. 48 your bordering on indifference. 72 is just asinine. Oh well the damage has been done and my opinion of Riot is set at this point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brown Eye","date":"2016-07-26T17:37:37.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}
