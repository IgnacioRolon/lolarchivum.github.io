I've done a repair about 3 times now and I've even re-installed the game and still I've not found a fix. It's definitely not my internet as I can watch streams and Youtube videos without any issues. This seems to be just happening when I play league.\r\n\r\nIs there any possible fix? It's really hard to play like this and I haven't even bothered to play in the past 3 days because of how bad it's been.   {{item:3073}} {{item:3073}} {{item:3073}}","replies":[{"poster":"RaijinKami","date":"2017-07-15T12:19:53.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.\nSame thing here","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darthyra","date":"2017-07-09T13:02:52.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has anyone fixed this yet, somehow?
