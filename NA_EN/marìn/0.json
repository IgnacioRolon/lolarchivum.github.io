First, I thought it was the firewall that was blocking the connection to league so I tried to add league into allowed apps but I there weren't any apps that I was able to add. I thought my computer was broken since firewall wasn't working so I downloaded an app that scans your computer for problems. I got so many errors and corrupted files. There were about 1200 corrupted or missing registry files. After the scan, I pressed fix but it said to make an account and you needed to pay money so I could not finish it. I tried sfx/scannow on command prompt but it said the scan detected problems but wasn't able to recover all the files. Then I just decided to fully clean my drive and reinstall windows (I used the \"fully clean my drive\" on windows 8.1). I did all that but the problem still repeated. My firewall was broken, my wireless shut down every time I played league and I scanned my computer again and got the same result before formatting my computer. I only downloaded league after the format and how could the files be corrupted again? Help me please. (The first link is when my wireless gets disabled and the second one is showing how I can't add any app to the firewall. There is usually a list of apps but they are not and I can't type anything in the box also)\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/5ba1O\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/69U2s","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-22T23:26:20.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen this issue in the past when a router simply cannot keep up with the bandwidth League is requesting or using. As a first step, I recommend [forwarding your ports](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq8) to see if it resolves the issue. If it doesn't, I recommend bypassing the router entirely and trying a wired connection directly to your modem with an ethernet cable. This will let us know if the issue is local to the router itself.\n\nLet me know the results of those steps.","replies":[]}]}
