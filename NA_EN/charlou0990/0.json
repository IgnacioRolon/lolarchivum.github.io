We're looking into better ways to help newer players earn a special collection as well. Most recently, we rolled out First Strike for the PROJECT skins, where if you purchased a PROJECT skin during the first week, you unlocked a custom loading screen that players who later bought the skins wouldn't be able to unlock. \n\nThis is something we're absolutely open to exploring again in the future. \n\n> The victorious skins come to mind I find it weird that you don't offer them for a price to players who reach gold but i'm just saying that as someone who really has fallen for elise. Maybe in the future you guys should do more stuff like the first strike portraits to make something special for the time, rather than whole skins that you can just never get if you haven't been playing for 4 years...\n\nVictorious skins have been debated, both internally and on the boards, Reddit. I can see points on both sides. TL;DR, while it's really cool to be a new player and have an opportunity to have Victorious Janna (I'm sad I don't have that one, myself. :P), it's a less than great feeling for a player who grinded through the season to earn the skin. This is one is a bit harder to solve to make both parties happy, since players have already earned the skins, as opposed to everyone beginning from the same point as First Strike. These are also achievement skins, as opposed to content that could be purchased with RP.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2016-08-12T18:14:34.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm kind of surprised that getting gold in one season doesn't grant you the past victorious skins.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-15T18:27:41.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Each year's Victorious skin is sort of like a trophy - you earn it for being Gold or higher in a particular season, which is why we don't unlock previous year's Victorious skins.","replies":[{"poster":"TheHowNotTo","date":"2016-08-15T18:35:39.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you ever thought about making them available BUT give those who have them now special borders?
