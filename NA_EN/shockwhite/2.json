Upon arrival, he robs you of all your elo, ignores any counterplay whatsoever, and spawns an MMR generator that lasts until he oneshots your nexus at the cast location. Reactivating Death Mark will cause Zed to steal 20lp from everyone on the enemy team.\nAfter 3 seconds, Death Mark will trigger, dealing flat elo damage plus a percentage of all MMR and LP damage dealt to the marked champion while it was active.\n\nPHYSICAL DAMAGE: 100% MMR + 20 / 35 / 50% of elo stolen\n\n\n\nHopefully this will clear a few things up about Zed for newer players.","replies":[]}
