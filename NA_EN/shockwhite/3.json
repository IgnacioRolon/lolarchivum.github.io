Every one of his abilities either got a huge damage nerf or a massive cooldown increase, at that point he was barely a tier 2 ADC but alright, at least he was still fairly viable. But then, after thoroughly demolishing the rest of his kit to preserve his passive probably because muh identity, Riot then guts his passive and shoves him down to absolute trash tier.\n\nI don't get this logic.","replies":[]}
