I had garen because teemo was countered hard by the enemy champion going top. Well, I'm not too experienced with him and so I am not the best. I build my first item, and immediately the Zac starts to flame me for literally no reason. That continues for the entire game which is about 30 minutes. After the game, the jhin and zac flame me for building 1 item that didnt go with my build. A, they literally told me to go a different build. B, I wasn't familiar with Garen. Then, before they leave, the zac says I should kill myself. I said something like are you kidding me? He then goes on to say,\"yeah you really should,\" then leaves. Are people so angry at this game that they don't care if they actually caused suicide? Suggestion: Auto-Detect people who say that and suspend them for a day or two. If they are saying that, they shouldn't be permitted to play this game. Do you agree or disagree?","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2019-11-03T21:00:50.343+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot already does that\nAnd they get banned for 14 days instantly\nEspecially if they use that special 3 letter word\n{{sticker:sg-lulu}}","replies":[{"poster":"Summoner SpeII","date":"2019-11-03T22:39:24.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arcade Lulu,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=aIpnYilB,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-11-03T21:00:50.343+0000)\n>\n> Riot already does that\n> And they get banned for 14 days instantly\n> Especially if they use that special 3 letter word\n> {{sticker:sg-lulu}}\n\nit isn't a instant ban, but it is a heavy trigger word for chat restrictions, only the n er word is a instant ban","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2019-11-03T22:46:59.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Summoner SpeII,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=aIpnYilB,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-11-03T22:39:24.340+0000)\n>\n> it isn't a instant ban, but it is a heavy trigger word for chat restrictions, only the n er word is a instant ban\n\nOh i can guarantee you that n word isn't the only insta ban word\nThe f word (homophobic slur), the K word (which is the topic of this post) and the N word are all trigger words that give you an instant 14 day ban (My friends have experience about these things)","replies":[{"poster":"Summoner SpeII","date":"2019-11-03T22:49:36.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arcade Lulu,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=aIpnYilB,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-11-03T22:46:59.822+0000)\n>\n> Oh i can guarantee you that n word isn't the only insta ban word\n> The f word (homophobic slur), the K word (which is the topic of this post) and the N word are all trigger words that give you an instant 14 day ban (My friends have experience about these things)\n\nno, i reported someone who typed kys, and saw them still playing, only the n-er word will grant a instant 14 day ban","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2019-11-03T23:57:13.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Summoner SpeII,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=aIpnYilB,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2019-11-03T22:49:36.157+0000)\n>\n> no, i reported someone who typed kys, and saw them still playing, only the n-er word will grant a instant 14 day ban\n\nThen explain to me how multiple friends of mine have gotten insta banned for saying the K word?\nEven on the boards i see people complaining about getting 14 day banned for 1st offense, and you guessed it, they said the K word or the F word\n\nThey're all insta 14 day ban, understand it and accept it","replies":[{"poster":"Summoner SpeII","date":"2019-11-04T02:40:15.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arcade Lulu,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=aIpnYilB,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-11-03T23:57:13.599+0000)\n>\n> Then explain to me how multiple friends of mine have gotten insta banned for saying the K word?\n> Even on the boards i see people complaining about getting 14 day banned for 1st offense, and you guessed it, they said the K word or the F word\n> \n> They're all insta 14 day ban, understand it and accept it\n\nthey are instant 14 ban if u type anything else in combination with those words, like afk, report, and other racist terms, u can ask support about it\n\ni highly doubt ur friend typed only 1 word in his chat log","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2019-11-04T06:53:07.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Summoner SpeII,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=aIpnYilB,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-11-04T02:40:15.448+0000)\n>\n> they are instant 14 ban if u type anything else in combination with those words, like afk, report, and other racist terms, u can ask support about it\n> \n> i highly doubt ur friend typed only 1 word in his chat log\n\nThey only said the K word 2 times but ok ig\nAnd i have seen so many people on these boards getting banned for just saying the K word or the F word once","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jennifer17","date":"2019-11-04T01:26:04.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"technically if the person/q is quick enough they can get into several games. but again thats unlikely.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-03T21:37:22.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, they do suspend them immediately, so...?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-11-03T21:15:25.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do already though.
