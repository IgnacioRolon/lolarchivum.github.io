There seem to be problems with chat glitches, as well as consistently lower frame rates (I used to play at 150+ frames, now it never goes above 60, even with no cap on frames and all settings exactly the same). My laptop has Windows 10 and am pretty sure it automatically upgrades drivers. Anyone experiencing this as well or any ideas how to fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-01T23:32:07.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been seeing an influx of this type of issue popping up here on H&S.

I suggest [disabling the game bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) to see if anything changes with this.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"Pink Caboose","date":"2016-09-02T00:26:50.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I figured it was just a setting change somewhere, but that definitely helped.
