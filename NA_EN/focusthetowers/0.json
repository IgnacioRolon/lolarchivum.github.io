They openly state that they will try to match you will players of your same skill level. At lower tiers, where the mix is of old and new players, what proof are they providing us to ensure these matches are balanced? You can't see MMR nor past games in champ select. You can't see their preferred roles in champ select. You can't see their most played champion in champ select. You don't even have time to discuss comp or strategy with said comp before the game. It's a game of luck, which it shouldn't be.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YokoNomi","date":"2018-03-22T21:09:11.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Computers aren't miracle workers.","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-03-22T21:12:24.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You dont work with computers then.","replies":[{"poster":"YokoNomi","date":"2018-03-22T21:13:18.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XXXMurderPenguin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PkwElNFb,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2018-03-22T21:12:24.140+0000)\n>\n> You dont work with computers then.\n\nI don't, but I feel like this is common sense.","replies":[{"poster":"FocusTheTowers","date":"2018-03-22T21:16:26.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YokoNomi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PkwElNFb,comment-id=000600000000,timestamp=2018-03-22T21:13:18.940+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t, but I feel like this is common sense.\n\nCommon sense in a controlled and monitored environment?","replies":[{"poster":"YokoNomi","date":"2018-03-22T21:23:50.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FocusTheTowers,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PkwElNFb,comment-id=0006000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-22T21:16:26.684+0000)\n>\n> Common sense in a controlled and monitored environment?\n\nControlled in what sense?

However, the fact is the game is becoming more team reliable, which tends to make it harder for the \"higher skilled player\" on the team to feel oppressive. Not only are they expected to \"carry,\" but carrying is now harder.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"P4 Silent","date":"2018-03-23T11:27:06.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"FocusTheTowers","date":"2018-03-25T15:37:21.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=P4 Silent,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PkwElNFb,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2018-03-23T11:27:06.597+0000)\n>\n> Simple reason.\n> When you got this..\n> https://imgur.com/gLw1LuQ\n> \n> RIOT has no reason for any improvement.\n\nNot sure what this has to do with anything.

Since we can't have the scoop on how MMR and Matchmaking systems work, obviously we can't know what is actually wrong. Only theorize. Which is not our fault, and just because we can't prove something doesn't mean something is not wrong.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FocusTheTowers","date":"2018-03-22T21:05:55.976+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lakrosin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PkwElNFb,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-03-22T20:46:26.298+0000)\n>\n> They added autofill.\n> \n> They force trolls on your team if you win too much.\n> \n> They refuse to calculate CC into loses and how your team refuses to followup.\n> \n> They used to give you loses when it was 1 v 5 and remake wasn&#x27;t an option.\n> \n> They don&#x27;t wish to reveal their MMR system because they know they will get trashed on, maybe for lying.\n\nSay more!
