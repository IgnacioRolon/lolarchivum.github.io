Have good macro.\n\n2. Have good mechanics.\n\nYou can climb as high as Diamond 1 with great macro and bad mechanics and vice versa, maybe even further than that.\n\nSo usually your team will end up having either people with one of the two or a balanced mix of both. And when a mechanics player gets behind their impact on the overall game goes way down since they rely mostly on outplaying opponents mechanically as opposed to with macro. If their stats are just too low to accomplish mechanical outplays, their overall impact suffers tremendously.\n\nI personally view myself as having absolutely terrible mechanics but great macro (I couldn't play something like Riven to save my life).\n\nThat's why I pick champions that are relatively low on mechanical skill but are able to create map impact, and probably why the opposite players pick stuff like Kat or Zed and gun for kills.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Grunt666","date":"2018-03-23T12:08:36.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Z3Sleeper,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=x9ZgzUPp,comment-id=000700000001,timestamp=2018-03-22T23:44:04.564+0000)\n>\n> That&#x27;s the real hard part.

How do you find/gain leads while in this position?","replies":[{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2018-03-26T11:46:29.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally, I try to keep lanes pushed as Sivir, because it's easy and fast to do so. I only get shoved under tower when I can't clear waves fast enough (first levels) or when I'm so behind and the enemy can easily engage me.\n\nIf that's the case, then it's hard to come back from these games, honestly. It's not in your hands anymore, it's up to the enemy to make mistakes and capitalize on them, and this probably needs to happen a lot. What I do in these situations is try to waveclear and rotate around and map to keep towers safe and keep my CS up, pick up jungle camps when I can and try to keep vision on objectives, mostly Baron. As long as I can stall the game and keep csing, I have a chance. Sometimes, I even starve my team from csing themselves because I believe in myself to carry as Sivir late.\n\nSo yeah, when you are forced to stay under tower, try to stall. Just hard waveclear, even if it means you lose some cs. Big leads are obtained when a team can take towers, then rotate to take other towers, not by missing like 5-10 cs to protect a tower. It's all about momentum and how hard you can snowball. Denying snowball from the enemy is very important when playing from behind. \n\nSometimes, when they realize they can't really push against me, they leave lane and try to take another tower instead. For example, when they already take my first bot tower and realize it's risky to take my second one, they leave and rotate top to take that one. That's where I can farm up safely and because of my pushing power, I can fast push to the enemy tower. Eventually I either trade towers top for bot (trading  equally when behind is really good), or I force them to abandon their top siege and come bot to defend. It's even more evident when I have also taken the bot tower, then then there's a long lane to push, I fast push it to their second tower and chip it down for like 500HP then back off. I force the enemy to come and clear that wave, and push it all the way to my tower, during which time I rotate to some other lane to do the exact same thing, or pick up jungle camps. Since my push is faster than pretty much anyone, I can rotate, shove waves, then return to bot to do the exact same thing. As long as I know where my enemies are, I can do that indefinitely till I chip down enough towers and farm up and outpace the enemy team.\n\nIf anything, it all comes down to how experienced you are in the champion you play and what you are up against. If you go against Brand - Caitlyn, then that's a nightmare lane and you can't even cs under tower as easily. In such a situation, abandoning the tower and free farming under second tower and using the pushing technique I stated above is really good. Sure, you might lose pressure on the map, your mid laner is probably not gonna have a good time, but when you play against a strong early game team, losing the minimum is of unmatched importance.\n\nEDIT: Don't play Sivir in any elo below Diamond 3. It's really hard to win games with her because people don't understand how to work with Sivir. They try to force fights early when Sivir isn't as strong as other ADCs, lose them and fall behind and then act all surprised. Sivir is the champion that wants to wait 25 minutes and then do anything. She's all about game control, push waves, slowly chip down towers etc. Not the most fancy of gameplay, but damn effective if played correctly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2018-03-23T08:15:25.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You probably have an impact on 5-10% of your games.

They say they are, but check your MMR of your team and your opponent. After winning a game or two, the MMR of your opponents goes up. This makes sense, duh. But YOUR teams MMR goes down. It doesn't go up, it doesn't stay the same, it goes down by a large amount.

There are too many games where players are just fighting, praising their end of game damage, while ignoring they have the lowest damage to objectives.\n\nMy thing is, this is happening far to frequently if am being \"matched with players of similar skill.\" If I main low deaths, at the LEAST, I shouldn't be matched with feeders or players who don't secure objectives.
