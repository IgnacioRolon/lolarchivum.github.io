But from all the S ranks I have earn with Thresh while having him at level 5 mastery already. I have not once gotten a token for this achievement. I'm starting to feel all my efforts to continually earn consistent amount of S- or Higher rank is becoming useless. Anyway to resolve this issue cause I tried everything and it seems I has become impossible to earn the Mastery 6 Token. Any solution to provide? I have Thresh at Mastery Level 5: Guardian with 31307 Total Champion Points. I have at least earned a minimum of 11 rank of S- or higher. What can I do at this point?","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-07-12T04:24:21.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What game modes were you playing when you got these S ranks?

Though that a very good note. Should be included in the champion icon scripting \"Rank S- or higher to earn a Master 6 token. Combine 2 tokens to advance further\" they should note that it can only be earned normal or ranked SR matches. I know it's in the FAQ but it can clarify easier to new players or sole focus on getting the Master 6 or 7. Though its weird I know I have gotten at least 3 rank of S- or higher at a normal SR Matches.","replies":[]}]}
