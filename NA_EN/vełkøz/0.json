Under the locked camera, the champions tend to vibrate and have a delay in movement throughout a game on Summoner's Rift. Have never experienced this issue until this patch and the patch beforehand where the issue first sprung up. \n\nHopefully this issue can be resolved - I'm not able to get a recording myself; however, hopefully another can provide the evidence as it's extremely irritating. x.x","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-13T23:34:37.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooof, that sounds pretty weird!
