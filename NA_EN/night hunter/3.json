He is definitely not as bad as people think, but there is no way on earth that he counters Fiora.  I would go as far as to say that Fiora is one of the most annoying lanes for an Aatrox.  Fiora has sustain, which in his current state, Aatrox cannot fight against.  She can completely negate your only form of engage, ensuring that you cannot get out once you are in.  While it is true that her true damage is not as effective against him, did you know that her heal ult pops on his bloodwell?  She can ult him with bloodwell up, which means she kills him.  When the bloodwell is popped, then she heals all the damage Aatrox may have dealt and proceeds to kill him.\n\nThere are definitely champions that Aatrox can do well against, I would say his best matchups are Yorick and Maokai.  Yorick because Aatrox gets so many more W heals off on the ghouls, but oddly enough, his W works on Yoricks wall as well.  Maokai just because hes a tank with little early game damage, there are other champs I could have used instead.","replies":[{"poster":"blueberrypancake","date":"2017-03-03T17:05:04.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Although less common, he is probably a hard counter to kassadin, and easily beats shen\n\nWith the Fiora thing, i've read the stats wrong, it is a losing matchup lol.
