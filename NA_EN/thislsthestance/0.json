Nowadays I get 70ish ping, and it discouraging sometimes for when it gets any higher on occasion.  I remember someone mentioning that the server in chicago and a server in seattle would be joined as one in some form or another in future plans? So I was wondering what progress, if any, has there been in reducing the ping for the west coast? Any info or insight is appreciated.

This could be local problems or how your ISP is reaching riot direct.  Grab [WinMTR ](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/)and run a traceroute to the server:  104.160.131.1.  Run it for a few minutes and let me know what you find.  I have no say in where our servers go, but I'm happy to help troubleshoot with issues reaching our game server.","replies":[]}]}
