In this part of the process, your patcher is trying to scan game files to prepare an update.  OS Settings or even the speed of your hard drive could increase the duration.  As long as you don't get any errors, it's best to leave it alone!  Closing it out early could restart everything and make the patcher scan all of your game files for corruption.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[]}]}
