Is he fun to play? I like lots of mages but im not sure if i should reroll the skin or buy veigar, i hate facing him and he looks boring but i'm not sure, any pointers?","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-23T23:04:59.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a lot of fun playing him. Early game you are playing a bit from behind, having low to average base damages. Your goal is to gain power by last hitting minions with your Q and hitting enemy champions with skills, which permanently give him one ability points each. His scalings are very good though, so end game you end up being a raid boss that can nuke anyone that you can hit.\n\nSave your E for ganks or situations where you can play safely when it is on cd. Don't be afraid to delay your build with a couple of cheap defensive items like seeker's armguard or negatron cloak if you are starting to lose bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dolasaur","date":"2017-01-25T00:02:44.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's an interesting hybrid of a solo player and a team player. PQWR do absolutely nothing but damage, but his E has so much utility baked into it that Veigar has seen some periods of his life where he was played as Support.\n\nVeigar is also fairly cheap. You can get 1350 IP to buy him in one week just from First Win of the Day bonuses. Give him a try. See if you enjoy using your E to zone people, or how it feels when you stun 4-5 people with it after chaining with something like Malphite ult. See how amazingly rewarding it feels when your R kills someone and his /laugh automatically triggers (yes, that's a real part of his kit).  :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TequilaZombie","date":"2017-01-23T23:59:12.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you like one shotting people?\nDo you like AoE stuns?\nDo you like one shotting even more people?\nDo you like being evil?\n\nThen Veigar, the shorty evil overlord is for you!","replies":[]}]}
