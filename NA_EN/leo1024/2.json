Why is it that the easiest ults are point and click yet they do the most damage? I can dodge every {{champion:134}} ability in the book but her ult will still do massive damage. I can flash out of {{champion:45}} stun and dodge all of his abilities but the second he hits R he can ignite and i&#039;m dead. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m perfectly fine with escaping with 2 hp and seeing a {{champion:99}} later charging or even a {{champion:222}} rocket headed my way because if they kill me with it they earned it, but i don&#039;t see why a no counterplay ult is allowed, you can dodge the others but even if you use {{item:3157}} for {{champion:134}} and {{champion:45}} ult, odds are you were low and now you&#039;re in a bad spot\r\n\r\nI find ults annoying like when i&#039;m in a 1 v 1 and {{champion:10}} or {{champion:23}} ults, but at least it has counterplay, i can flash away or not fight them for 2 seconds but point and click ults doing the most damage out of any ultimate in the game is super frustrating and needs to be balanced in some way","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-19T15:37:07.574+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The counterplay is no moping around them with low health when their ult is up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2016-11-19T15:26:44.169+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Who needs to bother with ultimates when some marksmen can hit for 1500 damage every second with a single right click?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2016-11-19T15:22:30.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well at least {{champion:134}}  has to set up her balls first\na  6 orb ulti is going to do twice as much as a 3 orb ulti... and it take a while to set up a 7 orb ulti (7 orb is the max).\n\n{{champion:45}} .. just presses R","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-11-19T15:29:19.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His Final Boss skin encapsulates the feeling nicely.\n\nDELETE!!!","replies":[]}]}]}
