That's what I am saying. Each ability are just one simple function.  I'ld like to note that they serve specific functions in allowing fiddlestick's odd kit and method of doing damage to function.\n\nAn \"overloaded\" champion is a champion with multiple functions stacked onto their abilities, and have things 3+ passives.  Champions where they have a wide array of strengths and abilities jammed onto them for little good reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2016-11-01T00:28:23.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That isn't overloaded. Overloaded means the champion has a bunch of random crap in their kit, to the point the champion is able to fulfill multiple roles and sometimes even better than champions that designed for that specific role.
