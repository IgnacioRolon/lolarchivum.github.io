No! It fits nicely in his kit but I do think it needs changes, maybe only allowing it to block a certain number of abilities instead of running on time, and though it may be a stretch anything over a certain amount of damage should be able to pass like an ult because blocking an ult with a W? Cmon now, the only other champion that can do that is Sivir but she can only block one spell as opposed to Yasuo windwall blocking EVERYTHING that touches it. Just my thoughts on the Yasuo wind wall situation, let me know what you guys think!","replies":[{"poster":"Deflum","date":"2016-09-22T04:43:42.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think your suggestion will not work on one condition, An ADC would blow through it in seconds. Imagine a Jinx just mowing down WW in seconds and killing yas after for no cost to her. But the ultimate thing is pretty op and it breaks the game for some ults. Like Braum's _**Fissure**_ (a giant crack in the ground) is stopped by Yasuo's Windwall ability. Maybe basing it on damage would help fix it. but i'd need really high scaling for it to be useable. like 800 at rank 1 or so. Yas is only good in low elo mainly, get out of bronze/low silver, you'll start seeing worse comps and less op individual champs. Like an amazing Karma/Sivir botlane with an olaf jg. but less Yasuo in general.\n\nDisclamer: i could be wrong, but for me, (A Karma main) Karma can counter Yas in lane pretty hard. having the RQ combo level 1 stops his dashes so he cant poke you if you kill minions. and if he goes all in, RW before he gets his knockup and all the damage is magically gone!","replies":[{"poster":"Leo1024","date":"2016-09-22T11:22:55.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah idk if I said it in the post but I was thinking ranks 1-2 the wall blocks one projectile, 3 it blocks 2, at rank 4 it blocks 3 and at max rank 4 projectiles may be blocked, and yeah jinx might mow through him but everyone has that one counter they don't stand a chance again, kinda like any mage against {{champion:136}} mid, it's SO hard to do anything against him if you're a ranger mage like {{champion:127}} or {{champion:117}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TyroneWatermelon","date":"2016-09-22T04:45:19.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\" damaging abilities\" like he needs any more with doubled crit chance,sheen and 50% bonus armor pen.\nUtility or not,he still spam his E as much as Riven mashed keyboard,it does damage,by no elo in late game.","replies":[{"poster":"Leo1024","date":"2016-09-22T11:25:26.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.
