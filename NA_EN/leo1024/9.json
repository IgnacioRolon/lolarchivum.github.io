The ability to deal damage to the whole team that can only be mitigated with a shield or ability that renders one untargetable makes things decidedly un-fun for the enemy team, in particular for those playing champs for whom this damage is ultimately unavoidable, regardless of what champion it is affixed to. Adding an item that grants a spell shield for protection against such abilities makes said ability less of a middle finger to players, but in turn adds a bit more depth to strategy when using both karthus' ult and the shield in turn. Now Karthus players can choose whether to use their ult to force the enemy to blow their defenses specifically to avoid damage from that ability in particular, or perhaps to wait and watch  for when these defenses are used up and nothing then remains between them and unavoidable damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Leo1024","date":"2016-10-31T22:17:38.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you don't know yet though, velkoz is super easy, i own him and dislike his easiness as a champion, it got boring for me, karthus has little to no cc like traditional mages, lux has a root and slow, lissandra has her E to get away and he W roots, but karthus has a slowing wall which means little to nothing since you'll either get hit by cc turning to cast it, or get dashed at by ad mid laners","replies":[{"poster":"CobaltTheMadMage","date":"2016-10-31T22:23:20.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Leo1024,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=Ow1aq9X0,comment-id=0003000000000002,timestamp=2016-10-31T22:17:38.474+0000)\n>\n> you don&#x27;t know yet though, velkoz is super easy, i own him and dislike his easiness as a champion, it got boring for me, karthus has little to no cc like traditional mages, lux has a root and slow, lissandra has her E to get away and he W roots, but karthus has a slowing wall which means little to nothing since you&#x27;ll either get hit by cc turning to cast it, or get dashed at by ad mid laners\n\nThat's how it's worked for champs that already have their own shields, and most of them have shorter cooldowns than this item is going to have. And I'm pretty sure that Karthus has enough AOE that he could just use Rylai's Crystal Scepter if his lack of innate AOE proves sufficiently troublesome.\n\nCan't guarantee if it'll solve your Yasuo problem though. Yasuo just makes it a pain for everyone he faces in laning phase, especially in mid-lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fugertech","date":"2016-10-31T21:58:50.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://giphy.com/gifs/upvote-PtbzIkZcxjmCY","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-10-31T05:21:20.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a mid mage main, I generally just hate the new item.\n\nI don't really feel like the item you're suggesting would be a good fix though.
