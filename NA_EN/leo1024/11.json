If played in the right hands, he can dominate the enemy team and make them feel like they can't do anything. Otherwise, you get people ulting the first thing they see and getting themselves killed. \n\nMechanically, his skills are easy with 2 point and clicks, one weird skillshot, and voidlings. And he doesn't really need to be fed, he just needs items.\n\nRiven on the other hand is known to be a difficult champion who can carry a team if she gets fed and has a high skill ceiling although a lot of people who play her can be toxic since they feel they **need** to carry every game.","replies":[{"poster":"Leo1024","date":"2016-09-10T03:11:56.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Riven is basically a less popular yasuo?
