In exchange? She is arguably the least forgiving support. Sona has just about nothing to get caught out of a bad situation between little mobility, no hard CC til 6, and being the squishiest support. If she gets caught in a gank, she is dead if she doesn't have flash unless you misplay hard. Other supports like Thresh, Janna, and Nami have a lot more options if they get caught on the wrong foot. Additionally, Sona is one of the harder supports to position with. To be a threat, you need to be inside that Q range constantly and you need to go up front if you want to land a good crescendo without flash. Plus, she benefits her teammates (even the front line) by standing near them... moreso than most other supports. She can't stand 20 ft away from the fight like Janna, Soraka or Nami ot be effective. Yet she doesn't have the CC or resilience to front line like Alistar or Leona.","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2016-12-07T05:36:06.585+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"And it seems to me that it is very difficult to manage her mana.

Unlike champions like Nami who need their full kit to function, Sona only needs her Q and W in lane. Hence why you'll often see her OOM early game : she can afford to. Keeping enough mana for a clutch W is all she really cares about. And unlike Lulu, who can potentially use all 3 of her spells only to poke, Sona really only has Q to cast.\n\nLate-game she starts using her whole kit and then you really feel that mana problem, but at that point you have the option to itemize for it, so it's less of a Sona issue and more of a player one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-12-07T05:50:42.882+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I read Taric main.
