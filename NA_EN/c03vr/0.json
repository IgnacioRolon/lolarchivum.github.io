After about a week of playing, I opened up my client a got a message saying I got banned see game 1. I click on the link and it showed a game as jax, I dont even play him. I am almost 100% sure that my account got hacked, even thought I have never told anyone my password, I don't even play jax. Can someone please tell me how I can contact riot games and get my account fixed before the end of the summer when I cannot play anymore?
