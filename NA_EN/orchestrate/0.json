My wifi is fine, twitch streams are buffering, videos are loading, sites are connecting, but as soon as I get into a game, my ping spikes up to (around) 200. A couple of the people I was playing with had this issue as well, and especially during preseason, it might just be high traffic on the servers, but it is seriously affecting my enjoyment of the game. Just hoping for some insight onto why this is happening.\r\n\r\n~King","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-15T03:18:45.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It may very well be due to high traffic in your area, but it's also likely like your connection is being routed in a really difficult way to our servers specifically. If you could try running a quick traceroute to our NA servers at 104.160.131.1, using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/), so I can get a better idea of how your connection looks when it leaves your network?","replies":[{"poster":"BigDaddySpain","date":"2017-11-15T03:26:50.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From the looks of it, it also affects overwatch players too.

A VPN tells your connection to take a specific route rather than the one your ISP chooses. \n\nI just finished talking with some of my techs, and they're under the impression that Roger's ISP could, in fact, be having some minor issues possibly. Go ahead and shoot our techs a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with this data so they can gather some data and see what needs to be done on whose end of things!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bo0","date":"2017-11-15T03:26:07.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also having this issue and I'm not sure if I did this right but I am getting this from WinMTR:\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n\n|                          hitronhub.home -   84 |    6 |    1 |   11 |   11 |   11 |   11 |\n\n|                          INTEL_CE_LINUX -    0 |   30 |   30 |   13 |   19 |   58 |   17 |\n\n|                          INTEL_CE_LINUX -    0 |   30 |   30 |   11 |   15 |   28 |   12 |\n\n|                          INTEL_CE_LINUX -    0 |   30 |   30 |   15 |   21 |   33 |   20 |\n\n|                          INTEL_CE_LINUX -    0 |   30 |   30 |   17 |   21 |   30 |   24 |\n\n|                          INTEL_CE_LINUX -    0 |   30 |   30 |   26 |   33 |   46 |   32 |\n\n|                          INTEL_CE_LINUX -    0 |   30 |   30 |  133 |  156 |  181 |  154 |\n\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BigDaddySpain","date":"2017-11-15T03:32:43.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems to work now.
