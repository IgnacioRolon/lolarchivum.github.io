When I checked my op.gg account, it showed that I had played several matches, when in fact I had not played a game all day (my brother was hogging the computer). The two games that were played today were both on Summoners Rift, and I almost never play on that map. Additionally, the order of the two summoner spells was changed; I always keep my flash in the first slot.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-28T22:24:58.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First let me mention that account sharing of any kind is against of the [Terms of Use](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse), and is not a good idea for account security.
