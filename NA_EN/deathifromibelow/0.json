Kalista had Braum soulbound (I think that&#039;s what it&#039;s called, right?), everything was fine. Then for some reason Braum disconnected, never to be seen again. At this point Kalista tried to soulbind me (Volibear). There was the typical soundeffect, yet nothing else happened. Both of us didn&#039;t know what to do. Then she tried the same with Irelia, same results.\r\n\r\nLink leads to my matchhistory version of the game, IDK if that helps.\r\nOthers than that, have a nice one. \r\nPeace.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2016-09-07T00:10:51.001+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to do the rebind within the first 3 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-09-07T17:27:42.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheLastShadow45,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=nbbpQEUN,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-09-07T00:10:51.001+0000)\n>\n> You have to do the rebind within the first 3 minutes.\n\nCorrect - there's a limited about of time before you can no longer rebind to another champion.","replies":[{"poster":"MrFluffyPuffy","date":"2016-09-07T17:35:10.254+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are the one who get binded, are you able to remove it too?
