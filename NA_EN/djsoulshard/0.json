It gets worst when I am in a discord call, specifically discord. Any advice is appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-28T22:17:54.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you mentioned the lag getting worse when you're on a discord call, there's a pretty good chance that other programs are eating up your pc's memory so League isn't able to run very smoothly. I'd suggest closing out of discord to make sure your connection to our servers isn't getting interrupted. If that doesn't help at all, check out the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to see if there's any network settings you could update.","replies":[]}]}
