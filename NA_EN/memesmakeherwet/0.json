Delete the champ or stop creating the game riot cause u don&amp;#039;t know what u doing.\n\nI was the warwick in this game and I dominated the game, shutdown a yi and set him so far behind. After all of this though I mean had to be a 3-4k gold lead at 15 if not more but our gp fed him 3 kills and he dived us under tier 3 and through our whole base. It was not even close to being balanced even with executioners calling I couldn't stop him. It feels so bad playing against this after I worked for our lead and setting up our team just blown away by this champ. Why even play the game if I am playing it and getting a lead and it doesn't matter because one top laner gives him 3 kills and now their mundo is unkillable.
