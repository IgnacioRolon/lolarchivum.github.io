Then again that's all assassins.   They are currently useless in team fights because of Exhaust/support items.  The only way Zed is getting the upper hand on you in a team fight is if your team just isn't paying attention.  Other than that there are the normal tips like building steraks/GA, just getting better at dodging in general, and positioning.  Even building an armor item wouldn't hurt, you need to understand if Zed fails his assassination he is useless for the rest of the team fight most of the time.  Surviving is your priority.  But if you are doing all of those things and Zed is somehow still killing you in a 5v5 you need to tell your team to keep their eyes on him. \n\nRemember Zed needs to be in melee range to get a kill with death mark, he cant simply swap to his shadow and maximize his damage.  Also Zed isn't strong, he is one of the weaker mid laners currently and he has been since he got the nerfs, he didn't even receive buffs in the update, it was just a pointless change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2016-12-04T22:16:47.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aiming CC for where he lands after ult (directly behind you) and avoiding shurikens as  best you can manage\n\nhaving an attentive support for shields and heals, or having exhaust up (you can take it yourself if you can convince them to take heal in your stead)","replies":[{"poster":"Bishasaurus Flex","date":"2016-12-05T06:46:21.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Big Lincoln,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BNU44YAE,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-12-04T22:16:47.765+0000)\n>\n> aiming CC for where he lands after ult (directly behind you) and avoiding shurikens as  best you can manage\n> \n> having an attentive support for shields and heals, or having exhaust up (you can take it yourself if you can convince them to take heal in your stead)\nDirectly behind?  Either im dumb and can't see, or it's not behind his target.  Ive seen multiple videos where he lands in front, to the side OR behind.  Ive even taken a friend into a custom to see exactly his landing location and it was always different.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2016-12-05T01:18:11.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Counterplay to zed?
