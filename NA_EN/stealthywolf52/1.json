I drafted knowing how unlikely it was I'd get any right.  ... then I got SSG right and almost Misfits.  XD  If you take it too seriously, all the fun of watching worlds is just lost.  I'll cheer on C9 and Fnatic, even if I don't actually think they'll make it all the way.  I'd love it if C9 did though.  It would be awesome.\nBesides, who really cares.  At this point, everyone is complaining that they have no chance at a perfect draft anyways.  So at that point it really doesn't matter what they picked.  That chance is lost : P","replies":[{"poster":"StealthyWolf52","date":"2017-10-21T02:12:28.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True. I completely agree, though I would like to get baron nashor, I want to do it with a win on the team I'm rooting for, which has been and always will be c9, but no matter, I watch worlds still.","replies":[]}]}]}
