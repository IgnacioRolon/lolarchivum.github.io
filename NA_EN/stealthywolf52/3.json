All the XP you miss and all the XP they got from the kill. I've seen games where someone died pre 6, walks back to lane, the enemy hits 6 first and kills them again.

Unlike gold, experience gains aren't really that immediately visible unless you level up, and as you mentioned the XP lead gained by farming is already more than enough to grant a level advantage in lane. If kills end up not making enough of a difference; it would always be possible to just ramp up the gold bounty (which would be much easier to appreciate) until they do.\n\nA current problem with XP leads in lane is that they just encourage the winner to sit in lane and amass even more of a lead while giving the loser increasingly few options. Gold leads, on the other hand, can only be turned into actual power by going back to base and purchasing items, so without XP bounties from kills, players could still accrue a level lead by staying around and farming, but would also be pushed much more towards going back for items, thereby giving their opponent an opportunity to catch up or otherwise exploit their absence. In the interest of keeping relatively shorter games, it would also work out, since kill-heavy lanes could get more of an advantage from items and would be more able to make crucial swings either way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WarlockLaw","date":"2016-02-01T19:14:51.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This entirely, it's made worse if your opponent is running tp and you aren't.

Picking and choosing which CS to vie over is an essential laning mechanic.\n\n>Even then, sometimes that number you can safely get is 1 or 2, which means you'll be an item behind anyways.\n\nIf you can only safely get 1 or 2 CS, then you're fucking up somewhere in laning. \n\n>Which means you're screwed because they can push you to your turret and stick you there and unless you've a waveclear champ, you're missing cs.\n\nIt's not hard to CS under tower. If you see that the wave is inevitably going to push you to your tower, prime the minion HP so that you can actually secure it. Just because you're under tower doesn't mean you can't CS or that you'll be \"screwed\". In many matchups, it's often advantageous to let your enemy push you under tower and farm there in safety, also allowing your jungler to have room to gank the enemy laner.\n\n>Getting defensive items in lane makes it nearly impossible to catch up. It's usually not enough to offset your disadvantage as well.\n\nYou also don't have to die in order to realize you may need defensive items. Playing any bruiser against a Vlad in the top lane almost always merits buying a Spectre's Cowl, even if you plan to buy damage. Again, you don't have to die in order to start buying defensive items, so there is no \"nearly impossible to catch up\" unless you are just making extremely terrible mistakes in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Ratbert","date":"2016-02-02T00:44:59.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"So he can't use a general statement to give advice for a specific situation?\n\nIt's called being zoned and/or melee.

Being the first death in a lane does not guarantee a lost tower, so when he says \"pick and choose what minions you want to farm and leech exp\", you extrapolated to say \"leech exp from your 2nd tower?\", which wasn't what he was saying at all. Pick and choose minions to farm and leech exp, so that you don't endanger yourself to die or lose HP on your tower.\n\n>It's called being zoned and/or melee. If you're a death behind, going for cs can be suicidal or very hard without losing lots of resources. Sorry for not being able to get the perfect 6 when behind.\n\nRanged top laners aren't all too common, and even when they are played, melee champs have more move speed and general tankiness. Sure, you may have to invest into sustain, but it doesn't mean you HAVE to let yourself die in lane when you're at a disadvantage. Being at a disadvantage does not mean you have lost the lane, and it doesn't necessarily mean that you were put at a disadvantage because of dying either. You can be put at a disadvantage without dying, in which case, playing safer is the right choice anyway.\n\n>How can you prime the minion hp without using mana or being in a dangerous range?\n\nWhat are auto attacks? If you see melee minions at 3/4 HP (so after a tower shot, 1 auto attack won't kill them), just auto attack them once to prime them. \n\nIf it is dangerous for you to prime minions when the enemy is pushing your lane hard and spending their auto attacks/spells to push the lane, then you're fucking up somewhere in your lane mechanics. \n\n>If you let them push long enough, they'll get your turret.\n\nBut they also won't have a huge lead over you. If they aren't killing you, they aren't getting extra kill gold. If you are safe and farming effectively under tower, your enemy isn't getting a CS lead over you. And they are at greater risk to be ganked by pushing so hard. You also have FREE pressure on them to damage them and force them off tower, since they aren't likely to tower dive without a lead unless you've managed to let yourself get to 1/4 HP while they are still over 1/2 HP. \n\n>I'm talking about after your first death, given the nature of this thread and what the guy before was talking about.\n\nAnd the very nature of the topic of \"dying in League of Legends\" has to do with the quality of decision making by players, which is what I'm talking about: decision-making that either leads to dying in-game or preventing deaths.\n\n>Getting defensive early when behind means you've spent whatever gold you've got on defense, while your opponent is free to get offence. I exaggerated, but it'll be harder to farm and be useful in fights later on.\n\nOffense isn't everything. You don't see tanks building offense and being useful that way. Tanks are useful with defensive stats. Bruisers/fighters are useful with a mix of offense/defense. \n\nIf your final build has something along the likes of a Sterak's Gage or a Banshee's Veil, then getting Spectre's Cowl or Jaurim's Fist (defensive items) are not going to put you behind. And if you have to decide between Sterak's Gage or a Hydra item, and you've died at least once, buying that early defensive item component does not put you behind, because you're going to be getting it anyway and it helps you to stay alive longer in lane to get even more gold and exp.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jonxx","date":"2016-02-02T08:02:38.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, if you build a bit defensively they won't be able to kill you easily...

Say if you both have 30 cs, he kills you and gets 15 cs, he effectively has 60 cs and you have 30 cs. Just because you didn't get that 15 cs doesn't mean you LOSE 15 cs, it's just 15 cs you didn't get. The net difference is 30 cs not 45.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YossarianSensei","date":"2016-02-02T02:10:55.302+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really dislike how 'team oriented' Riot is pushing this Season, purely for the sake of e-sports.\n\nIt's made the game a lot less enjoyable and the e-sports games are still boring AF","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auroramancer","date":"2016-02-01T23:07:12.550+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So here's my quip on the issue. \n\nYeah, deaths feel more punishing now and games are decided much earlier. It feels bad to be on the receiving end of this.\n\nHOWEVER...\n\nBefore the recent changes of preseason, good decision making in the early game felt moot. You weren't rewarded enough for good decisions, and the enemy team had too much of a grace period with their bad decisions. It felt fucking terrible to play flawlessly in the early game, but then have the grace period of the early game nullify or diminish your good decision making. Then late-game comes around and your team makes ONE bad decision (after consistently making good ones) and the other team just wins the game.\n\nThese changes are better than what was previous. Good decisions are rewarded, bad decisions are punished. That's the way it should be. If you play a shitty early game, the late game should not be as available to you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2016-02-01T14:56:07.378+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game has kind of always been like that though- my worst experience as a Support was when my ADC got caught in the jungle level 1 and died- by the time he respawned and came back to lane the enemy was level 3 and immediately killed his ass again the moment he went anywhere near the creepwave.","replies":[]},{"poster":"La Barbotte","date":"2016-02-01T03:58:40.679+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"at least we dont lose money when we die, since rito is recently ''inspired'' by HOTS and smite alot im wouldnt be surprised if this dota feature came to life on the rift -.-","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2016-02-02T10:45:32.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Abatrox,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Q1P904cA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-02-01T03:58:40.679+0000)\n>\n> at least we dont lose money when we die, since rito is recently ''inspired'' by HOTS and smite alot im wouldnt be surprised if this dota feature came to life on the rift -.-\n\nI got so much cancer even thinking that this could ever happen in LoL. {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"StickyDice","date":"2016-02-02T10:03:22.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:112}} : *Adapt or be Removed*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Carpe Victoria","date":"2016-02-01T21:09:07.990+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish all those games the rest of my team collectively died 100 times they had your concerns.","replies":[]}]}
