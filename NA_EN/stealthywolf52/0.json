I think we can agree on this. But if we aren&#039;t getting nerfs for the entirety of league anytime soon we should at least make turrets half decent again. So here are some ideas. (Only some, not really all at once could be good)\r\n\r\n- After taking no damage for 45-60 seconds turrets begin to heal. \r\n       -Outer Turrets (5 hp/5 sec)\r\n       -Inner Turrets (10 hp/5 seconds)\r\n       -Inhibitor turrets (30 hp/5 seconds)\r\n       -Nexus Turrets (50 hp/5 seconds)\r\n\r\n-Increase AD/ AD gain/minute on ALL turrets\r\n       - Outer Turret from 152 +4 AD per min/max 180 -&gt; 155 AD +5 per min/max 190\r\n       - Inner Turret from 170 +4 AD at 8:00 and every minute after that, until 250 AD -&gt; 180 +6 AD at 8:00 and every minute after that, until 270 AD\r\n       - Inhibitor turret from 170 AD +4 AD at 8:00 and every minute after that, until 290 AD -&gt; 180 AD +6 at 8:00 and every minute after that, until 330 AD.\r\n       - Nexus turret from 170 AD +4 AD at 8:00 and every minute after that, until 270 AD -&gt; 180 AD +6 at 8:00 and every minute after that, until 300 AD.\r\n\r\n-Increase armour/magic resist per min on all turrets\r\n       - an increase from 1 armour/magic rest per min per turret (in their respective time frames) -&gt; 1.25 per min\r\n\r\n-Increase attack speed of inhibitor/nexus turret\r\n        - Attack speed on nexus turret/inhibitor turret increase from .83 -&gt; 1.00\r\n\r\nThoughts? opinions?
