I dug into this and it looks like there are login issues impacting players in the Southwest (USA).   You may experience issues logging in or getting stuck at the authentication server.

Hang tight!","replies":[{"poster":"NorthAfricanMan","date":"2017-12-09T22:35:47.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you","replies":[]}]}]}
