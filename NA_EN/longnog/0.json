Skills you'll need are fundamental illustration, anatomy, composition, perspective, colour and light theory, material rendering and visual storytelling. Our splash artists focus completely on creating a compelling image that conveys all the emotion and story behind a design - so ultimately we look for artists that can deliver striking work that really elicits a feeling.\n\nI think studying with that in mind will ensure that your work is effective and help your art stand out. I hope that's useful >:D","replies":[{"poster":"what you deserve","date":"2016-01-26T05:03:15.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That said, it's not necessarily a requirement- Riot's been known to commission non-Riot artists for splashes in the past (Deadeye teaser and Sona's splashes come to mind)\n\nJust felt like that was worth pointing out","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-01-26T18:07:41.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same applies for anyone looking to make a living from illustration, including anyone we would look to outsource to. To work at/with Riot there's a lot more required than just craft expertise; we look for people who are passionate LoL players with a deep understanding of our characters and community as well as being people with excellent communication, work ethic and attitude.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
