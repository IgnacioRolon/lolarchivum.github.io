I mean, I agree this is annoying and I was put in elo hell for a couple weeks because I lost LP for the same reason, but in the meantime this is something you can do to get around it and keep climbing.","replies":[{"poster":"CynicalChild","date":"2019-08-13T15:32:07.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i did that, but when i re-open the client there is no Reconnect button lol. just like in the attached pictures.

Are you absolutely certain you're ending the task in the task manager? Because if you just reopen the client then it's going to think you're still in the game unless that task has been manually terminated.","replies":[{"poster":"CynicalChild","date":"2019-08-13T18:01:59.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"buddy i wouldn't come here if i haven't tried everything. When i come back after ending the task it just opens the client and gets stuck at ''game in progress'' crap, hopefully they fix it by the next update...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-13T17:06:17.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There shouldn't be. It should just take you straight to the loading screen the minute you log back in if you do this. I'd look at the pictures, but the image hosting site is really weird and won't load for me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
