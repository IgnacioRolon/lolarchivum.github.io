In the process of downloading the game I got the error in the title. I've gone through past threads and looked at what people had to say, and most of them say you should download it separate from the client. I tried that, downloaded the 64 bit version and attempted to launch again. Thing is, it's requiring me to have (x86) for some reason and refuses to recognize the downloaded version. \r\n\r\nSo, what next?","replies":[{"poster":"LiL Batman","date":"2016-06-03T18:30:39.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@CRRAN8ERRY\n\nI'm sorry to hear you're having issues installing LoL on your new PC. I work on the team that builds the installers and am currently trying to get a repro so we can figure out what's wrong. A couple of questions:\n\n1. What installer are you using? (NA, EUW, BR) I know your account says you're located in NA but its not uncommon for people to bounce around between servers :)\n2. Did you do any Windows updates before attempting to install LoL?\n3. Did your laptop come pre-installed with anything worth mentioning like an antivirus and if so what is the name of it? \n4. What kind of CPU (intel, AMD) do you have? If you could give me spec info that could be helpful too.\n5. What Windows 10 version do you have and is it 64 or 32 bit? (Home, Pro) I know you mentioned you downloaded the 64 bit version so you most likely have 64 bit Windows 10 but just double checking ^^~\n6. Is Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 already installed on your PC and if so could you give me the exact name? You can check by going into your control panel and looking at a list of installed programs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-26T20:20:58.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm...if you downloaded it separately and are still experiencing the same issue, I want to make sure that your OS Permissions are properly set-up and aren't somehow the root cause as to why it won't launch correctly.  To that end, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Permissions Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104).  Some of the steps there may seem fairly basic, but they are crucial in hopefully resolving this issue!\n\nGive me a heads up if you are still experiencing this error!","replies":[{"poster":"jeanne mulaney","date":"2016-05-26T21:27:14.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked the updates and everything is up to date.

I'd also like to ask if you could run through the following steps for me; this process will generate a log file for us to better understand what's happening with the installer when the failure occurs:\n\n1. Open the Run window; this can be done by opening up the start menu and typing in **Run** and pressing Enter. Alternatively, you can open this by pressing the Windows Key + R.\n\n2. In the Run window, type in **regedit** and press Enter. This should open up the Registry Editor window.\n\n3. In the drop down tree on the left-side of the Registry Editor window, expand HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, followed by SOFTWARE -> Policies -> Microsoft -> Windows. When you're done, your Editor window should look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/lHZTtT9.jpg?1).\n\n4. Right-Click on the \"Windows\" Folder, and select \"New\" -> \"Key\", which will create a new folder within the \"Windows\" dropdown. Right-click this new folder and rename it to **Installer**. Once that's complete, your Editor should look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/gUTkeWf.jpg?1).\n\n5. Click on the new \"Installer\" folder that you just created, and in the right-side of the Editor window, right-click and select New -> String Value, which will create an entry on the right-side of the window named \"New Value #1.\" Right-click and select \"Rename,\" and change the entry's name to **Logging.** Similarly, right-click on the now-named \"Logging\" entry and select Modify. In the \"Edit String\" window that appears, enter **voicewarmupx**. When you're done, your window should look like [this](http://imgur.com/3Ar3ndw).\n\n6. Close the Registry Editor window. Open up a command line prompt as an Administrator by pressing the Windows Key + X, and selecting \"Command Prompt (Admin)\". If for some reason this doesn't work, you can also do this by opening the start menu, typing in **cmd**, and right-clicking the cmd.exe application and selecting \"Run as Administrator\".\n\n7. In the new Command Prompt window, type in **Net stop msiserver** and press Enter. This should cause the message \"The Windows Installer service is not started.\" to appear within the command prompt window. Next, type in **Net start msiserver** and press Enter, which should cause the messages \"The Windows Installer service is starting.\" and then \"The Windows Installer service was started successfully.\" to appear in the Command Prompt window. \n\n8. Close the Command Prompt window, and attempt to install League of Legends again. The failure should continue to occur, which will generate the logfile we're after. Open the Run window again (Step 1), type in **%temp%**, and press Enter.\n\n9. This temp folder contains the log file we're looking for. The log will be a text file, with a name that starts with MSI and should look something like \"MSIbf2a1\" (though the exact name of your logfile should be different.) It should have a \"Date Modified\" that matches the date and time when you attempted to install LoL in the above step. \n\nI hope those instructions are clear/make sense, if you have any trouble I'd be more than happy to try and help out. Sorry that you're having trouble getting the game installed!","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-27T21:14:05.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given that these steps haven't helped so far, I recommend [submitting a ticket ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)over to us so we can help out in investigating further.
