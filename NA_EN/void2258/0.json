In an effort to determine the root cause, can you please navigate to the following location of your LoL installation?\n\nLocal Disk --> Riot Games  --> League of Legends\n\nOnce here, please list (since attachments are currently not possible) any Folder found here (only folders, not files).  This should help narrow down the root cause.\n\nLooking forward to your response!","replies":[{"poster":"Void2258","date":"2013-09-18T22:46:25.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have a subfolder like that (installed with pandoless due to earlier issues).

They take a *significant* amount of time to make, so just writing everything down and redoing it all one at a time is a very large hassle (took me about 1.5 hours to get mine set up the first time, not looking forward to redoing that). It doesn't need a fancy GUI, just a quick script file that dumps to-from a text file on the desktop would be more than enough.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rammi","date":"2013-09-18T17:19:10.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this happen with every champ you try this with?","replies":[{"poster":"Void2258","date":"2013-09-18T22:00:01.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.
