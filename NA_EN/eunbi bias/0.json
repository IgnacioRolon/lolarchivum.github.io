I know for a fact that i use ip for all my champion purchases (with an exception for fizz last year i believe), and i had around 1650 rp with around 13000 ip. I purchased Viktor, and as I said, with ip, and my rp did not change at all. I remember looking at it to make sure I had enough for he upcoming Blood Moon Diana, and then I come back after a week to find my rp was subtracted by 880. I'm completely sure I made the purchase with ip, and now it has been depleted from my rp. I would rather have the Diana skin i've asked for for two years then a mage i just bought for test reasons. I would like to If im wrong but i hope i dont have to buy more rp. Trying to ween off :3","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-11T22:30:14.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds strange that it may have taken RP instead of IP so I took a look to see what happened.  I was able to confirm that the purchase was made for RP in this case.
