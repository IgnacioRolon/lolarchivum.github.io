This is what I've been playing like the last few days, since he's now viable again:\n\n**Runes:**\n\n*  **Dark Harvest**\n*  **Taste of Blood**\n*  **Eyeball Collector**\n*  **Ultimate Hunter**\n\n\n* **Manaflow Band**\n* **Transcendence**\n\n\n* **Offense:** +10 adaptive Force\n* **Flex:** +10 adaptive Force\n* **Defense:** +15-90 Health\n\n*Runes Explanation:*\n\n* **DH** is the best damage Keystone out of the 4 imo, since it can proc reliably on ult snipes and the resets are good for kite scenarios. Comet can miss and Aery has too low dmg.\n* **Taste of Blood** gives some nice lane sustain. Cheap Shot would rely on ally spells, and Sudden impact would only trigger on half your kit if you intend to activate it with E.\n* **Eyeball Collector** is the best option in that row imo, due to its reliable stats. Take the other two if you really make use of the vision utility.\n* **Ultimate Hunter** for more ults. I guess if you roam a lot you can take Relentless Hunter too\n\n\n* **Manaflow Band** is a must have. You won't really buy a mana fixer, so this is neccesary for your mana sustain.\n* **Transcendence** for the CDR. CDR is a good stat on Ezreal. Celerity adds a total of 2 MS to your build, and at least I am not a fan of Absolute Focus disappearing in a clutch situation where you need it the most.\n\n\n* **Stats:** Grab the early free Ap, and Health is better than those joke resistance values.\n\n**Skill Order:**\n\n* **QEWWW R WQWQ R QQEE R EE**\n\n*Skill Explanation:*\n\n* First point in Q for farming and first poke\n* Second point in E for eventual escape\n\n\n* Now start maxing W to build up Ap scalings, which is important to offmeta picks like Ez\n* Q max after, due to Q being your main poke out of lane\n* R whenever available, obviously\n\n**Items:**\n\n* **Core**\n * {{item:1056}} {{item:2003}}  {{item:2003}}  Typical Mage start \n * {{item:3100}} Lichbane rush for the Ap ratio on Q. Prioritize the Ap items!\n * {{item:3020}} Your boots, obviously\n * {{item:3089}} Get a ton of Ap fast, because the damage is what gives your pick worth\n\n* **Situational**\n * {{item:3135}} If enemies have Magic Resist, get this item. You should get it no matter what the enemy builds, but you don't need it quickly if noone buys mr.\n * {{item:3285}} Good item for burst and to get that tasty cdr, if you don't need to itemize against anyone.\n * {{item:3165}} If you don't know what to get and just want damage. Luden's is the superior option, but if you already have it you can buy this. Or if you need the Grievous Wounds.\n * {{item:3907}} or {{item:3905}} if an enemy is running you down and you need more Movement Speed.\n * {{item:3116}} If you need to kite a tank for your team. If the enemy only has squishies, it's not really worth since just killing them is the better cc.\n * {{item:3102}} {{item:3157}} The typical choices for dealing with fed enemies you need to survive.\n\n**Playstyle:**\nIn lane, poke with the occasional Q to get your Manaflow Band stacked. Or just sit back and farm. Once you get W, try fishing for a W hit and E in unpredictable directions for the seeking hit + mana refund. That's your main poke in lane, since enemies will hide behind minions to avoid Q hits. Don't use E in lane if you didn't hit W, because that's a huge hit to your mana reserve.\n\nEverything else you do with this champ is just common sense. Keep an eye on the map for R snipes. Kite with WQ combos and keep E until you decide to finish someone or you need to gtfo. That's all. Glhf!","replies":[]}]}
