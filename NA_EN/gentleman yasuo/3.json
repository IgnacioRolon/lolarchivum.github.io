It's a situational snowballing item. Just remember how difficult it is to escape someone with tier2 boots when you have none. You'll have more opportunities to apply DMG to your opponent at the cost of having less DMG, thus you shouldn't trade evenly if you buy these boots. You'd need to be taking one sided trades.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cõmega","date":"2019-12-06T01:13:37.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you need movement speed &amp; Damage","replies":[]},{"poster":"2Charmnot2Charm","date":"2019-12-06T01:25:25.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is the team expecting you to roam? If yes then get sorcs, no then go ahead with the blasting wand.\n\nDoes your champion have high base damage? If yes get the sorc boots and oblivion orb. \n\nFor example {{champion:134}} has high base damage compared to other mids and would be more effective with just nuking players early since she is basically dealing true damage.\n\nThe sorc boots are typically brought after getting {{item:3802}} for the mana sustain.\n\n\nEdit: Also sorcs don’t increase damage to minions, so getting the boots over wand Will mess with wave clear break points.","replies":[]}]}
