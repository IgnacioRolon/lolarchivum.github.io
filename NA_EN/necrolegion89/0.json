You could rerelease him or make some kind of event similar to the Project event where if you buy him during the event you get the free loading frame.\r\n\r\nAlso is there any kind of special animation for the release of Mecha Zero Sion?

I think it's a cool, if a bit unintentional flip on the standard mecha skin line, instead of having A transformation he is THE transformer, into anything you could need in a specific situation.\n\nThis \"adaptive combat chassis\" is probably one of the \"bells and whistles\" Sion insults the later mechas for.","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-03-25T10:55:42.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dis guy gets me\n{{summoner:31}}","replies":[]}]}]}
