Lets talk about Aurelion Sol","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":6,"down_votes":8,"body":"I cannot claim to be an expert in astronomy or physics, although my major is related to physics.\r\n\r\nSo I&#039;ve got some gripes about the new champion, Aurelion Sol.\r\n\r\nAurelion Sol claims to have created the stars, all of the stars in Runeterra&#039;s universe and therefore all galaxies and life! This seems incredibly unbelievable. On top of that he has the most asshole VO of any champion I can think of! Then there is the fact that he can visit Runeterra and be enslaved by simple magic.\r\n\r\n**His Powers:**\r\nIf he truly created the stars and galaxies, then this means that there was never a force of gravity or electromagnetism needed to make these processes happen. Therefore, life and planets like Runeterra should be impossible to form or come into existence. You see, stars do not need another force, outside of the 4 fundamental forces, to be created. They do not need Aurelion Sol to make them as they would just have naturally formed over time. This makes me question Aurelion Sol&#039;s claims to being a &quot;star forger&quot;.\r\n\r\nIf he really was a star forger, then he should have incredible amounts of energy stored within him to bring together all of the hydrogen or whatever fuel stars in League&#039;s universe need to start fusion, and ignite! Someone with that amount of power should be as big as the observable universe and not be able to visit a planet like Runeterra without somehow compressing all his energy and size down to that of a school bus. If he did, then he must be emitting tremendous amounts of radiation (assuming he doesn&#039;t turn into a singularity from this) and his visit to Targon should have been the end of Targon as the mountain should have melted, literally melted or evaporated away, from his mere presence yet it didn&#039;t. \r\n\r\nI know black holes have not been confirmed in League&#039;s universe, but if they were then they should be Aurelion Sol&#039;s mistake. Based on how he talks about stars and his fascination from making them, black holes should terrify him. He is a cosmic entity who can create stars, has probably eternal life, and is perhaps wise enough to know not to make such mistakes, but naturally these things should occur due to the irregularity of hydrogen distribution throughout the universe, unless League&#039;s universe has symmetrical distributions of hydrogen gas and be symmetrically distributed to prevent black holes from forming. \r\n\r\n**Weakness to Runeterra Magic:**\r\nA cosmic entity like Aurelion Sol who &quot;forged&quot; the stars should have nearly unlimited reserves of magic, enough to overcome any silly limited magic that would enslave him. Despite this he was easily enslaved by Targon&#039;s primitive magic. This is just laughable, he should be able to completely destroy the crown given to him and destroy those who tried to imprison him yet he doesn&#039;t/cannot.\r\n\r\n**Arrogant Voice and Attitude:**\r\nThis is pretty hard to argue against, but someone who has lived for billions of years should surely have moved past this amount of arrogance, past any Runeterran intellect and wisdom, and not act so childish or like a douchebag. His language or way of thinking should surpass anyone&#039;s and therefore might not be needed to express trivial things like taunts or opinions to such primitive creatures as the ones in Runeterra. YET HE DOES!!!!!! He pokes fun at lots of champions and creatures despite being billions of years older and wiser than they are. Its like you name calling an infant or an insect when you are grown up hoping for them to understand your words and meanings and feel bad about themselves.  This seems childish in my opinion and unworthy of someone who created the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy feedback:\r\nHire some science fiction writers, look at Bioware, I hear they keep losing members, so hire one of them to write your champion lores and backgrounds as well as ideas of how science fiction champions should work. Aurelion Sol should have been made into a cosmic voyager who orbits around the Sun and intersects Runeterra&#039;s orbit every once in a while each time stopping by to observe the creatures and their advancements. Someone who was placed/tasked to defend Runeterra&#039;s solar system from intergalactic forces such as the void, someone who draws his power from stars and not the other way around. I mean just look at our sun, it pumps out so much energy every second, enough to destroy our planet several times over without hesitation.  At least then Aurelion Sol would seem believable and not as a joke. Or is his lore an April Fool&#039;s joke?","replies":[{"poster":"333lom","date":"2016-03-19T13:25:10.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings! I felt summoned, as a student of physics!

I agree when science is thrown out the window it can be fantasy breaking. In terms of magical cosmic entities, though, I give lots of wiggle room for defiance of physical and theoretical laws. I think there are times to play with believable elements -- for me this is at the higher out there realms of understanding, where what's observable can be twisted by imagination. \n\nFor instance, I don't mind that the island in LOST is a gateway to magic moral energies that somehow manipulate electromagnetism, but I DO have an issue with Charlie's drowning because of the basic fundamental physics of how water would flow into the hole in the side of that undersea base. He should have survived. \n\nI can also assure you, I was not a philosophy major. \n\nThank you for the thoughtful criticism and feedback. It's much appreciated. :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2016-03-21T18:45:20.446+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=333lom,realm=EUNE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=JPc1qxs7,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2016-03-19T13:25:10.210+0000)\n>\n> Greetings!

He seems to possess magical powers capable of manipulating creating matter in space, which very well may circumvent needing the fundamental forces. It does not necessarily dictate his size within a physical plane. It also does not necessarily make him immune to other forms of magic. Maybe he would be resistant to someone like Veigar, but other matter that was not created by him (such as gems) may possess some sort of power over him. The example that comes to mind is Superman's weakness to kryptonite. That might not be a cut-and-dry comparison, but hopefully you get the idea. \n\nAs for the question of is he the only star-forging dragon, FauxSchizzle basically said he is most likely the only one. However, I took the comment to mean there may be other entities that are not dragons that are capable of creating stars. There are also other celestial beings. Maybe some create gravity. Maybe some create planets. Maybe some destroy these things. Who knows? \n\nI do agree, though, that his arrogance seems a bit misplaced. I like that he is regal and does not really seem to get down-right angry. But I would not expect a being of his scope to look down on others. But, as has already been mentioned, who knows what a star-forging dragon would be like. Looking at him from a human perspective, one would expect him to be very humble and peaceful since he has spent so long in space viewing many forms of life and death. \n\nOverall, I don't have a problem with his character or his story so far.
