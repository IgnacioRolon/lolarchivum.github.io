So i was in the waiting screen waiting for over 5 minutes waiting for a player to connect because that player wasnt connected. The game didn't start for so long so i was curious then i found out i was the one who was disconnected but i was stuck in loading screen. then when i tried to reconnect back to my game i got into the game and bought my items then my team voted for a remake.  how is that possible, i reconnected before the voted but it still went through and now im on lower queue. its really annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T03:39:05.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The [/Remake System](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) will mark any player who is *inactive* for 90 or more seconds within the first 3 minutes of the game.
