I have not removed anything nor added anything. What you see is what I got from the Lol-client. I have no problem printscreening the log from the client for those who don't believe this is the entire log I was presented with.\n|I was banned about 3 min after that game. \n|I have made a support ticket and waiting for riot to respond. (The did respond, look at the end of this post)\n|Support ticket was made 48+ hours ago.\n|First support ticket was solved without a response!\n|To me, Ekko was the real problem. Morgana was just inexperienced and was more interested in discussing then winning. As you can see by the log we had a little discussion regarding my death when I did ward tribrush to bait in \n Vi. Vi came but Morgana didn't dispite it being the tribrush and it was our side and I had pinged for assistance about 10 senconds in advance, her excuse was that she was clearing the minionwave (as a level 3-4 morgana?) and therefor didn't want to zone/ try to Q the rakan who walked on the inside (next to morgana) to get to me. Hence the \"zoning\" comment from my side where I did think Morgana should have zoned out the rakan and leaving me and vi for a 1v1 at least. There is an in-game replay of the entire game that anyone can watch to my understanding.\n|I welcome any rioter in here and you have my permission to talk about my account regarding this case as long as all context are posted. \n|I was Twitch Jungle, not adc.\n|Everything I said had a reason that I can justify.\n|My intentions were never to blame anyone, my intentions were to win the game and if that requires me to tell a player how to zone someone out then that is what I will do. I dont see how that goes against anything in summoners code.\n|\"You talk to much\" , what is to much and what is to little? I have seen world champions lose games to amatures due to lack of communication. Also I dont see how \"talking to much\" goes against summoners code.\n|I did not have a chat restriction nor any recent bans when this ban happen. The last ban I had was half a year ago(?) . I did post the log here as well and people did comment like you are here, most thinks that I did edit the log because it's not as toxic as one could assume given the permanent ban. I dont edit my logs.\n|I would post a link with a screenshot from the client with the log, but then I would break the \"reference\" rule in the forums, Im only allowed 1 reference.\n|HERBIE28 decided to solve the ticket and close it. He didnt respond to the questions I had and didnt want to acknowledge the thread nor the peoples opinion within this thread.

Now Im permanently banned (on this account?) \nPlease explain what is the problem here cause I have no idea, really I have no idea.\n\nSupport ticket was responded to with this msg:\nMYSTICKARMA\nToday at 13:13\nHey there Summoner!\n\nYour account has been permanently banned after being escalated through multiple levels of punishment by our disciplinary audits.\n\nTo see the most recent games which led to this action, please log in to the client to view your reform card. While we do our best at Riot Games to encourage reform, we permanently remove players who continue to create negative experiences from our game.\n\nThis action is only taken after repeat punishments and we will not lift the suspension under any circumstance.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that we do not tolerate negative behavior of any kind, including retaliating to toxic behavior in the same manner. If someone else is being toxic, feel free to mute them and report them later, especially if you received the final warning, the two week suspension.\n\nAlthough this marks the end of the line, we’re confident that with some reflection you will be able to avoid this kind of situation with whatever new games you decide to play.\n\nBest of luck in your future endeavors.\n\nKind regards,\n\nMysticKarma\n\nPlayer Support Specialist\n\n\"Heart and mind as one.\"\n\n---------------------------------------\nA new supporter came and did repspond to the ticket.\nThe question was still the same: \"I dont understand what in this log is the problem. Now Im permanently banned (on this account?) \nPlease explain what is the problem here cause I have no idea, really I have no idea.\"\nThe msg I posted before his post that he did reply to:\nHello HERBIE28 \nPlease explain why I am permanently suspended. A link regarding explanation has been provided in the previous msg. Please click it and read it before posting a reply to me. I ask this of you becuse previously I have asked of you(riot) to explain something and I dont get an explanation at all. \nI would like to know what is it that I said that was the problem? \nWas it the odl? The Wtf? The kid? What did I say that made you permanently ban me?\n\nAlso. Why would you give me a \"reform card\" with a lie? I call it a lie becuse of the text, it claims my logs are really toxic, but when posting the logs to the forums people claim they can use them as bed-time stories for their children... meaning they are not toxic at all.\n\nI have been given the tips by someone who did comment to be \"This, you have to be polite and persistent.\" \nI dont think I shold have to but that is what I will do if that results in me getting the help I have been requesting for several weeks now.\n\n\nHere is his response: Hey there,\n\nFirst of all, please keep in mind that toxicity is a very loose term that many players think is just a system that catches on to your swearing, but it's a lot more complicated than that, you see - toxicity is negativity in all it's forms, from the early GG's and sarcastic congratulations, to incessant whining on chat or harassment or just comments that distract rather than help, flame rather than aid, telling other people to report people which is also rude and not the point of chat.\n\nSecondly, you were escalated through several levels of punishments (5 chat restrictions and a 2 week suspension) prior to the permanent ban. Those prior punishments were a chance for you to reform your behavior, but you chose not to. Keep in mind that, after the 2 week suspension, you should show absolutely NO SIGNS of toxic behavior. Also, while you may only receive a limited number of chat logs in your reform card, we look at your behavior as a whole, in each and every chat.\n\nLastly, making a judgement based on what people say on the Boards is not the best way to go about it. The system triggered this suspension because some of the people that played with or against you were offended by your behavior and the system deemed this to be the case.\n\nSince the circumstances of your suspension have been explained, I will be closing this ticket.\n\nHave a nice day!\n\nBest regards.\n\nHerbie28\n\nPlayer Support Specialist\nRiot Games\n\nNostalgia isn't what it used to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-08-23T21:13:29.764+0000","up_votes":65,"down_votes":10,"body":"> This was the only game I was banned for, there are no more log and no more games.\n\nThis isn't entirely accurate. \n\nThis is your 11th penalty on THIS account  and have also been banned from the boards.

I have been asking this question for over 8 months now without you being able to tell me what I have said that is the problem.(I did request this but you didnt provide info) You only say that I am negative etc etc etc, but when you finally show me a log this is far from the truth. (like the log provided above wich you also you could let everyone know is the 100% log and nothing have been changed on it)\nWhat you need to understand is that your knowledge is not absolut and you can not read minds, this means that if I say hello, it means hello and not something else that you want it out to be. This has been the case many times when talking to you(riot), just like when you did call my behavior toxic and did claim that I had called people idiots... I had not, the word I used was \"idiotic\" and that got another definition then \"idiot\", one you are and one you do. I stop using that word to avoid confusion.\n\nAnd no, my logs does not show \"consistent negativity\" , that is a lie. Again, prove it to me and everyone that this is the case. I know that I did change my behavior after you what I did believe(and still do) wrongfully did punish me at the start of this year. I no longer \"report call\" for example and the logs show you this, for you to leave this out when judging me is you looking at the glass half empty and not half full.\n\nIf I get reported a lot, can it not be the result of people being to sensitive? If you were to look at those games where I got reported Im provoked in every single one of them and I simply stand up for myslf. I also dont understand how me letting my teammates know that Im on a losing streak is \"Negative behavior\" , if anything that lets them know that I might be \"feeling bad for my recent performence\" and can help me... You also left out that I did made a ticket about this since Im banned in your boards. As a reply to this ticket your college decided to lie regarding my punishments, he also did claim that I was lying about it, I proved him wrong and sent him evidence of this, evidence that got ignored.\n\nIm not a \"soft troll\" or whatever it is you are trying to call me. Riot Lyte defines a troll as a force who wants chaos and drama. It needs anonymity, a platform and an audience. Im not anonymous and creating drama and chaos are not my motives, therefor Im not a troll and I dont \"troll people\" and I have no intentions of doing so. IF you were to read the chat logs rather then judge me on the number of reports you can see that I do answer every single question I get even though I get flamed for the answers I provide (like for instance about my age). A troll doesn't answer truthfully. Sorry your \"soft\" troll theory does not fit on me and only someone who doesnt know the definition would define me as one.\n\nWhat do you think an argument is? Can you give examples when I argue with people without taking single words and sentences out of it's context?\nI dont argue with people, if someone calls me an idiot I simply states that I want him to use words he understands because when I ask him \"what do you think idiot means?\" They say \"you\" , which is inaccurate. They do this cause they are frustrated because they cant bully me in to submission like they can with others. Basically you ban me for standing up for myself on the rift. Please post a log where I initiate the argument and keeps going. I have already given you permission to post anything my accoutns have written in your clients as long as you dont take it out of context.\n\nYour ticket support have treated me like nuclear waste and lied to me over and over and over again, they have disrespected me and been rude towards me.\nThey make false statements they cant prove or back up, they wrongfully judge players, they dont listen and they dont answer questions.\nI believe I have not been judged fairly and I find you leaving out a lot of information regarding me and my activity on the rift deceiving. Again, I have given you permission to talk about my account all you want as long as you dont take anything out of context, like when you bring up the number of punishments I have but you didnt tell them over what time and when these did occure, becuase in the last 6 months I have is it 0 or 1 punishments? And that was a case similar to this, I did post that log in the forums as well and people came in just like here and was saying \"This cant be the entire log\" due to it being so mild.... Just like the log up there.\n\nIm sorry, you ain't helping me nor anyone else in this forum when you leave vital information out and don't help and assist your players.\n(edited) Also I have not intentionally feeded once during this period, that is a lie!
