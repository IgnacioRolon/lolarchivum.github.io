Now, lately, I've been focused on Mid and que it up as my main role every game, with Top being the secondary, and I experience getting top A LOT more often than Mid, to give you an idea of what I'm talking about I decided to do a small amount of research. \r\n\r\nIn the course of 30 games I got Top roughly 80-90% of the games, I wish I could provide further proof, but you have to simply trust me. Lately this has been worse than ever, and I rarely get my main role, over the last week, me getting Top over Mid has become a meme on our TeamSpeak server. It feels very frustrating and I'm wondering, is anyone else experiencing something similar? Is it possible this could be a bug? It's unbearable. Thanks for help\r\n\r\n- Further information - I'm Gold 2, EUW.

You might just be getting unlucky with which roles you're getting.","replies":[{"poster":"Rιn","date":"2017-09-21T09:08:56.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unlucky? Well then I must be EXTREMELY unlucky, because as I continue to play the percentage is not evening out, it's consistently staying around 80-90%, not to mention that sometimes I don't even wait out the estimated queue time and still only get my secondary. Of course I know that Mid is popular, but the numbers are uncanny","replies":[]}]}]}
