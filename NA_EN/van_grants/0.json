The goal of those two changes was to make Yasuo's shield a bit more powerful (early game particularly) when it's up, with larger windows of downtime in exchange. Trying to just burn through the shield's more costly, so Yasuo's got more capability to make aggressive plays while it's ready. At the same time his enemies have more time with it down to try and attack him, increasing the importance of playing around his passive for both sides.","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2015-04-29T05:00:49.692+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"I don't think you answered his question.\n\nHe's asking why some balance changes don't appear on the PBE before going live.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-04-29T15:51:45.288+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, what he said is that it was put on the PBE.
