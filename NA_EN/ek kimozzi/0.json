International law is a curious field, I considered it as well before settling on Immigration law. International just encompasses so many possible things. Like, you could go for international humanitarian thingies and spend all of your time looking at international accords and agreements, international trade law stuffs, international contracting (the most interesting imo), etc. etc. I think that most of the actual work is in the international contract negotiation field, but I could be wrong. You could also consider becoming a JAG with the military, which could get you semi-related work. A lot of my classmates went for that.

WHAT OP), but otherwise I'm down for that build. Do you go thunderlord's on Vel? Especially with the 5.23 buffs inc, I'm a huge fan of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-11-24T08:33:26.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=3Ez5MeZe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BUqzEzBl,comment-id=000c00000000,timestamp=2015-11-23T21:22:50.681+0000)\n>\n> Nothing like locking in a first pick support Anivia, then spamming your wall in the middle of lane and making instant Vayne Stuns, which you then follow up with your own stun.\n> \n> \n> \n>  Not to mention the egg bait tower dives you can pull off.
