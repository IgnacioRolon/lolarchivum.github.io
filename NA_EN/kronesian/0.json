Sometimes, I have a hot second or to for my pick/ban, other times it shoves me out and says I dodged queue.\r\n\r\nI am currently on a 30 minute wait from this happening and at -10 LP. This is becoming increasingly infuriating to deal with.\r\n\r\nI'm playing on a Lenovo that I obtained around 2012/3 that's still doing pretty well for itself and its on a Windows platform. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo i don't know what the issue is, but I didn't used to have it. Even if you can't fix it/aren't looking into it, at least illuminating the nature of the problem to me would be much appreciated - I'm getting sick of getting negative LP and long wait times for something I have no part in.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-27T15:41:04.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having a poor connection or hiccup and causing you to lose sync with everyone in champion select.
