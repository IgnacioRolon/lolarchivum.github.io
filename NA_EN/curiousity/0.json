I am able to see the mana being used but no animation or damage being done to any of the minions or champs if I am attacking them. I have repaired the LoL client several times hoping to fix the issue but haven't gotten anywhere with that, I have also completely reinstalled league but again nothing has worked, the only temporary solution that occasionally works is if I open my task manager and force close league and reopen it and even then its not always a guarantee. has anyone experienced this problem before or knows how to fix this? please help","replies":[{"poster":"love god","date":"2016-07-19T01:03:12.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that this may have something to do with your connection to the servers, and more specifically packet loss. This has happened to me before the same phenomena, but I had a second computer running which had another player that was in the same game. While I could cast abilities and move around, i would see no animation. However, the abilities would be cast and seen for the other players in the game. I checked and the closest thing to this was packet loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-20T20:36:06.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a spot-on analysis of the situation and I agree, this definitely sounds like packet loss.
