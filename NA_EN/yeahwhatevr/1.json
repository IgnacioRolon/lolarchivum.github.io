Im sure this is probably a windows thing i did reinstall windows recently. just the updates happen so vigorously when the comp goes black to reboot and the fact it happens without fail at the start of the match just as champions are appearing on the screen. just wondering if anyone encountered this issue \n\nPS loaded a version of windows 8.1 and im sure i have my updates set to not go automatically","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-04T00:50:47.984+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you shut your computer down at the end of every night?

At least once a day not usually my first match 2nd or 3rd. as soon as \"Welcome T..\" computer crash's, and auto reboots. if im lucky i get back before the rematch vote,  and am a few mins late AND BEHIND! off to reinstall and see if this corrects anything. cause im not getting anywhere in the ladder at this rate. League is the only game giving me issues\n\nP.s the Rematch vote is so broken, Plenty of times i've gotten back before or during vote and even if the votes are 1yes 3no game will rematch and i take the penalty","replies":[]}]}
