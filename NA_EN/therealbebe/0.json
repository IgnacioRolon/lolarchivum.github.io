As a first step, he should make sure his OS is updated to the most current version.  I then recommend using our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to make sure his drivers are up to date as well.  Have him join a custom game to test things out.\n\nIf he continues to have issues, ask him to submit a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can help him out directly!","replies":[{"poster":"TheRealBeBe","date":"2017-08-02T18:24:30.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, he updated everything and used the FPS issues guide.
