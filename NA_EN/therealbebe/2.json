I understand why.. its because a troller got into my game and was toxic, stole my farm, BMd me, didnt help me in fights.. nothing. So because im not the type of guy who lets himself get bullied i sayed to him to fck off. So then i go get myself so dinner nd i come back to a YOU HAVE BEEN BANNED screen .. so im thinking: Ok, i respect that i was toxic  but then is see .. no email .. no specific information about the ban .. nothing. So im asking: Is this normal ? Only because im not letting myself get fuked over ?\r\n\r\nAnd excuse my English im not really good at that.\r\nI hope i get a answer soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-07T23:53:50.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't usually send out ban emails anymore I don't believe, but you should have been able to log into the client to see your reform card and what specifically was wrong.
