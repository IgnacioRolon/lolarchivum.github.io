About 2-3 months ago when he tried logging in it wouldn't let him in he swears he remembers but you can't trust everything someone his age says. I told him to reset it using the email but he used his friends email to make an account. As this is happening i'm just thinking oh he just can't remember his password. After him complaining over the next few days i finally  load up the client and log into my account. I type his account name into the search bar and nothing. I am positive we were friends on league and i have old match history with the account and i've searched it up on lolking and it does exist. so why can't i see it/why can't he log into the account?","replies":[{"poster":"BajaBlastMyAss","date":"2017-07-06T18:37:44.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay so I have found his account but he's not on my friends list anymore and there are some runes on his account and he has never bought a rune in his life and honestly doesn't even know what they do. So now my question is how can he get his account back?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-06T18:05:06.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His login screen could be set to the wrong region depending on the error, but we can help!
