Firstly, I recommend enabling [low spec mode](https://i.gyazo.com/a39e12ca76e54359342203c476a0e9c1.png) mode just in case champion select is causing too much stress on your pc.\n\nThis can also happen if your connection is degrading or unstable, which can cause you to lose sync or get left behind.  You'll want to run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot that.\n\nBe sure to test it in a custom game, though, to prevent anymore penalties.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
