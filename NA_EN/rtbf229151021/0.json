That is to say, the \"L\" icon shows up on my dock, and the update bar beneath it shows up, but halfway through its progress, the application just crashes.\r\n\r\nI have 120mbps internet, so I don't think that's the problem\r\n\r\nI posted a picture of the application icon right before it crashes. It gets to about halfway in the translucent update bar, and then it closes and nothing happens\r\n\r\nSo, I don't know what the issue is. If anyone has any insight, I would really appreciate it!\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T17:55:29.785+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though your internet is strong, it can still have issues specifically connecting to our servers.  To help get this resolved, I suggest going over a series of steps found in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.  Make sure to select Mac for instructions specific to your operating system.  This issue can also happen if launching League from your dock.

Tried to open the client, but to no avail. When I ran the test service you guys provided, a few problems came up I guess! A few include:\n\n\"Direct TCP access to remote DNS servers (port 53) is blocked.\nThe network you are using appears to enforce the use of a local DNS resolver.\"\n\"Direct UDP access to remote DNS servers (port 53) is blocked.\nThe network you are using appears to enforce the use of a local DNS resolver.\"\n\"Direct UDP access to remote NetBIOS NS servers (port 137) is blocked.\"\n\"Direct UDP access to remote NetBIOS DGM servers (port 138) is blocked.\"\n\nAlso:\n\"The resolver at 8.8.8.8 is not responding to requests.\"\n\"The resolver at 8.8.4.4 is not responding to requests.\"\n\nI'm not sure what these are so hopefully you can shed some light on the subject... I am on a University campus if that helps!\n\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T20:37:07.325+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update on this.  Straight up, I think you should reach out to your campus IT and see how they can help you out.  In similar cases, they were able to help out with their specific issue.  Hit them up and provide them with the above information you gave me here.   Hopefully, they can work out the blocks and get you fixed up!","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf229151021","date":"2016-09-02T22:43:38.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually got it working by going to a friend's house to patch the client! Now my client is working fine. Who knows what happened, but I'm glad it's working properly now.\n\nAt any rate, thanks so much for your help! It was much appreciated =)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
