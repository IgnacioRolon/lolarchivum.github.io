Like half the size it normally is.\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly fine and normal sized then suddenly it just changed itself to a miniscule size.\r\n\r\nNo changes made to any config files, I did absolutely nothing new or different than opening it and playing a game.\r\n\r\nI cannot get it back to its normal size and there are no settings for adjusting window size either.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T16:35:45.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you are currently using a 4k monitor which currently isn't supported, this issue could be due to a recent Windows update problem.  You can get this fixed up by adjusting your game properties through your OS:  Right click the LoL icon -> Properties -> Compatibility Tab -> Check the \"Disable Display Scaling on High DPI Settings\" Box.\n\nHope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Kuno","date":"2016-09-02T16:50:00.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not using 4k monitor, no windows updates. Your suggestion didn't fix the problem. \n\nEventually I just uninstalled and reinstalled LoL entirely and it's back to normal","replies":[]}]}]}
