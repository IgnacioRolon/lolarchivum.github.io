The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**How 8.16&#039;s landed/a few 8.17 things**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve been looking at how 8.16&#039;s landed over the last few days. Some notes:\r\n\r\n* So far at least reducing runes burst damage doesn&#039;t seem to have hit any individual champion excessively hard by itself.\r\n* Wukong however&#039;s been hit pretty hard by the combination of direct nerfs and Rune changes. We&#039;ll see whether he stabilizes before potentially making changes to him (burst threshold changes add a brief but noticeable relearning period). If he remains as weak as he&#039;s currently looking we&#039;ll want to do something for him, likely in a way that doesn&#039;t add burst damage back (so something like sustained damage, tankiness, regen etc)\r\n* We&#039;ll be exploring changes to Duskblade and Stormrazor, potentially shifting their power a bit more towards sustained damage and/or making them not stack. Not certain yet if either change will go into 8.17 though, dependent in part on seeing some more 8.16 play.\r\n* Tahm Kench changes don&#039;t seem to have impacted his performance in solo queue. Our hope was we could reduce his appeal in pro without nerfing him elsewhere by shifting power around. Waiting to see if that&#039;s actually working, but not struggling in solo queue&#039;s a good start.\r\n* We&#039;ll probably be buffing AD Trynd a bit in 8.17. We ended up hitting E CD because, when paired with CDR, his mobility wasn&#039;t sufficiently windowed. While at present only his AP builds build CDR we were confident it would also be a future issue whenever AD itemization let those builds grab CDR too. Wanted to address that issue as a result and then put some power in to help out AD Trynd based off where he ended up post nerf.\r\n* The tanks we buffed are doing a bit better across the board. They&#039;re looking as hoped so far, though we&#039;ll want to dig into a few specific cases (Sion mid, Amumu in low MMR, Rammus jungle) to make sure they&#039;re not overbuffed.\r\n* Zoe&#039;s been hit noticeably power wise. As mentioned previously we&#039;ve got work looking at reducing frustration playing against her already underway. No current plans for other changes to Zoe before that&#039;s ready. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**State of Akali**\r\n\r\nAkali&#039;s been out for a little while now so figured it was a good talk about how we think she&#039;s doing. Her average performance is still gradually climbing as players get more experience on her and things like playstyle/builds get socialized. Players with 15+ games on her are also performing pretty strongly, with effectiveness similar to what you&#039;d see on similar champions for the same number of games played. She&#039;s been seeing a bit of pro play too, so far looking like a decent pick sometimes, but not pick/ban worthy, at least so far. \r\n\r\nOverall we feel Akali&#039;s on a good trend. No currently planned changes as a result. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Non LoL: Flavour Text**\r\n\r\nUsual deal: If you&#039;re not interested in non LoL game design discussion, would skip this bit.\r\n\r\nLink here to a discussion of flavour text in games by Alex Wiltshire of PC Gamer. Includes discussion on flavour text as a tool, how it helps build theme/worlds, status as optional &#039;gameplay&#039; etc. Examples drawn from games like Dark Souls, Alpha Centauri, Pillars of Eternity and more. Well worth a read if that sounds like your sort of thing. The Dark Souls bits in particular resonate with me personally, given how distinct a world that series offers despite being pretty minimalist with its story telling through traditional channels (very limited dialogue, no quest log etc). \r\n\r\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/the-art-of-flavour-text/\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"food please","date":"2018-08-17T17:10:19.122+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":72,"body":"Here's a clip of a 3/3 Lux support surviving a well executed combo from a 7/3 Zed who is 3 levels ahead.

Lack of damage is not something I have ever felt on the updated Rek'Sai. Since you mentioned in your previous post she is being looked at for buffs, would it be possible to give her help in other areas?\n\nI'm curious to know your thoughts on potentially decreasing the interval on tremor sense blips, as it is her most unique utility compared to other fighters. Not back to the pre-nerf interval, but somewhere in between?\n\nAnother area that has potential for improvement is the wonkyness of her current ult upon landing (\"clunky\"); it feels like there's a lock out on being able to basic attack upon landing for about a second, which can often be the difference between life and death in close duels or in the thick of teamfights and is especially relevant when you use the ult for the untargetability and not as a finisher.\n\nAs it stands, her passive regeneration is irrelevant past early skirmishes and has a very weak per level scaling. It becomes negligible after the first ten minutes of the game. Maybe something could be done with that?\n\nSetting aside my suggestions for what could be done for her in her current state, I would also like to ask what you guys see as her intended gameplay pattern?

(Most of this counts for any AD-Assassin!)\nThe reason why i picked up Zed was, because he was a high mobility high damage early- to midgame champion that fell off in lategame. I just loved being able to crush my lane by punishing their little mistakes and close out the game as fast as i could.\nBut with the introduction of Lethality this playstyle has shifted a little bit. Zed didn't have as much power early on but had more power late because Lethality scales and is in total a higher number late than flat armor pen was. At this point I was still fine with it because we still had 20+ Lethality in runes to make up for the loss of armor penetration early.\nThen Season 8 came along and the 20+ Lethality in runes were gone. Of course you could argue, that the enemy also lost about 10 armor from runes, but the truth is that the 20+ Lethality loss is a way harder hit than the 10 armor are. In addition many Champions also got a base armor buff to make up for the loss in runes. Sudden Impact, which I guess was meant to compensate for the loss of lethality absolutely doesn't do it's job because it's so little Lethality which especially Zed can't make use of in lane because he would have to instant W-Swap which is way too hard of a commitment so early on in the game.\nAs of now, all these early game losses have led to Zed feeling like a scaling mage in terms of  losing almost every matchup in midlane because of his non-existent poke damage and long W cooldown but scaling very well into the game thanks to LDR and the amount of Lethality all 3 Assassin-Items give combined with each other.\nIf you disagree or don't feel like this really is true, you can prove my statements easily by looking at the winrate by game length being low early, even lower in midgame but very high in 40+ minutes games.\n\nTL;DR:\nZed is supposed to win early to mid but lose late as it's the nature of his class. Instead he does no damage in lane, losing to most matchups while scaling way too good into lategame thanks to LDR and the amount of Lethality all 3 Assassin-Items give combined with each other.\n\nWay to fix:\nThere are so many things you could do that wouldn't buff Zed directly but would make his playstyle what it once was and how it's meant to be.\nThese are a number of suggestions that are combinable but would also work as a standalone fix.\n\n1) Revert Lethality back to flat armor pen - decrease the total amount you get from items but select one item that offers a big amount of armor pen. This way you have a stat that is very powerful early but falls off late because it not as big of a number and doesn't scale.\n\n2) By giving us the choice what stat we want to get in runes, regardless of what tree we went, offer the choice to get Lethality as a stat in runes.\n\n3) Add more early base damage into Zed's kit. The base damage of his q level 1 and 2 are laughably low and that alone makes him lose most matchups because they can just outpoke him with most spells\n\n4) Decrease his W cooldown early, remove the passive AD on his Ult and move it back to his W. Once you press W in lane you lose 22 seconds of pressure and are punished super hard even if you hit your combo. Though Zed should be able to be heavily punished if he doesn't use W properly, it's cooldown is so long that even making full use of it's potential, it gives so much time of free pressure to your opponent. Reverting the Ult passive back to his W would make him a) stronger early due to the small bonus AD it offers, b) less matchup dependent in lane and c) weaker in late due to losing the massive amount of AD the Ult passive offers but getting less AD from W in late\n\nI hope you read this and understand my points. I'm speaking in the name of all Zed mains here because if you looked at the r/zedmains for example you can see nobody really is all too happy with the current state of the champion.\n\n I would love to see your reply.\nSincerely, the Zed community","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eagzey L9","date":"2018-08-22T02:34:41.792+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaco is trash because of the rune changes, and no, I'm not saying it out of bias. I've said that previous buffs to Shaco - like your idea of putting 70% of AD into his Q - were way too overtuned and unnecessary; I want the Jester to be balanced and at the very least, playable. The problem was that Shaco's damage came from external resources like Electrocute and lethality (especially Duskblade), and gutting one of them effectively guts Shaco. If you nerf Duskblade in subsequent patches Shaco will legit be useless (if he isn't already). He's meant to be an early game champion but he doesn't have one.

Imo, he should maybe have some power taken away from his late game (revert that last W buff maybe? It was more of a \"win-more\" buff that he doesnt need) and add some of that to his early. Doesnt need anything too crazy, he just has 0 early lane pressure/trading potential compared to every other champ and he usually doesnt come online until the games already decided.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Goddie Boy","date":"2018-08-17T15:59:59.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"With the adjustments to burst runes, are there any thoughts/worries about defensive options becoming too overbearing?","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Homie busta","date":"2018-08-17T16:12:35.581+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Overbearing?

Before, we used to have 9 Armor and 12 MR from runes as default. Most of the champions only got 6 Armor as compensation and some base health in the Runes Reforged introduction, but i think that wasn't enough.\n\nWhat about completing the compensation by giving everybody (except some tanks that already got their) more Armor and MR?
