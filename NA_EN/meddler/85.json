The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**Rate of Balance Changes in TFT**\r\n\r\nWe're at the point now where we're planning on slowing down on rate of balance changes in TFT. Until now we've been making pretty frequent and large changes trying to get everything broadly in line. From what we're seeing balance is getting close to a point where natural meta evolution's going to counter a lot of things though. Changing too quickly undercuts ability for that to emerge and can make it feel like whenever you're starting to master things that expertise gets reset too much with new patches all the time. 9.15b next week's likely to be pretty small as a result and current thinking is 9.16, while it will introduce new content with the Hextech Champs, shouldn't be as heavy on raw balance as 9.15. Plan is to still act swiftly on anything really degenerative or straight out bugged of course.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**SR Balance**\r\n\r\nAs mentioned previously we're now in the part of the year where we'll be making few balance changes for a while, keeping the game in a stable state. That means in particular fewer mechanics changes to existing champions and limited systemic changes to things like items, the jungle, runes etc. We'll still have regular balance changes each patch of course, though they'll tend to be more at the level of tuning than big swings at things.\r\n\r\nLooking at 9.15 things landed pretty much as expected. We don't have any significant followup planned yet for champs changed that patch as a result. For 9.16 we'll be keeping an eye on Yuumi, Irelia, Karma and Ezreal as all potentially too dominant, especially in a pro play context. Only specific change we're testing for 9.16 so far though is a nerf to jungle Sylas where his Q2 damage will also be reduced against monsters, not just minions. That's aimed at reducing the extra value he gets from being a strong flex pick, hope being that trimming that down will let us leave more power in him in other ways.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**How we think about maintaining multiple versions of a feature** \r\n\r\nGiven recent discussion around the Legacy Cursor I figured a bit of visibility into our thought process when it comes to offering multiple different versions of a feature might be of interest. Before diving into that though, for anyone who's missed it the option to use the Legacy Cursor's back in again.\r\n\r\nSo, first off, general thoughts on benefits and costs of maintaining prior functionality when we update something. I'm assuming here that the output of the feature in question is the same (e.g. a cursor you use to control the game, a patcher that updates the game for you, a particular UI etc). Things like old and new versions of a champion by contrast are a very different case because what one player chooses impacts others.\r\n\r\nThe benefit side of things is pretty straightforward - it lets us give different groups of players what they want. The cost side by contrast tends to be more complex, particularly depending on what the feature in question is. Meaningful costs we think about include:\r\n\r\n* The ongoing extra time that will be required to support multiple versions going forwards. Tends to mean things like having to make additional new pieces of art, fix the same bug in multiple places, additional QA testing each patch. For some features that time cost's trivial. For others (e.g. maintaining multiple versions of the in game HUD after its update a few years back) it adds a lot of extra time.\r\n* Some improvements that would be great for most users can end up being blocked by the need to support older functionality. Supporting really old operating systems for example can block improvements to things like memory usage for everyone else.\r\n* The total size and complexity of the game's code base has some impact on how quickly we can develop new features. Removing anything unnecessary gives us future efficiency as a result, which is particularly important for games like LoL with long lifespans and regular updates.\r\n\r\nLooking at the Legacy Cursor as an example:\r\n\r\n* We shipped an update to LoL's cursor in July 2018. Our belief was that the updated version would be a better experience for most players. That generally seemed to be true, testing did indicate that a subset of players indicated they found the cursor change really disruptive though. \r\n*  In response to that we added a Legacy Cursor option to allow players to opt into the old functionality. Cost, both upfront and ongoing, of doing so was pretty low and audience asking for the old cursor seemed to be of a meaningful size.\r\n* As with any legacy feature we made a note to reassess at some point, see if it was still worth supporting or no longer necessary.\r\n* Somewhere along the way we got some wires crossed in our internal communication and the need to assess the Legacy Cursor was assumed to instead be a need to remove it a year later. Cursor gets removed, players get understandably sad.\r\n* We then take a look at who's using it, see that it's around 10% of the LoL playerbase, and add it back in. Cost of maintaining it's low and value seems pretty meaningful.\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2019-08-02T15:28:13.621+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey Meddler. \n\nAt this point, is it fair to say that the changes Karma was given in 5.10 have broken her kit?

That's the case for Irelia, her ammo bar is self only, so I assumed it was very easy to choose between the two.\nMy point is, it's very easy to mess up your counts, thinking you were at 2, use the chord you want, and too bad, you were at 1 and now you can't get the proper chord because the corresponding spell is on CD.\n\n(Quick side-note, but I believe Irelia should be for everyone, not just self, not because of windows but because it's important to communicate to enemies that a big part of her DPS comes from this passive being up. The golden effect on her hand is there already, but it's much less loud than an ammo bar. People would be less surprised by \"Irelia one-shot\" and less frustrated if they understood that.)\n\nAnd that argument for clarity in general, not just windows timing, works for Sona too, so I could make a case for an ammo bar visible for everyone, but my ask definitely originates from my experience as a Sona player, not for playing against.\n\nThanks for the reply, anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-08-02T17:46:21.417+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha.

Furthermore, why is the heuristic for determining pro play presence so rudimentary? How is a company earning billions in revenue simply giving a checkmark to whether or not a champion appears in P/B? How is a red side last pick \"nobody picked my counter\" valued identically to \"THIS POWER PICK IS OPEN, SLAM IT\" first pick blue side? Furthermore, how does contribution to team damage count towards this?\n\nHow do you reconcile the fact that as you continue to try and hamper Irelia's pro presence, that you might as well remove her from the game as a serious pick for the vast majority of the League of Legends playing population? Remember when Akali crested below 40% win rate in solo queue? Is this the goal here? Is she supposed to be a mid-tier pro pick, and completely absent from the hands of anybody else, like Garen is supposed to be a mid-tier pick for low ELO play, and absent elsewhere?\n\nOr, as I saw on /r/ireliaMains :\n\nRiot: Let's release a skill-expressive champion!\nPros: _express skill_\nRiot: **NERF THAT. NOW.**\n\nFurthermore, assuming Riot achieves their goal of reining in her presence in pro play, that'd essentially mean she'd need to be rebuffed since she'd be absolutely bottom of the barrel in solo, and not highly represented in pro.\n\nWhy not just bite the bullet, and be happy that pro play sees a perennial presence of a champion that's aesthetically amazing to watch for the people in TV-land, give a second look to how you analyze pick/ban data in pro, while creating a champion that the vast majority of people wouldn't just be reported for feeding on in the game that the vast majority of individuals play across the world?\n\nOverall, I think this is a huge failure from Riot here. The idea that you have to completely destroy a champion because a few select individuals whose literal job it is to play the game for more time than is healthy for most human beings to do can competently play a champion in certain situations just seems so utterly bizarre to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Min Haegeum","date":"2019-08-02T19:52:34.643+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"This.\nRiot you have to wake up, stop balancing the game around less than 1% of the playerbase, even in challenger her winrate is negative.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkaidan","date":"2019-08-03T07:37:12.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yea lets balance the game around the casual players who have no fucking idea about what they are doing and have no interest at all in learning how to deal with certain champions and improve.\n\nI agree they shouldn't balance around proplay (which is not the same thing as high elo), because we don't get to play soloQ as 5 men premade, but balacing around low elo players because they are too lazy to improve is dumb","replies":[{"poster":"IlyaK1986","date":"2019-08-03T11:48:27.025+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The **very person they showed that they flew into her office to consult on her new kit when they remade her** says she's awful in solo queue. \n\nIreliaCarriesU streamed yesterday, and he was *really* down on her solo queue prospects.\n\nIf that's not damning, I'm not sure what is.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aatrox Airlines","date":"2019-08-02T19:59:52.382+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":8,"body":"Irelia is fucking aids to play against","replies":[{"poster":"IlyaK1986","date":"2019-08-02T20:49:09.752+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"The data completely disagrees with you.

Karma's performance in regular play dropped massively after the E haste duration reduction;\n2. This latest nerf has her to the point in standard play of being middle-of-the-pack at best for both support and top, _and_ highly unreliable from mid, even amongst the most proficient people playing her (u.gg and Lolalytics both verify this);\n3. Her actual performance in competitive for 9.14 is unremarkable, despite her pick rate, instead implying that her presence follows the trend of prioritizing position flexibility over raw power (and even then frequently being unable to successfully exploit that flexibility);\n\nWith all of that in mind, how clear is it yet that she needs an actual update, and not just being left to the whims of repeated nerfing because her current iteration is only functional for the majority of players when it provides enough raw strength to be easily exploitable in competitive?\n\nHow much of a priority is being placed on giving her an update that _listens_ to what Karma players are saying and sticks _with them_ to see it through, as has been requested by Karma players for multiple years now? The last attempt at an update went heavily against what the majority of Karma players wanted in multiple aspects, and was then swiftly abandoned with very little in the way of iteration; meanwhile, Teemo update, Malphite update, etc. were on PBE for extended periods to receive feedback and get adjustments that fit what people were requesting, and even though Teemo's update didn't end up shipping, it was still getting modified for months.\n\nKarma has a long history of being neglected and put to the side in favor of other champions, with many of those champions _consistently_ getting favor at that.

This is about the {{champion:134}} buff.\n\nPlease revert the 9.15 buff (lvl2/3 ultimate damage buff) and buff something else. All I thought this buff would do is increase her playrate/banrate by a little bit, which is exactly what it did, without really helping her, since all it did is:\n- Rarely, put even more of her damage into her ultimate, killing enemies from even higher amounts of hp with a single spell\n- **Often, be useless, as the damage is overkill, especially since you often use Syndra’s ulti on low HP targets.** \n\nThere are many better ways to buff her. I would personally target her W, as it’s her worst spell currently.\n\n**W buff ideas (one of the following):**\n- Get back her W mechanic back (the mechanic that was removed early season 9) by increasing her W grab range (W1) on spheres only, and keeping the throw range the same. I know this is a buff you’ve mentioned being cautious of not putting through as it targets Syndra mains/low ping, but this mechanic was in the game for a season and a half and it was not a problem. **Currently, a lot of the times, Syndra wants to use her W on an enemy, but can't get in range to grab her sphere, and is left with an unusable spell.**\n- Lower mana cost: if you would like to keep Syndra’s W as her least strong ability, I would reduce the mana cost from 60-100 to 50-70, to make it a better option to max W/match its power level. The lower lvl 1 mana cost would also match the current power level of her W, as her W used to be much easier to hit while having high base damage early. It doesn’t deserve to be 60 mana at lvl 1 anymore.\n- Higher damage when maxed with slightly lower scaling: if you would like to increase the W damage when maxed (the buff on twitter), I would reduce the mana cost a bit too to help Syndra when maxing W (60-100 to 60-80).","replies":[]},{"poster":"MiracleMorg94","date":"2019-08-02T16:16:55.991+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":7,"body":"Stop nerfing Karma and give her the damn rework she rightfully DESERVES, Meddler.

I'd rather see counters to these champs arise than the need to gut them, as Azir in particular has faced a ton of nerfs already.\n\nOn another topic, is there any kind of gameplay explorations for champs that you can clue us into?
