The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Reflecting on Odyssey**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve been looking back at Odyssey a bit recently and reflecting on how it went and what we can learn from it. A few thoughts from that:\r\n\r\n* There&#039;s clearly some interest in PVE within LoL as a substantially different experience, not just as an emulation of PVP play (Co-Op versus AI style). Being able to heavily modify a champion&#039;s capabilities and raid style encounters were called out in particular as a lot of the appeal. \r\n* Most people tried the mode, and a meaningful proportion put quite a lot of games into it. Digging into it both the mode&#039;s gameplay and the mode specific missions mattered quite a bit for people who engaged heavily. \r\n* Friction trying to find a team who wanted to do the same missions you did was the most common source of frustration reported by an enormous margin. We should avoid creating those sorts of conflicts again, via things like changing mission designs or helping players group together with common goals.\r\n* We&#039;ll keep an eye out for another opportunity to try more PVE like this at some point. It&#039;s not as inherently replayable as PVP is, but is certainly worth exploring in the future.\r\n\r\nWe should also have a dev blog that runs through some stats from Odyssey in the next month or two, covering things like popularity of the different champions, difficulty completion rates, augment usage etc. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**Nexus Blitz** \r\n\r\nAs we mentioned a few weeks back we&#039;re planning on bringing Nexus Blitz back for another test run from 8.24 onwards:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/10/dev-up-next-for-nexus-blitz/\r\n\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re now well into the work on that so wanted to share a few details about how it was going:\r\n\r\n* We&#039;ve got a couple  new events we&#039;re confident in, including one that&#039;s especially focused on smaller skirmishes rather than teamfights, in contrast to many of the existing events. \r\n* We&#039;ll be taking out Snowball Fight. While it had its moments, feedback on it was overall noticeably more negative than other events.\r\n* On the rewards side we&#039;ll be cutting a couple unsatisfying / frustrating ones like Blessing of Caitlyn and Cursed Minions,and adding some more fun and memorable replacements.\r\n* Reshaping of some of the map walls and jungle camp locations is looking promising, giving a bit more of a distinct laning phase and jungle path variety.\r\n* The map itself should also end up looking noticeably nicer/less like an early prototype. Not currently expecting it&#039;ll be as polished as something like SR for this test, but you should see a fair bit of upgrade aesthetics wise compared to the first version.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------        \r\n**Preseason**\r\n\r\nIs still on track for patch 8.23. We&#039;re working on some final polish at the moment, including likely taking a bit of sustain out of the game overall to avoid laning phases becoming too defensive and safe. Also testing keeping minion spawn at its current time, rather than getting minions and the jungle onto the map earlier. Main point under discussion there is how to assess the value of that time for the invades and action it sometimes offers, which can be strong high moments, versus the larger number of games where it&#039;s unused time spent afk/alt tabbed until laning starts. \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Rahambe","date":"2018-11-07T15:07:12.948+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you guys ever thought about putting Nexus Blitz during the downtime in which there is no roaring game mode?","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-11-07T15:10:38.766+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"If everything with Nexus Blitz turns out well, it’s eventually going to be a new permanent mode like ARAM.

The two modes have a lot of similarities including game length, fluid and poorly defined laning phases, distinct composition needs with a focus on roaming, and centralizing objectives to incentivize team fights.

Dominion's small map size was a strength, not a flaw. For one thing, larger map sizes have a strong emphasis towards slower, more methodical gameplay with \"setup -> payoff\" flow. With smaller maps, there's more opportunities for faster-paced, reactive gameplay, since a player's sphere of influence/effective range covers a larger percentage of the map. Granted, being able to cover too much of the map is definitely problematic (e.g. pre-nerf Kassadin). Furthermore, enlarging the map could have made it feel empty. Skirmishing and clashing with the enemy team is significantly more difficult if neither team can find each other.\n\nRegardless, mode gameplay specifics aren't the focus here. It's the meta, \"out-of-game\" stuff that's in question. \"Having more game modes fractures the overall League playerbase\" was frequently brought up before. Is that not applicable to Nexus Blitz? Similarly, Riot has historically ignored or avoided balance considerations in non-SR modes. Will that be the same for Blitz, and if not, why? Yet another issue is the question of recognition/reward for skilled and dedicated players that Dominion struggled, and ARAM currently still struggles, with. It's all stuff that's important for the future of all alternate game modes, but Riot doesn't seem to have addressed it yet.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Daddy Zernii","date":"2018-11-07T15:19:54.756+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler,\nSo, the delay to Lissandra passive hitting PBE was caused that she had a skin in the works, and skin team had to change it to new passive aswell when you finished testing that spell?

I only see Aatrox and Gnar actually build it and Zed/lucian too. sure it would get more power on Lucian and MF again but yet again, the kindlegem change didnt really change the amount of champions that build that item.\n\nAlso something that concerns me, the current testing rune changes with the extra path. Is it possible to get maybe Flat CDR instead of scaling? It doesnt really benefit anyone that you get 1% on lvl 1 and just 10% on Level 18. most players will rather go for the offensive or defensive stats and the CDR path will just be ignored.\n\n\n\nHope you could answer these questions.\n\n\nMuch love, much respect, as always, keep up the good work.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkSpiritslayer","date":"2018-11-07T16:50:47.493+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"this guy is so right on all his points!\nu deserve a {{item:2010}} \n\n1. high dmg toplane champs like {{champion:92}} feel pretty useless atm\nlike: why go Riven top if you can just pick something WAY more tanky that still deals the same amount (or even more) of dmg? like {{champion:6}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:122}} \nand vs tanks its just a free lose anyways cause even a tiny bit of armor makes you completely uselss and they can burst you down in one combo (yes ... tanks that burst someone down ... so fun) - like  {{champion:516}} {{champion:78}} or even something like tank {{champion:79}} \noh! and lets not forget the abusive mages top that can build armor and still deal a shit ton of dmg - looking at you {{champion:112}} \n\n2. ever since the changed and nerfs {{item:3071}} went from a pretty good item to a pretty shitty items\nit just took ppl quite a while to realize that even if you are a tanky champ - a champ where BC should be a core item - BC is kinda shit\nthats why even the BC-core users switched to {{item:3078}}\nBC just cant compete!
