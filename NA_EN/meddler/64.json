The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n**Midseason changes still being worked on**\r\n \r\nAs you&#039;ve likely seen in other threads in the Devcorner and PBE Boards we&#039;ve got a number of changes in for midseason. Those are still being worked on, whether it&#039;s polish on AD items that will be in 8.11, ongoing exploration and tuning of jungle changes (probably in 8.10) or follow up to mage and AP item mana changes from 8.9. Continued feedback on those much appreciated, whether from direct experiences with the changes in game or analysis of them after they&#039;re posted. While we won&#039;t be able to act on every piece of feedback, especially when different players are looking for very different things, it is extremely valuable, letting us catch or improve a range of things. \r\n \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Thoughts on supports soon**\r\n \r\nWe&#039;ve talked about a lot of other classes and positions recently, we haven&#039;t talked much about supports and problems there for a bit. Some thoughts on that shortly (Friday or mid next week). Short version is there are some issues we want to look at once midseason&#039;s stabilized, including how reliably defensive power is from enchanters and whether the current power from the heal/shield stat&#039;s too high and/or undercosted. Long version soon.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**Varus W empowered Q sounds**\r\n \r\nWe&#039;ve been seeing some feedback recently that it&#039;s too hard to tell when Varus is charging a W empowered Q, versus just a normal Q, making it hard to play around that more dangerous cast. Turns out one of the reasons for that is that the main audio cue on the empowered Q charge (a spinning powering up sound) wasn&#039;t playing most of the time. That should be fixed in 8.9, let us know if it&#039;s still really hard to tell if it&#039;s a normal or empowered Q after that.\r\n \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Surrender Rules**\r\n \r\nSometime soon (probably starting this week) we&#039;ll be testing a change to the early surrender rules that removes the unanimous vote requirement and instead goes with the normal 4 of 5 yes votes. That change will initially be only on the Oceanic server, if it tests well there we&#039;ll then roll it out to other regions as well.\r\n \r\nWe originally went with a unanimous requirement for early surrenders to ensure players weren&#039;t having games that looked winnable still surrendered out from under them that early. Looking at early surrender&#039;s use however games that fail a surrender 4-1 between 15-20 very often end up with a surrender or defeat around 20 minutes instead. That means the unanimous requirement is mainly just dragging out already lost games.\r\n \r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2018-05-02T15:42:15.633+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Also can I hear your thoughts behind what we may see in preseason","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-05-02T16:01:06.845+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sure, though I'll have to get back to you in 3-5 months on that.","replies":[{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2018-05-02T16:06:59.754+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bookmark this comment","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SeanGoku","date":"2018-05-02T16:16:41.203+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey Meddler. How about you guys take this opportunity to try out my surrender \"switch\" instead of the vote?\nIn short it just means that everyone can vote silently (or \"switch\" their vote) in the options menu. And as soon as the threshold is reached the game is ended. \n\n*edit: Some people noted some edge cases that might be frustrating with this system. So alternatively you could have the surrender vote pop up, when 4 switches are turned on. This way everyone gets a last chance to change their mind. Just added this up here to keep everything tidy.*\n\n- There would be no more annoying surrender vote spamming of toxic players during team fights\n- Nobody would be forced to make the prompt decision every time, but make their decision any time they want\n- You could switch the switch any time, even at minute 1, but the game would simply continue until both requirements are met\n","replies":[{"poster":"Kalturi","date":"2018-05-02T18:54:50.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the other hand, it would be really frustrating if I had my surrender option switched \"ON\" but something changed and I no longer want to surrender, but I haven't gotten a chance to change it, and then a teammates swaps from \"OFF\" to \"ON\" and that triggers a surrender for my team.\n\nEssentially I'd feel like we surrendered and I didn't want to but I contributed to the vote positively because I just hadn't gotten a chance to change my setting yet.

Early IE gives really high potential crit, gets multipliers on damage going too fast and leads to increased access to crit in lane. Shifting it to a later item and pushing some of its power towards being better at killing tanky targets more helps with those issues. We chose double crit because it's both a pretty strong limiter (no way you're rushing this as a first item and few champs can go Zeal item first) and one that's pretty easy to understand (oh, I need some crit for this to do anything, I'll get it later). \n\nI think you'll generally be right about StormRazor, ER and BotRK as common rush items. Less confident we'll see early BT still. Would also still expect  some of the existing less common starts to still exist too.
