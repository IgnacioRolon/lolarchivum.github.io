{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-02-28T17:51:48.617+0000","title":"Quick Gameplay Thoughts: Feb 28","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi all,\n\nSome stuff on our minds below. As usual things mentioned here aren&#039;t necessarily final and this certainly isn&#039;t a comprehensive list, just things in a good place to be talked about today.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Marksmen**\n\nAs per the post a couple of weeks ago (http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/XuAJPHo1-some-follow-up-marksmen-thoughts) we think Utility Marksmen, AD Caster Marksmen and lane bully marksmen are in reasonable spots generally (some exceptions). Crit marksmen definitely still need some work though. For crit marksmen the bulk of that work&#039;s going to be in mid-season when we&#039;ll likely make some changes to crit and/or armor pen functionality (see testing out different approaches, so hopeful on that stuff, but it&#039;s not guaranteed yet, might end up doing something else). \n\nWe had some small tweaks that will affect crit marksmen, and marksmen in general in 7.4 (Warlord&#039;s Nerf, Fervor Buff, Last Whisper situational buff) too. Apologies for the disconnect between opening patch notes context (talk of big changes) and what was actually in the patch. That was the result of a misunderstanding between people on what we&#039;d be tackling in 7.4 versus what we were targeting for mid-season. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Keystones**\n\nAs you&#039;ve probably seen we&#039;ve got changes to DFT, Bond of Stone (soon to be renamed) and Warlord&#039;s Bloodlust on the PBE at present. We&#039;re trying to get significant functional changes to Keystones out of the way in one patch if possible, addressing issues with their patterns so that, ideally, we can just focus on numbers tuning for them for a while. That pairs with the reduction to damage contributions from masteries in 7.4 which was the other improvement we&#039;d identified we wanted to target in the shorter term. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Patch Cycles**\n\nOn a different note I figured it might also be interesting to some people to talk a bit about how our patch development cycles work, in particular why we stop making gameplay changes beyond a certain point and how that impacts how quickly we can respond to some things. It&#039;ll also probably be really boring to other people so suggest bailing out here if that doesn&#039;t sound like your thing. \n\nEach patch gets locked for bug testing, compatibility checking etc a week before it goes live. That means that with 7.5 for example, which we&#039;re currently working on, our last day to make gameplay changes is tomorrow, and even then anything new we add should be pretty minor (want to get the bigger changes that are harder to assess and check for bugs changes in early). That means we&#039;ve got a week between 7.4 going out and 7.5 getting locked to make changes.  \n\nThe big exception to that is anything that needs tooltip adjustments. Since those have to be translated into other languages those need to be done earlier again (ideally by the Friday a few days after the previous patch, at latest the Monday after that). It takes a couple of days to get a read on the new game state after a patch too. As a result we start working on a patch before the previous one goes out, based off what we think will happen, and then adjust as needed if our predictions were wrong. For bigger unexpected tasks it can mean we need to take a patch longer as well.\n\nOr, to put that into a rough timeline, since that&#039;s a bit of a block of text:\n\n* 1 week before Patch 7.4 goes out we stop working on patch 7.4 and start working on 7.5. \n* Patch 7.4 goes out. \n* 2 days after patch 7.4 we get a read on how that patch has impacted balance. We&#039;ve then a couple of days to make additional 7.5 changes if they affect tooltips and a couple of days more again if they don&#039;t.\n* 1 week after patch 7.4 goes out we lock down 7.5 completely and start on 7.6 gameplay changes.\n\nWe will occasionally hotfix changes in too of course, those add significant extra risk of bugs though, particularly for some types of changes (stat adjustments tend to be pretty safe, things that change game logic like how spells function less so). As a result we try to use those really sparringly, since they get less testing time than changes developed normally and can lead to champions/items getting disabled etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Pastor Yorick","date":"2017-02-28T19:09:38.012+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"News on Galio rework? :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-02-28T19:58:21.181+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can confirm Galio is getting an update!","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2017-02-28T20:00:06.814+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sigh, Well played.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pastor Yorick","date":"2017-02-28T21:17:15.978+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"u my boi meddler","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rcteg","date":"2017-02-28T18:23:52.204+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"How will the marksman changes affect Yasuo?

At least use them to fix up any last minute bugs/balances and what-not to avoid the early patch issues.\n\nAlso, am curious at how you look at the health of a patch when it does go live, do you go by top players, bottom players, or sort of grab a small batch from each group and division? Again, 2 days seems like a very short time span to get a full read of how it's affecting the game. People take roughly a few days to even a week before they're all settled in, just take a look at when a new champion or rework comes out.\n\nOther than that, I actually was playing recently and this patch definitely feels a lot better. Things aren't dying so fast and even Ashe feels solid again taking Fervor.

Did our changes land roughly as hoped?). For bigger changes (larger updates, new champs) we won't try and make a call in the first couple of days generally, since as you say it takes a while for people to learn and adapt. Exception is if something's so far out of line it's obvious even then. We look at a range of stats (average Elo, high Elo, different regions, by game time etc) when assessing impact of changes. Important to mention though that stats are useful, but not what drives our decision making process (they're a tool to be used carefully, not something that should drive priorities themselves).\n\nGlad this patch has been treating you better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2017-02-28T18:01:54.038+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey meddler can I ask an OT question, do you ever play on OCE since iirc you are from New Zeland and as for an on topic question what are your thoughts on some traditional junglers struggling in the jungle at the moment like Volibear or Udyr","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-02-28T18:11:30.067+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played occasionally on OCE when back home, or in Australia, for work or a holiday.

Not a high priority right now, given we've been focusing on bigger things, we did test some possible changes a few weeks back to see if they were a direction worth more exploration though.

So I'm no longer a priority of yours? I see how it is. {{item:3070}} \n\n:)\n\nUdyr OTP here for last 4 seasons. I have some ideas on what to do with Udyr but having him being able to get to level 20 is pretty underwhelming. That usually happens around minute 35 and most games are done by then, especially in pro play. I would like to see that power distributed earlier in the game especially into early Phoenix ranks. \n\nThematically, his stances are his identity. Without introducing much more complexity, a bit more depth into his gameplay/stances is needed. (ambigouus statement of the year)\n\nI think the biggest opportunity to change is his passive. Monkey's agility is powerful but it doesn't have that 'oomph' where you know it is impacting the game. Additionally, the monkey is not part of his identity so can be overhauled without impacting identity. What about this? \n\n\"Udyr Passive - \"Hear me Spirits, and Rise to my Call\" - Udyr is temporarily (10 seconds) empowered by large jungle monsters he kills, gaining +5 AD, +5% AS, and +5 MS stacking up to 5 times.\"\n\nrisk here is the power farming but you could apply some champion-only mechanic to encourage getting on map to apply the passive.\n\nAlternate kindred-like: \"Udyr Passive - \"Hear me Spirits, and Rise to my Call\" - A random jungle monster is marked throughout the game.

Leathality and LW buffs just destroy you, you dont have enough damage to be a damage dealer and you cant be bulky enough to be a tank and on top of that you arent that mobile. \nMost Juggernauts tend to be really tanky while dealing insane damage. Darius / Garen / Shyv / Olaf / Voli / Trundle / Nasus  \nWhile you got some CC as Udyr it doesnt compensate your  low damage output. \nI think that if you buff  his Phoenix proc damage and add an AD ratio while lowering the AoE part the \"Not enough damage\" part can be fixed to some extent, and maybe add some AD / Armor ratio  to his W to make him tankier so he can survive the LW / Leathality abusers and maybe buff his base AD by a few points like 3-4, but i guess if you do all that its gonna make him  way too strong. \n\nThe only thing that the level 20 cap is gonna do is  give him some attack speed buff late game which is irrelevant, the other thing i can see possible is like reducing his GCD  from 1 sec to 0,5 and maybe some base stat buffs plus reverting the W nerfs  from the whole Ruinic / IBG /  Udyr.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlashStriker","date":"2017-02-28T22:04:30.110+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=a2ftyl7z,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2017-02-28T18:11:30.067+0000)\n>\n> Udyr needs a bit of balance work in general.

I know you guys are usually cool with other classes using items, so long as they are usually better served by their own class's items.\n\nBut recently it really hasn't seemed like that. Marksmen in general right now are ALL using lethality items instead of items intended for their class. The ones who can't make good use of lethality are just not being played much, and why would they? It's hard to compete with builds that are good lategame when marksmen can just build early game items that don't really fall off in any significant effect.\n\nAre you guys going to do anything about it or just leave it for now until you can make greater systemic changes?","replies":[]},{"poster":"RestTarRr","date":"2017-02-28T21:15:27.025+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"we think Utility Marksmen, AD Caster Marksmen and lane bully marksmen are in reasonable spots generally (some exceptions).
