The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n**Runes we&#039;re looking at**\n\nWe&#039;re working on some runes, with the goal of shipping some changes during preseason. Run through of what we&#039;re trying below:\n\nChanges we&#039;re pretty confident in\n\n* Dark Harvest - Triggers when you damage a champion below 50% health, dealing bonus damage. Damage increases each time its triggered. Long ish (45s right now) CD&gt;\n\n Makes it more of a finisher, reducing power as poke or genuine one shot (single attack/ability) rune, since it can&#039;t trigger on healthy targets. Keeps its stacking nature as a point of difference from other damage runes.\n\n* Overgrowth - Gives flat HP per X nearby deaths, with an additional % HP boost after a certain flat HP total has been earned.\n\nShould be more appealing to a wider range of users, rather than just HP stackers as per the current % increase only. In retrospect we over corrected for this looking too appealing to everyone during Runes original development. Should help Resolve be a more attractive secondary tree as a result. Mixture of flat and % HP helps us tune for a wider range of different users.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges we&#039;re not yet as confident in (need more discussion and testing)\n\n* Bone Plating - Potential Removal \n\nBone Plating&#039;s a really strong Rune, even if it&#039;s not always recognized as such. It also demands more attention than we think&#039;s generally appropriate for a regular rune, given both user and opponent(s) in lane should be tracking its CD.\n\n* Shield Bash - New Resolve rune that makes your next basic attack when you&#039;ve got a shield deal bonus damage, based off your health and the shield amount. \n\nWe want Resolve to be a tree that offers both survivability and gives you other benefits based off your defensive stats (Demolish being a good existing example). Shield Bash is an exploration into that, with champs who get shields, whether from their kit, allies or items, being a broad enough pool to offer a moderate sized user base for a Rune. Still looking in particular into how to split power between offensive and defensive effects (e.g. how much should Shield Bash increase shield amount versus deal damage?). \n\n* Klepto - Changes to make it useful to a wider audience and less mandatory on Ezreal\n\nMight just involve changing CD, drop rate etc. Might also involve larger changes to how you trigger it, rewards given as well. Still pretty experimental and changing rapidly, hence nothing on the PBE yet.\n\n* Celerity - Amplifies other movement speed boosts, instead of providing some constant MS and damage off MS\n\nLooking to make it more of a choice, less general power, particularly less of a general damage contribution. Not sure yet if increasing the power of other hastes gives us sufficient balancing levers for best case users versus others (e.g. if balanced for Rammus, Hecarim etc is it just terrible on almost everyone else?)\n\n* Chrysalis - Assessing if still needed\n\nWe originally added Chrysalis to open up the Resolve tree to a wider audience. At the time the trade off in going Resolve was pretty steep for some users, given the forced HP from tree stats. We wanted to offer a mixed early defense/later offense option to help with that. Given there&#039;ll be freedom to pick your stats from preseason onwards however that need&#039;s reduced a lot. Going to reassess Chrysalis as a result. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n\n**Yorick in 8.21**\n\n\nWe&rsquo;ve seen Yorick&rsquo;s winrate drop dramatically in 8.21 off no major gameplay changes.  In cases like this that often means a newly introduced pretty impactful bug. That seems particularly likely given we rescripted some of how Yorick&rsquo;s ult works behind the scenes this patch to fix some other issues, so something unintended could have occured during that work. Looking into what&rsquo;s going on there right now it seems like there&rsquo;s probably a bug with his ghoul&rsquo;s damage in some circumstances. Aiming to get that hotfixed as soon as possible, though not quite sure at time of writing when that will be. Might be done already by the time this is posted, if not hopefully later today. \n\nEdit since time of writing: Got hotfixed yesterday afternoon. Was an issue where summoning the Maiden would reset his ghouls's to their level 1 values instead of being properly based off Yorick's level.\n\n \nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2018-10-26T16:15:54.471+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can you still stack overgrowth after getting the % hp boost or is it over past that point?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-10-26T16:23:42.565+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Keeps stacking, just an extra one time bonus for breaking that threshold.","replies":[{"poster":"WiccanBKaplan","date":"2018-10-26T16:26:22.176+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"EXTRA BONUS ONE TIME BONUS COME GET YOUR BONUS","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-10-26T16:31:03.453+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ah, yeah, I'm bad with words sometimes.

I get that you don't want to validate bad behavior, but letting it fester doesn't seem much better. \n\nKatarina's a good example here. I don't play her post-rework, but I've watched frustration and anger fester in that community from lack of meaningful engagement about that champ. When they brigaded a few months back, it was a last-ditch act of desperation.

I've played a bit of Wukong in the jungle, and while I'm not high elo, I agree that he feels good to play, other than his rank 1 Q. However I understand that his Q is a big part of what causes his burst to be too high and can see why he'd be difficult to balance, he has a very binary kit. I noticed you did not mention his top performance, do you think Wukong should now be played in jungle / mid more so than jungle / top? I've never played him top or mid, so I'm just curious on where you think he should land. \n\nAlso, I totally get not answering certain posts which didn't really create a discussion or posts that were unfairly downvoted. \n\nOnce again, thanks for your response. I don't want to bombard you with too many questions in a single post, but if there's any new plans for him (a new passive, I see the new spear item might be useful on him), that'd be cool to know as well.

(main burst is his e-auto-q-elec-duskblade combo).\n\nIf you check the season 1 spotlight it looks like he was designed to be a triforce bruiser but he really really doesn't fit that, and cannot. \n\nMy fellow wukong mains will probably disagree with me on the fact that the ultimate should be changed, but if that prevents him to become healthier overall in any given situation (his early game and splitpushing abilites), there's gonna be a time when it'll have to be changed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DontKillMySoraka","date":"2018-10-26T17:03:26.665+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another topic:\n\nAn idea for Kleptomancy:\n\nLet's make it like Gangplank passive, that you need to do a REAL auto-attack unlike Ezreal Q, Fiora Q etc. Then you can buff the Keystone again that characters like Sona can pick it again.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BobaFlautist","date":"2018-10-26T18:22:03.203+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any thoughts about just lowering Wukong's numbers across the board?\n\nAs in less damage, lower mana costs and cooldowns - I'm not Wukong main, but he's the funnest to play when you're relatively durable and get to use multiple e-q-w combos to weave in and out of a fight and just generally feel like an obnovioud trickster.

I still think the stacking mechanic should be changed, either to have a hard cap that is realisitic to reach even in bad matchups.

The second is that it does not give waveclear.  The third is that its AD bonus works against towers, which titanic doesn't.  The final is that the bonus damage from health granted by Titanic doesn't affect ability damage, only autos.\n\nAs a juggernaut splitpush top lane player these differences are really massive for me.  I think that titanic does have a place on champions like Shen for example, but there are many places where Atma's could really shine as an alternative.  Take for example Illaoi, against tanks Black Cleaver is a superb buy, giving you CDR, damage, and health.  Illaoi has more than enough waveclear, and I would argue that she doesn't auto enough to make good use of titanic.  Thus Illaoi would like Atma's but not titanic.  On the flip side you have a champion like Shen that doesn't have any AD scalings on his abilities, and lacks waveclear, making him a perfect candidate for titanic, but not a great user of Atma's.\n\nThe Atma's users don't stop at Illaoi though, champions like Darius, Urgot, Yorick, Nasus, and Aatrox would be great users of Atma's, given most juggernauts generally have better waveclear or don't value it as highly like Nasus or the current iteration of Trundle.  As a final note it would allow champions like Sion and Warwick to double down on the AD + Health stacking niche by taking items like Cinderhulk with Titanic and Atma's.\n\nStill not convinced?  Let's look at the other item being added, Spear of Shojin.  What's looking to be added by Shojin?  Teamfighting survivability for relatively high damage squishy fighters or assassins like Xin, Jax, Fiora, Pyke, or Talon.  I would argue that we already have an item intended for this purpose, it's called death's dance.  The mechanism is slightly different, but the goal is identical, the higher your offenses the harder you get to kill.  In addition it even provides CDR too!  If any item is redundant it's Shojin, not Atma's, and if Atma's isn't being added for this reason there's definitely no reason to add Shojin.  That said I do support both items be added since I enjoy diversity and creativity and I think that providing players with more things to think about and more options is rarely a bad choice.\n\nWith all that being said I can understand that there are other reasons for not adding Atma's to the game, but the stated reason of too much overlap is bullshit.

It was pretty clear that he preferred a system that offered finetuning on 60 points.\n\nI'm pretty sure, that he wouldn't mind, if Riot went back to something like the old system, but DID allow changing in champ select (Now feasible, since we have extra time for it).\n\nI also feel certain, that the OP wouldn't have any objection to unlimited free Rune pages, just as we had been given unlimited free Mastery pages.\n\nThese aren't the points that people are referring to, when they express dissatisfaction with Runes Reforged.

Champion balance is usually the #1 culprit, though there are exceptions (especially if you include bugs/glitches). Think about it, there are VERY few circumstances where a rune can decide the fate of a game. There are PLENTY of circumstances where champion stats/kits decide the fate of a game. Jax taking Grasp vs Electrocute does not completely change how you play (at least optimally). Jax with Electrocute vs Bard with Electrocute are massively different, and both have very different playstyles. So the statement that Runes Reforged is the cause of gameplay issues is grossly incorrect.\n\nSecondly, and this is somewhat related to the first point, where is the group of people that want Runes Reforged reverted? Are they hiding in some shady underground city where they are scared to voice their opinions? Have they been all kidnapped by Riot to suppress their outcries?\n\nI have seen people complain about specific runes, but that is like saying old runes and masteries had no problems too. Granted old runes and masteries weren't balanced much during later seasons compared to new runes but that is because they were not nearly as strong, and thus had way less agency in game.\n\nSo no, both of your claims have little basis in reality. Acting like old runes and masteries is better than new runes is more a statement about how you don't like it when things change. Welcome to League, things change. Get over it.","replies":[{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2018-10-27T03:22:46.532+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I see it everywhere.

Not only are you shafting junglers super hard but you're turning a late game oriented rune into mostly just a snowball feast/famine rune since you can't play intelligently to get stacks when behind (souls from teammates or farming jg/lane in the few areas of the map you can still control). \n\nEven if you reach late game in a one-sided game with this new rune, it will do nothing for you since you won't really have stacks. It's not about risk vs reward. It's just luck.\"oh my team's ahead from dicerolling a good SQ team and now I snowball and easily farm stacks so the enemy team can suffer even more\" or \"oh I have no lanes so I can't do anything this game and also can't scale even if I reach late game because \"getting stacks\" would mean dying non-stop.\"\n\nMoreover, the current DH is a great teamfight rune due to the sources of stacks. This new one is much less oriented this way despite the takedown reset. It's not a replacement. It's an entirely different purpose and style. Junglers need a rune too (for more than a pure early play style) and it's not at all fair for jungle players to be treated as second class citizens when it comes to runes. \n\nI also think it's going to be way more frustrating to face. Just when I think I will live, their new DH damage + assassin execute abilities surprises me at sub 50%. Just why ruin a good rune with some actual planning and thinking behind it only to replace it with something so devoid of mastery expression. It's literally nothing more than \"extra damage for being you\". \n\nI also see some curious comments about this rune and jungling, such as this one from Riot Rovient:\n\n> You gank lanes you feel you have a good chance of killing, right? They'll have to be under 50% HP in order to kill them or even force a flash in most cases.\n\nLooking for lanes to be low is NOT how you jungle at all. Even WW mains don't play like this. Ganks involve countless factors and HP is only one of many. Usually, you will be ganking based on pathing gold efficiency if opportunities turn up. However, you are primarily thinking about matchups, win conditions (can this lane carry the game? can they be useful if behind or are they feast/famine? etc.), wave positioning, summoner spells, VIDION, kit considerations such as escapes and the CDs of those etc. Most of the lanes a good jungler ganks are not going to be low HP. That's not the primary determinant of whether or not a gank is smart.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BobaFlautist","date":"2018-10-26T16:05:08.252+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=zpaM5Ki1,comment-id=001d0000,timestamp=2018-10-05T17:14:07.263+0000)\n>\n> Hmm, lemme see if that&#x27;s data we can easily pull and share or not.
