The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**Clash**\r\n\r\nThe recent test in Korea went well. Still on track as hoped towards the Global Beta later in the year as a result. Next up we've got some testing in a couple of regular sized regions, with EU West as a bit of a pre global beta miniboss to beat on the horizon.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------         \r\n**State of the Pro Meta going into Worlds**\r\n\r\nThe next patch (9.19) is the one Worlds will be using. We'll be making some individual champ adjustments to outliers in it but aren't going to be doing anything that should majorly shake things up. We believe the pro meta's in a really good state overall, including state of game pacing and early conflict. Very excited to see what the clash of different regions in Worlds brings as a result.\r\n\r\nSome possible champs for small scale balance changes in 9.19 below. This isn't a list of champs definitely getting buffed or nerfed it's a list of champs we're currently assessing. Likely some get removed, possibly one or two get added.\r\n\r\nBuffs: Ashe, Blitzcrank, Cassiopeia, Fiora, Graves, Heimerdinger, Mordekaiser, Orianna, Ornn, Rek'Sai, Riven, Sion, Twisted Fate, Vayne, Veigar, Xin Zhao, Zac\r\n\r\nNerfs: Gragas, Karma, Sejuani, Sylas, Tahm Kench, Yuumi, \r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------         \r\n**TFT PVE Drops**\r\n\r\nSo far we think the revised PVE drop system in TFT is showing good promise but also needs some polishing. We believe it's doing a good job of reducing unfairness (mainly) while keeping a lot of variance of game experience. We're looking at adjustments to things like Spatula drop rate, how early players can get 4 cost units, whether we're now injecting a bit too much gold into the system, where on the battlefield drops fall etc. Expect to see changes to address a range of issues in 9.19 as a result. If there are particular issues you're feeling with the changes now's the ideal time to talk about them in terms of our ability to implement and test changes for the next patch.\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Rouge","date":"2019-09-13T16:16:50.148+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"What is the direction of the {{champion:43}} nerfs?

If thats the case, give her a new reincarnation. Being one of the first to get a new visual update, at the time she fit. Now since League has changed so much and newer champions with complex kits have emerged-- accompanied by improvements to tech-- she needs a new coat of paint with those improvements; instead of constantly tweaking numbers or just removing something. \n\nGo back to the drawing board and decide on what you want her to be. Is she going to be a Mage main who can support? Just a support? What? As of now, she does multiple things, but never fully exceeds in anything and late game always reduces her to just being a shield bot. I main her for years, even before she was now noticed again by pro play. Even when she was literally forgotten or got unnecessary kit removals. I'm kinda annoyed that everything in League is centered around pros who just pick a champ because they found an edge and will quickly dump them once an unqualified nerf takes away that 'edge'. \n\nFrom her lore, to her looks, to her gameplay-- its dated. Whats worse is the fact that other champions disregard her. Irelia talks down to her. Akali threatens to kill her. If she is supposed to be this regal well known inspirational leader of Ionia, her kit needs to show that. Her interactions need that too.\n\nTL;DR: Who is Karma? What exactly is she supposed to be?

Irelia, Akali, Sejuani, Yuumi, Aatrox, Azir...the list goes on and on. Are they just going to continue to be \"champions you hope never to see on your team\"? Or will something be done to get them to 49.5%-50.5% in solo queue play? I'm not just talking about average tier here. I'm talking about the fact that LOLalytics has Irelia at below 47% winrate pretty consistently in **DIAMOND** and higher, worldwide, when it's generally a really, really bad thing when a champion drops below 49% win rate unless they're extremely popular.\n\nYou can't possibly make the argument of \"we're happy where &lt;> is\" when they have such awful winrates that nobody trying to climb would ever want to see them on their team.\n\nConsidering how often Riot says \"this is a pro-play nerf\", what about the opposite of that, which is a \"solo-queue focused buff\"?  \n\nThat is, can we please get an acknowledgement that other individuals (in fact, the *vast majority* of individuals) besides the 300 or so pro players globally play this game, and that they should also be able to play champions they want to, as opposed to being essentially forbidden from playing champions so undertuned because a few teams play under exceptionally coordinated circumstances that solo queue players generally can't?","replies":[]},{"poster":"xox BaByDoLL xox","date":"2019-09-14T01:40:55.360+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would genuinely love to know why you guys refuse to touch one of the more broken champs in the game - Pyke.\nEasily S+ OP status as a \"support\", insane gold in-come and isn't nearly punished enough for bad engages. You have mediocre players playing Pyke and getting a MUCH higher value on him than a really good player would get on the majority of the other champs in the game - yet alone supports who don't have hooks.\n\nThese Yuumi nerfs are harsh, but fine imo since she's a support - not a solo laner or ADC, but what I don't understand is why you nerf her and others repetitively and desperately try to bring her to a proper status as a support (aka, not able to assist but so-much in kills), a champ that isn't S+, S, or even A tier in most ranks and has a crap win rate.....but you continuously let pyke skate.....a champ that's not S, but S+ tier, and absurdly popular because of how cheap and powerful he is right now.\n\nI don't understand the logic. You keep nerfing Akali into the ground, yet Pyke skates. LOGIC?\nAlso, some of the other buffs going on.....it really does seem like you are indeed playing favorites. I try to ignore people saying it's favoritism and bias, or that you guys purposely are trying to push certain champs into play at Worlds, and give you guys the benefit of the doubt..... but I'm running out of reasons for a lot of the balance changes you guys are making.....there is literally no other reason to keep letting pyke skate...\n\nAnd what's bad about champs like Pyke being in the shape he is, is that you have mediocre players thinking they're really good...and this goes on for too long....and then when the busted champ they main is brought down to where they need to be, the player gets frustrated because suddenly they're not doing good anymore.\nI personally know people who main Pyke and do fantastic on him but literally are mediocre af on nearly every other champ and can seemingly not do well bot support without a hook, and even then it's not nearly as good as they do on pyke. I also had an Akali main friend that thought they were so good until she got the hammer and now won't touch her, or the game, because they're mad that they can't do as well. That's a problem, and the longer you let it go on the longer you screw with people's progression/gameplay experience.\nThing is, you guys are at least dealing with Akali over and over and over again, but Pyke keeps sliding under the radar...","replies":[{"poster":"Squii","date":"2019-09-19T20:21:16.944+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Triples gold income through an ability that doesn't even need to get last hit (hey guys let's just take Darius' ult and make it a Fisher Price babbie version) with an also large re-cast window, hand-holding regen that lets you position without a brain and not get punished, throw some invisibility in because why not its season 9","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Squii","date":"2019-09-13T20:18:03.650+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"We'll be making some individual champ adjustments to outliers in it but aren't going to be doing anything that should majorly shake things up.\"\n\n*proceeds to slaughter Karma's core ability*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hadriel","date":"2019-09-13T16:47:34.279+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why nerf Karma when she doesn't meet any of the nerf criteria you guys outlined for nerfs?

And picks like cait and kaisa have extreme offensive and defensive utility compared to her and still do not suffer damage penalties for it.\n\nHere are some current qol suggestions/fixes for ashe which would give her more options/effectiveness without hard buffing numbers:\n\n* Fix the q buff running out interrupting your current auto attack. \n\n* Allow guinsoo's rageblade to grant extra stacks of focus for q. Kai'sa is allowed to double dip on rageblade with her passive damage+execute as well as e cooldown, kind of a large power differential there.\n\n* Q stacks (not the active) being refreshed by ability usage like jhin 4th shot.\n\n* Add the true auto reset back to q.\n\n* Allow Q to stack on turrets. Like caitlyn headshot.\n\n* There is currently a bug on her w that reveals her in fog when she uses it - I have footage and will provide it when ready, but it is pretty straightforward to replicate. The ability is treated as a single target ability due to it only dealing a single instance of damage to each target regardless of how many arrows hit it. Therefor revealing her when it will done (it reveals her if they are in the aoe and leave) or has done damage.\n\n* Buff q dps somehow it's super weak\n\n* Buff passive crit scaling in compensation for ie nerf.\n\n* I have been having to take fleet+approach velocity to actually be able to kite/chase people properly due to the movement creep. I do not know what can be done to fix this outside of buffing ashe's base movespeed from 325 to 330 or 335 like kaisa, especially given kaisa has way more tools to help with her positioning.\n\nHere are some other qol which would be great for the champion but are probably considered larger scope changes.\n\n* Allow e to be cast while moving\n\n* Lower/remove the mana cost on her q, a mana cost can be added to e (as it does not have one) or w cost made to scale up a little in return.\n\n* Make e reveal stealthed/camouflaged champions in the explosion radius.\n\n* Add knock-down to her ultimate so that she can freeze enemy dashes reactively - it is described as a knockdown on the wiki but it does not in fact interrupt dashes.\n\n* Q given a bonus attack speed scaling like varus passive or allowing it to break the attack speed cap.\n\nThis is the original post these were taken from: https://www.reddit.com/r/AsheMains/comments/anblfn/ashe_really_needs_some_modernization_to_keep_up/\n\nAlso please consider reverting lissandra q nerf, her main community has died out so hard because the cooldown change ruined all of her all in combos and snowball potential for higher damage builds.","replies":[{"poster":"Squii","date":"2019-09-13T20:15:11.113+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree with this entire post, so many big changes and mobility powercreep happening with every patch and new champ that there's always someone left behind with more risk and less reward.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"evilsforreals","date":"2019-09-13T17:58:39.420+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is Karma being moved into purely support?

Maybe not like zoe, but i would add at least a 150-170% modifier to the base damage. (Right now a maxed out Q is a meme, you will never hit any mobile or immobile champ, it works only in ARAM, and if you hit congratulation, you stunned ppl for a short amount of time and healed them).\n- Also the Q 20% mov speed is cool, but you'll still go slower than the old 10% with E passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bliss Ocean","date":"2019-09-13T16:56:08.111+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Any planned changes for {{item:3303}} and the ~~Midlane Rejects~~ aka {{champion:63}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:101}}  who ruin bot lane as supports.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PowerOfDrainAge","date":"2019-09-13T15:50:59.602+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"For Xin Zhao, could you please not make utility buffs on a champion that used to be a carry duelist at the lvl of Jax?
