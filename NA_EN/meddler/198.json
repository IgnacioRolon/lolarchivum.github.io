The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Life of a Patch**\r\n\r\nNow that we're through the 9.13 development cycle we're reflecting on how the Life of a Patch project went. We should have some thoughts on that and a recap early July. If you're not sure what I'm talking about details can be found here:\r\nhttps://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2019/06/join-us-for-a-patch-cycle/\r\nTLDR is a lot of people who worked on the Summoner's Rift team for 9.13 tweeting a lot of details about the patch's development.\r\n\r\nFor those of you that followed Life of a Patch in detail, also very curious as to how you found the experience?\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Some early observations on 9.13 champ changes so far**\r\n\r\nJust looking at day 1 states here:\r\n\r\n* J4, Kennen and Trynd were rescripted so their AOE abilities would be more responsive. At the same time they unintentionally also had the way the radius on those AOEs is calculated changed. That resulted in a increase of around 50 units on each spell adding significant unintended power. That should be hotfixed already by the time this post goes out. We'll then see how they're looking power wise, including whether the extra responsiveness added significant strength to them or was mainly just a feel improvement.\r\n* Diana's also looking much stronger in 9.13. At time of writing it's not clear why, given we weren't expecting any of the changes to her Q to add significant power. Suspicious there's a bug in there somewhere, doing some digging into her scripts as a result.\r\n* Sona - Statistically is down in power pretty much exactly as much as hoped on average. Not yet clear how much Sona + a tanky support (most often Taric) is performing though. Power of support Sona still looks ok so hoping we don't need to make any further changes.\r\n* Pyke - Changes have narrowed the difference between his support and solo lane performance substantially as hoped. We don't want to put support Pyke in a terrible spot by balancing around solo Pyke and also feel some of what the 9.12 version of solo Pyke at least was able to do wasn't good for game health (lack of sufficiently exploitable weaknesses/inappropriate combination of strengths).\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Wukong Update**\r\n\r\nThanks again for all the feedback on the Wukong update that's been in testing on the PBE, it's been really helpful in making a call on what to do with that project. We will be going ahead with those changes, likely with some changes from exactly what was on the PBE and certainly with some further balance adjustments. Not sure on timeframe yet, that's mainly going to be determined by availability of artist time to work on some new visual effects, maybe an animation or two and some revised sound effects.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Tahm Kench**\r\n\r\nWe've got some work underway on TK changes for 9.14. Focus on those is more on reducing frustration playing against him than just balance adjustments, frustration in top lane especially. A key part of the direction we're currently exploring is reducing his ability to repeatedly CC the same target.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Safe ranged champs in top lane**\r\n\r\nSpeaking of top lane we're also doing some work on a few champs who sometimes go top bringing a combination of powerful AA based damage output and good disengage. Current list is Kennen, Jayce and Neeko, with changes aimed at lowering their early damage output, giving them some more scaling instead and adding a bit more risk to their laning patterns.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Teamfight Tactics**\r\n\r\nThanks for the patience with some challenges we're having with TFT's initial release. We've got a lot of work on things like login queues, server load etc underway and realize it can be really frustrating if you're in one of the regions that's got an overloaded server at present. We'll keep you folks in the loop whenever we've got updates to share.\r\n\r\nGameplay wise thanks for all the feedback so far. There are a lot of things we're working on adding or refining further (e.g. a lot of UI improvements that many of you have suggested). We're aiming to have a lot of improvements in 9.14 and each of the patches beyond it. \r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Dr40UR","date":"2019-06-28T17:26:13.787+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just a question, is there any chance that you guys are looking at changing the random items from minions in TFT?

Is there any chance that can get changed?

Examples of that in other genres are things like starting hand in Magic/Hearthstone, what you draw in poker, early loot in a Battle Royale etc. Playing from positions of strength or weakness result in a wider variety of experiences.\n\nOn this note -- a solid argument could be made that in Battle Royale games every weapon leads into my playsytle of \"use gun, kill opponent\" and in Magic/Hearthstone my cards -- even if they're bad -- are still from the deck I've built and thus applicable to the strategy I'm aiming for. While you can get a better/worse hand, I know my deck and my cards, so I can make reasonable predictions about the strategy to take.\n\nIn TFT my items acquisition is random, yes -- but so are the items I get (which may or may not synergize well with my team) *and* the champions I have available. Perhaps I haven't played the mode enough, but I feel the card game or poker parallels don't fit especially well, as in every one of those games mentioned there is a single random factor that is leading into other predictable and non-random systems. If items only dropped early (so you have to adapt to the items you have) or similar I think there'd be a good argument to make, but the fact that both champions AND items can randomly pop up things that so dynamically alter your strategy even into the mid/late game is...perhaps a little more subject to randomness?\n\nMaybe I haven't played it enough, but as someone who likes the RNG of card games, poker, etc, this feels a little heavy even then. It feels kind of like having my deck change in *addition* to a random starting hand when playing magic, which would make it difficult to play the game proactively.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreaktastic","date":"2019-07-01T16:09:10.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% this.\n\nComparing to MTG/HS is absolutely not a realistic comparison. You build your decks in MTG/HS. The ONLY random factor is draw order at that point. You can compare the champ pool to MTG/HS, but you cannot compare random item quantities and random item rolls to this. Items are another layer of RNG entirely.\n\nComparing to poker is also unrealistic. Poker isn't even about the cards you get. This is why pro players will often make remarks about being able to tell a rookie from a pro because they're so concerned with statistical probabilities and such. At the end of the day, poker is about plays, not the cards in your hand. Even if we strip that element entirely, once again, champions can be compared to poker due to the element of being dealt random \"cards\", and drawing from the same pool as other players. Items simply cannot be compared to poker.\n\nThere are multiple facets of RNG in TFT. If we're going to model TFT after poker/MTG/HS then one layer of RNG would be ideal (champion pools), and stripping the amount of items from RNG would be necessary. For example, always getting one item from clearing a camp (could even leave the item roll random as that could still be attributed to capitalizing on what you get). That's the only way a comparison to said card games could possibly be even remotely close to accurate. That, or stop using poker/MTG/HS as a reference as it is completely invalid with the layers of RNG we witness in TFT.\n\nA more accurate comparison would be a new version of poker. In this new version of poker, there is a whole new set of attributes which are dealt to some players at random. Attributes can be applied to any card, and raise a card's \"value\" or numerical representation for trumping purposes. Your Ace only trumps a King and lower if said card doesn't have an attribute applied to it which increases its value to be above an Ace's value. A flush/straight/pair/etc is worth its inherent value, plus the value of any attributes on the cards. Of course, there are still more layers in TFT due to upgrades, champ tiers, etc. However, this is still more accurate as a comparison to the core of both games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2019-06-28T18:41:26.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe riot is thinking of it as something like sealed deck in Magic: the loot boxes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akumu","date":"2019-06-29T00:36:39.143+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=EbZiPqnj,comment-id=00200000,timestamp=2019-06-28T17:53:45.009+0000)\n>\n> We're talking about possible tweaks to TFT item distribution.

Hearthstone\nRNG makes Hearthstone an extremely unfun game in the long run. Yes getting crazy RNG is fun for a few games or for that one crazy moment every one in a while , but eventually it becomes extremely frustrating and unfun. Its frustrating because you are winning or losing entirely based on something out of your control. Even for casual players, for whom RNG mechanics are usually tailored because they dont need skill to win, get sick of RNG eventually.\nI dont think its a coincidence that Hearthstone is on sharp decline and RNG has increased in the game substantially since release.\n\n2. Poker\nThis example is straight up apples and oranges. What you draw in your first  hand in poker doesnt completely screw you over for the rest of the game or otherwise automatically win you the game in most cases. Meanwhile in TFT if i get screwed on items early im literally screwed for the entire game. I might be able to make it to mid game with decent champ RNG but late game against someone who got 3 items when i got 0 my chances of winning are exactly 0.\n\n3. Battle Royale.\nEarly game RNG in BR can be negated or minimized through skill. The person with the better aim can still win with a worse gear. Moreover you can employ certain tactics to minimize the effect of RNG such as not hot dropping or running from early fights. \nThere is no expression or skill or use of tatics that can minimize it in TFT in the same way.\n\nYour premise that randomness is pretty valuable for the longevity of the game is false and the opposite is true. Randomness is 'fun' initially but then quickly becomes frustrating as you lack proper skill expression and wins are determined by luck alone. Furthermore developers use of RNG to entice casuals is only a short term boost to the game and enjoyment. Casuals lack skill but RNG allows them to win and feel good about themselves and playing the game. If they stick with the game and become better they will only become more and more frustrated potentially quitting entirely.\n\n RNG is also bad  for hardcore and skilled players because its not only not about being skilled its not even about being smart because luck trumps both. Game developers are short sighted  by adding heavy RNG elements to their games because the initial interest and numbers are not sustainable. Perhaps intentionally if the goal is just to make some quick cash with a temporary boost of players until they release their next game. Its hardcore players that keep games alive, thriving and and relevant, but you're not going to keep them around long if skill means nothing.\n\nTFT tactics is fun but I know ill drop the game fairly soon for the same reasons i stopped playing Hearthstone. Even not taking the game super seriously you can only lose so many times to things completely out of your control before you become sick of it.

While there are some great options for Mordekaiser, the pool of choices is somewhat limited, as I am sure Riot is well aware.\n\nMy questions relating to this: Are there any internal discussions occurring about new/reworked itemization for AP Bruisers/Juggernauts?  Second, if so, can you give us a sense of what sorts of items or abilities you are thinking about?  If not, is there a specific reason (balancing, resources, ect...) that this not occurring?  Finally, have their been any discussions internally about taking current items (Lets say Spear of Shojin for example) and making the stats it provides Adaptive?\n\nFor context, part of the reason I am asking this is a sort of followup to other discussions being had about champion diversity in roles.  There are a number of champions who, by virtue primarily of itemization, could play as bruisers/juggernauts top or mid, but cannot at this time.  I am wondering if perhaps the lack of itemization is, in fact, deliberate so as to keep certain champs out of these lanes so as not to throw things too wildly out of wack.\n\nI look forward to your thoughts, if you decide to provide them!\n\nRegards,\nTarcathos","replies":[]},{"poster":"JungglerBook","date":"2019-06-28T16:47:30.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey @Meddler.
