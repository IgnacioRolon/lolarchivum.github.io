The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Sightstone Tweaks**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve got some somewhat experimental Sightstone adjustments that should be coming to PBE in early January. Goal there will be to make it less of a burden on supports in terms of how much it limits their ability to build/choose other items. More details and rationale to follow next month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Coming work on Kleptomancy**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSometime early next year, 8.2 most likely, we&#039;ll be doing a bit more work on how Kleptomancy procs. We want to reduce the difference between great and poor users of it somewhat so that we don&#039;t have to balance it until it&#039;s only a reasonable option for those best able to optimize it at present (mainly melee solo laners with short CDs fighting other melee, plus a couple of others like Ezreal). Might also need to drop its average power a bit too, with one of the current theories being that the amount of mana regen it offers may be a bit too high on top of the other benefits also given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore thoughts on Klepto and how this change is testing during 8.2&#039;s development in January.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Minion Dematerializer**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re also working on minion dematerializer. Timeframe on that&#039;s uncertain, with work on Klepto and a new resolve keystone taking priority. One concept we&#039;re currently trying out that sounds intriguing at least is swapping it to an item that mind controls an enemy minion, giving you the gold/XP and converting it to your side. That&#039;s very experimental, so might not go anywhere, figured it was worth sharing to give some insight into the sorts of changes we&#039;re thinking about for that slot though.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Slow down as the holidays approach**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re getting close to the end of the year, with 7.24b (that&#039;s just gone out) our last patch until January. We&#039;ll be working on stuff for 8.1 for the rest of our time in the office in December, with some changes in response to how 7.24b lands. If anything looks exceptionally out of line we&#039;ll be assessing it as a possible micropatch candidate for next week so that it&#039;s not sitting in that state for longer than a normal patch cycle over the break. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Momo Biased","date":"2017-12-15T17:03:38.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the changes to resolve, is it likely that every tree gets a new keystone at some point? \n\nThanks for this post and the new patch by the way - the micropatch has been a great way to get changes out.

Because of this, these 3 guys have been on patch notes chopping block multiple times and their balance swings like a pendulum.\n\nSo maybe, you guys should shift some resources to focus on a small restructuring of their kits, by giving them abilities, with an impact that can be measured and in turn drain the excess power from the problematic parts of their kits and leave them in a more stable condition and not have to deal with these headaches every 4 patches or so.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ThrillØfTheHunt","date":"2017-12-15T17:04:34.403+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Any news on the Rengar changes?\n\nAny plans? \n\nAny goals/hopes?\n\nSuper pumped up to find out more.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-12-15T17:11:25.764+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Details to come in January once we're more confident in exactly what we're going with.","replies":[{"poster":"ThrillØfTheHunt","date":"2017-12-15T17:47:17.719+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awww, is there nothing you can tell us at all, even what direction you want to take him in?","replies":[{"poster":"WiccanBKaplan","date":"2017-12-15T20:01:00.262+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Insert Captain America \"Patience\" Meme*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"185147118 ííí","date":"2017-12-16T03:53:37.294+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you think you or someone working on the Rengar changes could come to our subreddit to discuss with us about these changes ?

My GF&#x27;s parents are visiting for a few days for Christmas, we&#x27;ll then probably spend a bit of time elsewhere in California, get of LA at least for a bit.\n\nThe Corki nerfs seem really misguided and severe. Why attack the very thing he's picked for instead of simply making him more vulnerable in lane/to ganks? -12 AD late game is insane for an ADC. I don't see why he's getting such an undue focus... It seems like you guys were just dead set on hard nerfing him based on some assumptions about the impact of MR changes. Data such as winrate, banrate, late game performance, not picked/banned once at All Stars was hardly considered.\n\nCalling him sleeper was pretty silly given that Corki is a very old champion with a decent playrate and has a predictable kit. Champions can be sleeper when new builds have been found for them, when most of the population is unaware of certain high impact mechanics or tricks, when their skillcap is extremely high, when people don't understand how the kit works together etc. To suggest that about Corki just because the data doesn't fit the assumptions and you guys wanted to believe a 46% winrate in Diamond+ during 7.21 was \"balanced\" is just ridiculous. This nerf will probably make him subpar and right back to a 48% winrate or worse in Diamond+. \n\nHis performance is good but this nerf is incredibly harsh at all stages and eats away at his niche on a patch that already indirectly nerfs him somewhat through matchups and runes. His late game winrate for a crit. ADC isn't even good. 50.5-48.5% late game is extremely underwhelming. That should be his best stage and it's average at best - probably because most games are decided by picks from CC and not just raw damage. He has to have amazing damage scaling to make it worth sacrificing CC. If not, he needs some kind of tweak to have utility.\n\nmore explanations in the links here: https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/client-new-features-feedback/ZAm3nfAc-corki-nerfs-blow-my-mind-if-they-go-through-given-the-ample-feedback If you guys read those arguments and still have the same opinion, I'll at least be at peace and consider it a fully informed decision.","replies":[{"poster":"ßiggie Cheese","date":"2017-12-15T22:24:07.894+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright... but wrong place to post this.","replies":[{"poster":"Biffsidius","date":"2017-12-16T05:40:38.618+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seriously, let the man talk about his girlfriend.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Piltover Customs","date":"2017-12-15T17:58:58.822+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know I'm late to this, just hoping you see it.

But if that ends, he surely is top candidate.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Miku Hime sama","date":"2017-12-19T08:41:34.188+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any news on when CertainlyT will give Sona her first successful rework?","replies":[]},{"poster":"lokiemoorM","date":"2017-12-17T00:39:57.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think that the second mid tower should be more tanky. in most of the games i play the second mid tower goes right after the first one. say one team loses a fight 3 for 1. the team loses 2 towers and a lot of map pressure just for one fight. i feel like most games are decided from that point on....","replies":[]},{"poster":"GurkenatorHD","date":"2017-12-16T12:25:22.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why exactly change Minion Dematerializer this way? It was the only rune actually being focused on waveclear by getting bonus %dmg to minions over the game and while it's not frequently picked, it's maybe also because some translations of its description suck. Why would you want a rune which only allows you to kill 6 minions without actual benefits? Its a translation problem, the %dmg is missing in the short description. Also it's a niche rune, as there are only a few champions who would benefit a bit of extra waveclear. The iteration you're talking about in the post however is not a waveclear rune, it doesn't really seem like a rune you could for example pick on any actual carry. So why not just adding an extra slot to the inspiration tree with this 'mind control' rune? It could be quite useful on some tanks who already take some stuff from inspiration (Singed for example).","replies":[]},{"poster":"colesy","date":"2017-12-16T04:31:40.387+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the current dematerialiser is really good on lux right now since it allows her to reach the breaking point of damage where she's able to one shot casters so assuming you do change dematerialiser is there any way she can get little touch to her e to compensate for the loss of the rune if it ends up being changed? she feels really smooth to play for the first time in i don't even know how long and she's not exactly tearing apart solo queue or anything in her current state so i'd be sad to see her get thrown out of viability again.","replies":[]}]}
