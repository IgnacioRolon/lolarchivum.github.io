The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n**True Damage**\r\n \r\nSince we&#039;ve got a couple of new high profile sources of true damage (Conqueror and the upcoming IE change) figured it would be a good time to talk about our thinking around it.\r\n \r\nRecap:\r\n \r\n* True Damage is damage that&#039;s not reduced by Armor or MR. No other effects increase or decrease it (damage amps like Press the Attack, Damage Reduction like Alistar ult etc). It can be blocked by shields/invulnerabilities. It&#039;s usually spell damage (e.g. Cho ult that applies things like spell vamp) or proc damage (doesn&#039;t trigger most effects). \r\n \r\nWhy we use it:\r\n \r\n* On paper, true damage sounds like it&#039;s just plain better than other damage and, point for point, that&#039;s almost always true. What true damage also does however is level the playing field a lot between how effective an ability or attack is against a tanky target versus a squishy one. Defensive heavy enemies can therefore take meaningful damage without the damage in question having to be so high it&#039;s excessive against everyone else. \r\n* To give an example, let&#039;s assume two targets, one with 80 armor and one with 240. Against a physical damage hit of 600 damage the 80 armor target takes 333 damage (44% reduction). The 240 armor target takes 150 damage (75% reduction). If that&#039;s the desired contrast in damage, perfect, physical damage makes sense. Things get trickier however if you need to offer more tank killing power. Let&#039;s say for arguments sake that 250 damage against tanks is needed here for the champ in question to be effective at fighting enemy front lines. To get that using physical damage alone we&#039;d have to push damage against our squishy target up to 555. Using true damage by contrast we can drop damage against the squishy down to 250 if that&#039;s desirable, or use a partial true damage conversion if still after some difference.\r\n \r\n \r\nWhy not just use more Armor/Magic Pen?\r\n \r\n* Armor/Magic Pen also narrow that gap between squishy and tanky targets. We&#039;ve got a lot of those effects in the game too as a result and they&#039;re particularly useful when you want a mid point between &#039;equal damage to everybody&#039; and &#039;very large contrasts in how hard you hit people&#039;. \r\n* For cases where you want complete equality, full true damage is the way to go. For things like Conqueror or IE though you could accomplish the same sorts of results using % pen, rather than a partial conversion to true damage. True Damage has the benefit of being easier to understand the impact of in game though, both for the user and the victim. \r\n* For the victim, seeing physical damage of 600 points for example might suggest you should build a lot of Armor. If that damage is ignoring most of your Armor already however (e.g. GP barrels stacked with % pen or shred) building health&#039;s often going to be the better defensive choice. A partial conversion to true damage makes it clearer that that&#039;s the case by contrast. \r\n* For the applier of the True Damage benefits are a mixture of satisfaction and better understanding of the power of the effect they&#039;ve got.\r\n \r\nBut there&#039;s no counterplay to True Damage!\r\n \r\n* Item counterplay to True Damage is lower, that&#039;s true. Item options still exist though. Health and shields are the primary item responses. Depending on the circumstances though effects like Frozen Heart&#039;s Attack Speed Slow, Zhonya&#039;s invulnerability, QSS&#039;s ability to prevent getting locked down in the first place etc are still strong responses to True Damage threats.\r\n* Counterplay&#039;s also not just something that exists in the item system - there&#039;s more to it than just &#039;what item do I buy do beat this thing&#039;. Less item counterplay does mean a heavier burden on other types of counterplay though certainly, which is why we&#039;ll often use true damage particularly on melee effects and/or sustained damage, rather than ranged burst for example.\r\n \r\nFrequency of True Damage\r\n \r\n* We&#039;ve been using True Damage more than launch LoL/early seasons did. That&#039;s due to a belief on our part that it&#039;s a valuable tool for helping balance the game that was underutilized.\r\n* Shouldn&#039;t expect a constant rush of new True Damage effects though. Post Conqueror and IE we don&#039;t have anything in the pipe, at least so far, that would offer True Damage to a wide audience. Likely it crops up on some individual kits over the next year of course. At present only one of the new champs/VGUs currently in development has True Damage on their kit, possible that number changes though certainly. \r\n \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Pyke Feedback**\r\n \r\nNow that Pyke&#039;s on PBE feedback would be especially appreciated if you&#039;re playing him on a few things in particular:\r\n \r\n* How you find his performance as a support versus other positions. Pyke&#039;s got some tools (basic ability hard CCs) we don&#039;t normally allow assassins or assassin like kits. There&#039;s some risk that counterplay that&#039;s ok when he&#039;s on a lower XP and gold income as a support and needs an ally&#039;s help to get kills generally won&#039;t be appropriate if he&#039;s able to function solo \r\n* How you find the experience of playing alongside him as an ally. Particularly interested in things like whether you can understand his game plan plus how much he&#039;s roaming and how that feels.\r\n* Whether, even if he&#039;s not necessarily able to play like a true assassin, he captures the feeling of it, in particular for those of you who enjoy playing assassins and have at least some interest in playing support. \r\n* How his build paths feel, particularly given the HP to AD conversion on his passive.\r\n \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**Testing a change to tower regen**\r\n \r\nOne change that&#039;s on the PBE at present that&#039;s harder to spot is that we&#039;re testing out a change to how inhib and nexus towers regenerate health.On Live those towers regenerate some health when damaged. What we&#039;re trying is having them only regenerate health up to the next 1/3 marker on them (signaled by notches on their health bars and the damaged tower animations). A tower that&#039;s at 79% health for example will still regen up to 100%. A tower at 50% would regen to 66%. And a tower at 32% would regen to 33% etc.\r\n \r\nWe&#039;re making that change in part to open up the ways you can approach taking down a base. The full regen model makes partial sieges much lower value unless you&#039;re coming back soon. It also means split pushing against an inhib tower tends to be an all or nothing thing a lot of the time. Giving partial success cases (cool, got it below 33% even if we didn&#039;t kill it) should help out those as alternative strategies to usually just blowing through the whole tower in one go, usually as a full team.\r\n \r\n \r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Sh√≠ny","date":"2018-05-16T15:57:23.280+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":"Pyke is the first champ to have a notch on enemy healthbars to show when you can execute them, could this be added to other execute champs like urgot?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-05-16T16:11:11.646+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe.

I'd like to think thats still a valid reasoning. Darius and chogath dont get less damage by ulting a bit too early, granted everything else is equal (like stoneplating for cho or stacks for darius), while for garen it leaves a skilltest for both players (estimating damage levels). So unless there's an execute that doesnt reward on kill, but also stays the same on damage (can it even be an execute then), I dont think there's much reason to give non-rewarding executes an indicator.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Algorithmic Bias","date":"2018-05-16T16:24:42.034+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":7,"body":"{{item:3174}} Athene's gives 30AP but {{item:3108}} Codex gives 35AP.

As such, i think it's a great way to accentuate a champons kit to make big abillities target agnostic and thus feel strong and imactfull(cho and darius ult are great examples), or to Establish a champion as high threat vs targets with high defstats(Olaf, Vanye, Fiora)\nHowever, this is something that makes those champions unique, allows them to shine when picked vs target that else have high damage reduction and thus creates and identity for them.\nThe problem with IE(and also conqueror) is that it gives that to every crit user which lessens the uniques off truedamage in a champions kit and thus denies potential meaningfull design space for champs. \nHowever, the main reason why i dislike truedamage on IE is that tankiness in the late already feels very weak. ADC already often skip %pen all together in favour of more crit cause their damage vs tanks is sufficient even with out it, resulting in more damage vs squishys. With the truedamage conversion, there will be even less reason for adc to sacrifice raw damage for the %pen. Also, one of the most imprtant mechanics for tanks vs crit dps are Tabis and Randuins with their %reduction that isn't affected by arpen, while truedamage does bypass any damage reduction.\nThis is also a big issue for tank mechanics. A champ like Alistar for example relies alot on high %reduction that keeps him alive in a specific window of time. Right now, only specific champs with truedamnage in their kit can bypass that, the rest has to play around that window. With truedamage beeing more accesible for all, such tank skills that creat meaningfull gameplay through windows of power get less and less impactfull.\nThe damage conversion also causes some issues with Death's dance physical damage vamp, and i#m not 100% sure how it works with normal lifesteal.\n\n>For the victim, seeing physical damage of 600 points for example might suggest you should build a lot of Armor. If that damage is ignoring most of your Armor already however (e.g. GP barrels stacked with % pen or shred) building health's often going to be the better defensive choice. A partial conversion to true damage makes it clearer that that's the case by contrast.\nFor the applier of the True Damage benefits are a mixture of satisfaction and better understanding of the power of the effect they've got.\n\nFor me, looking at my opponents items and reacting to them is part of the game and an important skilltest, same with knowing my opponents kit and what he does. Game knowledge should be a helpfull thing and not just trivial. So GP's barrel beeing contered by health rather than armor despite doing high physical damage isn#t a clearity issue imo. It just means that you have to respect you're opponents gear and kit.\nAs for the applier, the improved statisfaction and clearity holds true for full truedamage hits like Reksais E, but on a low key damage conversion, it doesn't really bring more statisfaction than a %pen effect or any other form of damage amp, and the clearity isn't higher than on %pen. Both pretty clearly communnicate that they help dealing with high resitances. Actually, for most players i feel like they highly overate the truedamage and have difficulty understanding that only a samll % of the damage is **converted**. I often meet players that some how think 20% converted to truedamage means 20% more damage.\nPeople were expected to grasp the concept of %pen in the past, and most did, so i don't see any clearity issues that need to be adressed via truedamage here....","replies":[{"poster":"DeusVult","date":"2018-05-17T14:02:59.631+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Meddler, this ^\n\nTrue damage for the most part is balanced in that their are ways to know that it is coming and ways that the target can play around the true damage.\n\nVayne needs to land 3 autos (or 2 and E, but still 3 times) so you can play around her short range or reduce her AS.  Fiora has to hit a vital, and you can play defensively towards your vital.  Olaf generally maxes E second, so until level 10 the true damage is minimal and you can play around the CD.\nCho ult has a long CD and he has to get in melee range, while Darius needs to get stacks on you before his true damage ult is worth anything.  These are all things you can play around.  Same with Vel'Koz having to get 3 stacks, Ahris Q return, rek'sai bite needing 100 rage to deal true damage, you as the target can maneuver and play around the true damage.\n\nBut when true damage just gets added to everything it loses its measure.  Come 8.11, because I haven't seen any changes to him on PBE, tryn will deal 35% of his damage as true damage.

Zyra is very difficult for a midlaner because she requires a lot of mechanical understanding to be successful in the mid lane due to the nature of her kit, and in many ways she may be better suited to top lane, but in either case the build, itemization, and playstyle differ from her support game play.\nHave you tried her mid since the recent change to her W?

Zyra can't poke champs under tower very well because the tower just one shots the baby, so she really needs to practice active wave management because you want the enemy champ to have to wade through your babies to get CS, so you want to pull them away from their tower as best as possible without having to totally farm under tower which is simply more difficult in the mid lane due to its shortness, so you have to freeze the wave and preferably even let it come to just in front of the tower which is hard for a lot of players to get used to because they just want to push because pushing is good and forces the enemy to work for his CS, but Zyra wants to starve you of CS by forcing you to come into her territory so its a different mindset that can be difficult for people to get the hang of.\nZyra also traditionally likes very different items in the midlane because she wants extra AP ratios for more burst potential for securing kills, so she used to generally go Protobelt and Lich Bane, but now you can also add GLP and Luden's to the options thanks to their CDR. Personally I like GLP + Lich Bane on Mid lane Zyra; Anivia is the only mage with a higher AA range than Zyra's 575 and the seeds trigger Spellblade so you can proc it a lot from a farther distance than other mages and an extra 50% AP ratio is nothing to scoff at late game when it's piled in on top of her all in. The bottom line with itemization on Zyra though is that she actually has a lot of options right now, so she needs to build and play based on what she's playing into and that can be tricky to keep track of because sometimes you'll want to go with a solid burst build on Zyra for dealing with squishies and other times you may want Rylai's and/or Liandry's with Void Staff for dealing with tanks and other times you'll want a mix so she actually requires more active thought and adjustment than most people want to have to worry about.\nI agree that Zyra is almost too difficult to sell as a viable midlaner right now unless you already have lots of games on her, in which case I can tell you from personal experience she will mercilessly shit on people, but I honestly don't see how that could change without changing her too much. In order for Zyra to be on par with other midlaners she'd need more burst over sustained damage at the very least, because with her current focus on DPS through her plants there's just no way to give her more kill pressure without taking something from her sustained damage and to me that would just be wrong because it wouldn't be her. Zyra was one of the first of the Catcher subclass and so technically she's the same subclass as Blitz and the same overall class as the enchanters, and so she's always going to be weird and slightly more support oriented because she was one of the first mages to be taken into the support role back in the day and it eventually spawned a whole new subclass and playstyle. I play her in both roles and I used to jungle with her a bit but I personally prefer her as a support because I feel that it fits her better because it is the only role that is focused entirely on PvP, so she never has to worry about PvE shit like farming and she can focus entirely on being an hellacious bully %%%% to the enemy laners from level one which is what I'm all about, lol. \nI'd love to hear your take on my assessment of her mid lane game as a Zyra main, and if you haven't tried the items or playstyle I mentioned then I'd really like to hear your take on that if you'd be willing to try it out and tell me what you think; I know it works well for me and some other Zyra mains but I'd like to get your opinion on it too since you're on a different server.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vanjie","date":"2018-05-16T21:01:12.340+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [New] Nimbus Cloak (S2)\n> [Back for more testing!]\n> \n>     Takes place of The Ultimate Hat\n>     Effect:\n> \n>         \"Shortly after casting your Ultimate ability, gain a decaying movement speed increase that lasts for 3s and allows you to pass through units. \n> \n>         Increase: 100 Movement Speed\n>         Cooldown: 60s, reduced by Cooldown Reduction\"\n\n\nA serious question Meddler, why do we have another movement speed enhancing rune? Sorcery already has Phase Rush, Water Walking and now Nimbus Cloak? Don't you think it is already overloaded with watered down runes and Keystone masteries that increase movement speed? Isn't there anything else more unique and exciting you can come up with than just another movement speed enhancing mechanic in the tree? I cannot believe you are allowing this to go through.\n\nLet's also add that Fleet Footwork, Predator, Relentless Hunter, and Time Warp Tonic all increase movement speed. So every tree has one movement speed altering mechanic, but the Sorcery Tree has three now. Are you telling me the only way this tree can become relevant is if it has three movement speed altering mechanic? You really cannot come up with anything better that replaces Ultimate Hat?","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Ban Freelo ","date":"2018-05-16T20:50:00.204+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ideas of changes to Fizz?","replies":[{"poster":"FabWarlock","date":"2018-05-16T20:51:29.866+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WarVeteranDeath,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=BlxHAay0,comment-id=005a,timestamp=2018-05-16T20:50:00.204+0000)\n>\n> Ideas of changes to Fizz?\n\nAgreed.
