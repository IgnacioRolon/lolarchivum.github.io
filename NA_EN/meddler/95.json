The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Some things we&#039;ll be looking at in 8.21**\r\n\r\nNot a comprehensive list, but a few champs we already know we&#039;ll be looking at in 8.21:\r\n\r\n* Kai&#039;Sa nerf - One direction is giving her clearer weaknesses. Another is making her upgrades a bit harder to unlock, given the original intent wasn&#039;t that she&#039;d unlock all 3 this reliably.  \r\n* Tank Pyke nerf - While keeping AD Pyke around its current power level. Potentially involves some degree of kit effect changes (e.g. modifying the HP -&gt; AD effect on his passive plus additional scaling changes?)\r\n* Corki buff - Didn&#039;t make it into 8.20, aiming to have it in 8.21 as a result.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**OMW Ping improvements in 8.21**\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should also have some improvements to the OMW pings in 8.21. The big change is that the sound of the pings themselves will now communicate a couple of extra pieces of info:\r\n\r\n1. Processing applied to the sound will represent distance between the user of the ping and the pinged location. The further that distance, the more echo there&#039;ll be. Basically it&#039;s a representation of how long it&#039;ll take the pinging player to get there.\r\n2. The further the ping is from the listening player the quieter the ping will be played. If someone&#039;s pinging that they&#039;re on the way to your lane, you&#039;ll hear a loud ping. If they&#039;re pinging they&#039;re on their way to the other side of the map, it&#039;ll be comparatively quiet. \r\n\r\nWe&#039;ll also be putting a chat notification of the OMW ping being used back in team chat. Looks like that got accidentally broken at some point when this approach was being developed. \r\n \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------         \r\n**Why we don&#039;t use adaptive effects in game**\r\n\r\nSince we added both adaptive damage and adaptive stats to the pre-game with Runes the question&#039;s naturally been raised as to why we&#039;re not using them in game as well. Things like why not have items just grant Adaptive AP/AD so more champs can use them, or having damage on champ abilities or from items change types to be more optimal all the time. Some thoughts on why we haven&#039;t been doing that below.\r\n\r\n* Adaptive Damage\r\n\r\nBy which we mean damage that can change its type. Easy example being Arcane Comet, which deals magic damage when you&#039;re building AP and physical damage when you&#039;re building AD. With Runes we were almost always aiming to design effects that could be  added on to any damage pattern. Offering the damage type that would make sense with the sort of pen you were likely to build was more appropriate as a result. That also means it&#039;s easier to pick defensive options against a specific champion, since their pregame damage contributions will generally be matching their kit damage type.\r\n\r\nFor in game effects by contrast our concern is that adaptive damage makes it much harder to predict what sort of damage you&#039;ll be facing and therefore purchase/play against it. LoL&#039;s got a lot of champ abilities and other damage sources already to understand/track, so making it so you also need to assess someone&#039;s build all the time to understand whether an ability has flipped damage type is something we generally want to avoid. Possible we might make the occasional exception, especially if it&#039;s a strong fit with a champion&#039;s theme and really well communicated through art/audio etc, but even then would expect it to be a rare thing if done at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Adaptive Stats on items etc (or abilities that scale with either stat)\r\n\r\nAs in stats that just give you whichever you scale best with of AP/AD/whatever. Again with Runes we wanted things to be really open, particularly to avoid having to make additional runes that were basically just duplicates with different scaling. With items by contrast there are quite a lot of cases where limiting the pool of users can be really important, particularly from a game health perspective. Which stats an item offers is a really good way to skew its value towards different users it&#039;s intended to serve well (e.g. pushing Zhonya&#039;s towards primarily mages and other heavy AP users, or skewing Black Cleaver towards health so we can keep it in a good spot for juggernauts and other tankier fighters). Additionally items changing which stats they offer also contributes to difficulty understanding and reacting to enemy damage output, especially if it flips back and forth during the game. We&#039;ve been very hesitant about adaptive stats in game as a result, given the degree to which that would privilege offense over defense, unless making defensive stats adaptive as well. There are some cases where it might be a useful tool (e.g. opening up the Spellthief&#039;s line to AD users). Possible we do use it a bit in circumstances like that at some point, also might just solve the issue in other ways though (offering other power rather than AD or AP specifically). \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Nope","date":"2018-10-05T16:26:32.279+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mention clearer weaknesses for Kai'sa.

FIX HIM...  Revert the nerfs, you guys already nerfed Items and Runes he didn't deserve actual ability nerfs he's been unchanged for over 6 seasons now. The Items and Nerfs were the problems you guys did the monkey dirty. FIX WUKONG. GIVE HIM ATTENTION ALREADY STOP IGNORING","replies":[{"poster":"KÍNGKØNG","date":"2018-10-05T17:07:19.103+0000","up_votes":76,"down_votes":14,"body":"There are many reasons Wukong needs a straight up rework, so ill put it in an organised list:\n\nPassive - Wukong's passive is incredibly boring and dull, it basically gives you MR and Armour depending on the amount of champions in Wukong's vicinity. It has no interactivity and it is bad, nobody even thinks about this passive when they are playing the game. At max level, the passive gives 40 MR and Armour when surrounded by 5 enemy champions. Sounds good right? NO. This passive gives absolutely no benefit to Wukong because of the way his kit is built.\n\nRole - What is Wukong? Is he a tank? An assassin? A bruiser? I have over 1 million Mastery points and have hit Master multiple times and I still have no idea. 99% of games building full AD is the only option, as building tank items means you have no damage, whereas champions like darius/renekton/irelia can build tank items and still be a massive damage threat. Also, even though Wukong has a garbage 'tank' passive, his natural bulk is incredibly low in comparison to other champions who fill his 'role'. This makes you a \"one shot the ADC\" champion which other champions who build semi-tank can do too.\n\nLaning Phase - Oh boy, this is the one that makes me SO salty. Despite popular belief at low elo, Wukongs laning phase is UTTER TRASH. Almost every top lane matchup is \"try to farm and go neutral so you can do something after laning phase\". Its boring, Wukongs kit doesn't have the skill factor that champions like Riven and Fiora have, which leaves you NO room to outplay your counters. Lets take Darius for example, a classic Wukong counter. To trade with Wukong you need to put yourself inside enemy minions with your E, and to avoid taking damage back you press W. But wait a minute, Darius just pressed E, what do you do now? NOTHING, there is nothing you can do, you are truly fucked because you dared to hit your opponent and you have nothing left in your kit. This isn't just a problem with the Darius matchup, almost all of Wukongs counters are like this (which is 90% of top laners).\n\nDamage Types/Resistances - Almost every champion in the top lane has some form of %HP DMG/TrueDMG/MixedDMG. Wukong only has physical damage. You could argue that his clone deals magic damage when it expires, but its so negligible its not even funny. Why is this a problem you ask? Because every motherfucker instant counters Wukong now by just building Tabis or some other basic armour item. This is such an annoyance I cant even begin to explain. Are you laning against Irelia, a classic Wukong counter AND outplaying her? Well guess what monkey, she just built Tabis and now she does more damage than you, has more cc than you, deals true damage, has more mobility than you, and more tankiness than you GL HF. \"Well then why don't you build Tabis on Wukong?\" you ask, let me tell you why. Wukong has shitty base damage, zero sustain, one damage type, and shitty base bulk. If he builds Tabis or another armour item, you are basically crippling yourself even harder because the enemy STILL has mixed damage types and higher base stats.\n\nJungle - A lot of you are probably wondering \"You could avoid all of these problems by jungling!\". Wukong has trash jungle clear, he has hardly any AoE and as I stated earlier, his base damage and tankiness is BAD. The only way to have a remotely healthy jungle clear is to take clone second so you can clear the camps, but even then its so slow its unbearable. By the time you have cleared 3 camps, the enemy has either cleared his jungle and done 1-3 ganks, or they have cleared their jungle and invaded you and now you are dead (if you play lee sin you are insecure).\n\nClone - This spell has so much potential, but it is so dated. Right now, your clones only usefulness is the THREAT of using it, i'm sure you all know the classic \"S stop\" where you press S and pretend you have cloned. The problem with this is anyone who knows Wukong can actually see the difference between an S stop and an actual clone, when you clone its a lot more choppy. The only way to fool anyone with it is by running into a bush and using S stop at the edge so they cant see you stop. However, the higher elo you go, the less this trick works. The clone itself is pretty useless above D5, the only useful aspect of this ability is the 1.5 second stealth so you can reset duskblade proc. In fact, i'm certain if you just removed the whole clone and made this ability a stealth ability it would be just as good. That sucks, because a clone sounds like it could be super fun to play around with. For example, what if you could trade places with a clone that you set down, or what if the clone used Wukong's E at the end of the duration instead of just uselessly spinning around and disappearing.\n\nUltimate - Whilst Wukong's ultimate is pretty good, it does not match the rest of his kit. You give him 3 basic assassin abilities, then you give him a team fight ultimate? Also, your ultimate's base damage is 20 (lol), which means if you don't build AD, you will be like a mosquito buzzing around in a team fight. Also, the tick rate of this ability has screwed me over so many times it makes me want to cry. When you ult, enemies can literally DASH THROUGH YOUR ULTIMATE without being knocked up, the biggest offender being Fizz Q and Irelia dash.\n\nSolution The best solution to these problems would be a rework. I honestly would not mind a full scale rework, maybe moving Wukong into more of a top lane bruiser role that has a lot of interactivity with his clones. You could also remove his current ult and give him something like a powered up mode (yes, like SSJ from dragon ball).","replies":[{"poster":"Strong Tomato","date":"2018-10-05T20:31:31.945+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":">  Also, your ultimate's base damage is 20 (lol), which means if you don't build AD, you will be like a mosquito buzzing around in a team fight.\n\nI agree with most, but not with this. His ult may have low base damage, but it has total AD ratio which means the actual base damage of Wukong's ult is 20+110% base AD so at lvl 6 that's 104 base damage per second.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Côco Atrevido","date":"2018-10-05T16:21:16.997+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Meddler, hope ur doing fine.\n\nIs it possible for the Lissandra new passive show up in the next PBE cycle?\n\nIs the colorful mage getting close or will it be revealed closer to the end of the year?

Wanted to share a bit of context as to why since I see them getting asked about a fair bit still. At time of mention our assessment was Rek'Sai was underperforming across the board, so we had room to add some straight power to her. Looking into things a bit deeper though we realized she was performing quite well at higher MMR already and that straight buffs would be inappropriate. She does have a fairly steep learning curve, and underperforms at low/average MMR though, so will feel weak to quite a lot of players. Would like to do some work to smooth out her early accessibility a bit as a result, that's a much larger task though than just adding power so it didn't fit within the time we had allocated. Expect we'll come back to her at some point, not sure on when though.\n> ","replies":[]},{"poster":"TopperH","date":"2018-10-05T21:41:58.832+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"https://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/platinum/plus/champions/\n\nSo Kai'sa dropped at barely 50% winrate after the lastest nerf and she is getting nerfed AGAIN.\n\nMeanwhile MF, Draven, Lucian, Twitch, Sivir, Jhin are all at >52% winrate, not to mention the more exotic picks like Heimer, Swain, Yasuo, all outperforming her.
