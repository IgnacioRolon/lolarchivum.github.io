The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**More Runes Discussion**\r\n\r\nMost of you will probably have seen this already, in case you missed it though some intial discussion on the IP/economy side of things with the runes transition was posted yesterday though. Lot more details to come, particularly around what happens with runes themselves, post from Cactopus that&#039;s well worth checking out if you haven&#039;t read it here though:\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/RlNQkO39-buying-runes-between-now-and-preseason\r\n\r\nAlso worth calling out was a post from Ghostcrawler in the replies, in particular since he discusses how we&#039;ve been looking at runes in terms of their impact on Riot as a business a little bit. \r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/RlNQkO39-buying-runes-between-now-and-preseason?comment=0043\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**7.16 Balance Approach**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve just started work on looking at patch 7.16 balance work. Since 7.15&#039;s a pretty large patch more of the next patch cycle than usual will start out with a lot of analytical work, assessing what we need to respond to, rather than working on already defined issues. Things we&#039;ll be investigating include:\r\n\r\n* Champs that may be too dominant or got changes recently for being too dominant and need to be watched closely now - Jayce, Thresh, Galio, Elise, Kalista, Caitlyn\r\n* Position assessments - Is Cinderhulk overtuned and thereby impacting jungling too much, what should we do about some mid laners (Ori, Synda etc) who overly present/reliable choices, are many ranged champs who should be good supports struggling too much at present.\r\n* Duskblade - Do the 7.15 changes go far enough, how does its power compare for different types of users\r\n\r\nMore thoughts to follow after some investigation.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**7.16 likely changes**\r\n\r\nIn addition to that research there are also a few changes we&#039;ll be testing shortly including:\r\n\r\n* Malphite - Taking another crack at him, this time looking in part to get a bit more skill expression onto his kit (think things like the recent Garen W changes, at least in terms of goal). Probably power neutral ish, maybe slight buff?\r\n* Maokai - Likely nerfing, probably Q damage and/or CD. Will be dependent on that Cinderhulk analysis above though to ship or not ship (how much of it is Maokai being out of line, how much that particular item?)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Spectator clean up**\r\n\r\nMentioned this a while ago, looks like it should be in 7.16. We&#039;ll be removing a few dozen team indicators from spectator view only, targeting things that just add unneeded clutter to the spectator experience. Rationale there is that LoL&#039;s already a really busy game visually, and anything unnecessary that&#039;s shown makes it harder to follow the necessary things. Changes will be hitting PBE soon, feedback much appreciated there, or on live after the patch goes out, if you notice anything that feels wrong (no longer seeing something really important, still seeing things of low value) . Changes include things like hiding the rings around Akali W or Kindred R because they&#039;re well defined already by existing spell effects. We&#039;re doing so now specifically because the next few patches will get a lot of use out of spectator in the competitive scene. These should also be improvements that are good for spectator in general in whatever context it&#039;s used of course.","replies":[{"poster":"Càne","date":"2017-07-21T16:11:56.546+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"What do you think about Fiora after her nerfs?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-07-21T16:55:50.541+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":6,"body":"Might have hit her too hard, nerfs did impact her a bit more than we expected.

That's a guess though, haven't picked the team's brains on him for a bit.\n\nAnother champ - It's pretty unlikely I'll personally do the game design on another champ. Doing so takes a lot of time and you need to be available to work with the rest of the team when needed too, so it's not always flexible time.
