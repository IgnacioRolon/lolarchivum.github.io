More on them from the champion team to come very shortly, thoughts from me on some other stuff below.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Twisted Treeline**\n\nNothing guaranteed yet, but we&#039;ll be trying to get a bit of work on TT in during the 7.8 cycle if possible. We prioritize SR balance over TT work, given mid-season&#039;s coming up quickly though there&#039;s less value in hitting balance on some champs that are going to be meaningfully affected the patch after anyway. Possible we might have some time to hit some stuff on TT as a result. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Ivern**\n\nSpeaking of treelines we&#039;ll be taking a pass at Ivern in 7.8. Love the dude, but he&#039;s a bit too good at some things which makes it tough for enemies to interact with him/his team. Things we&#039;re testing include:\n\n* Slightly longer passive application channel duration\n* Created brushes not hidding epic monsters within them (too much objective control power, though you can still create a wall of brush blocking them off of course and hide vision of them that way)\n* Shorter cast range on created brush (it&#039;s 1600 at present, which is a bit nuts)\n* Higher E CD (whoops, typo'd this the first time)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Mid-Season Approaching**\n\nCouple of weeks now until mid-season stuff hits PBE. I&#039;m not certain on exact timelines but we&#039;ll be talking at least slightly before that about the changes, what our goals are etc. Some of the crit changes we were hoping to ship didn&#039;t work out alas, so we&#039;ll have some changes to other AD items but not those. Will certainly take the time to talk through what we were going for, why we concluded we shouldn&#039;t ship the changes and whether we might go back to them at some point though. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Stretch goal for 7.8: Heimer**\n\nNo details yet on possible changes and there probably won&#039;t be anything on PBE for a little bit at least, we&#039;re hoping we&#039;ll be able to put a bit of time into Heimer though. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Shen** \n\nWe&#039;ve got some changes for Shen in testing that we think we&#039;ll be shipping some for of in the next patch. Goal there&#039;s to reduce the discrepancy in effectiveness between organized play on really low latency environments and regular play, reduce situations where Shen&#039;s strong in one context while ok or even weak in the other. As a result we&#039;ll be looking at things like:\n\n* Ult shield strength scaling with the allied target&#039;s missing health, lower base health values. Organized play tends to use offensive ults on really healthy allies a lot more, regular play more defensive clutch saves.\n* Increased E width. The difference in reliability between very low and normal latency circumstances looks to be too high and we think that width&#039;s part of the reason. Current width also creates some situations where it looks like it hit but didn&#039;t, so this potentially of double value as a change.\n* Removing bonus damage to non champions on the Q. Organized play gets a lot more value from wave pushing power throughout the game. Hitting this looks like a good place to remove power from that context as a result, potentially allowing it to be reinvested elsewhere.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Whoops, forgot something. We've also got ARAM changes coming in 7.8**\n\nARAM's intended to be a notably faster game mode than SR, some (not all) games can really stall out though. We've got some ARAM changes on the way as a result aimed to improving those stalled out games, with changes to stuff like super minion stats, slightly more cannon minions, slightly faster spawning waves etc. Those should be hitting PBE today too, feedback on them much appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"U Just Got Slain","date":"2017-04-04T17:11:56.086+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Meddler! Not a big Shen player here, but I know whenever I pick him up the bonus damage on his Q is really good for last hitting when Shen gets shoved in. Since he has no wave clear it is pretty easy to just push him into tower. Nerfing the bonus damage to non-champions will take away that extra safety net, so do you plan on making it an intended weakness of Shen to nerf his already low wave clear power early game (since sunfire helps a lot mid-late) and allow him to struggle under tower?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-04-04T17:18:04.954+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":22,"body":"A weak lane's intended for Shen yeah.

His rework happens, Shen loses his healing in order to make his lane more dynamic. As compensation, he gets better waveclear with Q (still weak, but better than before) and a kit that focuses a lot more on shielding and blocking damage instead of just tanking and healing. Well, here's where the nerfs start. Reduced HP regen, reduced damage ratio with Q against champions, reduced shield values on passive. And now making him lose the bonus damage on Q to minions and making his ult worse unless your ally is below 40%? In effect losing that waveclear that he got with his rework as compensation for not being able to heal anymore?\n\nThis is ridiculous. I've been a Shen player since mid season 5 and he's been hit with the nerf bat so many times because of competitive play. I don't understand how I can play this champ anymore, this is going to hurt him much more in SoloQ where his waveclear and mediocre damage against champions if they fuck up is the only thing keeping him alive in lane against frequent bullies like Darius, Jayce, Riven, etc. And I'm getting punished if I am aware of a gank bot or see my ADC in trouble and ult early, which gives my carry less effective HP for the duration of the fight? Might as well just watch my ally bleed until they're at 40% or else they're losing several hundred effective HP late game. Nice.\n\nReally disappointed here. E change should have happened immediately after his rework as changing his model seemed to fuck with the hitbox, making it quite a bit harder to hit than before. Really seems like Shen should just get disabled for competitive and let the people who actually play champs because they're fun and not because they're busted in a team setting play him and not feel like they're at a disadvantage.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2017-04-04T21:48:34.656+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"He can't even farm from range with Q anymore.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-04-04T17:09:48.679+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Redemption  {{item:3107}} + Locket {{item:3190}} seem to dominate support builds,  is this on RIOT's radar or do you think the problem lies somewhere else?\n\nEDIT: If it is on your radar, what sorts of ideas are you considering to address it?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-04-04T18:52:41.589+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"They too look too mandatory on a number of champs, though in terms of plays they enable and power they give champs buying them current thinking is they're not all that far off.

To list:\n\n* {{item:3107}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3504}} {{item:3222}}\n* {{item:3109}} is supposed to be one but doesn't serve that purpose at all (I'll talk about that next paragraph)\n* {{item:3060}} is massively situational and more common on top-lane tanks than supports\n* {{item:3174}} is only useful on a few supports, namely Karma and the wholly out-of-meta Sona, and the threat of overloading on CDR with it is a big deterrent\n* {{item:3050}} is as situational as Banner, and the passive is completely unreliable which makes it even less of a good option\n\n8 items you can say are specifically designed for a more supportive use. Most of the time, you're lucky to complete two or three before a match is over, meaning you're forced toward the ones that are generically strongest â€” not a hard decision to make, given how few items you have to choose from, and how bad some of them are.\n\nOn Knight's Vow specifically: Give it cooldown reduction, for the love of God. The lack of CDR options has been a consistent sticking point for tank supports, and for a supposed support item, the only people budgeting for it are top-lane tanks who get massively more gold, easier access to CDR elsewhere, and are far more durable and thus capable of using the item effectively. This has been something that it's needed since it was added to the game, and people have been saying that for months. If you're not going to give it CDR, you need to give a reason why you aren't, because that is a huge reason why tank supports don't give a damn about it.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-04-05T10:34:28.727+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, everyone has been talking about the lack of CDR on Knight's Vow since its very release. At the beginning, I and most others were hesitant, the item passive looked strong and it was already giving almost all stats that a support Tank wants in one item. CDR was the *only* thing lacking, so it looked like a fair trade.\n\nBut after a couple months, it's very clear that Knight's Vow isn't as much of a must-buy as we initially thought, so I'm much less hesitant now. Adding CDR to Knight's Vow looks like a no-brainer.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2017-04-05T02:33:20.373+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"All I ask is that you give Knight's vow some CDR.\nEver since Locket lost it's CDR, support tanks have a very limited selection for CDR. While the addition of cdr to eye of the equinox was great, it's still not enough.\n\nFrozen Heart is great into AD/attack speed comps, but then you're lacking in health earlu. You're in trouble if you try to fight a mage (well, help fight a mage). You can't even consider it against AP heavy comps (unless the ADC gets super fed). Don't even think about rushing it when a mage \"support\" like Zyra or Brand is bot. They'll get fed off of killing your melee ass. There's Zeke's, but it's freaking Zeke's. \n\nThere's plenty of supportive cdr items to grab like redemption. But then you're still squishy, so it's suicide to grab those on engage tanks like Leona or Alistar. At least not until you already got some tankiness.\n\nThere's plenty of CDR options for tanks, but those are selfish items that only help me. Those are fine, but I still like to help support my team.\n\nLook I understand sometimes sacrifices have to be made. If I want CDR, I have to give up tankiness. If I want tankiness, I should give up CDR. But it feel like tank supports are the only supports making this choice. Mage supports like Morgana & Karma have plenty of options for supportive items with AP & CDR. Hell, champs like Soraka, Janna or Nami don't even need AP, just CDR & they can get the job done. AP is just a nice benefit. But champs like Braum, Leona, Alistar, TK, etc, are kind of screwed.\nNow, I'm not say tanks support are unplayable, that they can't work with pure tank or support items nor am I saying mage supports itemization is in the best spot. I'm not saying any of that. Just saying support tank itemization could use a few more CDR options\n\nSo, I rambled on long enough.

Ardent should at least match Athene's 75%, if you ask me.\n\n20% heal/shield power is nice, but the active has a huge cooldown considering it's just a worse version of QSS (can't even remove a Malzahar ultimate with it), and it's barely 85% gold efficient by itself with the Harmony passive. Basically, only Soraka gives a damn about it, unless you straight-up _have_ to get that watered-down Cleanse because your teammates can't (or won't) get a QSS.

You mentioned some upcoming Ivern nerfs which are great to hear. Does the balance team have any plans to nerf other very strong junglers such as Lee Sin and Graves? I know Graves is getting the magic resist removed from his quickdraw passive but that won't change the fact that he can clear the entire jungle without smite or potions and remain relatively healthy. Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcMuH7v9gyc . I find it a bit ridiculous that this still has not been addressed. When using smite, Graves has one of the fastest clears of the game and easily outfarms, and outdamages most other junglers.\n\nAlso, Lee Sin has never not been meta since his release 6 years ago. Not only is he fun to play but he is very strong even for novices. Part of this is because he has a very healthy and quick clear, good ganks, and is the highest mobility jungler in the game. He also has 350 base movespeed. No hypermobile champion also has extremely high base movespeed except for Lee Sin. This movespeed when combined with his amazing kit, allows him to make plays and rotations arguably better than any other jungle champion in the game. \n\nI know Lee is an iconic League champion and is a favorite of players of all elos, And I'm only Diamond 5 and by no means am I an an expert of League balance but I believe it would allow for so much more jungle health and diversity if Graves, Lee Sin, and Ivern were taken down a notch.

One of the main issues I've had with him since his rework is his complete inability to re-position his dagger as needed most of the time, especially if he's behind in a lane. What I'm really wondering here, is would there be a way to implement a small mechanic that let Shen re-position his dagger under some circumstance? Maybe he can only do it when he is at full energy and is standing on the area of it. Then he can throw it a very short distance (maybe 600-700?). This would be really beneficial towards letting him line up better uses of Q for trades and help if he really botches a Q use too. It doesn't even have to apply his passive, do damage, or even CC to me. Just the ability to re-position is a nice quality to have.\n\nAnd while we're on it, can we streamline a bit of how \"dodge\" works? It seems that Shen W doesn't block some AA effects that are blocked by other dodges (namely Jax). One key instance is versus Xin Zhao, as the 3rd AA in his Q still performs the knock-up on Shen, but is doesn't effect Jax.

And that's pretty big, considering that Shen's rework has been (most probably purposefully) removing his ways to affect the enemies from a distance .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PeepingPeafowl","date":"2017-04-04T21:30:27.256+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Shen -\nRemoving bonus damage to non champions on the Q.

Unless further changes are made to gold and experience income, minions and super minions will prove to be too overwhelming too early for those teams to come back.\n\n**Possible Solutions**\n\n* Increase minions and super minions damage armor resistance and spawn rate gradually over time, to prevent teams from getting run over by those super minions 5 minutes into the game\n* Increase minions and supper minions damage armor resistance and spawn rate following some timespans, for example doubling all their stats every 10 minutes, matching the different phases\n* add an enrage timer, similar to the timespan but much later, to force games to end quickly past a certain point.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\n* On another note, **mages** are the main champion archetypes responsible for stalling games indefinitely, their wave clear is very good, it can prove to be very hard to push into teams with multiple mages when no minion is around. If you want to increase minions and super minions effectiveness, you are going to want to increase their magic resistance or health or something to make it so mages can't instantly clear minions waves any longer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jelapi","date":"2017-04-04T21:15:45.027+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh well, looks like playing Shen in the jungle will be even more painful early on...\nIncreasing the cooldown on his ult is also a bit harsh, I mean the cd was already huge, but the scaling on missing HP is great.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poluact","date":"2017-04-04T21:14:01.563+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This Shen Q nerf is gonna hit jungle Shen which is already not in the best spot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jackom1","date":"2017-04-04T20:49:27.244+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regarding Shen, is there any chance you may go as far as giving a definite, albeit large, range to his ult (like galio, pantheon or sion, so to speak)?

With a lot of experience on Shen I rarely miss a well positioned dash at 50-70 ping. I'm just a little worried it's arbitrarily lowering skill floor. \n- The Q changes are atrocious. Aside from killing jungle Shen, it just seems like the continued attrition of his strengths. It is a *really, really* big nerf - if it goes through he gets a borderline unplayable early game in exchange for.... what? A mid game where he can't contribute anything aside from *maybe* turning around 1-2 fights if your team mates are competent enough for your ult to matter? A late game where he's borderline irrelevant because his base stats are so cripplingly bad, he's at a huge gold disadvantage by default? \n- I'm really disappointed changes to his W aren't being looked at. It's a really awkward skill that fluctuates wildly in terms of value, and is hard to use well, especially if your team has no idea what it does. It's a really big area for improving the stability and usability of his kit - I would *much* rather see his W be make simpler/easier/more usable than his dash be made semi-arbitrarily easier.\n\nSo in short:\n\n-  If that Q nerf goes through you better be prepared to give him like +600 health @ 18 and actual ap ratios, ideally at the same time so he's not crippled for several weeks again.  \n- Please, please look at his W. Like its interaction with his passive means it can actually *hurt* your survivability vs AD casters.  Not only that, but if you were able to scale literally *any* part of it other than the cooldown, you'd be able to break Shen away from the very specific itemization he currently uses in competitive and open up a lot more build paths. Narrowing down his itemization further and further with stuff like that Q change (so he literally has to buy 1 of 2 items just to functionally cs) can only hurt the stability of his balancing in the long term.","replies":[]}]}
