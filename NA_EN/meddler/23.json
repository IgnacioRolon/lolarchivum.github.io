The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Second Test Run for Nexus Blitz**\r\n\r\nFor anyone who missed it we put up an article recently talking about what&#039;s next for Nexus Blitz. Short version is:\r\n\r\n* Nexus Blitz found an audience of players who really liked it, size of that audience was smaller than we&#039;d been hoping for though, so we&#039;re not making it permanent, at least not yet.\r\n* We&#039;ll be bringing it back for a second test run in 8.24, so it&#039;ll be available throughout the holiday period at the end of the year. We&#039;ll then assess what should happen next with it after that. \r\n* We&#039;ll be acting on a lot of different types of feedback received, with changes including adding bans, revisions to events/rewards, clarity improvements etc.\r\n \r\nhttps://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/10/dev-up-next-for-nexus-blitz/\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Why we&#039;re not planning to have flat pen/lethality in Rune Stats**\r\n\r\n\r\nCome preseason we&#039;ll be making it so instead of getting stats based off your choice of Rune styles you&#039;ll instead be able to pick a few choices of stat directly. One question I wanted to talk about there was why we&#039;re not planning on having flat pen/lethality be an available stat there.  They&#039;re stats you could get in the old runes system and we do see requests for it to be offered fairly regularly.\r\n\r\nPrimary reasons:\r\n\r\n* Flat pen offers a larger damage increase to squishy targets than to tanky targets, in contrast to AD/AP which are more neutral. We&#039;re not looking to increase damage to squishies specifically.\r\n* Itemization has been balanced around the removal of most flat pen from pregame. Adding it back in would mean another pass on Sorc Shoes, Lethality items etc to get to a similar end spot. Disruption versus benefit doesn&#039;t seem worth it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary reasons:\r\n\r\n* Keeping number of stats lower leads to a easier and cleaner UI\r\n* Understanding whether flat pen or AP/AD will provide more damage is often a really mathy choice, rather than a clearer trade off. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**State of Ezreal**\r\n\r\nNow that his update&#039;s been out for a little while wanted to share a few thoughts on Ezreal:\r\n\r\n* His AD build&#039;s performing pretty solidly, particularly given the amount his play rate&#039;s shot up, which tends to depress performance for a while as less experienced players get on a champ. We estimate that build&#039;s in a spot where it&#039;s balanced, or possibly slightly strong long term once this players have more experience with the kit changes.\r\n* His AP by contrast&#039;s looking weaker than it was pre update.\r\n* We&#039;re looking at buffing his W rank up damage as a result, given AD Ezreal maxes that last and AP Ezreal maxes it first or second. That will likely be in 8.22.\r\n* We&#039;re avoiding putting more power into AP ratios because we&#039;re already seeing the double tear builds be pretty powerful and giving him more value for AP pushes all his builds towards double tear as the way to go, removing variety. \r\n\r\n \r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-10-17T16:08:09.172+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":3,"body":"Odd question, but one I've never managed to get an answer for:\n\nHave you ever considered using *Rapidfire Cannon's* range-indicating tech to display changing auto-attack ranges on champions like Twitch, Tristana, and Kayle?

The item itself is extremely cost efficient as it is right now, it will get even better once you reduce the price and we aren't even counting the passive ability you get.

I really don't think that a W base damage per rank buff is the way to go on buffing AP Ezreal. I think rather than ranting in a solid paragraph it'd be easier if I bullet point my thoughts on this.\n\n- W is never maxed 2nd on AP Ezreal. It's first or last. E is too important. A buff like this kills Q max AP Ezreal, which currently is more viable than W max and is predominantly what I find success with (and what I have found success with for years).\n\n- Q currently doesn't have a high enough AP ratio for Ezreal to one-shot caster minions with Sheen and Luden's Echo. I've always been able to do this with Q max AP until now, and considering that AD Ezreal has bad waveclear, and AP has even worse clear, this is a bit of a nuisance.\n\n- You seem cautious to buff AP ratios due to the effect it'd have on incentivising the double tear build. Why not just kill the double tear build? It doesn't seem like something that was intended, and it doesn't seem like something that can ever be considered \"healthy\". I understand that you probably want more build diversity for Ezreal, but it sucks that AP Ezreal will never receive a ratio buff simply because you want this single item to be available to AD Ezreal players that already have very solid build options without it.\n\n- It's a smaller point, but buffing W base damage does still add to the power of AD Ezreal, if only at later ranks where Ezreal should fall off anyway. Additionally, when you're building AP, I don't really think that more W damage would be a good choice considering how much damage you already do it objectives with it.\n\n- W in lane currently has one issue, and that's that for a lot of the time you'll be burning E to proc it as minions will block your Q and you don't get the mana refund by auto-attacking the mark. Placing more damage into W and incentivising a play style where the following applies\nA). You can't control your wave because you have no Q base damage and the ratio has been nerfed\nB). You're dealing all of your damage in a single hit, as rank 1 Q is negligible\nC). You're in the shortest lane and in order to get off your main damage you have to burn your safety spell.\nPersonally, this seems unhealthy for the Ezreal player (Has an extremely risky damage combo that he is completely reliant on when a wave is present, which will be more often as he can't clear the wave with rank 1 Q) and for the enemy (they get hit for ridiculous amounts of damage in a single proc).\n\ntl;dr Stop double tear builds and give me an ap ratio buff on Q, just 10% would do :) xoxo\n\nI really hope you reply to this with your thoughts, and I sincerely hope you consider my alternative, or seek out a different buff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2018-10-17T15:53:28.836+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey Meddler can i ask why the Pyke changes were pulled?

I'm not trying to point fingers Meddler but it is nearing the end of 2018. In 2013 this champion received a VGU that didn't meet the mark and didn't solve her original problems. It took this Development team 5 years to give her a rework that was supposed to address just one of her issues that continues to be swept under a rug.\n\n\nI don't care about new players. I don't care about old players. It's getting to the point that not matter what people want done, you don't do anything. I don't want to have to go over all of her problems again but I feel like I have to constantly do this because almost all of you live in this delusional world that the VGU 5 years ago was successful.\n\n1) Still no identity. The scope of this rework, admitted by your Development team, was QOL changes and giving Karma a new W and Mantra W. From the looks of the spoilers, it doesn't look like her gameplay identity has been worked on at all. The entire point of her VGU 5 years ago was to give her a gameplay identity and new thematic. You didn't succeed with any of that and this rework could have been a perfect opportunity to do that.\n\nKarma mains wanted her fans back, a new passive, Mantra Q to new be blocked by minions, an ally function with Mantra W, and shield bomb back. None of that is happening on Karma from the looks of it. Karma is getting a new Mantra W that functions the same but it \"will help her jungling\".\n\n2) You still have yet to give her a running and shield casting animations, fix her animations, give her better VO, give the champion original taunts that isn't on another champion, and you know . . . give us an actual VU that isn't rushed and constantly ignored.\n\n3) There is nothing unique about this champion and everything that was unique was purposely removed from your Development team, so new champions can get the limelight. What did LoL players say was an iconic thing about Karma? Her fans and shield bomb. WAIT!? She doesn't have that anymore.\n\nRemember though, you made Karma players wait an entire year to get a new Mantra W that isn't addressing the sizable amount of issues that you created and continue to ignore, Meddler. What did this rework accomplish that fixes Karma's identity, art problems, thematic and gameplay issues? It doesn't because you want to cater to new players and blatantly ignore the community that helped build your game up and supported you. You are literally giving every old Karma main a huge middle finger when you priotrize work on Ezreal and you do 7 plus reworks/VGU on Ryze, when you are blatantly ignoring champions that you screwed up on.\n\nSo what is going to be so successful about this Karma update that you think is going to make people think she is a better champion? You are not even tackling one of her problems that YOU created and refuse to rectify.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2018-10-17T21:12:37.324+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">•Understanding whether flat pen or AP/AD will provide more damage is often a really mathy choice, rather than a clearer trade off. \n\nCheck out this conversation from a year ago:  \n\nhttps://twitter.com/RiotRepertoir/status/932814895510257665 \n\n>**Me:**  The problem is that we have pen-reliant mages without enough pen to preserve 7.21 power curves. 45% of the game's flat pen was just deleted from the game without any good reason. The design question is whether these mages should be less reliant on pen since the pen doesn't exist.\n>\n>**Rep:**  They should probably just be less reliant moving forward, since we don't anticipate adding any flat pen back in. As such, if there are champions suffering on account of lack of pen (Zyra, Brand, etc.), we should just adjust those champions.\n\nLook at the changelogs for Brand and Zyra. Every damage change to Zyra since 6.14 and Brand since 6.9 has *increased* their pen reliance rather than decreased it. So what gives?\n\nTo be absolutely clear, **I'm not saying they need more damage.** I'm saying that Riot shouldn't be making champions rely on tons of pen, deny them the stat they need, then continue to double-down on the pen reliance. \n\nIf you aren't supporting these designs through pen itemization, these champs' power curves become disproportionately dependent on enemy MR. On the flipside, pen math makes it hard to judge their relative power, and unexpectedly high damage makes them feel cheap and frustrating to play against. \n\nI wish we could just get pen-stackers rebalanced to a point where they don't need a tuning pass with every pen/resist change. 7.24 and 8.1 are good evidence that it's not sustainable.","replies":[{"poster":"Paletongue","date":"2018-10-19T01:26:40.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey do you mind explaining what makes them more pen reliant than before?

(AP scaling increased to 60% AP from 55% AP) \n* Increased plant frequency/duration\n* During rework, plant damage reduced to 29 − 114 + .15 AP from 29.5 − 140 + .2 AP. \n\n**Brand**\n\n* Blaze: Damage per stack increased to 4% of target's maximum health from 2%.\n* During rework, max Blaze damage increased from 8% to 24 - 28% maximum health\n* During rework, total base damage and AP ratio on abilities was reduced from 1818 + 3.45 AP to 1212 + 2.15 AP\n* Reduced ability cooldowns across the board, increasing passive uptime\n\n**Items**\n\n* Liandry's: Ability power reduced to 75 from 80\n* Torment damage per second increased to 1.5% / 2.5% from 1% / 1.5%\n* New Madness passive increases magic damage by 10%\n\n* Luden's: Rework made it a more commonly built item\n\n**Runes (Added Base/Flat Damage)**\n\n* Scorch: 10-30 magic damage\n* Comet: 30-100 + .2 AP \n* Electrocute: 30-180 + .25 AP\n* Precision first row % damage increases\n\nIn aggregate, these changes represent a large increase in AP-independent damage on champs where it was already high. This causes AP-dependent damage to be an even smaller share of total damage. \n\nMeddler's right that pen vs. AP power levels are really math-intensive. AP ratios are static, so 100 AP with a 3.0 ratio is always worth 300 gross damage. The net damage after MR is 261 at 15 MR, 200 at 50 MR, 150 at 100 MR, and 120 at 150 MR. In other words, you take 100 less damage going from 0-50 MR, then 50 less going from 50-100 MR, the only 20 less going from 100-150 MR. \n\nOn the other hand, the effective damage increase you get from 15 mpen swings from 13% at 15 MR, 7% at 50 MR, 4% at 100 MR, and 2.5% at 150 MR. But unlike AP's flat increase in gross damage, mpen's increase in gross damage depends on your current damage values. That's where a whole slew of additional variables have to be factored in.\n\nZyra is the best example of this (or worst, depending on your point of view). She gets average base damage increases with skill rank. She also gets plant damage increase per champion level. That base damage is multiplied by number of plants and plant attacks. Those values are then multiplied by 1.5 during her ult. Even under common conditions (ult, 3 plants, 3 attacks each), a 114 base damage on a plant attack turns into 1026 base damage from plants in a decent combo. Meanwhile, the .15 AP ratio on a plant attack adds up to just 1.35 AP in the same combo.\n\nThat's a lot of variables just to figure out what her damage is so we can determine whether a % increase from pen is cost effective. Mind you, this ignores all of her abilities, runes, bonuses, items. Assuming 0 AP for purposes of this example, Zyra's plants will get the same or more effective damage from buying Sorcs than NLR against any enemy with 60 or less MR.\n\nInterestingly enough, Zed works basically the same way Zyra does. His tooltip base damage is low, but it's subject to a bunch of multipliers. That 220 + .9 bAD on Q at level 9, multiplied by shadows and mark, adds up to 825 + 3.375 bAD from only shurikens. \n\n**TL;DR:** If you have high base damage (or multipliers like Zyra and Zed), the % increase in base damage is often worth more than raw AP/AD. Riot's changes listed above tilt the scale further towards pen and away from AP. The base damage buff to Zyra's E is a good example here. Before the buff a rank 5 E at level 9 got about the same benefit from buying Sorcs or a Blasting Wand. After the buff, she would need to buy at least 8-12 AP more AP to break even with Sorcs.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2018-10-17T15:55:27.798+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh yeah any plans for Rageblade or Edge of Night since Captain Gameplay said you guys might look into them this preseason","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-10-17T16:15:18.026+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"We'll be testing some stuff out, nothing concrete enough I'd want to make any promises about changes in preseason or particular directions though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BadgerDrool","date":"2018-10-17T19:53:33.896+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any thoughts on reworked Nunu's current state?

Once defensive stats (including base) get buffed in the preseason, he might be bearable. Vik won't be if this continues.\n\nThe mains for Vik should be coming together and create a list for Riot to work off to buff midlane vik, while avoiding to repeat what is happening.

All we're talking about here are the base damages and cooldowns. And yes I know you could buy penetration, but Ezreal doesn't do that.\n\nPersonally I see no compelling reason to go AP on him.
