The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Prototypes**\r\n\r\nSomething we&#039;ve been thinking about a lot recently is how we could expose more of our work in progress directly to players. Hope there would be that early feedback on things that are still pretty rough could help us identify and fix problems, or, alternatively if something&#039;s really not working, help make the decision to kill it. We&#039;ve tried such an approach a bit on the PBE this year, with work in progress on Quinn, Rengar, Fizz and LeBlanc exposed for feedback earlier than we normally would. That&#039;s gone pretty well. We&rsquo;re going to try doing a bit more of it as a result, including for projects that aren&rsquo;t just champion work. We&rsquo;ll have some details to share next week for anyone interested in that side of things.  \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Gold Funneling**\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the 8.14 penalty to gold funneling got added jungle items we&#039;ve been seeing two pain points in particular from it from regular jungle play:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Regular junglers who get ahead, usually off early kills/assists, who then get punished by it even though they&#039;re not the intended target.\r\n* Junglers who often prefer to not finish their jungle items, particularly those that split push later in the game. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re looking at possible adjustments to the current penalty rules to reduce problems on one or both of those points. Possible there&#039;s something in 8.15, not certain yet at time of writing. Given the current penalty itself is a bandaid until pre-season if we do find an adjustment to make it&#039;s likely it&#039;s also a bandaid that gets removed come preseason when we get a better overall solution in.  \r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Crit Item Changes**\r\n\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve been continuing to work on crit item changes for 8.15 this week, with some shifts in what&#039;s likely to ship versus our thinking last week:\r\n\r\n* We&#039;re keeping Zeal items at 30% crit for now. We do want to address crit overcapping. Cutting Zeal crit amount however without also changing how IE works results in marksmen power curves getting pushed later, with more of a marksman&#039;s power coming from the second Zeal item spike. That clashes with one of bigger goals of moving some power from late game to early/mid game. We&#039;re keeping the crit overcapping in 8.15 at least as a result. We will address it, but didn&#039;t want to do so in a way that traded one cost for a larger one. \r\n* We&#039;ve added an additional passive to IE, where it gives bonus damage on crits against minions/monsters. Not expecting the power from that to be too high, it does help both to give marksmen a bit of epic monster objective power back and improve satisfaction of a common basic action (AAing minions)\r\n* Not a crit item change, but a related one is that we&#039;re also increasing the cost of starting support items by 50g to reduce the number of pots a support brings with them to lane. We&#039;re doing that because we&#039;re seeing supports able to pressure non supports too hard early game due to the larger health pool they&#039;ve got access to. Supports with inherent sustain and/or protective abilities (generally tanks and enchanters) are the ones we expect to be least affected by that change, given pots represent a smaller proportion of their available health. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Gramps69","date":"2018-07-25T14:47:28.372+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":2,"body":"Can you address the overwhelming damage creep/mobility creep we've seen lately?

Split pushing potentially still gets hit later in the game if you're doing really well and not finishing your jungle item.

The W nerfs seem to have done nothing for Talons that build tiamat. They still shove the wave and then roam. If anything, the W nerfs further incentivize Talons to build tiamat.

It makes sense that Quinn has an advantage against melees given the nature of her kit. However, do you think she could require some toning down? Quinn also sees some play in mid and bot now. It's probable that her strength comes from the addition of Stormrazor, which Quinn buys during the mid game.\n\nWhat about Syndra? On PBE, Syndra has an early game buff for her Q. The buff is nice for a skill that's her bread and butter but I have doubts that it'll be sufficient to bring her into relevancy.

IE is balanced around giving players 30-40% crit. It is NOT balanced around giving players 60% crit, so you aren't losing power when you hit the 100% crit limit. In fact, the only time IE gives more than 40% crit is when you are building your second zeal item and have 45% crit (doubled to 90%). This means IE LOWERS the powerspike of finishing a zeal item and allows Riot to balance ADCs around having a smoother power curve. Moving zeal items down to 25% crit would only INCREASE powerspikes and make it harder to balance IE.
