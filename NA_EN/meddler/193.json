{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-06-14T15:04:23.359+0000","title":"Quick Gameplay Thoughts: June 14","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi folks,\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**Usual Disclaimers**\r\n\r\nThese posts will often contain talk about future work we're doing, or planning to do, that isn't yet guaranteed to ship. The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Teamfight Tactics**\r\n\r\nAs you've probably seen we're working on a new game mode we're calling Teamfight Tactics. If that doesn't ring a bell, this link here's worth checking out:\r\n\r\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/teamfight-tactics\r\n\r\nWe're getting really close to PBE for TFT and are very excited to start getting direct feedback on how it's going from you folks. For context we'll be treating TFT when it goes live (not just PBE) as still being in beta. It'll be representative of the sort of experience we think it should offer and we think it's a lot of fun already. It's not finished yet though and plan is to work on it really publicly. That means you'll see some stuff that's looking really polished and some things that are clearly work in progress. There might be some art that needs polishing still for example, bugs you wouldn't expect from a finished mode, some units that haven't been balanced yet etc. \r\n\r\nOur thinking is that it's better to get the mode into peoples hands, with some things still work in progress, so we can start getting wider feedback. Right now's the ideal time to be making changes, whether that's modifying some game rules, addressing particular frustration points, changing how particular units behave or whatever. Plan is you'll see frequent updates, both on PBE and in the patches afterwards, and a lot of communication from us around where things are up to, what we're planning next and what feedback would be especially helpful on. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Looking at 9.12 so far**\r\n\r\nOk, back to more regular topics now for a bit with some brief initial thoughts on where some champs have landed so far in 9.12:\r\n\r\n* Mordekaiser\r\n\r\nClearly OP and by the time you're reading this we've probably already nerfed him. Looks out of line by a clear margin in at least two positions. \r\n\r\n* Aatrox and Tahm Kench\r\n\r\nAre both looking meaningfully weaker post changes, though not massively so. That's what we were hoping for this round, no immediate follow up changes planned.\r\n\r\n* Karma and Zac\r\n\r\nOther side of the coin, they're both looking quite a bit stronger, so far that change has also been to the extent we were hoping, so no immediate follow ups planned here either.\r\n\r\nSylas\r\n\r\n* Looks significantly weaker. Plan at present is to let him sit for a patch (so no 9.13 changes) then reconsider for 9.14 once things have stabilized.\r\n\r\nYuumi\r\n\r\n* Had a couple of significant bugs, in particular one where her mana cost for Q was doubled when attached. We've fixed that, now waiting to see how she's doing. \r\n\r\nRyze\r\n\r\n* Seems to be performing about as well as previously in solo queue. Given some need to relearn his kit that suggests changes were likely an overall power increase and we'll see him looking stronger in the coming weeks. Remains to be seen if these changes have finally addressed how big his pro versus regular play performance gap is or whether he remains the poster child for problems in that regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Tioym","date":"2019-06-14T15:34:19.000+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":10,"body":"What's the Plan for Akali. \nIt's pretty rude to gut a champion and then not even respond to the people who play it.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-06-14T15:41:42.919+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":6,"body":"We're not happy with the current state of Akali either.

I know you guys wanted to decrease early presence from level 3 ganks and also prevent AFK farming being the most optimal strategy, but the outcome feels like farming your own jungle and efficient pathing just means nothing now. You can be 20 CS (5 whole camps, almost an entire full clear) up on the opposing jungler, but still a full level behind because soaking XP in a lane is so much better XP than actually farming your own XP. Similarly, it's basically impossible for junglers to keep up in XP with solo laners without just straight up farming solo lanes.\n\nI believe the current jungle situation is also a source of a lot of woes of other lanes. Nobody likes getting spam ganked all game, but it's still the best method because sitting in bush for a minute straight while the enemy jungler farms his entire jungle doesn't even put you behind in XP. And because junglers are 95% of the time behind in level from solo laners, any carry jungler will risk being turned on and one-combo'd by the enemy solo laner when ganking, so this turns a  lot of jungle attention to bot lane, because they can actually 1v1 an ADC consistently since they're usually around the same level. But for an ADC or Support, this is still just more frustrating because you get so much attention from junglers just because you're the only person that won't be 2, sometimes 3, level up.\n\nI know balancing the jungle has proven to be a difficult challenge, but surely there's a happy medium between AFK farm being the best method and spam ganking 24/7 being the best method. At the very least, I would love for pathing outside of your first clear to have some meaning to it again. Right now the only time your pathing matters really hard is levels 1-3, primarily because Krugs lets you get to 3 earlier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z4sso","date":"2019-06-14T17:30:02.334+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Meddler, was wondering if it is possible for you to track &amp; show the aggregate WR of all crit adcs by patch for the past few patches.\n\nThink it would be interesting to see how the WR is affected by meta shifts from tank -> enchanter supports as well as effects of ER/small adc buffs.\n\nOn another note, any news on Diana?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir Nope","date":"2019-06-14T15:36:17.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good Morning, Meddler.\n\nIs jungle Mordekaiser a healthy position for him?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-06-14T17:07:43.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suspect it probably will be once he's in a balanced state.
