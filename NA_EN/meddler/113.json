{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-07-28T16:31:21.155+0000","title":"Quick Gameplay Thoughts: July 28","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morning all,\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Usual Disclaimers**\r\n\r\nThese posts will often contain talk about future work we&#039;re doing, or planning to do, that isn&#039;t yet guaranteed to ship. The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**7.15 follow ups**\r\n\r\n* Nasus - Seems reasonable so far. He&#039;s scary sometimes, but juggernauts should have scary moments when they&#039;re in range to melee you.\r\n\r\n* Urgot - Also looking about right, at least initially. Jungle Urgot&#039;s struggling pretty hard, but that&#039;s as expected, solo lane Urgot seems to be performing fairly well.\r\n\r\n* Shyvana - Potentially too strong, no immediate plans for changes yet though, still watching. \r\n\r\n* Cho - Nerfs hit him meaningfully, may or may not still be out of line in jungle however. It&#039;s good to see Cho as a more functional champion (it&#039;s been a while), suspect we&#039;ll have to do some more work on him however soon or moderately soon. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Cho and Stoneplate**\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Cho, figured it would be good to talk a bit about him and Stoneplate. We&#039;re very much aware there are some strong opinions about Cho and Stoneplate out there and it&#039;s a topic with a range of opinions on it internally too. We talked about that particular interaction a lot before launching Stoneplate. \r\n\r\nFeast&#039;s a really high true damage spell, capable of getting to around 1000 damage late game on a tank build, with Stoneplate pushing that up a few hundred more assuming a normal number of Feast stacks. That&#039;s more true damage than we&#039;d normally be happy seeing from a champ in a single ability. Cho&#039;s got some pretty pronounced weaknesses however, in particular his long cast times, lack of mobility and limited reliability. Between those and the need to build Stoneplate, be around 3+ enemy champs and get into Feast range we concluded it was appropriate to allow the Cho/Stoneplate interaction to exist. So far that&#039;s still our take on it at present too. \r\n\r\nHaving said that completely agree it can definitely feel really rough being on the receiving end sometimes and Stoneplate&#039;s still pretty high on our watch list. The ability to use strong combos with it allow some pretty interesting uses and makes it appealing in a range of different circumstances. So far that seems appropriate, possible we do have to make some changes to Stoneplate and/or other things if the power of those, especially relative to their counterplay, gets out of line, whether that&#039;s Stoneplate+Cho, Stoneplate+Locket or something else again. The increased reliability Cho gets off his E slow&#039;s also noteworthy, and it&#039;s possible that while this was ok with an unreliable Q that the increased target access he&#039;s now got might prove too dominant long term. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Hotfixes**\r\n\r\nForgive the repetition on this one, last time from me I swear. Wanted to cover one final time that our approach to hotfixes has changed somewhat. We&#039;ve done some technical work which means that hotfixing&#039;s now noticeably safer to do. That means we&#039;ll be hotfixing a bit more, in particular targeting some things that we&#039;re confident are having a negative effect on the game that previously we&#039;d have waited until the next regular patch to change. \r\n\r\nFrequency of those hotfixes is likely to higher around big patches, such as 7.15 or pre-season, both because there&#039;s more things to potentially need correction and because those are generally the times where we&#039;ve had a bit less time for gameplay testing on any given change. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Censoring Mastery/Rune Page Names**\r\n\r\nFor anyone that missed mention yesterday the recent really broad censoring of page naming isn&#039;t working as intended. That should be back to previous functionality soon. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**7.16 Mid lane changes**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve got a bunch of changes aimed at bringing strong performing champs who mid a lot down at present. Not targeting anything too large on any individual champ, more looking to shift the highest performing tier there down a bit generally. Some of those changes are on PBE already, should expect a few more, or adjustments to existing ones, over the next few days though (e.g. Syndra nerfs changing to a ratio nerf instead of a base damage nerf).","replies":[{"poster":"Raxistaicho","date":"2017-07-28T18:00:11.868+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"How is Shyvana potentially too strong?","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-07-29T11:31:33.839+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://i.gyazo.com/490553cc544b634b87a39ce332869556.png i dunno","replies":[{"poster":"PeponiPoro","date":"2017-07-30T06:15:34.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Explain please ;w;","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-07-30T08:33:58.841+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"from below 50% to over 55% win rate opieop","replies":[{"poster":"LambGotTheCakes","date":"2017-07-30T14:53:09.764+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's almost like you ignored that it then fell to 51%","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2017-07-28T16:33:13.129+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":6,"body":"revert the Akali buffs pls.\n\nstill can't figure out why she needed them at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2017-07-28T16:35:01.096+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler I got a question about reworks regardless of scope do you guys consult the original designers of the champs when doing a rework","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-07-28T16:39:48.008+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually, though it's not always possible (a few people aren't at the company anymore) or not always a good use of time (some people are on R&D now and not so in touch with the current state of the game). \n\nTalking with the original people that built a champ can be really useful to avoid relearning lessons they went through, to understand initial intent better etc. How the champ's been on live and what players have attached to's often more important though, so while understanding that history's valuable it's not a blueprint to stick to over other factors, particularly when some things have proven to be problematic that weren't originally foreseen.","replies":[{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2017-07-28T16:42:06.275+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the answer, amazing context, so like when you guys eventually revisit the Lissanadra passive rework would they have to like chat with you","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-07-28T16:45:40.971+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"They wouldn't have to, it's not mandatory, but people usually at least pick people's brains like that a bit.

Sion currently has very good performance in most tiers - normally sitting in the top 5 winrates for both Top laners and Supports, so he doesn't really need buffs just for a performance boost.\n\nI can think of a few possible reasons for the buffs:\n\n1. Push him further as the roaming tank (more damage with long range ults, more health punishes him less for missing farm while roaming).\n\n2. Boost his jungling (more health from clears, more damage for ult ganks), since that was one of his intended roles in the rework.\n\n3. Trying to boost his playrate, since he is almost entirely played by mains (Unlikely, since, while W buff will help newer players as much as experienced ones, the ult benefits mostly veterans who can hit long ults more easily).\n\nI'm curious what Riot's actual reasoning is, and whether he would need some nerfs to balance out the buffs (he would).","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-07-28T17:29:40.589+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ult - Sion's a tank who often controls fights as much through zones of threat as actual CC/damage (stay out of Q, avoid R, kite his passive, don't be near W).

Also has the benefit of making it more valuable for allies to try and set up targets as Sion is ulting in. \n\nW - bit of power being added.
