We increased jungler influence unintentionally in the pre-season and have been reducing it to around previous levels since. \r\n* Courage of the Colossus is significantly weaker, reining back champions that utilized it especially well in particular. Combination of that and jungle stuff above&#039;s restored agency to a range of positions/champs, marksmen included. \r\n* Lethality&#039;s been buffed since it wasn&#039;t serving the needs of a range of physical damage dealers from multiple classes. That&#039;s given caster and early game marksmen itemization to better serve their needs and we&#039;re seeing a lot of success from them (and other lethality users) now as a result (too much so in some cases).\r\n* We&#039;ve made some changes to individual marksmen where appropriate (Draven, Kalista, Lucian, Trist etc).\r\n\r\n**Current thoughts:**\r\n\r\n* Utility marksmen (e.g. Ashe) seem to be in a reasonable spot. Caster/early game marksmen (e.g. MF) are performing strongly too, too well in some cases. Crit using marksmen (late game AA focused) however may need further item work (not straight buffs, but adjustments to who they&#039;re strong/weak against when).\r\n* Armor pen needs some followup changes after the Lethality buffs. Some of that&#039;s Black Cleaver being too broadly appealing, leading to some excessive strength sometimes when combined with Lethality. We&#039;ll be shifting BC to a higher health/lower AD profile as a result. Longer term (mid season potentially) we&#039;ll also likely take a larger look at the different armor pen types. As a stop gap before that we&#039;re testing Last Whisper (the component of Lord Dominick&#039;s and Mortal Reminder) having the same % pen as those upgrades, but less AD as a safety valve against mid game armor stacking. plus a reduction in the Lethality from Ghostblade and Masteries.\r\n* We&#039;ll also probably be nerfing some individual marksmen in the near future. Corki and Jhin are the most likely candidates.\r\n* We&#039;ll be making changes to Fervor and Warlord&#039;s. Warlord&#039;s being an effective default choice leads to a situation where you either take the thing that lets you not lose lane or the thing that lets you be appropriately effective later in the game IF you didn&#039;t get crushed too much in lane in the first place. We want Warlord&#039;s to be more niche as a result.\r\n* We&#039;re not seeing other classes edge marksmen out of bot lane. So far Ziggs is the only mage getting meaningful play as a farming bot laner and, while he looks a bit strong, we&#039;re still happy with his presence there. Long term we&#039;ll likely look at whether there are a couple of other mages we could get into bot lane in a similar way (tower taking power&#039;s probably some of the answer there)","replies":[{"poster":"RlP K0BE","date":"2017-02-10T18:49:23.953+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hi Meddler,\n\nSince the topic's on Marksemen, are there any changes in line for {{champion:203}} in the future?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-02-10T18:55:43.200+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":2,"body":"We'll probably make it so the first mark spawns on a Scuttle crab consistently, rather than sometimes on Raptors, given how hard that camp is now for them to deal with.

If you're going crit, you MUST get 50-80% crit chance to have any relevance in damage so you're locked into Infinity Edge into double Zeal items, Essence Reaver into Zeal into IE or simply IE into one Zeal item. All three of these builds require the 3600g for IE and ~2600g for one zeal item or 5200g for both, ER itself is also 3600g. \n\nBased on that the three builds cost 8800g, 9800g and 6200g respectively which even with perfect farm (super rare, not even pros have perfect farm) takes quite some time to complete and doesn't take into factor all other minor purchases like potions, control wards and certain piece items for game situation (Last Whisper, Hexdrinker, Vampiric Scepter and Quicksilver Sash). All in all, this makes for a very time and gold consuming build which lacks in early and mid game noticeable power  at a time where other positions builds are relatively cheaper and so are farther ahead. \n\nHowever people have found away around this with Lethality builds which while already cheaper at full build, their components are also much cheaper as you've said yourself 300-500g for each component and 700-850g for the full items at combine cost. So not only are they more accessible, but the power spikes are quicker and the full tem spike is much easily attained. Another thing is the versatility of the Lethality items, each one has a unique passive which grants it's builder more utility than a crit build would. \n\nIt makes no sense then to build crit on anyone other than a few who do better because they are more attack speed reliant (Ashe - There have been a couple Crit/Lethality hybrid builds, Vayne - her w passive is her lethality, Trist, Kalista, Twitch - can build as assassin but needs AS and Jinx)\n\nComing back to Lucian though, as much as providing a crit modifier on his abilities might help it further destroys his identity as a lane bully and in your face marksman. Lucian needs high dmg and survivability because of his lack of range both on his AA's and Ult. The crit build provides damage that scales but isn't strong when Lucian as a champ is strong (EARLY GAME and LANING PHASE). On top of that, the survivability aspect has to be left till much later or else he doesn't output the damage needed so you're forced to either do damage and be really squishy while having no range or being able to survive in close quarters but not have enough damage to burst even a squishy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Good Girl Melody","date":"2017-02-10T21:31:50.064+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mr. Meddler, how do you feel about Sivir currently?","replies":[]},{"poster":"jeremiahBIO","date":"2017-02-11T04:46:05.645+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi meddler, I appreciate you making this.

APC was ruined for no reason though. He was nerfed just because they don't like his style, not because he was OP in any way. I am still very salty about that.","replies":[{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2017-02-13T10:40:43.129+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean its not about power levels. Champion reworks are never just about adding/removing power. The champion reworks are meant to create healthy,distinctive and interesting playstyles.

Armor/MR shred? a slow? Corki's literally has everything Kog'Maw has). \n\nMarksmen have to bring different tools to the table or else it just becomes a matter of picking up whoever has the best raw stats.
