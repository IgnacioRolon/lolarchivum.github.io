Hope the start of the week&#039;s treating you all well so far.  \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Clarity work underway**\n\nWe&#039;ve got some work going on right now aimed at better surfacing various particular bits of information, belief being that some things that could have really interesting and engaging gameplay are being held back by how hard it is to track and appreciate their impact. Some things we&#039;re looking at include:\n\n* Improvements to the the health bar and surrounding UI to allow it to convey extra information clearly (status effects like the gold invulnerability UI we added last year)\n* At least a couple of additional end of game stats (likely candidates for a first round at least are damage to objectives and vision granted)\n* Attribution visual effects that will be used for a range of spells and items that don&#039;t currently create a clear enough link between caster and target (e.g. a general looking blue zap that&#039;s used if you&#039;re on blue team and target someone with Mikael&#039;s, Exhaust, Face of the Mountain etc)\n\nNot certain yet when those changes will be ready, possible some of them are in mid-season though. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**More balance changes being tested**\n\nWe&#039;re about to start a new PBE cycle tomorrow, all going according to plan. Since my last post we&#039;ve also started looking at a few more potential changes, which include:\n\n* Alistar - buffs to passive and E (update last year made him healthier we think so should be able to put a bit more power into him)\n* Camile - W no longer healing off non champions, W slow scaling by rank instead of a flat 80% ( targeting laning phase sustain and gank assist)\n* J4 - buff testing shifting W from bonus shield per champ nearby to max health scaling (part of our pass on junglers that need a bit of help)\n* Volibear - buff to R, with more bounces and improved bounce logic (another from the jungler pass)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Ninja Tabi**\n\nMentioning this again since it seems to be a point of some confusion at present. We have no current plans to nerf Ninja Tabi. They are being bought a lot, that looks like a natural reaction to a lot of games with multiple AD threats/champs buying Lethality however, rather than Ninja Tabi themselves being way out of line. Right now at least we&#039;ll be leaving them unchanged as a result (they&#039;re a counter that&#039;s being used as intended).","replies":[{"poster":"Jano1337","date":"2017-03-20T19:01:27.660+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Damage shielded\" needs to become an end game stat.

This passive's cooldown is reduced by 1 second every time Lissandra applies crowd control to an enemy with her abilities (including slows so basically everything but E), excluding crowd control spell effects from items. During immunity effects, the shield doesnt decay and will apply around the immunity. \n(example: If W is used to proc the shield, and then 1 second later Frozen Tomb is self used, the shield will still have 2 seconds left on it after Frozen Tombs immunity stops, but Frozen Tomb would lower the cooldown of the passive by 1 second per enemy hit aswell since the passive is already proc'ed (Zonyas also counts as imunity))\nCDR for passive: 40 seconds scaling down to 30 seconds later on in the game (40--31 (0.5 seconds off each level)) \n\nPS: Im sure RIOT can improve on the wording of that but I think that helps Lissandra in a large way as currently everything kills Lissandra faster than she can CC them. This would provide insentive for going into a teamfight and casing W, taking some damage and then healing back with her Ult. She could tank slightly more but 10% health is not enough for her to be played as a CC tank to my knowlegde, but would be helped by her core items, such as Liandrys, ROA since that provides more health. It also helps in lane vs her counters that she currently looses vs LB etc as she would be able to shield a little of there damage in lane and since this isant just a magic damage shield, will also mean she can try to counter talon, zed, and assasins in general. \nThe mana passive never helped due to the CC of your spells and the fast that most of the time, you wanted to use Q for the free spell but getting 60 mana for free as a passive felt not satisfying as you stated. The look of the shield would be icey to fit the theme and then would melt off Lissandra over time.\n\nWould love to hear peoples opinion on this.\nIronPenguin96","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-03-20T18:10:48.428+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":4,"body":">They are being bought a lot, that looks like a natural reaction to a lot of games with multiple AD threats/champs buying Lethality however, rather than Ninja Tabi themselves being way out of line.
