The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Patch schedule for the rest of the year**\r\n\r\nHaven't done one of these in a bit so figured it was a good time to talk about our approach to patches through 2019. (For those who haven't seen, we have a schedule of this year's patch dates published on the support site: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018987893-League-of-Legends-patch-schedule) First up, the standard LoL side of things (SR etc). This is all from the perspective of balance/widespread meta impacting work. New content like skins, champs etc will continue to release as usual.\r\n\r\n9.14 - A pretty large patch with a lot of different champs getting work. Expectation is we'll probably do a small follow up micropatch a few days after 9.14 releases since with around 30 champs getting changed odds are there'll be at least one who needs some quick correction afterwards.\r\n\r\n9.15 - 9.18 - Smaller patches, focused on stability and lower scope balance work. We'll be looking to avoid things with big systemic impacts here in particular (e.g. reworking items, changing strength of different positions significantly relative to each other, changes to objectives etc).\r\n\r\n9.19 - Worlds patch. Focus here is on stable, reliable.\r\n\r\n9.20 - 9.22 - Patches between Worlds and Preseason. Some work, including some behind the scenes technical stuff that's a bit risky to put in the Worlds patch, goes here. Generally we try not to get the Worlds patch and the state of the regular game get too out of sync though, so large work will be usually held for preseason.\r\n\r\n9.23 - Preseason. This should be mid November. We'll start talking details about what's in it before though, probably sometime late September or early October.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**TFT Patching**\r\n\r\nOn the TFT side of things by contrast we've got a lot of plans for both balance and ongoing feature development in the 9.15-9.19 sort of range (and onwards of course). During the mode's initial release we've been doing a lot of balance through micropatches as we get things generally into an ok state. Going forward plan is to do more balance through regular patches, including with patch notes so it's much easier to track what's going on. Still expecting we'll hotfix extremely out of line things quickly though of course, especially where they're warping the whole meta around themselves.\r\n\r\nAs a quick recap in terms of TFT in 9.14 we’re expecting we’ll ship:\r\n\r\n* DPS meters\r\n* A new unit (Twisted Fate, 2 cost Pirate Sorcerer with Pick a Card)\r\n* A lot more visible stats when you inspect a unit\r\n* A lot of balance changes\r\n* A lot of bug fixes\r\n* Changes to how PVE rounds drop rewards\r\n* Reworks of some items\r\n* Win/loss streak UI improvements\r\n* And more\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**Looking at Irelia in 9.15**\r\n\r\nWe're putting most of our 9.15 time aside for follow up on 9.14 and longer term work on preseason projects. It's likely we'll at least look at Irelia from the angle of her being too dominant in pro play in particular. Not sure yet what changes that might or might not result in though.\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"squirleon","date":"2019-07-12T15:25:51.753+0000","up_votes":49,"down_votes":5,"body":"Do you have anything planned for toplane tanks? Outside of Tham Kench who is getting nerfed hard, they have low winrates and very low pick and ban rates. They are also not seen in competitive much. Tanks in toplane basically only have one keystone option and that is grasp of undying. Tanks struggle against melee enemies because conqueror is stronger agaist a tank than grasp is for a tank. Grasp is also very bad against any ranged matchup resulting in tanks just being free gold because of kleptomancy. Turret plates are also an issue for tanks because tanks will rarely have the opportunity to get them because of lane pressure, resulting in falling behind too much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AIQ","date":"2019-07-12T15:37:41.620+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":2,"body":"Any chance that {{champion:102}} could Scale with Elder and Gain fury while dead? \n\nAny Chance {{champion:19}} can get his W bug fixed when he's running at a unit is between him and his target he loses all bonuses?\n\n{{champion:39}} seems fine for normal play is the direction that she be changed and power moved around or just legs broken like Azir and Kalista?

Perhaps that person is simply unaware and does not know anything is wrong with WW W.  \n\nAn example with you is that at the beginning of the year you stated that Shyvana would receive a QOL change that allowed her to scale with elder (you probably don't even remember that), we are now on the second half of the year with nothing to remotely show for it.

Here you are talking about Irelia again and her problems, but ignoring the vast majority of comments about other people's champions. You talked about Akali last week and the week before that Ryze and Lux. You and so many other Developers really need to be held accountable for your bias choices and work ethic. This game has over 140+ champions in it and it seems like Developers like you and other ones only care about popular champions, new champions and recent VGU ones.\n\n{{champion:43}} \n\nIt's been close to 6 and a half years now and there are still major problems with her kit, gameplay identity and incomplete art assets. Karma was actually to receive a GU earlier this year but Developers, like you, refused to address the problems and it was cancelled because of player backlash. Just like the excuses you used in previous years, time and the fact that there is a huge division in the Karma community is the reason why Developers like you cannot stand the champion or the community. You waited way too long to address her problems and now the community is conflicted within itself on what to do with her.\n\n1) Give her a proper GU that doesn't bottleneck her into one role specifically and finds a way to unify both support and mid players.\n2) Address player concerns that her Mantra doesn't offer much skill expression and the fact that the majority of her abilities exist on other champions and item actives.\n3) Address player concerns that she is being abused in roles and lanes she shouldn't be in, like top lane Karma.\n4) Address her incomplete art assets, lack of a shield casting animation, rushed and incomplete VO, and in-game models that don't match the splast arts.\n5) Her lack of a gameplay identity other than sitting in the back and shielding or hoping a Mantra Q lands and deals damage.\n\nI know I'm going to be down-voted and harassed. I know players are not going to agree with me when they have their own favorites. I just want people to really understand something. Try being part of a champion community where your concerns, questions, feedback, passion and creativity is ignored from the very beginning of a VGU to the very end of the VGU to present day. Try watching a Developer with no knowledge of champion design, art and someone who doesn't even play the champion be in charge of a VGU that gave her half arsed content and an over the place kit and gameplay identity. Really think about all of the players who voiced their concerns and opinions about their champion and it goes largely ignored for 6 years, where the vocal majority that hated the problems with her left the game because they were unsatisfied. Fast forward to present day where Karma has back and fourth buffs and nerfs, a cancelled GU, a Development team that has commented on her problems and admitted that she needs a lot of work, and a divided community of mains that are all at each other because a Development team refuses to do their jobs and focus on another Ryze VGU or rework.\n\nRiot, when it comes to Karma you can care less. When it comes to new champions and popular ones you prioritize all types of work on them. It's been 6 years and there has been almost zero communication, work, and an actual care by you.

Or if the hope of fixing crit, and its design of promoting luck and devaluing skill is dead, and that those who dont want a game where luck can win a game on its own can just leave.
