The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png        \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Rakan**\r\n\r\nWe hit Rakan with a pretty substantial nerf to his W in 9.2, with the goal of reducing the reliability of his engage meaningfully. Looking at how that's gone it's probably hit him a bit too hard though. Current plan is to see how he performs in pro play, given the 9.2 changes were aimed at making him more balanceable between pro and regular play in part. Based off that and his solo queue performance we'll then either look at the best way to put some power back in general (outcome we think is likely) or at a way to give him power in solo queue without making him stronger in pro (less likely, but possible). That might include speeding his W up somewhat, since we erred on the large side with the change to make sure we got a meaningful difference but realize that comes at a meaningful feel hit for Rakan players. If that's not appropriate, or what we can do there's not enough by itself, other potential changes include an R buff (giving MS on button press towards enemies rather than on contact?) or Q buff (details TBD).\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Jungle post 9.2**\r\n\r\nWanted to share some initial observations and thoughts on how the 9.2 jungle changes have affected things so far. We're still digging into some of the data and the meta's still shifting a bit. These are preliminary current state of things notes as a result, rather than things we're certain will be the final stable state of the game\r\n\r\n* The XP changes seem to have put junglers on average at the intended levels by game time. While they can look large on paper, effect on total jungler XP hasn't been that dramatic given changes to XP scaling (not base), don't kick in immediately and junglers do get some other sources of XP. \r\n* We're seeing some junglers who rely on a strong power spike at 6 still doing fine, others struggling a bit. Need to look into those cases more.\r\n* Power changes for different types of jungler haven't been that large in most contexts. Really high MMR (high diamond and above) does stand out though, with the same patterns seen in average MMR but to significantly larger degrees. As you'd expect junglers who focus on heavy farming and getting ahead of the XP curve, particularly those who use Challenging Smite well, have lost out on the most power. Kha'Zix and Graves are good examples of that, both of whom we felt could do with a bit of a power down. \r\n\r\nOn the flip side of things we're seeing tanks performing somewhat better, again especially in high MMR. That's pretty expected, given tanks tend to perform better whenever a position shifts towards lower economy (XP and/or gold) states, given their contributions are less scaling dependent overall. Tanks in average MMRs by contrast haven't changed too much, though do seem to be benefiting a bit. We're keeping an eye on their performance in both contexts. Good to see some stronger tank performance overall, bit cautious about discrepancies between skill levels and organized play versus solo queue potentially leaving them too dominant in some contexts while being fine elsewhere, given that's a trend we've seen in the past.\r\n\r\nMore thoughts plus probably some statistics to dig through to come, potentially next week. We don't have any systemic tuning planned for the jungle in 9.3. Will assess again during the 9.4 development cycle though, see if any follow up's needed to the 9.2 changes beyond individual champ adjustments. We have been looking at level 2 ganking, with a pretty heavy hit to Camille in 9.3. Xin Zhao we don't think's such an issue by contrast, given he's got more meaningful weaknesses than she does, so makes a much heavier trade off for that early strength. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------         \r\n**Ranked 2019 so far**\r\n\r\nIn case you missed it we posted a run through earlier in the week of how the ranked season start has been going. TLDR is so far fairly smooth, looking into a few things with position ranks though (NA and KR). Image here summarizes our current plans with more details available in the links below. Given there have been some meaningful changes to ranked versus last year and that we've got ongoing work on the system too it's a topic we'll keep talking about quite a bit over the next few months too, try and give you folks as much insight as we can into what we're thinking, what we'll be doing, what feedback would be especially helpful etc.\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/AJEPJmn\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/8sVyEEQ5-ranked-2019-dev-update-1\r\n\r\nUpdate since time of writing: We’ve been digging into some bugs/issues that have been affecting matchmaking for regions with position ranked.

Probably because heavy utility doesnt seem to have any weight to the power budget of ap items since even utility items still give 80-100 ap.\n\nAP itemization is just really bad and has been for a while. AD subclasses all build differently. For example fighters, marksman and assassins all have different build paths, for AP it doesn't matter they all build samey regardless of what type of champion they are. Sylas really shows off the flaws of ap itemization as he is an ap bruiser without any AP bruiser items in the game for him to build.

While they can look large on paper, effect on total jungler XP hasn't been that dramatic given changes to XP scaling (not base), don't kick in immediately and junglers do get some other sources of XP. \n\nWith todays pro games we have seen junglers being 1-3 lvls down to solo laners and even below the ADC only ahead of the support. Is that really intended? I mean, I can't see the solution for a role being to make them more into a second support again or an early game role only.\n\nRight now the junglers have a lvl 3-6 XP hole (was there before) and then lack a bit of XP afterwards I would say. The problem of the junglers were not really the XP but the lvl 2 gank and that they had a bit too much time to gank early on. \n\nI think you did go a bit too far and didn't actually solve the real problems of the jungle. For a lazy change it was ok, but it was still just a band-aid that didn't fix the jungle.\n\n1. lvl 2 ganks: speed up minion spawn from 1:10 to 1:00 to remove leashes. At the same time give the jungler 2 stacks of smite from the start. This way you can still clear fine with smite at your first camp but are slower. This delays lvl 2 ganks enough to give laners time to also get to lvl 2 or ward.\n\n2. Change jungle XP sclaling to a slightly curved one (more growth early, less later): camp lvl 2-9 gives 115/125/135/140/145/150/155/160 XP (still less than before 9.2). I also brought back a scaling with each lvl because it seems so strange to just add XP every 2 lvls. I added one more lvl of XP at the end to not give too much XP back too fast.\n \n3. If an ally now kills a camp while you are near you now gain the XP from the jungle item still. This is just a small QoL change when you give over buffs to allies. You give them already the camp XP, you should not also lose the item XP\n\n4. Rift Scutter reward: 120/130/140/150/160/170/180/190/200 XP (lvl 2-10; lvl 1 XP = lvl 2 XP) instead of 115-207 (lvl 1-9).  Gold also down to 70-120\n\n5. Rift Scuttler Spawning: now spawns stacked. If both are alive and A dies, it has a 120 sec respawn timer. If A or B dies while the other one still has a respawn timer, its timer will not start till the first one respawned. Removes the RNG from the respawn and makes them spawn a bit more often.\n\nWhy?\n\n- junglers have a huge XP boost on their first camp but afterwards they are actually falling behind in XP pretty fast for a long time. This is why I made the XP not linear but a nice curve to increase XP at the second clear without increasing it even further on later clears. Wit the recent nerf they can still keep around till around lvl 3-4 but then fall behind decently fast (lvl 4 jungler vs lvl 6 solo laner). This gap needs to be reduced a bit.\n\n- Junglers after lvl 8+ fall off in XP so I added 2 more lvls of scaling for normal camps. They still don't each the old 172.5 XP at lvl 7 but at least 160 XP at lvl 9. It is still a nerf but gets them better into the mid/late game\n\n- Rift scuttler is mostly number clearing for clarity except for the respawn change. The respawn change also brings in more rift scuttlers so the reward was reduced a bit at the same time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Adalvar","date":"2019-02-01T16:36:49.964+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Meddler. \n\nAre Kayle and Morgana comming out in 9.3?\n\nAlso will you guys consider taking a look at {{item:3027}} ?

Maybe something like 25%-35% or maybe even 30%-40%. All the while taking away some, of not all of the AD he gets from E, it’s not completely “needed” and I believe it would really help his oppressiveness in lane when he randomly pokes you with q2. \n\nYou could also lower his passive damage mid-late but also increase the ways for aatrox himself to lower it. Whether it be by not just casting abilities and hitting with sweet spot that lowers the cd, but by hitting with both instances of W, maybe landing damage during the E buff, or even autoing during E buff or in general, or even autoing while in ult. \n\nI just reallllly think the ammo system is fully needed on him, or at least a renekton style E, maybe if he lands damage during buff duration he gets another charge? Maybe that can keep going until you miss? Although that may be too strong. \n\nI just thing the E is really gonna hurt him more than anyone wants. \nI hope you read this","replies":[]},{"poster":"pogcorn","date":"2019-02-01T19:09:10.913+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"please consider reverting the R duration and/or CD nerf to compensate his weak early game \n\n15s duration but keep current CD\n12s duration but lower CD\nnot both in the gutter","replies":[]},{"poster":"ooshawn","date":"2019-02-01T19:35:07.485+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"meddler, please do not leave his E in that state for a whole patch man.

The real issue is that people will exploit any complex system that you make.\n\n1. The most common is the duo que with swap.  Since your system wants to discourage lane swaps to a more favorable match up, Duos que up with their partners role and swap. Lowering the games MMR to give favorable matches of a Plat top main vs a silver top laner.\n\n2. If you're at 100 LP in your main, get Autofilled to a secondary and lose, you are removed from 100 lp in your main, forcing you to win again for 3 LP.\n\n\nHere is an example of a real rank system with no flaws.\n\n1. Keep our tiers (iron, bronze, silver, gold, etc.). \n\n2. Keep our 4 divisions in their tiers (4, 3, 2, 1). \n\n3. Make Promotional games only for going up in a tier (silver to gold aka silver 1 to gold 4).\n\n4. Remove LP and make the system a win and loss system that increases the number of wins needed to go up a division, based on your tier bracket.  For example, Silver needs 5 wins for each division and on the 5th win, you go up a division rank. But if you lose a game, it takes 1 more win to move up. Simple and straight forward, most importantly, gets rid of those rage tilt moments when you climb and get shafted by 1 LP like your current system does regularly.\n\n5. Keep the MMR as the match making system, but let the players see their MMR in the game hub under their account tab. I find it very stupid that you hide our MMR from us and don't let us see the real value of our time in your game.  You say sites like OP.GG are wrong, but until we see it from you, I cannot believe your MMR system isn't rigged to punish players in mid to low elos that are climbing, i remember last season i got an S- but got just 14 LP and a loss was 19 LP.

In general jungle in the grand history of league has not been the highest carry position. Adc or mid are usually those positions. Support, and somewhat less jungle/top tend to facilitate mid and adc carrying. This isn't too say jungles can't carry or tops or supports can't either, or even that adcs or mids can't play a facilitating the carry role, but traditionally speaking. It doesn't make much sense then if a position that isn't the primary carry of the game most (again keyword is most since there are a lot of jungle carries just not as much as mid or adc) of the time has much higher leveling capacity than the primary carries. \n\nA couple notes. Adcs are meant to be somewhat weak early which is why they require support. That is the trade-off for delaying their power till late.

We&amp;#039;re still digging into some of the data and the meta&amp;#039;s still shifting a bit. These are preliminary current state of things notes as a result, rather than things we&amp;#039;re certain will be the final stable state of the game\n> \n> * The XP changes seem to have put junglers on average at the intended levels by game time. While they can look large on paper, effect on total jungler XP hasn&amp;#039;t been that dramatic given changes to XP scaling (not base), don&amp;#039;t kick in immediately and junglers do get some other sources of XP. \n> * We&amp;#039;re seeing some junglers who rely on a strong power spike at 6 still doing fine, others struggling a bit. Need to look into those cases more.\n> * Power changes for different types of jungler haven&amp;#039;t been that large in most contexts. Really high MMR (high diamond and above) does stand out though, with the same patterns seen in average MMR but to significantly larger degrees. As you&amp;#039;d expect junglers who focus on heavy farming and getting ahead of the XP curve, particularly those who use Challenging Smite well, have lost out on the most power. Kha&amp;#039;Zix and Graves are good examples of that, both of whom we felt could do with a bit of a power down. \n> \n> On the flip side of things we&amp;#039;re seeing tanks performing somewhat better, again especially in high MMR. That&amp;#039;s pretty expected, given tanks tend to perform better whenever a position shifts towards lower economy (XP and/or gold) states, given their contributions are less scaling dependent overall. Tanks in average MMRs by contrast haven&amp;#039;t changed too much, though do seem to be benefiting a bit. We&amp;#039;re keeping an eye on their performance in both contexts. Good to see some stronger tank performance overall, bit cautious about discrepancies between skill levels and organized play versus solo queue potentially leaving them too dominant in some contexts while being fine elsewhere, given that&amp;#039;s a trend we&amp;#039;ve seen in the past.\n> \n> More thoughts plus probably some statistics to dig through to come, potentially next week. We don&amp;#039;t have any systemic tuning planned for the jungle in 9.3. Will assess again during the 9.4 development cycle though, see if any follow up&amp;#039;s needed to the 9.2 changes beyond individual champ adjustments. We have been looking at level 2 ganking, with a pretty heavy hit to Camille in 9.3. Xin Zhao we don&amp;#039;t think&amp;#039;s such an issue by contrast, given he&amp;#039;s got more meaningful weaknesses than she does, so makes a much heavier trade off for that early strength. \n> \n> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------         \n\n\nGoing to need to see the full stats because of right now it is all double speak as any amount of replays show otherwise and your selective hearing is avoiding all the threads and comments pointing otherwise of what you said above.\n\nScuttle needs to go for diversity sake.","replies":[]},{"poster":"smexxyhex","date":"2019-02-01T23:19:51.401+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Balance team needs to take a serious look at Sona and it's disheartening how forgotten she is.
