Next time (Thursday?) should be ready to take a look at what some more of the things we&#039;ll be working on in 7.8. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Magic Damage Shield UI**\r\n\r\nDuring Galio&#039;s development we identified that on tanky targets it was too difficult to tell how much damage they were taking if they had a long duration magic damage shield up, because of the similarities in color and tone between the enemy healthbar red and magic damage shield purple. As one of the steps to improving that we tweaked the magic damage shield bar color. Internal feedback on that change was that it read better. PBE feedback, as is often the case for changes that go out mid PBE cycle, was minimal. After the patch went live however we started seeing a lot of feedback from players who felt that the new color was too close to the regular shield UI, resulting in a different mislead instead. We&#039;ll be adjusting magic damage shield color use again as a result, both to find a point that avoids overlapping enemy health bars/regular shields and to put in some specific tunings for colorblind mode.   \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Things moving to 7.8**\r\n\r\nA couple of things that have been in testing during 7.7 will be moving to the 7.8 patch cycle instead:\r\n\r\n* Lissandra - Testing a new passive (tear style mana stacking and enhanced auto attacks post spell cast). We&#039;ll either ship that or, if it&#039;s not working out, the backup changes (Q AP ratio, maybe something else) next patch. Needed more time to test that passive properly.\r\n\r\n* Shen - We&#039;ve been looking at making some adjustments to Shen&#039;s kit to make him more balanceable in organized play versus regular match made games (if balanced for one ends up pretty unbalanced in the other, a long running Shen problem unfortunately). Those won&#039;t be ready for 7.7 as originally targeted though.\r\n\r\n* Bard - Changes to Bard&#039;s passive (adjusting which rewards at which Chime counts, more possible meeps) look promising. We&#039;ve got some concerns the numbers in testing are too strong a power boost however, so we&#039;ll probably be taking another patch to look into those too (chance this does still ship in 7.7 though depending on how testing goes).\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Unusual Playstyles Update**\r\n\r\nFor anyone that hasn&#039;t already seen it we posted a runthrough yesterday on how we&#039;ll be approaching unusual playstyles like Smite Support Nunu that come to player support&#039;s attention going forwards. From the gameplay side most important thing there is that trying to win is what counts. Link below which is well worth a read, we&#039;ll be talking more about how we distinguish between intent to win and trolling soonish too/ \r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/EtXQhs5J-weore-updating-our-policy-so-unusual-play-styles-dont-get-14-day-bans?comment=00030000","replies":[{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2017-03-28T18:03:56.926+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":7,"body":"Can we have a hint at the next new champion please?

This can only occur once every X seconds (maybe make it so when *you* CC an enemy the CD is reduced).

It was my birthday this past week, and I celebrated it on /r/JaxMains a bit and was wondering if as a late B-day gift you could give me some special insight about how {{champion:24}} and Jax related questions.  If you're strapped for time, please only answer the questions marked \"**IMPORTANT**\"\n\nObligatory: How is Jax right now performance wise? Any plans for buffs, nerfs, distant ideas for a an update of any sort? Is he even on the list of champions needing attention? What kind of attention would said attention focus on? VGU? Whole package?\n\n1. **IMPORTANT** Why does Jax's (W) Empower not give him extended range like so many other auto attack resets? It feels so bad to activate the spell then flub the auto reset because of the range. What's the balance costs for giving his W or his ult autos bonus range on those specific autos?\n\n2.  **IMPORTANT** Why does Jax have 125 Range for his basic attacks? \n(This is one that I hear a lot from /r/JaxMains that I think is really silly. \"giv mor rang pls\") I suspect it to have something to do with his versatile and long range mobility spell being on a relatively low cooldown as well as his access to hard CC.\n\n3. **IMPORTANT** (sub questions are not) Who even is supposed to build {{item:3124}}? It doesn't feel like Jax is supposed to build it but It seems like such an amazing item for jax to want to prioritize it. AS, AD, AP, Ghostly doubleAutos. But I can't even feel good about building it in 1/20 games because of the stack management and cost. Why does an item that cost so much have one of the strangest feeling gated usages?\n * Why does Guinsoo's have 6 stacks? Is that the sweetspot for Ranged and Melee Champs?\n * Why can't it have 8 stacks but generate 2 stacks per auto?\n * Is there a reason why a lot of stacking items/stats don't have the same \"falling stacks\" mechanic that Jax's passive has?\n * I actually really liked the AOE version of rageblade a while ago, Was it just too powerful in general, or where there just abusers of it's power that were too effective (cough, kog/jax)? Is there a reason why ranged champions just can't have a smaller AOE. or AOE scaling with range?\n\n4. Could you please tell me, statistically, if the new version of {{item:3153}} that's live right now better for Jax than older versions of BotRK? \n\n5. What 3 stats do you feel are most important for Jax? Personally, my top 3 stats are.\n 1. Attack Speed (Not all of it, just having enough attack speed is very important.)\n 2. Health (Jax already has a lot of damage mitigation tools, so just get HP to make it matter)\n 3. CDR (Jax feels really good with low CD's)\n\n6. **IMPORTANT ABOVE ALL ELSE**  Could you please harass the skin team, or send [Krepo and Froggen to do some sleuth work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBaTzBjp-gw) to find out if there are any skin ideas for Jax? (I don't like warden, sorry. Another Nemesis tier skin pls.) Is Jax's age holding him back from getting skins?  Or just lack of good ideas? In order of importance imo. Please ~~flame them~~  pass it on to them.\n * BattleBoss (or RaidBoss) in the arcade/boss line of skins. an EPIC weapon, Jetpack Q, and shiny particle effects for WER. Maybe he has an everything proof sheild text effect, or the skin gives off a general vibe that he's \"Cheating\" or not playing fairly, even though he's just better. \"omg ur hacking\", 'no i'm just really good hehe' \n * Project Jax. Lots of purple and blue please and an Amazing Future BASHING weapon.\n * Blood Moon Jax. Seems like a nobrainer considering all of the ionia champs and how he *sorta* has ties to Ionia? (Most ionian champs are graceful and elegant, but jax is a bash master who's in game mechanics, despite his lore of him being skillful, just plays and looks like a brute.)\n * Dragonslayer Jax (I'd like to imagine Jax trying to solo dragons in search for bigger badder prey)\n * D&D Warrior Jax. I have no ideas for this but I do like this.\n * Monster Hunter Jax (TBH I wasn't stoked about this line of skins, but same reasoning as dragonslayer)\n * El Macho Jax. He wears a mask, He boasts about finding worthy challenge, seems great! (Going to find a hard time looking for a weapon though :thinking:)\n * Nightmare Jax. I think that skin for tryndamere is really dope and would like to see one for jax, but I understand Trynd has the whole Pyramid head thing going for him with his massive sword.\n\n7. Jax Expanded VO like lux. Is Mr Erik Baa still able to be brought in for VO work in the future?\n\n\n---\n\nI also got some Jax ideas that are PROBABLY pointless, but I'd still like to ask you to indulge me and see how this shifts jax's power. EVEN if some of these changes don't fit him thematically. \n\nJax's (W) Empower feels really simple, noninteractive, and not entirely great sometimes. I have some ideas to make the item \"Overloaded\" and \"Cool\"\n\nEmpower gives other abilities special effects!\n\n* Empower Q reduces it's CD in exchange for damage, or some other effect like. APPLYING ON HIT EFFECTS, PLEASE LET JAX'S Q APPLY ON HIT EFFECTS.\n* Empower E increases the stun radius, damage, or stun duration based on how many attacks were dodged\n* Whenever Ultimate is cast Jax's W and R autos have very small AOE (like, malphite (W) Brutal Strikes sized.) for the duration of the ultimate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeitsu","date":"2017-03-29T17:49:25.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you feel about Aatrox changes?, you mentioned he was being looked at in 7.7 but we don't have more information about it since.
