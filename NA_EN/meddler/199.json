Telling us that you guys had plans and you'd learned from the Juggernaut update, and a great start to the transparency that followed.\n\n* The single champion update posts were amazing. Laying out a general idea, which abilities you guys liked or thought might need to change, identifying and expanding on the reasons why players _like_ those champions... All good to hear. Really enjoyed those and they came out at a good speed.\n\n* Not only did it come out on time...I think it was early, actually, right? IIRC when you guys announced it you said it would come out June-July most likely, but it actually dropped the first week of May! Freaking awesome. Shoulda been the Before Mid Year Mage Update tbh.\n\n*  The balance was reasonable. Sure maybe Malz released a little strong (but mostly in the Jungle...which was only possible cuz you guys listened to players saying they wanted Jungle Malz to stay, so ty) and Swain and Cass and Vlad were a little weak...that's fantastic, actually. Only a small handful of unbalanced champs when you guys reworked or introduced ENTIRE SYSTEMS (items, champs, dragons, red/blue buff, Rift Harold change). And they were hotfixed and things were mostly evened out a week or two after 6.9. Bravo. Clear progress since not only Worlds last year, but also the ridiculousness that Graves, MF, and Quinn brought with the Marksmen update.\n\n* Piggybacking off the above, new itemization was really good too. I'll be honest, I don't play many mages, but from what I've heard the new itemization is good. Community freaked out about the Protobelt...and just like Duskblade, you guys said it would probably be alright, and it was. Again, nice job. Looks like you set out your goals and dodged a lot of landmines.\n\nReally looking forward to hearing about the next class update. :)\n\nFor what it's worth, my vote goes for Skirmishers. Tryndamere (more specifically, his reliance on crit) is just _awful_.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"hopeful4","date":"2016-06-08T17:41:25.700+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Are you planning on releasing more items which are defined by their actives like Protobelt?

I can't see mid laners abusing that since they're generally the highest level player \n\n\nEdit: and what if the correct play is to scan a specific brush you need to not have vision in, compared to knowing they placed a ward somewhere not that useful, them you have a choice between the wrong play to get exp and the right one.
