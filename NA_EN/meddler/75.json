{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-07-18T15:18:20.310+0000","title":"Quick Gameplay Thoughts: July 18","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi folks,\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Usual Disclaimers**\r\n\r\nThese posts will often contain talk about future work we&#039;re doing, or planning to do, that isn&#039;t yet guaranteed to ship. The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Duskblade**\r\n\r\nContext in a previous post for anyone that missed it about how we&#039;ll be hotfixing more often now: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/qXAN1k8U-quick-gameplay-thoughts-july-14\r\n\r\nWe put out a hotfix to Duskblade yesterday, taking some damage off it. Compared to champion balance it tends to be harder to get a quick read on things with a more systemic effect like items, hence this balance hotfix being quite a bit after the patch compared to what you&#039;d expect for an individual character (needed the extra time over the weekend to make a better assessment). We&#039;ll be continuing to work on Duskblade in 7.15 at least as well, with the damage nerf not expected to be a final solve but instead just taking the edge off. Making the slow melee only&#039;s the likely first step, we&#039;re also considering lowering the damage again for ranged at least as well. Call on that will depend in part on how the somewhat nerfed version now on live performs. \r\n\r\nThe intent with that ranged damage nerf wouldn&#039;t be to make Duskblade unusable on ranged champions, but instead to make it appropriately powerful on them. Items like Duskblade should be reasonable fits on ranged AD caster champs, not just AD melee, so the issue is we believe not that they&#039;re using it in the first place, but that it&#039;s too effective on them comparatively. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Kayn**\r\n\r\nStill watching Kayn, doesn&#039;t look like he&#039;ll need any balance changes in 7.15. Player performance on him continues to improve as people get more experience, with a lot of the early failures starting to disappear now. We&#039;ll take another look in 7.16, looking in particular to see if things have stabilized enough to give a better read on assassin performance versus darkin performance (assassin&#039;s been lower, but we believe has been climbing more, so want to see how each form levels out, not just their comparative starting points). 7.15 will contain a number of bug fixes though for various bits and pieces on him.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Additional 7.15 balance changes**\r\n\r\nLooking at how the jungle meta&#039;s changed/champs have performed we&#039;ve got a few late changes coming in for 7.15:\r\n\r\n* Cho - Now too strong (buffs went too far). We&#039;ll be cutting some of the flat damage and % damage off E as a result (current numbers in testing: 20-60 and 3% instead of 20-80 and 4%). We did consider hotfix nerfing Cho along with Singed and Nunu, but concluded his state wasn&#039;t getting out of line as quickly and his counters were clearer.\r\n* Lee Sin/RekSai - We&#039;ll be pulling the nerfs to these two we&#039;ve had in testing, at least from 7.15. Goal with them was to open up jungle options more, we&#039;re already seeing shifts more towards tank junglers (in part driven by Cinderhulk changes) so belief is these nerfs made sense in the previous context but arguably don&#039;t at present. Will revisit after seeing where 7.15 lands.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-07-18T15:48:55.928+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just chiming in to thank you again for these posts you make, it's useful and interesting to know what reasonings are behind the changes that go (or don't go) on PBE :)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-07-18T17:53:59.761+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wukong Airlines","date":"2017-07-18T16:30:49.335+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Meddler, why were {{champion:77}}  changes fully reverted for the second time? will he be receiving different updates?\n\nand will{{champion:62}} receive any number changes/ passive update or rework in the near future?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-07-18T17:48:33.619+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"We don't yet have enough confidence in the Udyr direction, in particular how much he should/shouldn't be split pushed focused.
