The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Some thoughts on tanks + thoughts on damage part 1**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve seen quite a bit of player discussion around damage currently feeling really high. Also seen fair amount of discussion around tanks, and how some are struggling. Wanted to start today by talking about the tank side of things, given it&#039;s also part of the damage discussion. Further thoughts on damage in general to follow next week, there are quite a few different angles worth talking about, so wanted to split the conversation over more than one post. Talk next week will include some of our thinking on damage contributions from kits versus other sources in particular (e.g. where is ability to stack damage from items, runes etc healthy or problematic?). \r\n\r\nSome current thoughts on tanks then:\r\n\r\n1. Tanks played as supports are generally performing pretty solidly. Jungle and top tanks by contrast are more likely to struggle. A lot of that reflects what a team expects from higher gold/XP positions. Many tank patterns front load a lot of their contribution, which tends to be pretty consistent in power (CC that isn&#039;t very item/level dependent in particular). That means support tanks are more likely to still justify their spot even if tanks overall may be weaker.\r\n\r\n2. Most players are drawn much more to damage focused classes than non damage ones. Play rates for many tanks tend to be low relative to other options when they&#039;re equally balanced. \r\n\r\n3. That combination of some tanks (jungle and top struggling) and lower general appeal means metas occur, such as the present one, where there are few tanks being played. That contributes to damage feeling high for a couple of reasons. Teams without tanks lack a front line, so tend to get burst more due to the lack of soak/zoning. Metas without tanks also mean it&#039;s more likely that each team has 4, or even 5, damage threats on it as well though, especially if enchanters (the main other non damage group) are also being played less. Even if any individual champion&rsquo;s damage isn&rsquo;t any higher the game&#039;s going to feel much more lethal when there are 1, or even 2, more high damage champs per team.\r\n\r\n4. Given the above impact on how high damage the game feels, plus other benefits tanks bring (they give structure to team fights, help create more distinction between different members of a team etc) we think it&rsquo;s generally good for a team to have around one tank on average. That&rsquo;s not to say teams without tanks are bad and something we want to remove entirely, or that teams with multiple tanks are always problematic. Tanks being too common or too rare tends to create problems though, with one a team on average tending to lead to good metas. \r\n\r\n5. Some tanks are proving to have some of the difficulties being balanced between pro and regular play that a few other champs (Ryze etc) have. Gragas has also been such a case, Zac and Sejuani are now also creating some problems in that regard too, indicating our approach with their updates last year had some significant issues. \r\n\r\nSo, having tanks be good choice who get picked is something we think&rsquo;s important for the game, both to help keep damage output in check and for other reasons. In terms of what we&#039;re planning to do to support healthy amounts of tank play:\r\n\r\n1. We&#039;ll be looking at damage sources that are anti tank, particularly those that counter Armor/MR. Feeling is we&#039;ve pushed too far in terms of amount of pen/true damage offered. The reduction in true damage from IE&#039;s passive in 8.15 is the first part of that. Following changes will depend on how large an impact that does/doesn&rsquo;t have, plus the general state of the game. Need to be careful here not to swing back so hard that stacking tanks becomes optimal again, without sufficient ways to respond to it. \r\n\r\n2. We&#039;ll be buffing some individual tanks in 8.16, particularly those who&#039;ve been historically healthy even when strong and/or that we&#039;ve overnerfed this year.\r\n\r\n3. We&#039;ll be looking to reduce the organized team versus random team difference in effectiveness some tanks show. Not certain yet on timing of that. \r\n\r\n4. Longer term again we also want to work on kit satisfaction (feel, rather than power) for some tanks. Not sure when that will happen yet, could be quite a while off (e.g. not this year) depending on what other work on champions is also needed.\r\n\r\nTanks we&#039;ll be testing buffs for in 8.16 below. Not guaranteed all of these ship, possible others also get added, though this is our best estimate right now of the appropriate candidates. \r\n\r\n* Amumu\r\n* Nautilus\r\n* Sion\r\n* Leona\r\n* Rammus\r\n* Maokai (probably pretty jungle focused to avoid him defining top lane too much again)\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**Stats Tab** \r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve been testing a new stats tab in some regions recently. So far that&#039;s been doing pretty well. Plan as a result is to roll it out wider with a patch or two, barring any unexpected issues arising.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Next Champion Roadmap**\r\n\r\nShould be in early to mid August. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"A Nunu","date":"2018-07-27T18:29:58.717+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":1,"body":"#DON'T GIVE NUNU A DASH THANKS BYE\n https://i.imgur.com/b7Hjwht.png/img","replies":[{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2018-07-27T20:57:16.859+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm on the playtest team and I can confirm that he has multiple dashes.

Now that this is about tanks I was wondering if you could go more in depth on Zac and the possibility of a revert or partial revert.\n\nSorry about the wall of text, I have a lot to say on this issue and would really appreciate a response.\n\nGankr here, former Master tier Zac top/jungle main before the rework. Myself, along with many other former Zac mains have been extremely disappointed with the rework and the lack of communication about it. Back when the rework was taking place, we had Riot Shrieve talking to us on the subreddit ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thesecretweapon ) about the changes, but since then we have had nothing. Zac used to have much more versatility as a top laner as well as a jungler with different build paths depending on your play-style.\n\nHis Ult: One of the biggest complaints in the Zac mains community is that his new ultimate feels terrible to use, especially compared to the old one. It does no damage and is completely one dimensional. It either picks people up or it doesn't. The old ult actually required skill the maneuver yourself around in a teamfight to knock people in the direction that benefited the team. When his rework was announced, his ult was called a \"chaotic wukong ultimate\" which makes 0 sense to me. It is only chaotic if you use it like a Wukong ultimate. It is like saying Oriana R is a chaotic Diana E. If you use the Oriana R like an idiot, then that may be true, but if you actually know what you are doing it is more skilled version of a Diana E. It is the same thing with Old Zac R and Wukong R. His E also had it's knock up duration changed to scale with charge time because of this, which is a pretty large nerf, which I will get into later. Not only is this ult less reliable, and less satisfying, but the ability Zac was known for got nerfed to make room for it.\n\nTop Lane: Top lane Zac was a decently popular pick, even though it wasn't the strongest. It had a lot of counter play, but also had a lot of outplay potential. In this lane, you used to max Q in order to poke through minions and clear waves. The low cooldown and the surprisingly high damage made it core to this champion. Without this ability, it basically single-handedly destroyed Zac top. Another thing that killed Zac top is the E changes. His E used to be a 1 second knockup at all times which allowed for usage point blank. Without that his ability to duel or escape is much worse. The final problem with Toplane Zac is that his ult is pretty much useless in this lane. It does about 1/4 as much damage as his old ult, assuming your opponent is bad enough to get picked up in it, and it also doesn't give you a movespeed boost to be used as an escape from a gank or bad trade.\n\nHis Damage: One final issue I'd like to bring up is that his base damage on every single ability got destroyed. This further weakens his ability to fight other champs, which is especially terrible in a meta revolving around duelist junglers. Zac cannot be expected to exist in a meta where he needs to either fight off champions, or clear well, because right now he doesn't do either better than meta junglers.\n\nIf you want an even more in-depth version of this, here is a post I made a year ago that goes into each ability: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6f27eh/im_gankr_15m_mastery_points_zac_main_master_tier/?st=jj7jd9ey&sh=ad3eb579","replies":[{"poster":"BobbyBiggPlays","date":"2018-07-27T19:50:19.772+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Seconded, a reply from Riot about their thoughts on Zac would be really appreciated, especially given that he is specifically mentioned as a problem case by meddler in this post but then not listed as one of the champions receiving changes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WiegrafOfValor","date":"2018-07-27T17:53:25.187+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":3,"body":"#Meddler, can we have more utility on Tank items and Runes? I see no reason for runes such as Grasp and Aftershock to deal damage, and I really don't understand why the runes aimed for Tanks lack several tools that can help Tanks do their job in a healthy way.\n\nTake for example some ideas that can be use as Runes or Item concepts: \n\n* **[Item Concept]:** ACTIVE: Instantly unleash a shockwave, pulling all nearby enemies in 200 units towards the user.\n\n> The idea behind this item is to have a tool to protect your backline from mobile assassins or/and divers. Most of the times, even if you are Tanky enough to hold the enemy team, they can ignore you easily and unless you have a kit that can make the enemy focus you, such as having a taunt, there isn't much you can do. This item could change that.\n\n* **[Rune Concept]:** Taking damage drops shards that can be picked up by your allies that will restore their HP based on your maximum health, also once the user dies, a massive shard is dropped and the allied that pick it up restore X health based on your max HP, and gains X AR and X MR based on your stats for a short period of time. \n\n> This rune would help when you have to engage on a teamfight to create a opportunity, burning the enemy team CDs, costing your own life. That rune would make it so that the enemy team gets punished for focusing the tank. Which should be a good play by the Tank player, but more often then not it ends just being a waste since we have such short CDs nowadays.\n\n* **[Rune Concept]:** Gains passive Physical shield based on bonus AR, It regens after X seconds out of combat. When broken grants X Tenacity until the end of it's cooldown. Cooldown: 60 seconds.\n\n> This rune is made so it lessen the effect of a heavy poke laning opponent, that can set the Tank champion behind and create a frustrating laning phase. By making the tank have to wait for it's shield to regens before going into lane, creates room for the opponent to gain leads if poking right, without making the life of the Tank player miserable. Lategame can be useful for engaging and making use of the Tenacity to position yourself and create plays.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Thunderc0ck","date":"2018-07-27T23:43:17.199+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your first idea, conceptually, is horrible because Tanks already have the tools to lock down the enemies. Furthermore, the idea that you need to have a \"taunt\" to make enemies focus you is silly. If you're a tank, enemies WILL focus you because you should be bringing enough disruption by default so that if they don't focus you you'll make them have enough downtime through Crowd Control that they'll pay for it. It's a bad item idea that would be used by Juggernauts like Mundo or Darius to dive the enemy backline and screw the damage dealers harder than they already do.\n\nThe second idea could potentially work, but I don't think it would be that useful. There's a rune that already does this in Font of Life and you barely see it being used because life regeneration isn't useful later in the game. Early on it is, but scaling with Max HP OR Bonus HP means that it will always be at its most efficient late-game, at which point unless it regenerates ridiculous amounts of HP (which would make it broken), it will simply be bad over Lifesteal or straight defensive item choices like GA or Banshee's for the damage dealers. Also, the big shard that gives Armor and MR is an idea that I severely dislike simply because you're punishing the enemy team for taking down the tank. If you're unlucky, the enemy ADC picks up the shard, gets a ton of HP and resistances and you know will have a much harder time focusing them because you didn't kill them instantly (not to mention that it would be horrible to code with passives like Sejuani's around).\n\nThe third passive is a bland and simple shield with tenacity slapped on top of it. Lack of imagination and a simple power-increase on tanks is not what I would consider a \"utility rune\". It's either strong enough that you'd take it against most, if not all Physical-based matchups or it isn't and you just don't take it whatsoever.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2018-07-27T15:58:25.086+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":3,"body":"Damage has been high since runes reforged came out.  \n\nSince almost all runes are just Do X to get Y \n\nY being More damage.  \n\nPerhaps an interesting question you should think about should be.\n\n\" Why is it that Building Defensively when behind make zero difference in whether your opponent can still kill you\". \n\n^^^^.

Yeah the old ult ate up her power budget but it was a lot more fun/satisfying to use and I don't remember riot having the same problems for keeping her balanced back then.  \n\nTo be fair, I have to wonder if riot is starting to give too much skill expression to champs.  The fact that the pros pick and can do crazy stuff with perennially nerfed and underplayed champs speaks volumes about the those champions being poorly designed.  I say so because it's clear that those champs are designed exclusively for the pros and balanced completely around them.  Less skill expression would increase the stability of performance of champs, but you don't want to take too much out.  \n\nI would argue that a champ that is completely balanced around pro play, like Azir or Ryze, probably has a bit too much skill expression; you are forced to neglect the rest of the player base by keeping these champs nerfed and it's a clear example that the pros are playing a different game than the rest of us.  This is something riot has consistently been against and I think it's time to admit that the balance issues of those champs go directly against riot's philosophy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daoist","date":"2018-07-27T15:53:13.856+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":6,"body":"Hey Meddler, do you have any plans for {{champion:91}} ? \nHe is too much of a threat to roam, waveclear, and snowball in the mid lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ggplayer250","date":"2018-07-27T16:04:36.078+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hey Meddler, I see now {{item:3031}} is getting a buff to have a smoother buying process.\nBut I want to ask about the {{item:3089}} .

Right now, the highest we get is warmongs with 800, and it sucks as a single hp item as alot of it's power is gated by a 3k hp threshhold. If you compare that to the old days, Warmogns would either grant up to 1337hp and 45 hp/5 for compareable less gold that was gated behind a stacking mechanic so it wasn't to strong as a rush, and later we had it as 1k hp item with %hp regen even in combat. We no longer have an as self efficient item for raw HP to back up defstats only items or for provideing good baseline tankiness vs all damage types.\nOn top of that, tank items are generally pretty slot inefficient, often not even gold efficient, and their unique damage reduceing effects also got nerfed alot in time. I remember FH haveing more aura range with a stronger as-slow, and randuins active also slowing as by 35% fro quite some time...\nThen we have the lack of self-defensive keystones. Fleetfoodwork has a poor heal without high offstats for the scaleing, overheal and triumph are the strongest defensive runes but in a path that doesn't suit tanks, Grasp has most of it's power in the damage rather than the heal, Aftershock also has a good portion of it's power in the damage rather than it's defensive use, Guardian has half it's power on shielding allies and often doesn't activate when YOU would need it.\n\nHowever, the probbably biggest issue is champ design and crept up over the years. Back in the days, tanks did solid raw flatr damage vs squishy targets, but not much vs tanky opponents, supports hardly delt damage vs tanky targets aswell, partially becuase they couldn't affor much actuall items. Bruisers had overall less raw anti tank damage, and jungle most of the time also was a more supportive or atleast didn't scale that well damage wise(lee for example starting with good damage and then building tank). But most off all, mages were way more CD reliant and thus had far less dps, and magic damage overall beeing much less dps and more burst, so tanks could focus on armor as a single mr item usually was sufficent vs some abmbient aoe damage and to disway mages from trying to burst the tank.\nNow, about all tanks have %hp damage(exept malph and rammus), causeing them to be more dangerous vs other tanks, supports can afford to pick up more damage, and many of the support picks are even focused on dealing damage like brand or pyke, carryjunglers are very common, and we have alot easier acces/less trade offs for getting anti tank items like BotrK(compared to good ol madrets) or Liandrie's, and most mages, atleast the ones that are meta, have rather lowish CDs if not straight dps. For tanks(and bruisers), you usually can't get tanky for teamfights, you just can choose wether you want their mage+ambient to melt you or wether their adc should shred you, since you can only itemize properly against one of that, and at full built it feels like not even that is possible as an adc still shreds you through 5 armor items.\nThe damage of a single adc vs tanks might not be much higher than in days of old, but the damage of a full 5 man is alot higher than it used to, and the defens later on is lower rather than higher....\n\nI think it's also important to note that this issue applies to bruisers just as much. The only reason they are strong right now is because they dominate in the early lane, transition into a good midgame IF they have a lead and games snowball so strong that their still poor lategame doesn't really matter. But if they have to enter teamfights without a lead, or simply in the lategame, they can't do shit because they die way to quickly.\n\nBut apprently the only thing that comes to mind for you guys when some one underperformes is damage, like on Olaf for example. He currently has a bad overall performace, however he does well in the first 20 min and the drops like a stone. You're answer on PBE to that? Buff his W AS that only really matters for the early clears and duels without fixing any of his mid/lategame teamfight issues. How about finally not loosing the defstats of his ult when he needs them the most? Or boosting some base defstats, or increaseing the healincreas on his W at later ranks? NO, just slap a bit more dps on him and it'll be sure fine...\n\n\n----------------------\nIn terms of tank balance for pro and normal play, i think a good start would be removeing the dash+flash interaction that gets abused alot by Gragas and Seju. It gives them alot reliabillity especially for early ganks, which is very valuable for proplay, and it's a mechanic that i think shouldn't be in the game. it's basically 'cheating' on the hitbox of you're skill, giving you're opponents no option other than getting hit or preemptively flashing which then means you can trade a few sec CD vs 300sec of flash.\nImagin Ezreal beeing able to use flash duering his ult to alter it's path...\n\nAlso, how about reverting the tank update reworks? Mao is even more generalistic than he ever was, Zac is an abomination that is near impossible to balance in one mode, let alone for pro and regular at the same time, Seju has been an balance issue ever since and lost alot of her old identity in the progress without getting any improvments on her thematic...Also, Nauti want's his niche as CC-god back, and haveing each tank with enough CC to basically chain CC on their own is not great for the game. Especially as meele, whenever modern tanks are strong, it feels like you're no longer allowed to play the game as you're CCed 24/7 in every fight.","replies":[{"poster":"vulpeslingua","date":"2018-07-27T21:48:42.367+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love your analysis of the game over the years and especially highlighting specific parts related to the power and damage creep of the game!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pokemonred200","date":"2018-07-27T16:08:54.211+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regarding tanks, what do you think about their items?
