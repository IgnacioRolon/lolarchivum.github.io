{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-01-30T16:37:41.412+0000","title":"Quick Gameplay Thoughts: January 30","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi folks,\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**Usual Disclaimers**\r\n\r\nThese posts will often contain talk about future work we&#039;re doing, or planning to do, that isn&#039;t yet guaranteed to ship. The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Refinements to Bounties**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve got some adjustments to how bounties from CSing are calculated coming in 9.3. Our goal with introducing CS based bounties was to recognize when players and their teams were substantially ahead via CS gold and give catch up opportunities in those cases, rather than only when a player was ahead on kills. In some cases that&#039;s been working well, in others however players have been ending up with CS bounties not because they&#039;re ahead, but because they&#039;ve caught up since their last death. We&#039;ll be making some changes behind the scenes to the CS bounty calculation as a result so that the threshold to hit a bounty better reflects actual game state, meaning that you should only have a bounty from CSing when you&#039;re meaningfully ahead.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n\r\n**Healing on Akali Q**\r\n\r\nAt this point it&#039;s likely we&#039;ll be taking the healing off Akali Q. We&#039;re doing so because we believe the current set of tools Akali has means she&#039;s lacking in sufficient weaknesses, in lane in particular. Sustain is generally a tool we give to characters who have weaker all ins, or difficulty making an all in happen when they want. Akali&#039;s pretty good in both those regards however. Trying to trade and gradually grind down a champ with all in strength&#039;s normally a good response, sufficient healing nullifies that as a weakness however. Couple that with decent waveclear from Akali (in part because she uses energy, not mana), plus decent roaming to take advantage of that pushing, and it&#039;s hard to find strong enough weaknesses against her. That lack of clear enough weakness is then amplified again by Akali&#039;s ability to flex between multiple positions, allowing her to sometimes take a more advantageous match up. Being a flex pick isn&#039;t an inherently problematic thing, but it does add additional power to an already hard to punish kit. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s certainly possible that removing Akali&#039;s healing leaves her in a pretty rough spot overall though. In cases like this where a champion&#039;s been problematic for an extended period we&#039;ve had decent success in the past by taking a heavy pass to them to remove issues, then going back and adding power shortly after if needed once we&#039;ve seen where they&#039;ve landed. Zoe early last year was a good example of that, proving very difficult to get into an ok spot power and frustration wise with a series of smaller adjustments. Only after we took a really heavy pass and then put some power back in were we able to get her to a better, more stable state. We&#039;re looking at potentially bringing Akali&#039;s based HP5 up to average, from quite low, in 9.3 alongside the nerf, larger compensation, if needed, would be later though. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**More Updated Movement Animations**\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;ve got another round of updated walk/run (mainly) animations hitting the PBE shortly. Feedback on these once they&rsquo;re there much appreciated. As before we&rsquo;re targeting movement animations generally because they&rsquo;re seen so often, so they&rsquo;re a great way to improve a champion&rsquo;s overall visual quality for the time involved per animation.\r\n\r\n* Dr Mundo - Mundo does things his way. In this case that means getting an updated Q throw animation instead of a walk or run anim.\r\n* Gragas -  Updated base run \r\n* Katarina - Updated base run \r\n* Lux - New no boots walk anim and updated base run\r\n* Shen - New no boots walk\r\n* Twisted Fate - New no noots walk anim \r\n* Zyra - New no boots walk \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2019-01-30T16:39:40.881+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hi Meddler, can I ask for some  more context regarding the magical boots nerf since they seem really left field.

She would no longer be able to heal off the wave therefore reducing her sustain in lane phase and also make it a lot harder for her to heal in ranged matchups. Completely removing spell vamp/healing from Akali's kit seems like destroying an aspect of the champions identity that she has always had and removes one of the things that had always made her unique. As well I would argue her all-in isn't nearly as strong as other mid-lane assassins due to the delays in her burst caused by her passive circle and the delays on her ultimate,I feel like if her heal is removed she will just become like every other assassin but with worse burst potential.","replies":[{"poster":"Revert SyIas","date":"2019-01-30T21:40:04.885+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok wow this is probably the best solution I have read today.

Up to this point the focus on Akali's balance was the shroud. What to do about the shroud. Should the shroud make her untargetable by turrets. Is there enough counter play around the shroud. That along with the fact that all previous mentions on the work with Akali was that she would be \"Adjusted\" gave the impression that only the shroud would be touched and she would get compensation some other way. I was fine with the possibility of the shroud being nerfed to the ground but was interested in what might be the potential buffs. Then the heal and her sustain gets gutted and the shoe drops. \n\nWhile the Zoe approach to balancing is probably the best for champs like Akali who's abilities are so intertwined with each other that it is impossible to make a simple numeric adjustment to fix any integral issues, I would have been more comfortable if the plug was pulled early and communication was up front and honest about what your intentions were. I also feel like the community backlash from Akali players would have been lessened too if there wasn't moths of only discussing her shroud. \n\nI hope by the end of this Akali is still a skill expressive champ that can be played in Mid or Top with interesting mechanics to bring to the table. I can think of many interesting things that could be added to her passive mechanics, Q, or ultimate and I am sure you guys are already thinking about what possible paths you could take her.

Removing the charge system on E seems legit. But the second direction you mentioned, in your last QGT, is way better. Having only 1 E every 9-5 sec is bad. You are able to poke realy hard in the early game, but late it gets difficult to hit the comb right.\n2. Removing E's spell vamp against minions completely, is wrong. It's one of the only thing remaining from the old Aatrox.\n\nSolutions\n1. Take the second direction you mentioned with the renekton like E. It will help the enemy to play around it, since it will be on cd, sometime after the first cast. But it won't hurt his all in potential.\n2. Removing it, is the wrong choice. Perhaps you should just replace it. E.g. the second E cast (if renekton like E) gives you extra healing from all sources (including minions). This would still reduce his lane sustain and also lead to a more aggressive second e cast, instead of saving it as a disengage.\nOR at least increase the healing on champimos a little bit.\n\nThoughts\nPls try the second direction with his E. Somthing like 16-8 sec cd with the current 3-1 sec cd in between each cast. Also the recast has to be within 4 seconds so you can do the Q comb right.

I think it would be better if the Energize enhancement effect was spread out over all of the Energize items so they all scale based on the number Energize effects you have, instead of forcing Stormrazor to be a niche item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smeagiul","date":"2019-01-30T16:51:10.750+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hi Meddler, is support into the conversation to be looked at ? You guys posted 5 months that support items would be looked at, support tier 3 item aren't build by support (Remnant of the aspect HP just too low for the cost and what it used to give, and the other two are just not worth it just for the extra ward), I understand that locket was frustating to play against in a Meta where Tank Junglers could give a 2K shield but the game changed to a more early game focused kind of gameplay, think the item could see some changes (CD or Shield value idk to be honest). HP stats shard is irrelevant too in comparison to what you could get last season, and i know you guys have been trying to get Tank support out of the way for the past year cause of pro play but you need to know that even though you guys made a lot of changes to the relic line item ( HP nerfed, gold per 10 nerf, etc) Tank support will always be there in Pro play cause Pro know how to play around the Range vs Melee matchup and Aftershock helps a lot too when you can literally burst any enchanters with Alistar at lvl 2 with ignite. \nYou know i've been asking for a long time and sent a lot of messages but i think it would be nice to just have a conversation about the support role cause atm, it became a lot more offenssive then it should be, you're not rewarded as a support for being a support to your team but more like a second carry in the botlane especially with how weak Crit adcs are atm. You can talk to Maple about the multiple messages i sent if you want to.\n\nHave a nice day anyway, in the hope you'll see this.","replies":[]}]}
