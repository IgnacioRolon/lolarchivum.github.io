For some champs, Urgot being a good example, they're only going to be somewhat accurate as a result. Marksman/tank for example implies some pretty contradictory things - squishy to protect versus front line initiator or fight controller, builder of primarily offensive items versus primarily defensive items, high value squishy target to kill if you can versus hard to kill target to kill if you must etc. It's possible that that combination of tags may still be the best shorthand to describe a champion though, the overall message being more important than the details. Also as a side note Urgot should probably be a marksman/fighter rather than marksman/tank.\n\nIn terms of design space there there's definitely a lot to explore. Support/assassin is one I feel's got a lot of potential in particular - imagine a character with an assassin like play style (squishy, active defensives instead of toughness, flanks the enemy) who, after going in, grants various team utility effects, rather than trying to explode a single enemy.

Considering he's got the least escape potential of any adc as far as I know (an area slow with a cast time, and an ultimate, but no escape and super-slow move speed), why doesn't he have the same kind of ridiculous damage that, for example, Jinx has?

Our goal with signature abilities is to distinctive skills that are situationally extremely powerful (if used right) but not universally overwhelming. Something we're working on at the moment is making our champion roster, both new and existing champions, more distinct where possible, and putting power into iconic abilities tends to be a great way to do that. Having said that there are still a lot of general design principles it's important to follow despite that. Counterplay's one of the big ones, and somewhere Vi's ult, cool skill though it is, is a bit narrow (counterplay's too dependent on the skillset of the target, abilities are usually healthier where there are some accessible universal counterplay options).\n\n2. A champion's initial damage numbers in early testing are usually just a rough estimate based off somewhat similar abilities (e.g. if creating a single target click to hit ability a designer might look at Annie's Q as a starting point). Early prototyping's not focused on numbers much though, it's the concepts of what the skills might do (is this fun, interesting a good thematic fit for the character, adding some new to the game etc) that we focus on. As a result numbers just need to be balanced enough to give useful testing on that stuff/not heavily distort the test for other test points.\n\n3.

The mechanics of how skills work, concepts of what new they offer, distinct niche a champion could occupy, new experiences for the player are the things that matter most. Describing and analyzing how Thresh can pull an ally to himself is much more important a thing to think about and focus communication on than how much damage his E passive does.\n\n* Put power more on the most interesting parts of the kit, not on the needed, but familiar, bits that help the character function. Blitzcrank for example would be a much less interesting, fun champion if his Q range was dramatically shorter and his base stats were much higher.\n\n* Ask yourself whether something's a good idea, or a good idea for this particular character. This is one we run into all the time, cool skills that just aren't a good fit for the champ in question. Fizz for example had the ability to place springboard traps on the ground he and his team could run over to bounce in an early kit. Was a lot of fun, and a skill we'll do sometime on some champ, but didn't offer him what he needed to function as an assassin.\n\n* Try and restrain the number of different effects you put on abilities where possible. The fewer effects you have the more impacting and distinctive each can be. To be extreme imagine a skill that did 12 different things when it hit an enemy for example - each is going to have to be so weak it's hard to feel and not worth playing around.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-08-26T03:00:19.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meddler, what are you thoughts on Poppy?  \n\nI really like that she's got versitile build options and playstyles, I also like how she's kind of strong if she can get items and get into the late game.

Gangplank's ultimate, Kennen's ultimate, Sion's passive, and Brand's ultimate come to mind off the top of my head. Given the apparent tendency towards the removal of randomness in game (Sion is getting a rework, dodge was removed, Baron spells won't be random post SR-update), what is your position regarding a potential rework for those abilities?\n\nIn my opinion, having to compensate for the low possibility of maximum effect has a negative pressure on the average use case of the ability. For instance, Brand's ult could hit his main target 3 times for some really impressive damage.... or it could go over to the side and kill some minons. Kennen's ultimate isn't guaranteed to hit a specific person for pushing 2 seconds.\n\nSecondly, is there a particular reason Brand's ult doesn't have a bounce range indicator like Nami's Ebb and Flow does?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-08-26T04:04:13.410+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, randomness without good justification's something we're removing.

I haven't played enough Kennen myself though to judge whether there's enough there that's worthwhile or not though. Brand's ult I agree can be extremely frustrating, it does mean that fighting Brand, even when he's underfed, is always a risky endeavor and so any Brand should be treated with caution, something that's got some value in a non mobile, low utility mage (reduces irrelevance when behind).\n\nCan't think of a good reason for Brand ult not to have that indicator, we'll add it.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-08-26T04:08:02.026+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's the justification for keeping critical strikes in the game?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-08-26T07:48:36.812+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think actually worse(read \"far more frustrating\") than Brand is Fiddle with his spamable e, especially as it can chain-silence you with a single spell from time to time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hamadriade","date":"2014-08-24T22:17:07.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can you tell us something about a sand mage concept please?

Maybe change my perspective on why these things exist.\n\nAlso PS: When is Ezreal W going to be changed into something more unique QQ could give you so many suggestions for it to be changed.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-08-24T23:39:53.526+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tying too much of a champion's damage up in a single spell can lead to some power curve problems (Zilean for example bullies incredibly hard early while he's maxing Q and then falls off unsatisfyingly hard). Having said that though having high damage on a basic ability isn't necessarily problematic in my eyes - not every character needs to be three damaging abilities plus a high damage ult, even if they're played in a damage role, and non damaging abilities can open up a lot of gameplay space (e.g. Anivia's wall). Are there particular problems you see with such abilities?\n\nAgreed, Ezreal's W is the least interesting and least satisfying part of his kit. We're certainly open to improving it, though would want to do so in a way that didn't remove an intended weakness or just straight out overpower his kit (hence the removal of the old attack speed slow for example - strong duelist against other marksmen's not a core part of Ezreal's intended identity.).","replies":[{"poster":"Amariithynar","date":"2014-08-25T06:39:36.639+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, to that I say- isn't Ezreal an explorer? Yet all he has are skillshots and a teleport-nearest-hit. Nothing he has actually suggests that explorer portion of his background- So why not something to do with that? Have him toss out an invincible ten second ward, or be able to see into bushes even without poking them, or something thematically appropriate.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-08-26T03:20:16.305+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like the thematic tie in, agreed that side of his character's underutilized. Would want to find something a bit broader than just vision utility for him, that sort of approach can be a solid starting point though, especially since would want to find something that wasn't just damage in order to give the skill a clearer point of distinction.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"zork824","date":"2014-08-24T22:43:14.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How did you come up with Yasuo?

Control over the wind was something the Yasuo pod (a group of developers working on a project) hit on pretty early, which resonated well both with the themes we were going for (wanderer, speed, power) and with the way the art was going.\n\nDouble crit chance was identified as a way to offer a melee champion a needed steroid while also changing up how the character thought about itemization a bit (Yasuo's early item choices are very different than they'd be if he had a +AD steroid for example, which leads to a different set of choices and experiences than on other champions).","replies":[]}]}]}
