The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n\r\n**Surveys**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do a lot of surveying each week to help us understand what's on players' minds. It's not something we talk about that much though, so figured it would be good to give anyone interested some more details. The surveys we do range from really simple (one or two boxes to tick after the game), to collecting general feedback (couple of questions and a box to type open feedback into) to quite lengthy (a link to an external website with a comprehensive set of questions about a range of topics). Over the last couple of weeks so some of topics we've been asking about include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* How important players feel the Honor system is or isn't\r\n\r\n* What players feel are are appropriate and inappropriate summoner names\r\n\r\n* Perceptions of queue time\r\n\r\n* The state of game Balance and what players feel needs buffing or nerfing\r\n\r\n* Attitudes to voice chat\r\n\r\n* Which champions people are excited to see interact in future stories (e.g. Swain/Darius, Ornn/Voli/Anivia, Garen/Kat, GP/MF etc, with a big list of possible combinations to chose from)\r\n\r\n* Perceptions of Swain. We ask about all new champs and VGUs, plus many of the smaller updates, both to players playing the champ in question and other in game with them. We survey just after their release and then again at least once a while later once things have settled down balance and perception wise.\r\n\r\n* Kai'Sa surveying, including thoughts about the release process too (what do people think about the teaser, reveal, comic, spotlight etc)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen conducting these surveys we want to get as accurate a reflection of the player base, or a targeted subset of it (e.g. ARAM players, or junglers) as possible. That means random selection from accounts within that target population and ensuring we're also getting a representative mix of accounts in terms of factors like what time of day someone normally plays or their MMR, assuming those aren't part of the initial targeting process (e.g. new players only, or Diamond plus players only). We'll also do surveying across a range of different regions to try and get as good a handle as possible on global player feelings. Lot of risk of unintentionally biasing towards feedback from English speaking regions otherwise, given we can read a lot of player feedback in it online easily ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of that need for randomized surveying to get a representative result we don't usually do opt in surveys for whoever's interested. Definitely understand the desire a number of people have to contribute to surveying on stuff about the game. The issue though is that people actively looking to take part in surveys tend to be non representative of the larger group you're trying to build up an understanding of. That most commonly means they're much more invested in the subject in question, which will lead to results that show much higher than accurate amounts of caring, positivity, negativity, engagement (or past engagement) with the game etc. One thing we might be able to do however for anyone interested in the survey side of things is posting more of the data we gather. If there are particular things you'd be interested in seeing survey results for let me know and I'll chat with our data folks about what's possible. I expect there'll be some things we can't share (probably some commercially sensitive data for example at a guess), but should also be some things we can post and talk about more. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n\r\n**Hiding Healthbars**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall thing, but following up on it since it was asked about in one of these threads a while back. We've got a change in for 8.6 where, if you've got hide healthbars turned on, it'll also hide them even when you mouseover the unit in question. Goal there is to make it a bit easier for video creators who want to hide health bars to make content. \r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n\r\n**On My Way Pings**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe're also doing some work at the moment on the 'On my way' pings to try and make it so they convey some information about how far away the person coming is when they ping (e.g. Nocturne is coming from very far away versus Malphite is nearly there). Looking at things like somewhat different sounds, visual effects and chat messages to communicate that. It'll be a bit before that's ready for PBE still because it's being worked on by a few folks from Champion team in the gaps in their schedule between champion work. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Mono Hearted","date":"2018-03-14T16:10:38.365+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey Meddler, what do you think about shifting ADCs back into a more \"sustained damage\" role compared to a burst damage role in the late game? In past season where I played, probably s3-6, that seemed to be the case, but the advent of the energizer/crit-rush build made it so that marksmen were dishing out huge amounts of damage in 1-3 auto attacks, which I personally believe is why the meta is so marksmen-focused currently.\n\nI remember there were nerfs a while back making IE a worse first buy, I believe through nerfing crit chance on it and shifting it to the zeal items, but the energizer meta seems to make it still the best choice most of the time.

But buffing the anti-attack side as a release valve to marksfolks means you have a 1100 gold super efficient hard counter for a number of top/jungle champs like Aatrox, Xin, Yi, Yasuo, Trynda, etc. Right now, Tabi is probably too generally good, but after your suggestion, Tabi will be worth against some champs (Darius, Renekton, Pantheon, etc.), but simply buying this cheap item will almost be an instant win against a number of other melee champs. And I'm not sure that's a desirable state of the game, even though I agree we need a release valve against marksfolks. I think Thornmail and Randuin work better as release valve, and Tabi shouldn't be too much of a hard-counter, because it's too cheap to allow that.","replies":[{"poster":"Steelflame","date":"2018-03-14T18:33:12.368+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember that the reduced armor is also a factor.
