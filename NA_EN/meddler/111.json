{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-07-25T20:34:47.592+0000","title":"Early Game Changes Update","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi folks,\r\n\r\nQuick update on the early game changes we talked about last week (link below for anyone unfamiliar with them).\r\n\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/B2y4p4vE-pre-worlds-early-game-update\r\n\r\nOver the last few days we&#039;ve been gathering feedback from a number of pro players, coaches and analysts from multiple regions. One of the big reoccurring comments was that the collateral damage from the cannon minion change was much higher than we were accounting for. General feeling was that while it would make it more costly to lane swap (desired), it would also disrupt a lot of other play, strategic movement especially, later on in the game in the 5 to 20 minute period (undesired). Based off that concern, some follow up playtesting and some strong arguments that the other changes would already add significant cost to lane swapping, we&#039;ve decided to remove the cannon minion change. We believe that we need to make changes to encourage more early game interaction, the cannon minion change looks like a case of too high a price for that though, at least at this time of year. \r\n\r\nSome good questions were also raised about the tower AI changes currently scheduled for a later patch. We haven&#039;t got those into playtesting yet, but will be investigating those issues as soon as we can, particularly around their effects on early risk taking. It&#039;s possible we might end up delaying some of those AI changes to Pre-Season. We believe they&#039;ll be good for the game once tuned appropriately, might or might not be the right time for them though. We&#039;ll assess whether or not they make sense once we&#039;ve seen what the impact of 6.15 is like and once we&#039;ve been able to get some feedback on them direct in game, PBE included. \r\n\r\nWe also particularly want to get feedback from a number of pro teams that we haven&#039;t spoken with, especially given there are some regions we haven&#039;t yet been able to get more organized feedback from. While we aren&#039;t planning any other major systemic changes before pre-season we will tweak existing numbers if appropriate in patches 6.16-6.18 (thinks like Fortification duration, amount of gold for first tower kill etc). Ongoing feedback&#039;s going to be especially valuable there. \r\n \r\nTLDR:\r\nNo cannon minion changes \r\nMight delay some of the tower AI changes","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-25T20:38:41.668+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"While you guys are looking at tower AI and with the precedence of the tower spells from the new RGM Nexus Siege, I encourage you to look at new opportunities for Ohmwrecker :3","replies":[{"poster":"MythHunt","date":"2016-08-22T21:04:04.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if instead of dissabling the turret, ohmwrecker changes it allegiance for 3 secs.\nAttacking the enemies or enemy minions instead of you or allied minions?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SlashStriker","date":"2016-07-25T20:36:20.354+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"do you have any interest in giving the minions special abilities?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-07-25T20:38:49.506+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might at some point, that'd almost certainly be a mid-season or pre-season change though unless it was the best way to solve a specific, urgent problem.

That's not skillful, it's not a play that's going to make me say \"Whoa! Svenskeren just won his team the game with that early aggression\". It's a play that will make me say \"Ugh. Sure, let's just give this jungler a bonus Flash that lets her get out of turret range while also canceling any turret shot currently coming at her, and no one else has this...this is fair. There was counterplay to this. Elise just needs to occupy a ban slot at all times if they don't want to deal with this.\"\n\nIt's obnoxious. Early game dives should still work, but the trade off for diving someone who is **full health** should be \"Okay, we gave up a kill, but we got more assists because we were grouped up, so we still came out ahead\".
