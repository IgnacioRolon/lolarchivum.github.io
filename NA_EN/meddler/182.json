Really looking forward to seeing everyone&#039;s thoughts after it does. Some bits and pieces below in the meantime.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Support Basic Attacks**\r\n\r\nAs part of our ongoing work on the support position we&#039;ve got a mixture of both large and small changes planned. We&#039;ve talked about the revised support starting items already, which is the largest support focused piece in mid-season. As a smaller change though we&#039;ve also got some feel improvements to the basic attacks of various champions often played as support too. Those are generally champs who aren&#039;t very auto attack based. On one hand that means having a good feeling auto attack isn&#039;t as critical as it is on say a marksmen. On the other hand it&#039;s also tended to mean their attacks haven&#039;t received the same attention in past, so there&#039;s a lot of room for improvement. We&#039;ve got some tweaks coming to Sona, Morg, Annie, Janna, Nami and Soraka in 7.9.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Ancient Coin** \r\n\r\nThe ancient coin line changes will hopefully be one of the more interesting things hitting PBE today, at least for bot lane players. For anyone wanting to do a bit of early theorycrafting the stats we&#039;re currently testing on Coin at 22g at Tier 1 and 32g at Tiers 2 and 3 on gold coins, with 8% missing mana restored on mana coins. More details on our goals with those items to follow later today, we&#039;re hoping amongst other things to make Coin a more interesting and appealing choice on a wider range of champions. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**10 Bans in Ranked and Draft**\r\n\r\nWe haven&#039;t talked about ban changes for a bit, they&#039;re certainly not forgotten though. Should be able to get back to some details about that after mid-season, with work on the new client coming along well getting some needed pre-requisites out of the way. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Poacher&#039;s Dirk**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re also testing out some small tweaks to Poacher&#039;s Dirk in 7.9. It&#039;s an item that&#039;s under performed since its introduction that we&#039;ve hesitated to buff because some of its likely potential users have been challenging to balance. We&#039;re at the point though where we think we can make at least some changes to make it a bit more attractive versus just buying a couple of long swords to upgrade later. We&#039;re looking at  a lower cost and CD, paired with a bit less AD, as a result.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-04-18T16:27:43.796+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should change the name of these segments to Meddler's Musings. it's pretty catchy imo","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2017-04-18T17:07:20.420+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Enter the Mind of the Meddler\"\n\n\"Meddler: Mindfreak\"","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-04-18T17:13:28.815+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":0,"body":"In Beddler with Meddler","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-04-18T17:45:01.476+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god please no.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-04-18T18:17:20.004+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah post them all at night so that it makes sense too","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2017-04-18T17:24:52.407+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2017-04-18T21:06:23.674+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Meddler: Mind-Phreak\"\n\nFTFY","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hige","date":"2017-04-18T16:08:14.150+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"still a bit scared about coin... allowing gold to be obtained like that will further empower mages and even adcs to play as supports even if they aren't precisely healthy for the role, malzahar comes to mind and currently MF is probably walking that path too... but we'll see","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-04-18T16:25:20.230+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget anyone getting Coin is giving up the Spellthief's line.

Allowing even one more cast in a 30-40 second time span would more then outweigh the damage boost, so if it is reasonable restoration and reasonably easy to access the coins I would expect a switch. On the other hand though lots of the supports who take coin currently do it because it is lower risk then spellthief, so making it appropriate risk/reward for the former group is likely to make it poor for the latter.\n\nI have not tried it on the pbe yet mind, and given the ping playing from europe is not practical, so there is a decent chance I am wrong, but from just hearing about the mechanics I'm not enthusiastic.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-04-18T17:47:08.625+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's certainly some risk on the mana side yeah, though so far it's tested pretty reasonably in that regard.

It seems like it will make them have a much less safe laning phase especially when up against Blitzcrank and Thresh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Last Ballad","date":"2017-04-19T07:57:03.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would there be room in the future for Murksphere(that one support item from BMB) to come back in some form? Because currently there is no support item that directly synergizes with how more passive enchanters wish to play. \n\nMages have a support item that gives gold for attacking the enemy. New changes also give them \"Netherstride Grimoire\"(also from BMB) type passive upon stack discharge.\n\nTanks have an item that gives pretty efficient tank stats, which are pretty close to {{item:1054}}, and stat wise, way better than the other support items when compared their dorian's equivalent (coin is worth a {{item:1004}}+little bit of CDR). The new changes also further the ability for tanks to absorb damage in teamfights.\n\nAnd the new coin seems geared towards the supports that want to be up in the enemy's face, zoning them off of the minion wave with the threat of engage({{champion:412}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:497}}), and while the quest rewards are helpful to enchanters, it doesn't benefit them more than it would (almost) any other type of support. The extra point more helps out those champs who have multiple skills in their kit that are necessary for their playstyle, and you want points in them almost equally(Thresh q/e, Blitz q/e, Rakan w/e). Enchanter's on the other hand, usually max their shield/heal first, then everything else is rather meh as far as adding power to their kits goes(an argument could be made for Soraka though, what with the regen from her q, but she of all the supports needs correct positioning the most). \n\nSo supports like {{champion:40}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:117}} don't fit into any of these play styles, especially coin's which presents them with the choice \"put yourself out of position and into danger, or you get no gold\", and none of the quests' rewards really synergize with them either. Only one is helpful, and even then not in a synergistic way.\n\n-\n\nNow, do not take this as me railing against the coin change, because I see that it is necessary. And those champs shouldn't be able to just sit in the back and almost afk for their gold(Janna and Soraka are in my top 5 highest mastery champs, bty). But they also shouldn't be forced to play against how their kits require them to, just to get gold.\n\nAnd that is where Murksphere would come in. The enchanters, as a class, prefer to go in for short trades and, by either reducing the damage done with a shield or just healing the damage done back, slowly wear down their enemies in a battle of attrition. They also tend(or, at least, they seem) to build the most active items out of the classes, and are therefore more likely to get more use out of {{item:2045}}. \n\nAs of August 2015, Murksphere had the stats of\n\n\n> Stats\n> +25% base mana regeneration\n> +5% cooldown reduction\n> \n>  UNIQUE â€“ SWINDLER'S SHIELD: Shields target ally from the next 60 damage. You generate 1 gold for every 4 damage absorbed (maximum of 15). Self-cast shields will not generate gold from monster damage. 15 second cooldown\n\nSound familiar? That's because {{item:3301}} has the exact same stats, though without the active attached.\n\nThe short cooldown of Murksphere, pared with the fact that most of the enchanter's \"enchanting\" skills are less than the cooldown, would mean that the enchanters would have to actively engage in combat in order to gain gold, yet in a way that synergizes with their build path(globe of trust built out of forbidden idol) and playstyle. The potential issues are that you would be unable to make an eye item out of it, as it already has an active(however, that would also cement it as the pure support item, built for going with {{item:2045}}), and the fact that an extra sheild, with nearly Karma's lvl 1 streangth, might make it overpowered(though changing it to be based upon target's lvl would work, as not to be overbearing lvl's 1-3)\n\nAs for the quest, I personally like the idea of giving the support's a shield whenever an ally that they shielded or healed took damage, up to half of the effect(or a max of 300?) that stacks(if multiple allies affected and taking damage, stronger shield for the enchanter), but wears off after a while(sort of like {{item:3072}}, but instead of refreshing upon doing damage, it refreshes upon an shielded or healed ally taking damage). An enchanter protects the team, should the team not do the same for them?\n  (It just seems that it would be fitting{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} )\n\nIf the gold gen is used off cooldown, and having it be used fully each time(both happening is slim), isn't even that far off the other items. It would place the gold gen at 60g per min, with 100% being earned actively, compared to {{item:3303}}'s of 60g per min(taking into account the passive 2g per 10), {{item:3302}}'s range of 50-82g(2 castor minions - cannon minion+melee minion and the 2g per 10) per min, and new coin's ~76g(depending on drops and finalized value, with the 2g per 10)\n\nThis would also free the coin to be directed fully to the likes of {{champion:53}} {{champion:412}} and {{champion:497}}, instead of them having to share a gold gen item with a class that wishes to position in a completely different way than them.\n\n-\n\nIf you survived that massive wall of text (I ONLY MEANT IT TO BE A FEW PARAGRAPHS! WHAT HAPPENED?! Ñ‰(ÂºÐ”ÂºÑ‰) ), thank you for reading through all my rambling.\n\nEven if using the Murksphere and derivatives isn't feasible due to data you collected during the BMB, or you can not think of a way to balance it to use in today's League, I urge you to look into a support item for the enchanter's that does not force them out of their play pattern so massively.\n\nSincerely, \nAnd enthusiastic ~~god~~ _**support **_ of the rift.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2017-04-20T04:17:00.669+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lulu is mainly a poke support, why were u building coin on her?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Oelyk","date":"2017-04-18T16:04:17.548+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the prospect of happing support auto attacks being more interesting besides procing spellthief and bandit gold, but I am a bit concern that you included Annie in that list...

I only play Support and honestly relying on pickups for gold is not a good mechanic. As a Thresh, you already miss a lot of souls because it's absolutely not safe to walk over a minion corpse. When this sort of mini-game mechanic starts starving gold income, it's really bad. The coin pickup gravity radius (of sorts) would need to be much larger than Thresh souls or else you'll be leaving a lot on the map.\nDid anyone internally ask the broader player base of Supports if Coin is a problem?  I for one like that while my overall gold income may be lower over time, that I don't have to do kitchy things for income (and the added sustain matters a lot for squishy enchanters or can't run forward to pick up scraps).\n\nCan we have a discussion that doesn't start with this decision already being made instead of tweaks to it?  It's really not appealing on so many levels.\nThe triumverate works well now.  One for sturdy melee, one for dmg/pokey ranged, and one for those champs that really, never want to be near opponents.  So not you're forcing them to walk into potentially dangerous situations just to acquire the game's most basic currency?\nSorry, another edit.
