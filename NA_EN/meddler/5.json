The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**CC Score at end of game**\r\n\r\nWe mentioned this at mid-season, it&#039;s been delayed until now though. Short version is a CC stat at the end of game that reflects how much CC each champion in the game has applied. Should be shipping in the next patch (7.12). We ended up having to get the system rewritten because the original version imposed a higher than appropriate server load (scripted in an inefficient manner).\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**10 Bans in match made games**\r\n\r\nShould now be live everywhere, or just about to be. Looking at its effects so far they look pretty good, with champ select times down noticeably, dodge rates (deliberate or accidental) no higher than before and annecdotal feedback fairly positive. Still monitoring all of those things though of course.\r\n\r\nIn terms of champion ban rates Yasuo&#039;s has spiked up significantly, other champions look fairly unaffected. Will want to see how that does or doesn&#039;t change over the next couple of weeks and what the trend&#039;s like in other regions (since we&#039;re just looking at NA data for now since that&#039;s where it was initially rolled out). Pick/ban rates can vary dramatically region to region so it&#039;s possible there will be some other high ban rate cases out there, would also expect Yasuo&#039;s ban rate to be significantly lower in at least some NA regions based off historical trends.\r\n\r\nMore thoughts on 10 bans to come soonish.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**7.13 Balance Changes**\r\n\r\nDetails to come next week, some of the targets we&#039;re considering though are:\r\n\r\nNerfs - Kennen, Fiora, Galio\r\nBuffs - Cho&#039;Gath, Poppy, Gnar, Trundle, Maokai\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Existing Keystones Masteries as New Runes**\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that we&#039;ll transfer at least a couple of existing masteries, with some modifications, into the new runes system. We&#039;ve got some in mind already that we&#039;ve been testing, wanted to throw the question open to you folks as well though. Poll below for which of the current keystones you&#039;d be most interested in seeing translated over, also really interested in hearing thoughts as to why though of course.","replies":[{"poster":"SSJ CARROT","date":"2017-06-08T17:34:06.318+0000","up_votes":91,"down_votes":7,"body":"Can you guys please check out sivir..\nshe has lost her entire purpose... 500 range, gets bullied in lane by literally everyone. low base atk speed..so her dps is quite bad, and her utility is  not even that good, ashe/varus has better ultis.","replies":[{"poster":"Fisher No Chains","date":"2017-06-08T17:57:26.906+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"I agree that she's bad right now. \nI used to play her a lot in S6 and right now there's no reason to pick her because I don't even enjoy it anymore.

The initial ult changes were really harsh on him and a bit unnecessary. The whole reasoning behind \"rewarding a good Kennen ult\" seemed like more of a cop out for low elo players who don't know how to play against Kennen ultimates, because the likelihood of someone sitting in your ultimate for a full three seconds is essentially none in almost every game past gold elo. Kennen needs high damage in the initial ticks of his ultimate because he's designed to be played as a burst mage. If you really want to argue that the old ult still did too much damage, then that's fine, but in its current state Kennen's ultimate does NOT do enough initial damage and he's suffering because of it. I can go more in depth into this if needed because I have a lot to say on this, but I think the fact that everyone collectively dropped AP Kennen and his winrate dropped nearly 3 ~ 4 % in one patch says enough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wet Dryman","date":"2017-06-08T17:50:49.390+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any thoughts on Gragas?
