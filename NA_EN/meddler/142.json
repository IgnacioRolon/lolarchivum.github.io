The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**MF VO**\r\n\r\nBack when we were recording the VO for Gun Goddess MF we also looked at a VO update for MF's base VO, given we had voice actresses for all the required languages in the studio already. As you'll have noticed we didn't end up going through with that though. Wanted to share some details as to what happened there.\r\n\r\nWe recorded a lot of lines for a new MF VO set and put them into internal testing. Reaction was unexpectedly poor to it. To get a wider read we then reached out to Rioters who've played a lot of MF (mains or former mains generally) to get their thoughts. Feedback was really split, with different people having different takes on who MF is. We then put that new VO into research labs with a number of regular players who came in to visit our campus, some of whom were MF mains, some of whom weren't. Once again we saw some really contrasting feedback, in particular the distinction between \"spunky, playful\" versus \"bad ass, bounty hunter\". We believe that reflects in significant part that our portrayal of MF has changed over the years. Her presentation in some of the newer stories for example is more the bad ass version. Her current VO, given its age however is more the flirty, fun earlier take on the character. \r\n\r\nBetween that disconnect over who MF is, and some sadness at moving to a new voice actress from some play testers  we concluded it didn't make sense to use the new VO. That was a disappointment, given it felt like a great opportunity to update a well loved champ with a very limited set of lines. It was a case where the downside felt larger than the upside though. We'll hopefully take another swing at updating MF's voice at some point, starting with a better definition for MF's identity to base a script and performance off. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Couple of notable bug fixes in 8.21**\r\n\r\nI normally avoid talking about specific bug fixes given there are a lot in any given patch. Wanted to touch on a couple today though, given they're topics I've seen a number of questions on, the Zyra one especially.\r\n\r\nZyra - Got a fix for an issue where plants would get stuck trying to attack untargetable non champion enemies (e.g. Azir Soldiers or Orianna ball) and therefore be unresponsive when it came to attacking actual targetable enemies nearby.\r\nYorick - A bug fix for the Maiden to address cases where, while she's still following Yorick, she wouldn't always recall when he did. Mainly an issue in the jungle. Doesn't affect cases where the Maiden's no longer following Yorick. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Soraka is SO HOT","date":"2018-10-12T15:59:09.924+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=irL2yrul,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-10-12T15:56:01.780+0000)\n>\n> Zyra - Got a fix for an issue where plants would get stuck trying to attack untargetable non champion enemies (e.g. Azir Soldiers or Orianna ball) and therefore be unresponsive when it came to attacking actual targetable enemies nearby.\n\nDoing God's work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cryxe","date":"2018-10-12T15:59:45.900+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"Hi, \n\nWas wondering about how... *soon* we could expect the new \"colorful mage\"?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-10-12T16:19:34.541+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"When they're ready.","replies":[{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2018-10-12T16:43:34.397+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"it's a multiple entities champ ? :p","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-10-12T16:49:20.159+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it's a singular they, to not reveal their gender.\n\nCome on, we already had that discussion when Ornn was teased...","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-10-12T17:42:35.165+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep.

I think that skin is a waste, you removed her long hair and her sex appeal is lost in all that mech (her trademarks). At least she has some enjoyable dialogue (even if half of it is Exo...).\n\nI can only imagine how much time and energy that was required to do all that VO work.

Lesba Zyra here! Hopefully, you plan to give Zyra some rework, so she can be useful as a midlaner once again. I know you've stated, that she is really weak for dia elo and more as a midlaner. (I've reached with her master tier every single season. Even this one is really pain in the ... So I've dropped to Dia 3-5 elo) I've never stopped playing her as a midlaner. And I've never played her as a support (only once and found that super boring). Riot should bring her glory as an useful midlaner once again. I am tired to see Karma/Brand/Morgana as viable mids, but Zyra. She is stuck on the bottom for a few seasons already.\n\nI am tired of her low ap ratios and basic dmg that depends on flat magic penetration builds. This build doesn't work anymore. Especially against melee champions with their passive mr increase. The old haunted mask was her core item. Now it isn't that effective. I am tired of plants dying every single time, because of dia players focusing these. I am tired to see melee champions just one-shotting a melee plant that is not even able to hit them, because of enabled auto-attack. This reworked passive is her core problem again. Good for laning. Godlike for early. Useless for TF and late game roaming/moving .etc\n\nThank you for your attention. (if this one has dragged it)","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2018-10-13T00:07:37.993+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a lot of mystery surrounding Zyra mid and the series of events that transpired between her rework announcement and the present. The designer conceded to player feedback and committed to balance her for mid. It turned out that Zyra's patch changes were never actually playtested or balanced for mid. 1.5 years later we were all stoked for targeted mid buffs in 7.24, and the changes ended up being a colossal nerf to mid lane with far less impact to support.\n\nKaipop is down from Master 289 LP to D4 since the August bugs were introduced and seems to have all but given up on mid lane altogether. Shaian is down from Master to D3 in the same time frame. In mid lane, you're down from Master to D4 since the plant hp nerfs. I'm a scrub, but I'm down from P4 the past two seasons to G4 this season. Every other Zyra mid main I know is down nearly an entire tier since the plant hp nerfs.\n\nThe plant hp nerf was a surgical nerf to mid (particularly in already-hard melee matchups) disguised as a buff. It was too precise and too predictable to be an accident. 11 months later, there is no fix and only one comment on the issue that revealed a failed/stalled half-measure to eliminate only the most egregious melee 1-shots to vinelashers. The exceptionally narrow scope of that direction is a pretty good indicator that the balance team thinks the 7.24 changes were good overall with unintended issues at  the margins.\n\nBut none of that - the intentional nerf, radio silence, etc - makes sense in the larger context of the champ. Zyra has a legacy of pro/esport play. Meddler personally plays her and described her mid weaknesses exactly. She hasn't been labeled as toxic and sent to the \"waiting for update\" dumpster. \n\nIt's obvious that Riot isn't doing any of this out of ignorance or apathy towards the champ, so it must be deliberate. But why in actual hell would anyone *deliberately* do this to any champ? Why deliberately nerf mid after announcing a mid buff and commit to it for an entire season+, yet still post comments about all the reasons mid is unviable? \n\nI just wish someone at Riot would make sense of this because there's a lack of logical consistency when comparing comments made by Meddler, 20thCenturyFaux, and KingCobra with comments made by Repertoir, MapleNectar, and Afic. They two groups are completely at odds with one another. At this point, my best guess is that there was some kind of internal malfunction, change of direction, or larger-scale reassessment of the champ, and Meddler won't clarify wtf is going on because they don't have a plan (yet?).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2018-10-12T18:04:22.816+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=irL2yrul,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-10-12T15:56:01.780+0000)\n>\n> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \n> **MF VO**\n> \n> Back when we were recording the VO for Gun Goddess MF we also looked at a VO update for MF&amp;#039;s base VO, given we had voice actresses for all the required languages in the studio already.

She uses flirting merely as a tool, and doesn't take specific joy in doing so (but doesn't dislike it either). If I were to imagine her wait of flirting, that would be a subtle kind, with body language and double entendres, with the goal of distracting, and troubling her opponent, catching them then offguard.
