The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Stoneplate changes partially delayed**\r\n\r\nLooks like we&#039;ll be shipping one of the previously mentioned Stoneplate changes (bug fix so it doesn&#039;t give more health than intended when combined with Cinderhulk) in 7.17. The other change (extra health granted is a mixture of base and bonus, rather than all bonus) however will have to be delayed to 7.18. It&#039;s tested well and we were hoping to get that in for 7.17 but there&#039;s a little bit of technical work needed to implement it bug free so we&#039;ll need to push it back a patch. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Ornn and Worlds**\r\n\r\nBeen seeing the question crop up occasionally of whether Ornn will be playable at Worlds or not. It&#039;s an issue we went back and forth on a lot ourselves, our conclusion at the end though was that he shouldn&#039;t be available. His release is only a couple of patches before the Worlds patch (7.18) and he&#039;s got a lot of distinctive stuff on his kit that could take a bit longer than usual to assess the impact of, upgraded items for his allies especially. We&#039;re really excited to see him in pro play, want to make sure we&#039;ve had time to do any polish that&#039;s needed though. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**A few 7.18 Balance plans**\r\n\r\nSome of the champs we&#039;ll be looking at in 7.18 below. Since there&#039;s a 3 week gap between 7.17 and 7.18 we&#039;ll also be doing a second pass partway through the patch development cycle. That means there&#039;ll be further changes coming, based in part on how 7.17 performs and pro play on 7.16 which starts this coming weekend.\r\n\r\nNautilus - Needs to be buffed. Not certain what we&#039;ll do yet, first step is assessing his needs.\r\nPanth - We&#039;ll likely nerf his early Q damage. Might then put some power somewhere else, make him less about either crushing lane or failing to be usefu. An ult buff&#039;s one of the more likely possible changes.\r\nJanna - No immediate changes planned, going to be monitoring her closely though to see how the combination of Coin and Ardent Censer nerfs affect her though, with changes later in the patch cycle moderately likely as a result.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Champ Changes not in 7.18**\r\n\r\nTouching on a few champs we&#039;ve been testing things for recently that won&#039;t be coming back in the 7.18 patch at least:\r\n\r\nVayne - Changes likely coming in 7.19. Removing Q&#039;s ability to crit and putting power elsewhere&#039;s still the plan.\r\nAzir - Small update could be as soon as 7.19. Still going well, got some focused testing this week and weekened though which might reveal something new.\r\nUdyr - Hoping to have something ready for him before pre-season (7.22) still, need to see how work on him goes though.\r\nYasuo - We&#039;ve got some good lessons from the Yasuo changes we&#039;ve been trying, won&#039;t be shipping anything for a while however. Extra range on his ult showed some good promise in particular, since it allowed him to better capitalize on his allies&#039; play without giving him more personal power. Will likely revisit that next time we look at Yasuo. Shifting power from his shield to other defensive effects (e.g. base stats) also showed both some promise and some risks.","replies":[{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2017-08-18T16:46:30.890+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey Meddler, Riot Fearless recently mentioned you guys were in talks of a \"release valve\" for excessive healing can you elaborate","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-08-18T17:17:05.015+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"Healing or shielding?\n\nWe've been talking about shielding in particular, with the belief being that some form of mid game response to shield stacking is likely a good idea.

I am, in short, suggesting changing the stun of his Q on thrice-stacked targets into a charm instead. \nWhy am I suggesting such a thing ?\n Context. I am a big fan of Tahm Kench. I personally think he is one of the best designed champions in the game, in terms of coherency between his visuals, background, and gameplay (you can give his dev team my congratulations). But I feel that, regarding the way he is designed, a last improvement could be made. \nI’ve read the Champion Insight that was published when he released (http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-preview/champion-insights-tahm-kench-river-king). I shall use it to back my words. In this Champ Insight, we learn that Tahm Kench’s character is built around his mouth. He is at first a mere devourer, but then, he is also a charmer, someone who uses his mouth and tongue to both attract and devour his prey. Thus, linking background and gameplay, we can understand that when he licks his enemies (with his basic attacks and his Q), he is somewhat talking them into trusting him (the slow), slowly trapping them thanks to his eloquence... So, when, he achieves this, he finally charming his enemies would make a lot more sense than a simple stun. \nIn a world full of slows, stuns and knock-ups, CC abilities like charm, fear, or taunt conveys in my eyes much more than just power, strength, or precision (which are what is mostly conveyed through stuns or knock-ups) ; these “different” CC types show really well uniqueness or personality in my opinion. It is, I understand that, important that such CC exist, but for Tahm Kench ? Is it really power, strength, precision, that define him ? Tahm’s dev team fully committed into a character created around his mouth and his uses of it. A silver-tongued, talking fiend that charms his enemies, wouldn’t it be so perfect in game ? \nStill, I understand  a few things. First, that it is a different kind of CC that may reveal harder to balance. It is obvious that, a charm being more powerful that a stun for Tahm Kench’s kit, the duration of the CC is likely gonna go down (a 1.5 second-lasting charm would be pretty busted ; better make it 1 second or so). Second, that he is probably not your priority at all. There’s the Worlds, the Runes Reforged, the preseason... And Tahm is fine as he is, it seems, in the current meta. I am just asking to you, to Riot’s dev team, to consider it, to keep it somewhere in your head(s) and, if you think this is worth it, to at least try it out. \nThanks for hearing me out, you do a great job overall.","replies":[{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2017-08-18T19:08:44.923+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Howain! That's a good question and it makes sense at first blush that Tahm Kench's output would be a charm.\n\nHowever, thematics and in-game feel don't always map perfectly. In game, we needed a strong, straight-forward spell with good gameplay around it to realize Tahm Kench's threat-over-time pattern (stay around him for too long and you'll be stunned or devoured). Tongue Lash is a straight-forward skillshot with a long self-root, like Amumu's Q or Blitzcrank's Q, which we know has pretty good play around it. However, forcefully striking an enemy with your tongue isn't a thing that lends itself to a charm, in my mind. It makes sense if you know who Tahm Kench is, but if literally all you know is \"he's a catfish who slaps you with his tongue\", it makes no sense.\n\nIn my mind, the aspect of Tahm tricking people with his mellifluous verbiage is more on the meta level of how you don't take him seriously due to the silly things he says and his funny animations, until suddenly he eats you and all is darkness.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaunite Scuttler","date":"2017-08-18T20:26:54.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I get it.

And I must admit I've never thought of him tricking the players themselves the way you described, which is by the way really interesting and makes lot of sense ; it preserves Tahm's  \"character fantasy\", let's say. \nAnd the stun can anyway still be interpreted as a _punch_line that make the character stand still so it's fine. ^^ \nThanks for taking the time to answer me and having shared your insights on the River King's game-design.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-08-18T17:35:41.488+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"What about crit items tho?

So by the time she gets work actually done on her, it will be around August of next year and it will mark 5 years before you work on her. This is not counting the amount of stuff you mess around with to put off working on Karma up till then. Lux will most definitely receive another addition to her art assets. Lux will receive another update to her kit that works on her shield now, because you want to offer her more utility with her shield. You said a few months ago Karma would be worked on this year. Now you are saying she is probably not going to be worked on till next year . . . . and most definitely up in the air at this point. When it comes to anything with Karma, you have no problem pushing her back for another Ryze rework, another art asset and kit update to Lux, a rushed LaBlanc rework, new champion reworks, and so much more.\n\nDownvote me nerds. I call out a hypocrite when I see one.\n\n---------\n\nWhen you do decide to work on Karma in 2020, address the following:\n\nPassive = She could use a new passive that fits a battle-mage and her theme better.\nQ+R = Her Q+R needs to be ground targeted or completely re-imagined for a battle-mage.\nW+R = Needs an ally function or some other use than what it is now.\nE+R = Needs to either be more original and separated from Iron Locket of Solari active or have her Shield Bomb placed back in her kit.\nR = Could be better and offer more decision making than just one mantra at a time.\n\nFinally, do not let Ricklessabandon EVER touch Karma. He has shown the Karma community that he is to incompetent and unwilling to listen to player feedback when it comes specifically to Karma. Look at LaBlanc. Enough said.\n\n---------\n\nI look forward to excuse number 15 some time next year, Meddler. I also look forward to the 6 times you work on Lux next year.

As a niche, making her reflect damage (so she's true to her name) could be a possible direction. I'd like to see 2 charges back on her mantra as well (but to add an internal CD to each empowered ability). Current Karma tends to only mantra one ability constantly (whichever is more relevant to the role she's playing). Decision making is hardly a factor at this point.

Might be the nudge support Karma would really like but otherwise...? It's risky.\n\n\nI think a healthy change would taking a first look at Mantra itself. Increase the base CD of mantra to 60/50/45/40 or something... but allow Karma to store 2 charges past level 6. Then 3 charges past level 16. Soulflare/Renewal/Defiance then have a 10 second cooldown each that is **not affected by CDR**.

Lulu can use auto attacks and abilities off of shielded champions. Taric can use abilities off of shielded targets and is rewarded for doing it when he goes in and uses an auto attack.

Then she could be properly balanced for all kinds of play, as her kit would statistically be more healthy.","replies":[{"poster":"Dunal","date":"2017-08-18T20:48:01.608+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't disagree that a new W and Passive would be good, especially since passive is now part of Coin.

He had a bad winrate paired with a low pickrate for a long time now (even experience player struggle with him). \n\nFiddlesticks is no stranger to indirect nerfs (Magus > Runic Echoes, fear changes, Zhyonas Hourglass changes) but also the jungle changes him hard.\n\n**Buff monsters loses their minions:**\n\n* Fiddlesticks no longer gets bounces with his Dark Wind. For an entire jungle clear this adds over 20 seconds of extra clearing time. This alone kills the champion.\n* For reference, Nocturne now clears the jungle almost a full MINUTE faster than Fiddlesticks. They had about equal clear time before.\n\n**Raptor buff having more small raptors:**\n\n* Even though Fiddlesticks likes jungle camps to have more than one creep, it can easily become too much. Old raptor camp was already pushing it, and the new one is extremely inefficient with Fiddlesticks E.\n\n**New Krugs:**\n\n* The new Krugs is a cool idea, but it completely fucks the way Fiddle clears the jungle. If you use your Dark Wind the krugs die fast, but you have it on cooldown as the smaller ones appear and you have to drain and auto them down individually. It just takes way too long.\nThis camp is almost never worth doing as Fiddlesticks. Krugs were his fastest camp before and now it's by far his weakest.\n\n**Removal of Raptor smite buff:**\n\n* Fiddlesticks was the best user of the Raptor smite buff in the game. Period. He completely relied on it to get surprise ultimates off. With that gone every ultimate is a gamble unless you have a sweeper or control ward area, which takes time and setup.\nPossibly the biggest indirect nerf to any champion in preseason 7 is this removal.\n* The addition of health on smite does NOTHING for Fiddlesticks since he has such a sustained clear, so he even gets no benefit from the tradeoff change.\n\n**PLANTS:**\n\n* Vision plant can see Fiddle's ultimate locations even though he perfectly cleared vision of that area. Huge nerf.\n* Honeybloom is mostly useless for Fiddlesticks, but this isn't the biggest deal.\n* Explosive plant can stop channels and thus Fiddle can't duel anyone near them. It doesn't sound like the biggest deal, but it limits your options in quite a few scenarios. Also people can use it to get out of your drain even if you're not in it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yadid","date":"2017-08-18T19:21:40.362+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the introduction of the ten ban system, we saw Yasuo's ban rate soar.
