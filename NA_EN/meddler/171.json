The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Some reflections on new champs/VGUs this year**\r\n\r\nSince the game's in a stable state right now with Worlds underway and preseason fast approaching I figured it would be a good time to share some thoughts on how our new champs and VGUs this year (Sylas, Kayle, Morgana, Yuumi, Mordekaiser, Qiyana, Yuumi) have gone from a game design perspective. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Cohesion between gameplay and theme\r\n\r\nThis is something we've sometimes missed in the past, Kindred and Shen being some of the clearest examples, where kit and theme/backstory don't entirely gell. This year's releases by contrast I feel have done really well here, with gameplay generally delivering on desired fantasy and expectations. Mordekaiser for example hits the massive, dark magic powered lord of the dead thing pretty well. Yuumi delivers on playful, helpful mage's familiar. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Uniqueness and Satisfaction (playing as the champion)\r\n\r\nI think it’s been a strong year so far in this regard too. I think our new champs and VGUs have generally managed to both bring something distinct to the game and made doing so feel good for the user. Sylas's spell steal, Yuumi's attach and Morde's ult are particular standouts for me here. Some of our past work by contrast has only delivered on one of the two. Skarner's spires are distinct, but for too many players don't feel good to play with. Or from the other side of things Jarvan feels good to play but isn't quite distinct enough gameplay wise I'd argue from other similar champs.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Weaknesses and counterplay\r\n\r\nHere by contrast I think we've had a much more mixed year, in part because of some decisions we've made that have helped champions feel good to play as. Sylas and Yuumi stand out here in particular, with skilled play on them leaving opponents without sufficient ways to deal with them. Morgana, Mordekaiser and Kayle seem better in that regard so far. Not sure yet about Pantheon and Qiyana, reserving judgement there until they've been out a bit longer and we've got a better handle on which effects might just need some numbers tuning versus have larger issues to solve. \r\n\r\nIn terms of overall trends this one's particularly on the mind as something we need to get better at. Looking at 2018 releases Irelia, Akali and Aatrox have also been problems in this regard, leading to in game experiences for other players that aren't at the standards we want to hit. All our new releases having good game health, not just some of them, is one of our big champion goals for the coming year. \r\n\r\n* Maintaining Gameplay Identities \r\n\r\nHistorically some of our VGUs have ended up substantially shifting the gameplay identities of the champions being worked on. In some cases I think that's paid off well, with Sion, Poppy and Urgot for example very successful updates even if their gameplay is very different now. In other cases though we've sometimes changed things unnecessarily, losing things players loved about champions that didn't need to be removed on game health grounds. This year I think we've done quite well, with Kayle, Morgana, Mordekaiser and Pantheon all keeping a lot of iconic elements while also addressing some game health problems. Still some room for improvement. Overall though I think we've avoided some of the issues some past updates have had with unnecessarily redefining major parts of a champion (e.g. Graves no longer being able to be played botlane or Aatrox shifting from a very AA heavy playstyle to a more spell based one).\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Thoughts on Worlds Playins so far**\r\n\r\nAt time of writing we're partway through the second day of playins. Some very early thoughts on how the state of the game's looking so far:\r\n\r\n* Pacing's generally where we'd hope it would be in terms of things like amount of early conflict, contestation of objectives and time spent in late game\r\n* Overall pick variety has been ok given we've only seen a subset of teams play so far. Hoping we don't see Qiyana, Panth and Xayah stay at 100% pick/ban throughout the tournament as teams adapt and the meta evolves. They’re sitting there right now, but still very early on in things overall. Possible we should have taken more power out of them when nerfing each of them in 9.17-9.19, at the same time we didn't want to overswing and leave them in too weak a state to be played either.\r\n* Seeing some non marksmen get picked bot seems to have been healthy so far, with clear strengths and weaknesses resulting from the choice to do so and interesting play. Not clear how much the meta has settled in that regard though, particularly given some teams assumedly have put more time into practicing non marksmen picks than others. Very interested to see how bot develops over the tournament and hoping we continue to see some moderate class variety, especially if teams also feel they've got options for running marksmen in other lanes instead (or as well) when desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Toπ Senpai","date":"2019-10-04T16:35:24.345+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"What are your current thoughts on Karmas state in soloQ?\nHer winrate dropped except for Toplane","replies":[]},{"poster":"RuDoKa","date":"2019-10-04T16:18:28.398+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"Where is the music ???","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-10-04T18:10:56.035+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Music's generally handled by a different part of the org that I have only very limited involvement with.

As for akali over the course of changes and mechanic removals like her iconic heal she lost her identity as well becoming a weird bruiser intead of an assasin. And that brings me to the point would  you guys ever consider releasing their old kits on a new champions to satisfy both the old and new mains of those champions.I.e  for akali you could reintroduce her original kit on her mother.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UPS x ACE","date":"2019-10-04T19:28:15.120+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"**-Cohesion between gameplay and theme**\nAurelion Sol????\n\n**-Maintaining Gameplay Identities**\nAurelion Sol again???

Yuumi, in particular, is very polarizing and I do find myself some what sad with the direction that she is going. I would have liked to see her pushed to be rewarded more for interacting with her laning opponents by giving her a lower CD on her bop and block and a higher mana cost on her heal and attached Q instead of seeing the mana portion of her passive removed all together and her heal being buffed.\n\nIn general, I would have just liked to see more experimentation with making her interactive by giving her reasons to be aggressive in lane off her laning partner.

Firstly I think Mordekaiser isn't really a good example for a champion that provides enough counterplay. Especially the ultimate make him unbearable leaving players in situations where they go \"well, I guess I die :)\" way more often than actually giving them a fair shot. Then you go ahead and say you think reworks really paid off for Sion while it didn't do as well for Graves. Quite the opposite is the case. While I agree that Sion in the end has become a better 'Character' as a whole his former unique playstyles have been completely removed from him in the rework and were replaced with a rather generic tank skill set. He's no longer able to play multiple unique roles (AP heavy zoning/AD,attack speed front liner healing all his allies around him) but is rather limited to just one job: being a very generic tank. Yes he checks all the boxes now for doing his intended job, whereas previously he had stuff that didn't work together perfectly, and he looks and sounds way better than before, but overall I'm convinced there was a lot of room to improve him in ways that would suit his former self better while being up to the games higher standards. Graves on the other hand was the exact opposite: He had a strong thematic but his play style was rather boring, being not very distinct from all the other adcs one could choose from. His rework did an amazing job giving him a unique place in the game that no one else could fill while also working perfectly with his thematic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yordle Gunner","date":"2019-10-04T19:17:51.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot, pls update the visual and voice lines of old Yordles.
