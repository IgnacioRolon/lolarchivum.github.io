After testing a few different directions we concluded that a mini update on Aurelion Sol wasn&#039;t something we thought we should do, at least not in the short to medium term. He&#039;s still got a couple of issues we&#039;d like to improve at some point (play and counterplay around star use, Q satisfaction). The possible changes we were testing didn&#039;t work out as well as we&#039;d hoped in game though, creating an experience that wasn&#039;t more appealing for people who weren&#039;t already interested in playing Aurelion Sol and was often felt as worse for those who already play Aurelion Sol. We&#039;ve cut that work off as a result and are putting the time into other projects that look likely to give more game improvement for the hours spent. \r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Aatrox**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ll be doing some further followup on Aatrox in 7.8. Primary target&#039;s going to be making it so Aatrox has a less terrible time of it if he&#039;s jungling. Exact changes uncertain, though we&#039;ll be looking at passive interactions as a possibility of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Udyr** \r\n\r\nWe should have some changes to Udyr in 7.8 too. Current things we&#039;re targeting there are making Tiger a more viable build and adding a bit of power to Turtle. Probably hitting PBE early next week.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Responses to these threads**\r\n\r\nI&#039;d imagine this is pretty obvious already to anyone who&#039;s read through a few of these threads, but for anyone new figured it was worth clarifying how I approach these threads a bit. With the occasional exception I&#039;ll put a post up and then put time aside at least once during that day to respond to some of the discussion thread below it. I&#039;ll sometimes put time into reading a thread/responding further the day after as well, though that&#039;s less consistent. After that I&#039;ll have moved on to a more recent thread generally though, so apologies, but anything posted after that&#039;s very unlikely to get answered and may not get read either. \r\n\r\nIn terms of what sort of stuff I prioritize responding to I&#039;m more likely to get into discussions about some of the things discussed in the opening post, talk on major issues/perceived issues with the current state of the game and champions we&#039;ve recently worked on or are about to work on. Something I&#039;d like to avoid is every single thread becoming a set of &#039;What do you think of X champion&#039; for every champion in the game every time, so I&#039;ll generally skip those questions if there&#039;s nothing concrete to talk about. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Doran&#039;s Shield Changes**\r\n\r\nContinue to test pretty well. Highly likely they&#039;re part of mid-season as a result.","replies":[{"poster":"Blïtz Prank","date":"2017-03-31T03:36:56.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Meddler hello, the new champion gonna be pre- or post the mid season update?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-03-31T04:16:34.995+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.\n> [{quoted}](name=Cry n Fry,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=tcjKBREI,comment-id=005f,timestamp=2017-03-31T03:36:56.186+0000)\n>\n> @Meddler hello, the new champion gonna be pre- or post the mid season update?\n\nYes.","replies":[{"poster":"Raxistaicho","date":"2017-03-31T05:32:05.112+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2017-03-31T13:34:16.790+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perfect answer like usual, Meddler.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Üdyr","date":"2017-03-30T18:23:55.737+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meddler - You mention Tiger but no Phoenix changes on Udyr.

You don't have that much difficulties clearing camps when you build Tiamat or when you're counter-jungling, going for the invade/kills. Tiger ambushes are pretty stong, the DOT secures easily a kill after blowing the enemy flash. Meanwhile, Phoenix is just straight weak, it's the supposed to be the \"farming stance\" but it's outperfomed by other farming junglers like Shyvana who has also better ganking and duelling tools (%HP damage and a burst of movment speed).\n\nBy doing these buffs to tiger stance you're asking players to neglect Phoenix Stance and make Udyr players going for the kills with Tiger. His early game gameplay resolves more arround ambushes than ganks due to the atrocious low speed of Bear Stance. It's sometimes wiser to farm against bad matchups but right now you won't get any advantage, usually losing xp due to the low clear speed of Tiger Stance (things Phoenix Stance should be able to perform but doesn't right now). \n\nTL;DR: IMO Your're forcing the Tiger-Tiamat build over Pheonix Stance.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Fake Shaco","date":"2017-03-30T16:51:37.199+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Can we get a comment on the shaco nerfs?

Was there any thought of keeping just the ap part of it and allowing it to crit like it currently does? I think taking off the ability for it to crit is gonna further diminish the viability of the ap shaco playstyle. This will seem like a rant, but Shaco had 45% ap ratio taken off of E (120% prerework down to 75% along with -20% since backstab is no longer the same) and that damage was put onto Q. This was with the thought that the ratio on Q can crit. You are adding compensation on his passive, but it will be a flat ap ratio. Adding to that, in teamfights, as a squishy ap champion, you will most likely only get one, maybe two backstabs off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"what you deserve","date":"2017-03-30T18:24:21.061+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=tcjKBREI,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-03-30T16:56:13.927+0000)\n>\n> We do want to nerf Shaco in general.

If you're playing him as a squishy assassin, you're not likely to get a second backstab proc off. Unless you want to remove the cooldown on his passive.. But that sounds more oppressive in a different way.\n\nWhat you want to do is lower the ult damage ration from 75% to 50% and nerf or remove his E passive.\n\nRemember that Riot's policy on assassins has been \n> The question shouldn't be \"can I kill this squishy?\" but \"can I kill this squishy and get out alive?\"\n\nUnless you give Shaco more escapes, he's just going to build bruiser (which has been extremely effective anyway) .\n\nThe next thing that'll happen is that you nerf Trinity Force and Titanic Hydra, because they're actually problematic, and then you won't compensate for Shaco nerfs at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trash MammaI","date":"2017-03-30T18:09:58.583+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this mean you're targeting Rengar, Kha'zix, Wukong etc.?
