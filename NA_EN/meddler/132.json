The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Frost Queen&#039;s line in 7.18**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve got some late changes for the Frost Queen&#039;s line right at the end of the 7.18 cycle I though it would be good to give some more context on. We want to put a bit of power into the FQ&#039;s line of items, given they&#039;re underperforming relative to Coin/Targon&#039;s even on aggressive champs who should be much more drawn to FQs. We also want to offer non direct damage power where possible, both to reduce creep on number of high threat damage dealers on a team and to allow differences in how champs play in different positions (mid versus support for a number of mages). That meant adding AP or additional proc damage was something we wanted to try and avoid. CDR&#039;s is somewhat better approach as a result, focusing champs more on frequent casts (more sustained damage, more utility uptime). There are some cases where that contributes to CDR glut on some champs, most of the core FQ&#039;s users however are often buying non CDR items regardless however (e.g. Rylai&#039;s and/or Liandries).\r\n\r\nWe added CDR to T1, T2 and T3 of the Frost Queen&#039;s line as a result. We then started running seeing some mid laners swapping to it. Flexibility of item use across positions isn&#039;t in and of itself a problem, in this case it looked like it was at risk of making some champs (e.g. Cass) potentially too dominant. We made some late changes to FQ&#039;s as a result, uping the CD on minion kills by a couple of seconds and changing it so it gets extra CDR at T2 (now 10%), but doesn&#039;t increase further at T3. Intent there is that it&#039;s a better choice for supports building it and then going for other items, without pushing it to T3, without being too warping if picked up by others. Making it a support item that you&#039;re happier leaving at T2 also then gives a bit of extra distinction versus Targon&#039;s/Coin potentially too.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Brand**\r\n\r\nWe mentioned we&#039;d take another look at something small to help solo lane Brand out a bit sometime post Worlds patch. Still planning to do that, potentially in this next cycle. Something small&#039;s likely to mean something like a small bonus (e.g. mana restored) when CSing with particular spells to give us a lever to put power into non support Brand specifically when needed. Give him some better harass and wave clear if he&#039;s CSing well basically. Not expecting that&#039;ll solve everything Brand needs, but would like to get something quick for him before pre-season if possible.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Thinking about another prototypes blog**\r\n\r\nLast year we put up a blog that showed prototype versions of various champions:\r\n\r\nhttp://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2016/10/dev-on-champion-prototypes/\r\n\r\nI was thinking it would be good to do another one of those, look at some of the champions that have come and since and maybe a couple of older ones we didn&#039;t get to cover last time. Would be interested in people&#039;s thoughts on which champs you&#039;d be particularly interested in seeing. One disclaimer though - it&#039;ll likely only be covering champs released from around Gnar onwards (getting access to prototype files older than that&#039;s a more difficult process alas, easy to get old patch versions, harder to get old WIP stuff).\r\n\r\nIn terms of timing on that dev blog it&#039;d likely be a late this year or early next year thing once pre-season work&#039;s settled down. Takes a while to get everything in order though, hence the inquiry now.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2017-09-12T17:01:54.588+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=EqJ1zVfQ,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-09-12T15:36:21.020+0000)\n>\n> We added CDR to T1, T2 and T3 of the Frost Queen&amp;#039;s line as a result.

So with FQC you have 20% CDR in the build path and then *lose* 10% CDR when finishing the final item? \n\nIf you're worried about midlaners abusing FQC, why not do the obvious thing:\n\n1) Keep minion-kill penalty on tier 3 item\n\n2) Keep FQC at 10% CDR and let EotW have the buff to 20% CDR\n\nYou guys were really close to fixing a frustrating problem with Frost-line supports, and it's super disappointing to see you back away from a positive change because of hypothetical problems with mid lane. I was seriously looking forward to this change, because it's extremely difficult to itemize for CDR when 0 of your core damage items have CDR. \n\n{{item:3151}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3135}} \n\nThe problem here is a full build with 10% CDR, which is an extension of the problem of extremely narrow spell pen itemization. This problem wouldn't exist if we had AP versions of the lethality options. Either way, 10% on a component doesn't actually help because it fails to address the problem of builds capped at 10% CDR. \n\n> **Brand**\n> \n> We mentioned we&amp;#039;d take another look at something small to help solo lane Brand out a bit sometime post Worlds patch.

Might be able to get her back to mid to the degree she was played/effective there before the update, would still expect that to leave her significantly better as a support given even on release I'd argue that's where her kit was strongest.\n\nThe problem here is that the whole rework was a giant middle finger to mid Zyra. The only thing she gained of any value was 15 MS. Everything else about it hurt her in some way. Q's hit box is terrible and does less damage than pre rework, plants lost HP early and now die even easier to ambient AoE, you're more reliant on large swarms of plants which is just less feasible in the midlane and finally the bot brushes serve as a buffer to your RNG seed gen since if you stand in a brush you only place seeds within that brush.\n\nI also think that many of these are issues that should be addressed anyway. The high number/low value plants are far worse to play both with and against than Zyra's old plants. As a Zyra player they just feel too vulnerable to going down to AoE, especially mid and against Zyra it feels horrible to get 2 seeds RNGed on your head into 4 plants ripping you apart. Also why was Zyra's passive ever allowed to exist? It turns her whole character into an RNG fest where you're basically praying for seeds to land on the enemy.\n\nFinally no-one's arguing for straight Zyra buffs that will just break Zyra support, end up with nerfs and put us right back where we started. What we want is targeted buffs to Zyra mid alongside compensation nerfs to Zyra support where they make sense so Zyra mid is a viable pick. It's also not good enough to get Zyra back to where she was before the rework, the goal for Zyra should be to make her a completely viable midlaner alongside support if possible and if not [listen to the community](http://www.strawpoll.me/7114736/r) and relegate Zyra support to being more of an off-pick while Zyra mid gets primary balance focus.","replies":[{"poster":"ColdChrome","date":"2017-09-12T17:58:08.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-09-12T18:04:57.933+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":">And as for the votes, the community voted that way but let's guess: Most of the community plays support way more than mid, \n\nIf you stop and think about this for even 15 seconds you'd understand why Zyra being played more bot means shitall. \n\nZyra mid is trash. Playing Zyra mid is basically equivalent to throwing the game away, as such people don't play Zyra mid at all. Zyra support is much less bad.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/xVQr7ihf-mid-year-mage-updates-zyra-direction\n\nIf you look here you'll see a trend, people who want to play Zyra mid but don't because it's shit.\n\nPerhaps a better way of looking at this is that ~10% of Zyra players play Zyra mid in spite of it being complete trash. That's a far higher percentage than say, Sona mid at about 2% of Sona players despite Sona mid performing statistically far better than Zyra mid.

That opens a lot of room for buffs to spell damage/ratios, and suddenly Zyra has a reason to go mid for the gold and xp.\n\nI've always preferred the approach of just beating it over the head with numbers until it works TBH.\n\nThe reason for this is that with a few reasonable assumptions we can prove that there is a numerical point of balance\n1. Zyra mid typically gains more value from ratios than support, if we give Zyra an absurd AP ratio like 10:1 she'll probably never be played support and only see play mid to abuse said ratio\n2. Zyra support typically gains more from bases than ratios, if we removed all Zyra's ratios and buffed her bases she'd probably be even more cemented as a support\n3. These two things are linear, buffing ratios benefits both, as do bases but if we were to buff ratios and nerf bases in a way that's power neutral we'll always benefit Zyra mid and harm Zyra support and vies versa.\n\nWith those 3 assumptions we've already proved that there's not only a single point of numerical balance, but an entire line of points where Zyra would be equally as good mid as support. Some of these points will be blatantly broken, some will be weak but theoretically there should be a point of balance somewhere on that line.\n\nI'm not convinced that Zyra support would rank W even if seed spawns were tied to it TBH. They effectively were pre rework and pre rework Zyra support never even looked at her W, so I don't think this would work past it being a ratio buff for Zyra mid, which is a more indirect way of just buffing ratios nerfing bases, which is what I'm arguing for anyway.\n\n>The Q cost reduction, flat cost of Q, and base mana regen buffs were very helpful, since none of Zyra's core items have any mana or regen on them.\n\nZyra mid's most common first buy is Morello's anyway. With some AP ratio buffs I'm 100% sure that Morello's would be a core item for her, as it stands it's already very good because it's hard to pass up a quick 20% CDR on a utility mage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dog of Pavlov","date":"2017-09-12T17:46:22.658+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm honestly so confused.

It takes Zyra 760 AP to double the damage on her plants. I'm recalling from memory here, so I'll probably be slightly off but I believe it takes Janna about 540 AP to double the damage on her W.
