The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png      \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Mastery curves for recent updates**\r\n\r\nLast time we looked at some mastery curves we were too close to the release of various updates to compare how the champions performed pre and post update. It&#039;s been a while since then though, so wanted to take a look at how Akali, Aatrox and Nunu compare before and after. \r\n\r\nPost explaining Mastery curves for anyone who missed it:\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/1czrgEgw-quick-gameplay-thoughts-february-21\r\n\r\nAnd another with some additional curves in it:\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/635MVdLk-quick-gameplay-thoughts-august-24\r\n\r\nAatrox, Akali and Nunu pre update \r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/0frfcT1.jpg\r\n\r\nAatrox, Akali and Nunu/Willump post update \r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/PQL79lm.jpg\r\n\r\nAatrox - Ends up with more climb in the later parts of his curve, suggesting players are getting more benefit from their ongoing learnings with him between games 30 and 50. Trend suggests there&#039;s likely ongoing performance gain beyond 50 games, whereas old Aatrox had mainly flattened off by that point. Mechanical mastery seems a likely cause.\r\n\r\nAkali - Very similar curve overall.  \r\n\r\nNunu and Willump - Had a steeper curve than you might expect pre update, I&#039;d imagine given how his approach to jungling/counterjungling was actually pretty distinct, even if not mechanically demanding. Curve is steeper now, likely reflecting both the kits previous skill tests and some new execution ones introduced with the update (E and W use).\r\n\r\nFor anyone wondering, no, we don&#039;t have enough data to look at Neeko yet. Will get that into a post sometime next year though!\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Working on some ranked irregularities before season starts**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve been seeing a few issues with where some accounts are placed in the new ranked system. More details on that and how we&#039;re addressing it to come soon. TLDR for now though is:\r\n\r\n* We want to put genuinely new accounts into Iron because it&#039;s a better experience both for those new players and others who previously got matched with them in what ended up being really uneven games\r\n* Smurfs are currently getting put into Iron but then not climbing really rapidly as intended, so their MMR and rank get desynched pretty badly at times\r\n* Returning players should be placed based on their MMR, but are currently getting put into Iron sometimes. \r\n* We&#039;re working on a bunch of fixes for the above, plus some other polish, at present. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**What&#039;s likely in 8.24b**\r\n\r\nPatch 8.24b, our final balance changes of the year, will be out next week. Run down below of what&#039;s likely in it. Anything not listed that you&#039;re seeing on the PBE is almost certainly a 9.1 change or later. Given this patch will be live for longer than usual and our ability to respond to balance issues is extremely limited during the holiday period we&#039;re being careful not to swing too hard on any particular thing, hence a larger number of small to moderate sized changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Buffs:**\r\n\r\n* Aurelion Sol\r\n* Caitlyn\r\n* Corki\r\n* Singed\r\n* Varus\r\n* Vayne\r\n* Volibear\r\n* Warwick\r\n* Outer Turret MR/Armor post 14 min (40 instead of 0)\r\n* Forbidden Idol based item buffs (details TBD at time of writing)\r\n\r\n**Nerfs:**\r\n\r\n* Akali (possible changes move to 9.1, targeting 8.24b for now though)\r\n* Alistar\r\n* Cassiopeia\r\n* Kassadin\r\n* Pyke (focused on mid Pyke)\r\n* Tiamat\r\n* Zeke&#039;s\r\n\r\n\r\n**Likely 9.1 buffs**\r\n\r\n* Ashe \r\n* Jinx\r\n* Kalista \r\n* Nasus \r\n* Sejuani \r\n* Xayah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Some other future work:**\r\n\r\n* We&#039;ll be working on crit items early next year, not sure on exact patch though yet.  \r\n* For Irelia we&#039;ll be looking at mechanics changes as follow up to recent balance adjustments, probably in 9.2.\r\n* We&#039;re still discussing Trist and whether to do something for her in 8.24b, something in 9.1/9.2 or if we should wait crit item changes, given she&#039;s probably the champ who rises or falls the most based off changes to crit.\r\n* Buffs to some enchanters are likely at some point early next year. Would like to get a bit of peel back into the game, though don&#039;t want to swing too hard and over correct either, so probably will separate champ changes from Forbidden Idol item buffs.","replies":[{"poster":"ONE MORE GRAVE","date":"2018-12-12T17:08:18.236+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":3,"body":"Any thoughts on Yorick?

That alone is a good reason for a rework.\nYou cant just make the skill floor excuse every time. Sure that is a thing but it shouldnt be unplayable.\n\nIt is a strategy game, not: \"who can smash 9 abilities faster while animation cancelling and aa resetting\".\nI like nida not a hater or anything but yea... she doesnt really have a place either. Originally was made to be a laner, not a jungler. And she isnt viable in either role.\n\nShe has a problem, sadly it is really hard to fix without changing her too hard. The problem is the overtuned kit. Yes she has an overtuned kit. Yes it is a fact.\n\nThe problem with overtuned kits tend to be the same, lee, camille, jayce, nida, elise, irelia, ryze.. you see the pattern.\n\n\nBut besides that she has her unique personality that is relying on her current form, and riot wouldnt want to move away from that. So they would be forced to keep the kit = they cant really rework her without removing her \"charm\" as a character. That is the main problem here. You dont have that same charm on Morgana, nor the overcomplicated kit. Tho she is really enjoyable to play for most of the players who play league. There is no problem with changing that, if she can be better than she was before. -Just my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"BuffADNidalee","date":"2018-12-13T17:21:52.138+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"eh not every champion needs to be playable by everyone that's what champs like garen are for.

There is just too many \"things\" that deal damage towers now: \n\n>AP->dmg conversion, sorcery pot, spellthiefs, rift herald, baron minions, mountain drake (x1,x2,x3,elder), demolish, sheen+upgrades. \n\nAnd that is just generic stuff, that isn't me mentioning champion specifics, such as champions with empowered autos that didn't use to deal bonus damage ~~and other certain champions with tower execution on a basic ability.~~ It is fine to have all this stuff, we had AP->tower dmg and sheen for years. But since the damage of these tools are left at crazy high levels it just robs attack speed/DPS champions of one of their jobs and marksmen of their most important reward for staying alive at the end of a won teamfight.\n\nMarksmen are fine, across the board. Tanks are probably fine too but we can't see them behind all the penetration/true dmg running around.\n\nThere isn't a ghost crawling around the dev team any more, and there is no shame in hitting CTRL+Z on some of your longer standing content ~~Cries in 6.19~~","replies":[]},{"poster":"Museum","date":"2018-12-12T22:51:40.549+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler,\n\nadc main from EUW here. I want to comment on that \"all marksman are weak\" feeling you mentioned in one of the last posts. I think I might be able to explain something here. My personal feeling is, that when playing as an classic crit adc (Tristana, Xayah), it is not enough to \"do well in lane\" to have an meaningful impact on midgame teamfights, which are in most games these days the crucial points that decide over win or lose.\n\nLeaving the lane as a 2-1 Lucian for example leaves you with Bork+BC in a really good state to impact the cause of the game in midgame teamfights. Not being able to carry your team to victory leaves me in a mode where I tell myself \"ok dude, you got your chance, you did not use it, do better next time\", which is completly fine.\nLeaving the lane as 2-1 crit adc leaves you with Stormrazor+ZealExt as the best possible decision at this point (really talking about Tristana/Xayah here), which feels pretty bad on its own. Losing the game due to a lost midgame teamfight at this point feels for me so much worse then in the example above. It makes it easy to blame your team (if they would have played perfectly even you could have dragged the game out and carried it once completing ~4 items) and leaves you with the feeling that you never had the chance to use your lead.\n\nI am really happy that you guys plan to work on crit items! As a suggestion, I think you should implement some sort of a two item spike. When I started playing League back at the end of season two and I read some guides on how to build as adc, what you read all the time was \"BF Sword -> attkspeed Item -> complete IE -> situational items like ...\". I think it should come back to this principle. Three \"essetial\" items with either IE+doubleZealExt or IE+SR+ZealExt is way to much, especially regarding how fast the game is atm. I understand that you want to keep crit carries weak for some time in early, regarding how devastating they are in late. Maybe you could implement some sort of synergy between two items, which are meant for crit carries.Those items get stronger once they are both completed. Comparing crit to on-hit champions, I think they should be significantly weaker until two items are completed and slowly start getting stronger afterwards. That would even highlight their position as a botlaner as they need a support early on. Especially with the new turret plating, you can lose much being weaker until two items are completed, that's why I think it would be a good timing without coming back to \"crit carries only\" meta.\n\nThanks for reading, tell me what you think @all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2018-12-12T22:09:59.307+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So...what is the reasoning behind that Vayne buff?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Salvor Hardın","date":"2018-12-12T17:59:02.717+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"What happened to Neeko being \"potentially very strong\"?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fire Blaustoise","date":"2018-12-12T16:57:38.058+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":10,"body":"Okay, so what's the plan for {{champion:62}} on the short and long term ??

Cassiopeia is a champion whoms winrate is really dependant of the Player. But a Champion like khazix is not very hard to play and has little counterplay. He is literally so broken at the moment and it is actually ridiculous that hes not getting nerfed or even looked into. His Q a point and click ability with 1.2 -2 sec cd deals can deal up do 1k dmg per q? And Cassio is OP? I really don´t understand you guys Balancing Philosophy. You don´t want champions like taliyah to be able to shove the wave, but yet there are literally so many champions that can still do that and they arent touched. IF you dont like that type of mechanic, why is not every champion that can do that getting nerfed? Also Smite mid is going to get really the standard if you guys dont do anything about it. It doesnt matter if a Karthus gets Bounty Gold from csing, since he can just\" SHOVE\" the wave farm jungle press R get Dark harvest Stacks and win the game by not doing anything that requires any skill nor can you do much about it.","replies":[]}]}
