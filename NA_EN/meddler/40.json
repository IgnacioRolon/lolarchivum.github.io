The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n**Some more Mastery Curves**\r\n\r\nGot some requests to show more of these, Singed included, after the first post on them earlier in the week. Some more, with brief comments, below. As a reminder, a flatter curve doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that a champion is less skilled since it in part reflects how similar the skills a champion tests are to those tested on other champions. As with the previous set of mastery curves this is based off data from the previous 6 months, so it won&#039;t perfectly match current win rates. I&#039;ve also gone with mastery curves over 100 games this time, which does introduce some messiness into the curves for champs with lower sample sizes at higher game values, but also gives a better impression of how they change with more games played.\r\n \r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/yOAlN\r\n\r\nSinged - As mentioned previously has a really steep curve. That reflects how different his playstyle is to other champs in part. There&#039;s a lot to learn, even after a lot of games. It&#039;s also correlated somewhat though with how, if you&#039;re a really dedicated Singed player, you&#039;ll end up much better on him than other champions. That means you&rsquo;ll climb playing Singed and then, when you&#039;re playing other champs you&#039;ll end up losing more. That drags your MMR down a bit again, potentially increasing your future Singed winrate.\r\n \r\nTanks - A lot of tanks have mastery curves that cap out fairly quickly, given they test game skill in general more than kit specific mechanics. Malphite&#039;s a particularly clear example of that, maxing out after ~10-15 games. Alistar&#039;s got some more kit specific stuff to him, but still on average maxes out curve wise around 40 games or so mark. Ornn&#039;s then a strong contrast with most other tanks, with his curve continuing upwards a bit even after 100 games, reflecting that he&#039;s got a lot of different stuff going to to learn. When coupled with how most games on Ornn are by people still very early on in that mastery curve (the grey section below) it means you can end up with a champ with a low average win rate who&#039;s still quite strong when played by someone who knows what they&#039;re doing.\r\n \r\nMarksmen - Marksmen are another class with a lot of overlap between the skills they test, so their curves usually look pretty similar, with a steep early climb that then flattens out a lot. Tristana and Ezreal are good examples. Lucian&#039;s an interesting counterpoint in that he&#039;s got an initial steep climb, that curves off sooner, but then keeps gradually going up, suggesting there&#039;s a lot players pick up really quickly and then some subtleties that even after 100 games keep mattering. Vayne&#039;s a stronger contrast again, with a curve that&#039;s yet to flatten that much even after 100 games. That&#039;s a trend we see on mechanically intensive champions in general too, such as Yasuo (shown here) or other champs like Azir or Kalista.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Minion FPS Bug Fix**\r\n \r\nWe got a fix into 8.3, that we&#039;ve now verified is working as intended, that fixes a number of FPS dropping/hitching when minions get spawned into the game (lane minions, jungle monsters, player created minions etc). Should have improved performance noticeably for a number of players. Won&#039;t fix everything of course, but worth checking out if you&#039;ve been having problems around those circumstances and haven&#039;t played for a bit. \r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Duskblade Nerfs moving to 8.6**\r\n \r\nWe&#039;ll be moving the Duskblade nerfs back to 8.6 so that we&#039;ve got enough time to also do some compensatory work on champions who might be hit too hard otherwise. Not sure exactly what that compensation will look like yet. Possible (not guaranteed) candidates for buffs below. Most likely case where we don&#039;t buff is if a champion already has similar strength with Ghostblade or something else (they&#039;re not actually very dependent on Duskblade). \r\n\r\n* Wukong\r\n* Zed\r\n* Talon\r\n* Rengar\r\n* Quinn\r\n* Miss Fortune\r\n* Kayn\r\n* Kha&#039;Zix","replies":[{"poster":"Jatu","date":"2018-02-23T16:53:42.943+0000","up_votes":77,"down_votes":10,"body":"So {{champion:121}} , {{champion:107}}  and {{champion:141}}  could possibly get buffs because of {{item:3147}} nerffs but {{champion:35}} won't get any?","replies":[{"poster":"Cðulrophobia","date":"2018-02-23T18:17:18.916+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":4,"body":"{{champion:35}}  literally is in a good spot only due to the {{item:3147}} \n\nif a {{champion:121}} gets a buff for the {{item:3147}} nerf & he doesn't then wth.\n\nand don't tell me \"boo hoo, {{champion:35}} procs {{item:3147}} twice with his clone\" {{champion:121}} procs it at least 3 times via his ult, not instantly but he doesn't have his FULL damage out of first aa, unlike the clown.\n\nI don't care about a buff, but you could at least bugfix the clone and give HIM possibility of proccing {{item:3087}}\n\nwe won't cry about damage output even though YOU FORCE US to build crit.","replies":[{"poster":"94nono94","date":"2018-02-23T20:20:54.624+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":29,"body":"Except Kha'zix Cannot do it instantly.

Shaco doesn't appear on your list, why?\n\nHe's fallen hard into an item/Dark Harvest dependency loop. If you can't muster some early gold and farm with Tiamat you're likely going to struggle really hard mid game. If you can't farm it out you won't get the Dusk/Shiv/IE early enough in the game to run isolation picks on rotating laners before 5 mans start and your burst starts to get shielded out (a completely different issue in this game at thr moment [you guys need to look at some shield nullifying/transferring items, I have a hextech item and an ohmwrecker rework you should look at])\n\nHis E damage feels absolutely terrible (I've seen it fail to kill sub 1hp bar mid and top laners retreating to their tower a lot), I can't convey to you know bad his E really is. Please look at the change to Physical and the removal of % health damage, that really hurt his objective control.\n\nI'd ask that you guys take a look at his boxes. The health changes you made dont take care of random aoe abilities or single autos from late game a dc or bruisers removing both his W and the after effect on R.\n\nFinally, R clone explosion and the triangle is off.

This penalty stacks up several (infinite?) times.\n\n>Context for these changes is, to reduce the abuse cases in solo lanes without harming or even increasing the effect for supports that play around their \"minigame\". Live Gameplay felt that the *Spoils of War* passive was in a good spot and therefore decided to push the gold over time instead.\n\nThe problem with that penalty is that in some situations the support is forced to take minions, e.g. when the ally died or backed and they have to defend the turret or freeze the wave. In these cases, the support is being punished for doing something they should do, something that makes sense and is appropriate. This penalty is especially strong on **Frostfang**:\n\nThe passive can be disabled for several minutes depending on how many you had to kill. Frostfang is the only example where its passive proc is not only bind to gold generation, but also combat stats (additional on-hit damage). This can also happen upon engaging a skirmish (or just defending themselves) resulting in killing a minion by accident.\n\n**Sintie Pie (PBE)** made a really good suggestion for a compromise:\n\n>Instead of disabling the respective gold generation, the gold gained by killing minions/monsters is decreased constantly (kiss&curse effect). That means, the Tier 1 and Tier 2 items are highly ineffective for farming positions, while the penalty for supports is super low. As a team you are punished when the support takes minions that another ally could have taken instead. Yet the punishment is not as bad (by far) if you try to poke enemies that are hiding behind their minions and kill a minion while doing so. \n\nI think this option is much better than the current changes on PBE and I'd love to hear why your team would not prefer this one. \n\nSincerly, \nInTheory","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-02-23T17:05:21.949+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The Bandit CS penalty on the PBE's too harsh, agreed. We do want to avoid those items getting poached much at all (hasn't lead to good game states), don't want to punish supports for making the correct plays though, whether that's picking up the occasional CS via AOE hits on champs, clearing a bit or whatever. Next version, which I think hits PBE today, uses a ramping lockout, at 5s for the first CS, 10s for the second, 20s for the third. Max lockout of 30s.\n\nWe did consider a penalty on minion gold gained instead, but had a couple of concerns. The first was that, in order for it to be effective enough, that number does have to get really high (30%+?). The second is it then makes getting to T3 all the more important on a number of champs, bring them back towards more locked builds.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-02-23T17:14:32.157+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"The suggestion from Sintie Pie was a bit more subtle than just a constant penalty on minion Gold, though.\n\nFor instance, you get 100% of the gold from your first 10 CS. Then you get 90% for CS 10-20. Then 80% for 20-50. Etc. This allows you to make it cap to a very high number, even more than 30%, to prevent poaching, while still not punishing Supports/forcing them to get to T3 much.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"kilI yourself","date":"2018-02-24T15:11:49.770+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make Shaco great again you shitty company","replies":[]},{"poster":"HappyHazard07","date":"2018-02-23T16:55:35.063+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey meddler, \n\nAny thoughts on what to do with Zoe after the nerfs she took?
