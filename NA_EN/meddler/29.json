So far we&#039;re very much in the midst of assessing the balance state for a range of champions, items, objectives etc. Early next week&#039;s when we&#039;ll probably have enough of an initial handle on things to start talking somewhat concretely about patch 6.10 changes, for now we&#039;re focused on gathering stats data, watching games, following player discussions and getting some in game experience ourselves.\r\n\r\nThere are at least a couple of champs that are almost definitely in the wrong spot though. Cass and Swain both look substantially weak and we&#039;ll likely be hotfixing them soon (best guess - early next week). We want to avoid overbuffing though, so those changes will be on the conservative side, with the option of additional changes in patch 6.10 of course (we&#039;ve overbuffed off early reactions in the past and want to avoid doing so here). We&#039;re also looking at some other champs that might be sufficiently weak or strong that they&#039;re hotfix worthy too, haven&#039;t got a clear enough picture yet on that though, particularly since in some cases item changes might be the appropriate response instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmic Warper","date":"2016-05-05T04:39:05.904+0000","up_votes":72,"down_votes":1,"body":"PLEASE PLEASE remove the delay on swain's ultimate.

There's a few major glaring issues but The biggest one has got to be her W. \n\nI feel like the balance team greatly overvalued the power of this new grounded status. In doing so they took all of Cass's immobility and packed it into the W, making it in a sense more immobile than those it effects. The static casting range is the first thing that struck me as poor. W used to be a zoning tool, now its just a tool that creates a fixed zone at a fixed range. It has almost no skirmish potential in a team-fight. Prior to the changes W could be used at short range, allowing you to Proc you E and fight back during a skirmish, It also provided some counter-play against divers. Cass's other abilities remain so close range that the range demand of Miasma seems backwards. You throw your grounded zone, then for some reason need to get 'closer' rather than further. Considering she's rather fragile and no longer has the dueling power of her E that she had previously. I can't figure out any reason Cass wants to bring herself or her enemies closer. Whether its her need to get close to cast or enemies who want to avoid the grounded zone, she always ends up nearer to the center of the combat than her current incarnation can handle. The inability to cast it where you want it coupled with its inability to pass terrain, Also makes W a waste of mana in any mobile jungle skirmish. I just don't see how \"Grounded\" makes up for the sheer inflexibility of Miasma currently.\n\nW does not poison you're opponents. Its become a debuff zone akin to Soraka's Equinox.  All damage and E damage potential is gone the very second an enemy steps outside the zone. This made me honestly sad. Miasma wasn't the greatest damage dealing ability before but it was at least a poison. It had chase potential. \n\nSpeaking on chase potential, It has been greatly reduced for Cass. Her passive is weak and there was no considerations toward the stats on boots as far as early game power. For the Price of 4 MS per level, Cass has lost options such as{{item:3009}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3158}}, with the loss of early game penetration as the biggest hit to her power not at all being covered by the increase in ratio's. ALL of these items are better than her passive for their movement speed alone in the early game not counting their additional effects. Were it that the only boots were these{{item:3675}} then her passive 'might' be tuned relatively well. However this is not the case. Her Lack of MS is also pigeon holing her into buying other sources of MS whenever she is behind in levels. I just can't feel good about Cass needing to level up to remain mobile while other champions can buy their mobility. It feels like a punishment for having a bad early game.\n\nThose are my biggest peeves currently. My opinion is that the overall feel of this rework leaves Cass overreaching. This incarnation tries to make Cass a  skirmishing, DOT, Zoning, Anti-mobility, scaling mobility, Sustained damage AP Caster.  Yet she's weak in all these aspects at the same time. If anything she has even less identity  than before.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tesrac","date":"2016-05-05T07:14:35.033+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cassie feels so weak, right now.  Yes, I understand that party of that is acclimating to her kit changes, but that passive..... So painful.  It doesn't seem right that hey passive penalizes her, no one else's does that so I can't understand the reasoning behind it.\n\nHer new Q range is, for lack of a better term, clunky and the change to her autocast makes it much harder to land an ability that was already challenging to hit with.  This was already a high skill/high reward ability, but now if you land it there's no satisfaction since you will get at best one E in before they move out if range, or just close and kill you.  With the decreased range it forces her to get way closer to anyone the Cassie ever wants to be and it's no longer a good tool to trade in lane.\n\nHer W isn't a very effective tool note, yes you can block most of the width of a land with it, but the CD is just repressive and the grounded affect sounds cool, it's pretty meh in actual gameplay.  Not sure if it's a bug, it intentional, but Amumu can use bandage toss from inside it's area with no problem, which seems counter to its function.  The max range only cast and interaction with terrain as well as the loss of vision removed a huge amount of utility from the ability making it useful in very specific circumstances, but otherwise not desirable at all.  Grounded might be more effective if it interrupted abilities that moved a champ into it, especially if you could cast it closer to yourself, but as I'd I'd rather just have a while new ability then what it is now.\n\nHer E feels super clunky and the damage doesn't seem to have any significant impact early game even when the target is poisoned, maybe with a full build it wouldn't feel that way, but I can't get to a full build because everyone just walks up to her and kills her with impunity.\n\nHer R was already only moderately useful since landing the stun is very difficult against anyone that knows her kit because of the casting time, now that you nerfed the slow by a third it's even less useful, not sure why you nerfed the slow, it wasn't at all game breaking or harsh.\n\nLastly her passive, taking away her stacking passive and replacing it with one that penalizes you while only giving move speed is pretty atrocious, especially because now the only late game spike you get out of it is a very slight advantage in move speed.\n\nPlease, please, please listen to the players, don't just tweak her numbers, give the whole kit a serious looking over, Cassie deserves better then this nerf to her entire play style.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2016-05-05T04:18:03.437+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":4,"body":"Thanks for the update and communication Meddler (and Balance Team).

But now If anyone gets on top of me they just run around me laughing! for example. I just faced an ekko. Now normally, I would simply use my underneath me, while trying to back away as he dashes to me. but now my w doesent really stop him. because quite frankly its range is absurdly far. so he walks up, procs his speed boost, and stays next to me while I vainly try to ult (which now slows even LESS!!!) to get him off me, and then my q does damage, yay, but now my e has a huge cool down! OH NO. and now im dead because before I can cast e a second time (Where normally I could have done it maybe FOUR TIMES) I am dead. same for zed, fizz, talon, yasuo, yi,diana, orianna (because she can do so much more alot faster now) and any mobile champion in the game.

And that feeling is limited entirely to early laning and siege defense. When - not if - she gets nerfed, she will be utterly unplayable in a solo lane just like everybody called from the second we heard \"balanced for support.\"\n\nWhen Zyra mains said they wanted more access to plants, that did not mean that we wanted the same damage to require 2-3 times the number of plants or that we wanted to be **100% reliant** on them to function at all. Zyra's damage right now without plants is completely non-threatening. She can't even 1-shot caster minions with Q until super built. \n\nAt only 2 plants, she was straight-up nerfed; that's a fact, not a debate topic. So now any hope of a kill combo is 3+ plants, which means relying on passive, which means relying on luck and/or stupid enemies. Roaming is nerfed. Helping with skirmishes in river is basically pointless since you'll only have 1-2 plants and your own garbo damage.\n\nThe seed passive is annoying and unreliable. Half the time it places seeds *behind* me in bushes. Other times it places them in pathways. Occasionally it puts seeds in the direction of the enemy, which is generally good except that it often puts the seeds in immediate trample range, thereby wasting the seed altogether. Maybe 1 in 10 seeds actually goes somewhere I would actually place it.\n\nThe CDR on a bunch of new items does nothing to help Zyra since she's more reliant than ever on Liandry's + Rylai's to deal any damage, let alone threatening levels of damage. Before the update Zyra did enough base damage that she could afford to build a FQC or Morello first without making herself completely irrelevant until Liandry's. This is no longer the case, so we have to rush Liandry's + Rylai's and just deal with being the last champ in the game who doesn't have CDR.\n\nAll of that combines to make Zyra a slave to her passive. You need MORE plants to match her old damage. You have less access to CDR because gutted damage requires rushing items without CDR. Less CDR means fewer W seeds and control of plants, which brings us back to her ball-and-chain of a passive.\n\nWhen we said we wanted more plants, that was true. The way to accomplish that would have been to give us more seed access and steeper diminishing returns on multiple plants attacking the same target. More zone control + more access to plants without totally breaking her damage. \n\nNobody wanted Zyra's ability damage trashed to junk-tier in exchange for a flock of RNG plants; literally nobody wanted that. Go back through any of the Zyra feedback threads that you didn't read or respond to and find a single suggestion asking for insultingly-low ability damage and RNG plants. It's not there because it's an awful idea.\n\nI have 106 ranked Zyra games this season and had 211 ranked Zyra games last season. \n**I fucking hate this update.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ibori","date":"2016-05-05T06:45:24.099+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cass main here with a couple hundred games, I really don't like how Cass feels in 6.9.

If you rush a hotfix on her for ratios or base damage or whatever then her play may go up, but if you let it all sit for a little while, I think you'll realize that letting her use Miasma at close range is the best thing to do.\n\nThe biggest complaints about the new Cassiopeia kit are clunkiness and her inability to fend for herself without teammates' help. A Miasma cast range change would go very far in solving both of those issues. I'm sure you designers at Riot agree that the priority is first to develop a kit that functions well and feels fun and fluid, and the second consideration is the numbers, ratios, etc.  - also, once a kit has become \"balanced\" yet still contains problematic design such as clunkiness, then it becomes another challenge to add flexibility and then reduce power as well.\n\nHer damage problems could be caused by item builds, etc. and with time, optimization of other things could cause her winrate to increase.

Cassiopeia players would rather you take a little while and change the Miasma cast dynamic instead of just buffing some base damages or ratios and then see the winrate numbers go up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sythriel Draken","date":"2016-05-05T04:25:51.795+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":26,"body":"{{item:3124}} {{champion:67}} {{item:3124}} Cough Cough...

Last season I had over 300 games with Cass and 75% win rate. To be honest you guys completely butchered her.\n\nFor one, her E is essentially useless because of two things: the horrendously reduced Q range and the inability to use w in a desirable range. If you happen to get within range to land a Q you are likely so close to the enemy team that there is no room for counter play on your part, as the enemy has likely already moved too close for you to use your W and your E isn't doing as much as it used to to ward off enemies from approaching.\n\nAnother factor on the E is the change from the way it used to work. Instead of keeping Cass's trade potential (which was her biggest strength and outplay potential) you have now nerfed it so that trading with it is essentially out of the window. The 0.9 second cool down seems small but the extra 0.4 seconds ruins the cadence of Cass. You said you intended to keep her a high input champ but now it seems like I'm lucky to use one E before the enemy is on top of me or safely away.\n\nThe E needs to go back to the old way it was set up. Reward players for being able to land the poison and heavily punish those who refuse to learn how to land the Q. You also need to immediately fix the range on the Q, E, and W so that Cass can be viable again.\n\nFurther it is incredibly annoying that your initial E after a Q does not account for the extra damage all the time. This needs to be fixed.\n\nI miss the old days of the Cass that rewarded skillful players with the opportunity to kite and trade. Now we have a sitting duck that throws out 3 spells and then is cannon fodder for the enemy team.\n\nPlease Riot. Make this right. Cass is my favorite champ.\n\nP.S. Early game mana costs and damage will surely be addressed by most, but it is these changes that absolutely frustrate me.\n\nEdit: grammar\n\nTL;DR Revert abilities to old ranges and cool downs, make cass great again\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"ThwartinMaPlans","date":"2016-05-05T18:35:11.091+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"This person is right in so many ways Cass has been gutted.
