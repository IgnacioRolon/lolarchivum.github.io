{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-11-17T20:05:55.674+0000","title":"Preseason Q&A","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**We're about wrapping up now, we'll have a finalized rundown later this week, but thanks for participating! We'll probably close up comments by end of tonight.**\n\n**Preseason Q&amp;A**\n\nWelcome to the preseason Q&amp;A, where myself and the design team will be fielding major questions you might have about the current preseason. Before we get to that, I wanted to write up some early first impressions we&#039;ve had so far. There are certainly some outliers we want to address before we can get a deeper understanding, but initial thoughts might quell some concerns. A few weeks from now we&#039;ll have a more high-level overview.\n\nIn the meantime...\n---\n**Preseason so far**\n\nIt&#039;ll take a while for things to shake down, but I&#039;ll dig into some first thoughts. If, after reading this, there&#039;s anything not mentioned you&#039;d like to get our thoughts on, we&#039;ll be answering questions **between 1pm-3pm** (with some less regular posting throughout the rest of the day too (where time permits) between other work). \n---\n**General Game Elements**\n\n* Masteries\n\nOverall, we&#039;re pretty happy with how the new masteries are going, with some exceptions. The first of those is that there are some that are definitely too strong. The most notable of those is *Warlord&#039;s Bloodlust*, and we&#039;ll be hotfixing that today to work on champions only, rather than against all targets. Might also need to make some changes so that this mastery&#039;s just not just dramatically more effective on Trynd/Yasuo than other champs (or make changes to Trynd/Yasuo if needs be). Other likely outliers are *Deathfire Touch* (probably too strong on DoT champs, potentially too weak on others) and some of the Resolve tree on health stacking tanks.\n\nOn the other hand there are also some champions that aren&#039;t sufficiently well served by the current masteries. Starting soon (potentially patch 5.24) we&#039;ll start adding a few extra masteries in to flesh out the trees a bit more, probably beginning with the Tier 1 Cunning masteries, since that juncture currently doesn&#039;t feel like it offers many champs a good choice.\n\n\n* Minion Blocking\n\nWe made some under the hood changes to make minion blocking more predictable and less random in 5.22, but it looks like we also made minions feel too large.  We&#039;ll be looking to adjust this to make it feel &quot;right&quot; again, starting with some tuning to how minion blocking&#039;s calculated in 5.23.   \n\n\n* The Jungle\n\nWe&#039;re seeing certain champions struggle more than they should at present. We&#039;ve got some buffs to Hunter&#039;s Talisman and Refillable Potion coming as a result to help out some early clears. We&#039;re also seeing some magic damage dealing junglers in particular have issues, so are lowering Magic Resistance on some monsters to help them specifically. If you&#039;re currently struggling in the jungle, you may want to try Krugs (or Gromp) &gt; double buffs, as that seems to be a fairly stable approach.\n\nAs far as Rift Herald goes, we&#039;re seeing it do some cool stuff so far and it seems to be generating the sort of teamwork and reward for controlling the top part of the river we&#039;d hoped. That said, the Herald is looking like it&#039;s a bit too punishing, so we&#039;re reducing its damage output somewhat while trying to keep it tanky. Hopefully this reduces the need to recall after taking it for many champions. \n\n\n* Turrets\n\nWe&#039;re currently seeing turrets die too easily. Some of that&#039;s assumedly due to the reduction in effective health tower health in 5.22, some of it&#039;s also going to be due to a bug that&#039;s removing their intended growth in Armor/MR over time. We&#039;ll be fixing that bug in 5.23, and increasing outer tower health a bit, then looking at whether towers are still falling too fast or not.  \n\n---\n**Champions:**\n\n\n* Marksmen\n\nGraves is significantly too strong, Kog&#039;maw definitely too weak. We&#039;ll be nerfing and buffing those two respectively in today&#039;s hotfix, with Graves losing some burst and early harass power from Q (damage and mana cost nerfs) and a bit of base MS. Kog by contrast&#039;s getting a little bit of early AD and a better base attack speed. In both cases we suspect we&#039;ll need to make further adjustments as well. We&#039;d rather chip at some of the problem quickly and then reassess than try and do everything at once without sufficient observation time. \n\nCurrent thinking is that a few other marksmen probably also need adjustments, though just in the form of regular balance changes rather than a hotfix. For 5.23 we&#039;re looking at cutting a bit of power from Lucian and MF, both of whom seem too dominant, and we&#039;ll be fixing a couple of small bugs on Ashe&#039;s Q that should help her out a bit. We&#039;re also looking at Quinn to try and shift some of her power from raw damage back into utility, though aren&#039;t sure yet whether we&#039;ll have changes we&#039;re happy with for 5.23 or not.\n\n\n* Assassins\n\nPhysical damage assassins seem to be in a rough spot after the removal of Brutalizer and changes to Last Whisper. In the short term, we&#039;re looking to give some of them a bit of love through buffs to their kits (Kha&#039;zix/Zed), longer term we&#039;ll also want to find some other solutions as well (potentially assassin focused items, or item changes).\n\n\n* Other Champion Changes\n\nIt&#039;s not preseason specific, but we&#039;ve also got some significant follow up work on Mordekaiser coming soon. Statikk should be covering that in a separate thread in the Dev Corner within the next couple of days, with some context on what we felt worked and what didn&#039;t from the Morde rework in 5.16, plus thoughts on what our next steps are and why when it comes to addressing issues Morde has. \n\nThe next patch will also include a general sizing pass on a large number of champions, with model sizes of around 40 champions changes by between -10% and +10%. The goal there&#039;s to align champion size better with each champion&#039;s role (tanks should look bigger and tougher, squishies like ADCs smaller and more...squishy) while at the same time removing some visual discrepancies (Lucian&#039;s not intended be 7 foot plus tall for example).  \n\n---\n**Other Stuff**\n\n* Items\n\nStatikk Shiv&#039;s looking too generically strong. We&#039;ll be hitting its damage as a result, while increasing its damage against minions to try and focus it more as a waveclear item.\n\nRageblade is just all-around way too strong. As a first step we&#039;ll be increasing its cost a few hundred gold, but I imagine we&#039;ll need to look at further power cuts at some point as well.\n\n\n* Clean Up, Bug Fixes\n\nWe&#039;ve got a number of start of game things to sync up (bunch of stuff that needs to be shifted forwards up to 15s to match the earlier game start, like Bard Chime spawns, Skarner Crystals, Smite charges etc), plus a number of bug fixes to things that changed in 5.22.\n\n\n* Game Duration\n\nGame duration, and snowballiness, has been one of the things we&#039;ve spent the most time looking at and talking about since the preseason launch. So far it&#039;s looking like the average game is a couple of minutes faster. There are some changes coming in 5.23 that will likely impact that, in particular a change to Homeguard that gives a modified version to every player after 20 minutes, somewhat tougher turrets (see above), and changes to minion strength that cause them to push more if their team is winning (giving winning teams opportunities to siege/losing teams opportunities to farm and catch up). \n\nIn terms of direction, two of the big things we&#039;re looking at are the concerns that games are ending too often before late game and that a single mistake mid game may be deciding things too much, too often. We&#039;re also looking at whether games are too stompy in general. Some increase in stompiness is expected for the first patch of the preseason, as people experiment with new things, that&#039;s something that should fall off fairly quickly though. If not, we&#039;ll need to make some follow up changes. \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"fannybandit","date":"2015-11-17T20:57:34.313+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":3,"body":"I have a question/suggestion.

A world where a mage decides between high-damage, higher-cooldown abilities vs. lower-damage, utility-focused, lower-cooldown abilities seems like an interesting decision if done well.\n\nIn other words, right now there's a large mentality shift of \"I will always hit the CDR cap\" to \"I need to think try very hard to hit the CDR cap.\" Additionally, since outside of the keystone masteries there hasn't been anything more powerful injected into Mages, it might feel like a power decrease but we have a lot of noise and data we'll need to parse through to see if this is actually true. Are mages weak? Are mages properly calibrated against their core stats (CDR, AP, mana regen)? Honestly speaking I want to see more before just saying \"if you raise gold costs on AP and make it more difficult to hit the CDR cap, of course mages are going to be weak,\" - it's hard to assess that without seeing how the ecosystem of the game actually plays out, not to mention the strength of Deathfire Touch.\n\n[edit]\n\nAdditional note on other champions getting more 'free' access to CDR than mages. These kind of comparisons are really weird to me, because CDR is one of those stats that's very closely tied to the balance of the kit using it. CDR on marksmen tends to be very singular in purpose - damage - and often dependent on proper positioning to use well. Most Mage abilities tend to be fight-starters or fight-stoppers, meaning they have the ability to dramatically change the landscape or flow of a fight on a single ability cast. CDR to them is far more valuable and, in their natural item builds, needs to be 'priced' accordingly.\n\nIf stats were just generically priced without accounting for the stat affinities of the classes purchasing them, I think we'd get some really, really weird scenarios.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-11-17T20:41:13.955+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":3,"body":"Mostly, the complaint is that these are champions who only do useful things when they have their abilities up; compare this to ADCs, who's autoattack actually hurts.\n\nBut it's the ADCs that can easily hit CDR cap, without giving up anything at all, while mages can't.\n\nIt's kinda backwards, and easy to see how this makes people salty.","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2015-11-17T20:49:55.461+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":13,"body":"I edited in an answer regarding that, but I do feel like we're in a bit of a vacuum comparison. A mage using abilities on cooldown can often stop or outright deny a champion threat. A marksman can do the same via a steady stream of damage but we're basically talking variance in power. Mages have high variance - high highs, low lows (no abilities to cast), while Marksmen have less highs but more consistent output. In a balanced world, these two types of damage output would be well balanced against each other, but Mages also get the addition of utility, which needs to be considered as well.\n\nI suppose this is a long way of saying damage isn't the only thing to compare and Mages vs. Marksmen can't really be boiled down to individual stat comparisons and who gets access to what. A reverse example (not totally comparable) might be if Marksmen were demanding total AD scaling on Trinity Force procs, similar to Lich Bane.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-11-17T20:55:24.007+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":11,"body":"Really?\n\nLucian killing someone with one ult isn't a high?\n\nAshe stunned someone and getting them killed before they can respond isn't a high?\n\nMF wombo-comboing your team to death isn't a high?\n\nAnd it's not like every mage is utility focused, and not all of them have super strong induvidual spells.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-11-17T20:49:41.868+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Pwyff,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=B3Pe5U8H,comment-id=00080001,timestamp=2015-11-17T20:34:21.820+0000)\n>\n> \n> For the CDR topic, I wonder if the ideal state of Mages is that they are guaranteed to hit CDR cap without much tradeoff or if they can be balanced in a way that **investing into CDR is a meaningful decision** (ie: giving up MR and maybe even Sorc Boots to double down on cooldowns for the additional utility).

I mean,I like the new turrets because i can get my turret fast and help other lanes that need it, but if i gank for another lane and go back to base, and if my laner has a wave backing them up, i know for a fact that my tower is gone in less that T-minues 30 seconds. Which is pretty lame if i dominated them in lane; it's also pretty lame when you are being dominated and have to back due to low health, and your turret is being taken down in 2 pushes, maybe not even that. I know you guys wanted to try to speed up games, but I think i can speak for a lot of summoners when I say that I (we) love the long strechted out games because that is where our true skill and the champions true strengths come out, and that towers needed an overall buff not nerf. I think i personally would be fine with the tower changes if you guys tweaked their damage to fit how easily they can be taken down, or keep that \"minus all incomming champion damage by 30\" until like 10-20 miuntes???

And what I mean by non-combat are masteries aimed at things like map control, vision, taking objectives, and farming.\n\n2.\tWith two ADC junglers ({{champion:203}} Kindred and {{champion:104}} Graves) has there been any thought of making a jungle enchantment for ADCs? Currently after a lot of testing on new Graves (and my fair share of Kindred last season) they are better off not enchanting as {{item:1412}} Warrior is meant for fighters and {{item:3931}} Devourer is tuned to be unattractive on ranged champions.\n\n3.\tIs there anything going to be done about junglers being weak in the early game? With a tough first clear and them having to put a lot of gold into non-combat stats, junglers are very prone to being invaded and it is very hard to farm your way out of being behind.\n\n4.\tIn a similar vein is there any plan to make {{item:2032}} hunter’s potion more attractive? I really want to like it and I’ve been making a point to buy it when I can, but it seems to make jungle problems worse instead of better since it is even more gold spent on non-combat stats and by the time you buy it you are already getting enough sustain from your jungle items.\n\n5.\tIs there any plans to add some masteries to help {{champion:75}} Nasus as the mastery trees are just wonky for him. It’s not that their isn’t masteries for him, but that he has to take a lot of inefficient masteries to get to the ones he want and the masteries he does want are deep in the trees. For example, two masteries he should want the most are Intelligence and Stormraider’s Surge as he loves CDR and wants the speed boost, but they are deep in the Cunning tree and most of the rest of the cunning tree are full of things he doesn’t really want/need. On the other hand he likes almost everything in the Resolve tree, Swiftness especially, but none of the Resolve keystones are that great on him (Grasp of the Undying - He already has built in lifesteal and he probably won’t get more than one proc off on someone due to his burst/kitability; Strength of Ages - Unless you are a jungler it takes too long to farm up; Bond of Stone - He isn’t a support and would rather be doing damage then taking it from an ally). This means to get to the mastery he most wants out of the Resolve tree he has to take a keystone that is only okay on him.\n\n6.\tIs there any plans for {{item:3078}} Trinity Force? I built it once and I didn’t get anywhere near the power spike I was used to with it. And the rest of the time I didn’t even want to build it because of the stat layout.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2015-11-17T20:37:00.540+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why is there no longer a true-sight elixir or trinket? Every season since I have played (season 3 onward) there has always been an option for true-sight while full build. Oracles elixir could be purchased with all item slots full (just like other elixirs), and would auto-consume and give you true-sight. After it was removed, we got 2 true-sight trinkets (the upgraded red trinket and the pink ward trinket).\n\nNow, this pre-season, we have nothing. There is a trinket that gives you \"warning particles\" but it doesn't reveal the stealthed champion, so you can't target them. This is a problem, because MOST stealth champs are assassins, so unless you're a tank those warning particles aren't going to do anything - if they're more fed than you they're going to one-shot you with no counterplay.\n\nIf you are a non-stealth assassin (or an ADC) the stealth assassin is going to kill you with no counterplay almost 100% of the time (EDIT: because they get the first-strike). And if you've reached 6 items, you can no longer purchase vision wards, the only current item you could \"outplay\" them with.\n\nDo you guys plan to do anything about this? (I honestly have not played one game this preseason, and won't play at all this season if there are no viable anti-stealth options while full build - it's not about whether I can or can't climb, it's more-so that it is completely anti-fun to be against a stealth champ and not be able to do anything about them, so if a game isn't fun I'm not going to play it, because games are supposed to be fun)\n\nPS: I main Eve, and with no vision ward trinket, you've made it impossible for people to counter me late-game.

As an individual contributor to the marksmen updates, it will only reflect my perspective, but hopefully it will be helpful:\n\n1) Winrate data is heavily skewed at the moment due to three factors.\n First, a couple of champions are way too strong (e.g., Graves). They will naturally lower the win rate of all other marksmen. \nSecond, champions with new mechanics ought to go down in win rate as people learn to use them. This includes itemization changes (e.g., we are confused as to why players aren't trying Essence Reaver on Sivir). \nThird, not every champion will have a 50% win rate at balance. For example, as we differentiate marksmen, you'll have to pick them in the right circumstances - If you pick Vayne on a team that desperately needs wave clear, you'll probably be worse off than if you'd picked Sivir. Champs that have well defined niches will tend to be more powerful than their win rate suggests. \n\n2) We aren't sure where every champion sits. Obviously we have our own internal assessments of champion power, but they actually differ markedly from a lot of players' perspectives. Unless we take the time to carefully watch and play the champions on Live for a while, we risk just playing musical chairs, shifting a new set of marksmen from apparently weak to actually overpowered. Further, we can't just balance champs. We need to listen to you, the player base, about how you want to use champs in order to get the _right _changes in place. Technically, we could just balance any champ just through changing their base HP and HP per level, but it wouldn't lead to a satisfying experience.\n\n3) That is all very nebulous. So here are some specific answers. \n* We're hotfixing Graves and Kog'Maw today (nerf and buff respectively). \n* I'd look some obvious changes in 5.23 and a substantial amount of fine tuning in 5.24. \n* Caitlyn's Q is indeed too weak. Even if we had to nerf other elements of her, it would be worth buffing the ability to let her actually reach towers and make skillfully avoiding it matter when playing against. \n* I believe duo bot Twitch is very powerful and that players who are routinely failing with him are probably not good at the champion or are fixated on a strategy that is now less effective (teamfight AoE) as opposed to opportunistic assassination. Even the data supports this. His win rate is almost 50% when played in his best role. He's not doing well in the jungle, and we'll have to assess how much we can support him there.\n* I don't have a good sense for Sivir and Ashe's balance right now, so perhaps someone else can reply to that. Anecdotally, they feel effective given their utility.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"maucer","date":"2015-11-17T20:17:06.103+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Has there been anymore thought on adding champion mastery levels to ARAM (or other modes) in some form?

In my experience so far, anyone that wants to consistently buy potions to sustain for the jungle will struggle **heavily** on the initial camps if they take refillable and barely make enough gold to either upgrade it or grab the other jungle item before having to recall.  This feels super bad because of how much recalling delays you (in both gold and xp) for very small gain.  As well, going the immediate potion upgrade route delays your jungle item and the very important bonus xp from the second half.  (Side note - I've been feeling very underleveled in the jungle so far in the preseason even when avoiding the refillable.)
