The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Not doing starting items in pre-season**\n\nWe&#039;d previously mentioned that we&#039;d taking a look at starting items (changes and new ones) during pre-season. After some investigation into options there we&#039;ve decided not to do so, instead putting more time into runes, base stat changes and some other systemic changes. Starting items still looks like a good space to work on later, with things like an item for bot lane mages as an alternative to marksmen particularly promising. We&#039;ll give it another look next year as a result. \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Jungle Ezreal**\n\nBeen seeing a few questions about our thoughts on Ez getting jungle play crop up. Looks really cool so far to us is the short version. Nice to see a champ getting play in a different way. Early days yet, but counterplay seems fine, the lack of which is what&#039;s lead us to nerfing/changing champs out of certain positions in the past (e.g. Malz bot lane or Janna mid). If it ever starts to look too strong we&#039;d tone it down, but wouldn&#039;t want to squash it if we could avoid it. If Ez did end up as a jungle only champ we&#039;d want to do some work to let him lane again without pushing him out of the jungle if possible too. Similar situation to Ziggs as both bot laner and mid laner. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Ornn Balance**\n\nOrnn&#039;s been out a while and received a fair few buffs after a weak release. We&#039;re still seeing a lot of people struggle with him, at the same time though a lot of Ornn play is still coming from people getting their first few games on him in. We won&#039;t be buffing him further in 7.19 at the least, want to avoid overbuffing him and we think there&#039;s still some learning curve going on. Planning to check in on him in each of the next couple of patches though, see how things are going and if we should throw a bit of power his way or not. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Bramble Vest**\n\nWe&#039;re testing some Bramble Vest stuff at the moment, with two possible directions. Main issue is that Bramble Vest is too powerful for its cost as a general item, rather than a more specific niche buy. We&#039;re considering either increasing its cost significantly (around 300g) with a slight stats increase, both nerfing its gold efficiency and delaying its lane impact. Or reducing its stats a bit and pushing its cost up slightly, nerfing its gold efficiency but still leaving it fairly accessible in lane as a counter item if desired (rather than by default). At time of writing one of those versions should be on PBE, possible we test the other as well shortly, though might still go back to the first one depending on how things go.\n\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png\n","replies":[{"poster":"Rainfall","date":"2017-09-20T17:08:25.025+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":14,"body":"meddler,irrelevant to this post,why has riot stopped visiting and commenting on posts in the gameplay boards?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-09-20T17:25:19.619+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":2,"body":"I can't speak for all of Riot.

Here are some less drastic changes that I recommend to make ASol more accessible to new players:\n\n1. Allow him to move through units (makes hitting the stars a lot less clumsy, which is currently a tough barrier of entry).\n2. Allow him to cancel his Q early, so he doesn't feel like a free punching bag versus divers (it currently creates a really bad impression to new players who want to learn him).\n3. Increase the power of his non-W passive, so it's more rewarding and not quite as niche as it currently is, considering the screen clutter it adds to the game versus its actual usefulness.\n\nBut those things do not fix how oppressive ASol may be to his opponents, right? And they are straight buffs to a champion that's already strong, right? So let's look at things to tone down now:\n\n4. Make his W passive deal less damage, but perhaps give it a more niche/ context-specific utility. This, alongside suggestion n.3, forces Asol players to get closer in range and rely less on the safety of W's radius.\n5. Alternatively, make his passive scale in damage with each hit, starting weaker but gradually growing stronger the more times you hit it on the same opponent during a short window of time. This gives time for your opponents to go back and avoid being killed.\n6. If n.4 or n.5 end up weakening Sol too much, consider adding some damage back to his skill shots.\n\nTLDR; Make ASol less clunky, make him rely more on his non-W passive for riskier plays and riskier farm, make him rely less on his W passive to avoid lack of counterplay in certain matchups.\n\nThere, no need to drastically change the passive of the champion, like your earlier proposal intended to.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-09-20T17:10:33.908+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Jungle Ezreal\n\nEzreal has been for a very long time a poster child for champs who can **healthily** support various different builds.

His Q breaks a usually strongly established rule (you can't apply on AA effects at long ranges). That allows for some creative use of effects in different ways than other champs usually get to use them.\n2. That's counter balanced by a lack of a lot of other things on his kit (no CC, no sustained mobility, no protective effects beyond his blink/range, no target agnosticism etc). Getting powerful effects from different builds doesn't leave him overloaded.\n3. A lot of his output's unreliable (skillshots in his case), meaning even if something removes counterplay in other ways there's always some degree of inherent response available to all opponents. \n4. There's a strong enough core to his gameplay identity that it doesn't get drowned out under his items (he's still Ezreal, rather than just a bunch of different stats/unique effects).","replies":[{"poster":"DCYOUNG888","date":"2017-09-20T17:25:57.353+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean by \"target agnosticism\"?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-09-20T17:28:13.727+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, sorry, bit jargony.

But if a champion only had 30 MR and lost 20 from abyssal with your magic pen runes you don't get much from sorc shoes because abyssal's reduction works first lowering their MR before you hit them before you do dmg and count your penetration.

This is because you will auto a ton, but only cast spells some of the time on most mage junglers.  About the only excepjtion would be Eve, only that her two primary damage abilities have AD ratios anyway, so it doesn't matter and still is better for her to take the AD over Mpen.
