{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-06-07T16:15:41.906+0000","title":"Quick Gameplay Thoughts: June 7","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi folks,\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Usual Disclaimers**\n\nThese posts will often contain talk about future work we're doing, or planning to do, that isn't yet guaranteed to ship. The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \n**Zac revert refinements**\n\nGoing to talk today about various bits and pieces people have been bringing up a fair bit recently. First up, Zac's R revert. In addition to putting some straight power into him in 9.12 we're also looking to get some stuff working like it used to with the original version of this ult. That includes blob generation on each bounce for 9.12. Also looking to get VO lines back in that used to play with his ult, not sure on exact timing on those yet though.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \n**Shen Q and Hail of Blades**\n\nWouldn't normally focus on an individual bug (for one thing I just don't normally have the context on where a fix is or isn't up to). Did want to follow up on this particular one though. We've got a fix for Shen not triggering Hail of Blades on Q empowered AAs in 9.12. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \n**Chat on Loading Screen**\n\nWe talked about this when the changes to the new loading screen were rolling out earlier in the year but haven't touched on it since. Short version is we've decided to deprioritize this work for now. It's something we'd still like to do at some point, conclusion was that the Client and UI engineering time needed for it would be better spent elsewhere right now though. Should be able to talk about some of the projects we chose to prioritize instead pretty soon (realize it's hard to assess a call like this without context on what was being traded off with what).\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \n**Support Item Changes**\n\nSimilarly we made some changes to support items a while back to address some problematic uses in other positions. Our goal at the time was to then do some further work, find better long term improvements to those items in general. That work has shown some promise. Our current thinking is to ship it in preseason. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \n**Non SR Game Modes**\n\nAnd finally also seeing quite a few questions or suggestions crop up about non SR game modes recently, particularly Nexus Blitz, ARURF, ARAM and TT. We should have some details to share next month on how we'll be approaching those modes late next month, including when the non permanent ones will next be available. \n\n\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png          ","replies":[{"poster":"AIQ","date":"2019-06-07T16:19:47.070+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey Meddler,\n\nWith {{champion:19}}  he has a slew of Gameplay bugs affecting him ATM especially on his W.

Level 3 this is a 12.25 damage buff increasing the total to by 85.75 only if someone stays in it for 7 seconds. This is not much for an ability you spend 2-3 seconds catching up to a target first. Effectively you are going to deal around 40-50 of the damage. This will mostly help AP Shyvana clear faster and on hit Shyvana feel better with FM or full tank. I would say this is the only \"Buff\". \"Big\"? By no means. \n\nGaining Fury while dead is the definition of a QOL buff, as this should have never been a thing to begin with and it will RARELY have impact on the game. Because most Shyvanas die 5-6 times a game. And the majority of those deaths are 10-15 minutes. \n\nFixing WW Q and W will probably make him much strong and the buff on his Q should be reverted instead.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tantarboy","date":"2019-06-07T16:21:00.776+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm a bit afraid of what will be said about TT honestly, i really don't want to see it gone","replies":[{"poster":"xScarfy","date":"2019-06-07T17:13:12.408+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same!

We were told they would be getting traded off for more permanent game modes or events like star guardian that you guys would make more regularly (though not anywhere close to rotating game mode regularity). And I really don't feel like we've gotten the trade-off value.\n\nLike, we didn't get Nexus Blitz as a new permanent gamemode, Clash is still dragging it's feet getting live (not that I have any faith at this point I could even get the people to do it anymore after the leap of faith to get them to do it last time blew up in my face), and we haven't been getting much in the way of event gamemodes. In 2017 we got Dark Star, Invasion/Star Guardian, and OVERCHARGE/Project event gamemodes, in 2018 we only got Odyssey. With 2017 as our example year, I was thinking this trade-off could be worth it, but given we didn't get Odyssey until 9 months in, and it was the only event we got, AND that the justification for that was the Clash and Blitz work that has not come or will not come; I'm fairly annoyed over what we lost in exchange.\n\nSure, we've had some traditionally rotating gamemodes come back for a bit despite rotating game modes stopping, but most of it has been variations of URF or not really a full gamemode (Butcher's Bridge, map accents, and addition of Poro King to Blitz instead of a proper snowdown event). I have not seen Ascension, Hexakill, or Definitely not Dominion in a very  long time. Doom bots, Hunt of the Blood Moon, Legend of the Poro King, and Nexus Siege are rarely seen. With the gamemodes we get being determined by popularity and URF always being in demand, we may never see a lot of these gamemodes again. Not to mention we were told of work being done a year ago to get Hexakill on the new client and still haven't seen or heard anything about it.\n\nMy point is that rotating gamemodes were important, it helped keep the game fresh for me, and gave my friends a motivation to play the game beyond just summoner's rift. A lot of my friends like League, but find regular games a bit of a slog. They feel pressured to play good, but don't necessarily play often enough to match the ones of us that play near daily. And they don't have the confidence because of that to play other champions. Back when rotating gamemodes were around, I could always without fail get them to play a bit more and stagger out normal games for them with the rotating gamemodes. They understood the rules were so different that they didn't have to be good, the enjoyment was in the mode itself, not much else. I'm not getting that at all in LoL anymore. There's nothing to stagger out normal games with, ARAM doesn't really do that for me anymore given the random aspect, there are no rotating gamemodes, and events are few and far between. Personally even I'm starting to burn out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"painkills","date":"2019-06-07T19:02:50.898+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please bring back short, choose-your-own-champion game modes. \n\nI don't always have time to get a full SR done, but want to play.
