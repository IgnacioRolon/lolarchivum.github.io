The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Some 8.17 balance changes**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve just finished work on 8.16. A fair bit of time at the moment&#039;s going into exploratory work on preseason as discussed earlier this week. We&#039;ll be doing some balance changes in 8.17 too though. Some things we&#039;ll be looking at below, we&#039;re also expecting some champs will probably need follow up changes after the 8.16 nerfs to burst from runes. Waiting to see where those land though before picking targets.\r\n\r\n* Annie Buff - Getting back to this after other work delayed it. First direction tested will be increasing her AA range back to its previous values.\r\n* Garen nerf - Garen&#039;s too strong at this point. We&#039;ll be looking to take power out in ways that nerfs him more in lower MMR, less in high, given it&#039;s low MMR that he&#039;s particularly out of line\r\n* Yorick nerf - Same deal as Garen, targeting low MMR\r\n* Rek&#039;Sai buff - Not sure on details yet, likely just targeting overall power\r\n* Lee Sin assessment - Our 8.15 changes to Lee were intended to be a slight buff, looks like they&rsquo;ve potentially ended up being a slight nerf however. We&rsquo;re considering some followup changes to add a bit more power to him as a result. We tested some stuff during the 8.16 dev cycle, but weren&rsquo;t happy with it so concluded we&rsquo;d hold off and assess again in 8.17, see where he was up to.\r\n* Yasuo assessment - Similar deal to Lee Sin. 8.15 changes (crit items in this case) nerfed him noticeably. We looked at a buff in 8.16, but weren&rsquo;t happy with the specifics we had in testing. That was an increased AD ratio on his ult. That had the benefit of addressing cases where his ult was getting outdamaged by one of his auto attacks (some bad feels) and helped push him towards heavier AD builds (versus going tanky, which cuts into his counterplay quite a lot). Had the downside of also making more of his damage front loaded however. We&rsquo;ll be assessing him again during 8.17 too. \r\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**The Zoe playing against experience**\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;re also doing some work on Zoe, which is less about power and more about improving what it&rsquo;s like to play against her. Not certain exactly which patch that will be in yet, or what the specific changes will be. Could be 8.17, more likely somewhat later though. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**Smite in champ select**\r\n\r\nSomething we&#039;re doing with Nexus Blitz is making Smite a required pick for both junglers (gets put on you automatically in champ select). That&#039;s not necessarily something that&#039;ll be the case forever, but it&#039;s how we want to have for initial testing at least. We believe double jungle&#039;s optimal, but that&#039;s easy to misunderstand when first trying out the mode. We&#039;d like to avoid early testing at least being distorted by people who aren&#039;t aware you&#039;ll want two junglers per team, hence the forcing smite.\r\n\r\nAs a follow up to that we&#039;ll also be making it so, if you&#039;re put into champ select as a jungler on SR, you&#039;ll also have Smite as one of your Summoner Spells when you join the lobby. For SR you&#039;ll be free to change it should you want to swap positions with someone else, jungle without Smite or whatever (it&#039;s a default, not a mandatory thing). Goal there is to remove cases where a player forgets to check Summoners after playing a different position the game beforehand and loads in without Smite unintentionally, putting their team at a significant disadvantage. Still figuring out exact timing on that change, shouldn&#039;t be too far away, but will be a bit later than Nexus Blitz going live. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**On My Way Pings**\r\n\r\nSpeaking of things that are coming soon, though not in the very next patch, we&#039;ve got some improvements to the on my way ping. We&#039;ll be making it so that the ping also conveys some information about how far away the champion pinging is (really close, kinda close, really far etc). That&#039;ll happen both through different chat messages and somewhat different ping sounds. It&#039;s something we&#039;ve been testing internally for a while and as you&#039;d expect have found is helpful in coordinating ganks especially.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2018-08-10T15:45:10.487+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":18,"body":"Could we skip a patch of skins and get a new death recap?

Anything really.\n\nAre his statistics good at the moment? If so, why do you think they are?\n\nWhen the botlane meta was shifted and adc's playrate went down, Morde suddenly became viable bot because some of his worse matchups there(like long ranged Cait and Trist) had a very low playrate so Morde could more safely be brought to botlane.Then after a few patches, adc's were brought back to line, and Morde once again was vanished from botlane.\nYou also have Morde's other lanes:Top and Mid.\nMorde top has been far much worse since the start of season 8. He got very little compensation for stats when the runes were removed and more champions have been released that have made Morde have a more difficult time staying in top(those champions for example being Irelia and Aatrox).\nMorde mid seems to be his best lane at the moment. But even then, most of his matchups make laning so difficult that the best way for him to be succesfull mid is to leave the lane and roam with the jungler to look for picks and get dragon ghosts.\n\nSo can anything be done about him or do we have to play the waiting game forever until eventually morde gets reworked?\n\nPlease don't ignore this and thanks for taking your time to read this.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-08-10T15:54:21.833+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't confirm for certain which VGUs we'll have next year or in what order.

Specific combo timings, more game state dependent pushing power etc.\n\n\nIt's also possible we end up just having to cut some power in general from him, depending on how things test and other demands on the team's time.

If you decide to nerf Garen anyway, please make sure you do not forget to compensate him if you end up changing TriGage builds in anyway.\n\nAlso what are your thoughts on Ornn. I used to one trick Ornn since his release but his current state is just not fun to play at all, even after his repeated nerfs I was still playing him up until unstoppable was removed which I thought was a very satisfying part of his kit. I understand he needs to be balanced hard due to his impact in LCS but as a solo queue player it just feels unfair, especially because I was a Jungle Ornn player and not a toplaner.\n\n My humble opinion as an ex Ornn one trick is that you should focus a lot more nerfs on his ult than his W. Perhaps also change the shield on his W to dmg reduction for the duration of the flame breath as opposed to a shield that can persist, have it scale so that it is weaker than his current shield in the early game for how much damage it mitigates, but stronger in the late game (to compensate for ultimate nerfs) \n\nI also suggest taking some damage off his W and make it more skill expressive. Im not sure how you would do that but I had some thoughts. Put more damage into brittle if brittle is procced through specific criteria (a brittle procced by a teammates CC does x% more damage, a brittle procced via the knockup of Ornns E does x% more damage, brittle procced by Ornns ultimate does x% more damage, if brittle is procced within .5 seconds it does x% more damage, if not procced within 1.5seconds the maximum damage a brittle proc can do rapidly drops off with a minimum %). My reasoning behind this is that it can take some strength away from his laning phase in particular his zone after landing the last tick of W, but still allow contribution within teamfights, and reward an Ornn for playing well and landing combos or helping his team. I also know that giving Ornn access to more damage if played well can potentially make him a more crucial pick within the LCS but if he was only able to do maybe 2% more max hp dmg than current state if played perfectly, I would be perfectly happy to take hits to the base damage as I would be confident I can play him to full extent. Just some food for thought. \n\nAlso I would love to see the return of Unstoppable on his W. But perhaps with a compensation nerf, (if an enemy triggers Ornns unstoppable his dmg reduction/shield is lost for the remainder of the duration). Unstoppable felt like such a natural part of his kit and key part of his playstyle as a lumbering juggernaut. It really helped get in or escape if used well, but now without it, sometimes it feels impossible to escape or deal damage without ultimate against teams with heavy CC.\n\nThose are some really quick thoughts of mine and I am happy enough if you simply take the time to read them, I understand my opinion is nowhere near as weighted without balance experience or in depth statistics. Although if you ever feel like talking to someone who used to main Ornn and had considerable amount of games on him within higher elo brackets (plat 3 - diamond 5) PRIOR to his buffs as well as him becoming meta-dominant. I would love to and be honoured.","replies":[{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2018-08-12T17:30:55.415+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GenghisKhanate,realm=OCE,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=upj64E0i,comment-id=00ab,timestamp=2018-08-11T08:43:34.121+0000)\n>\n> If you plan on nerfing Garen please  look into the abuse of Triforce/Steraks as a build path BEFORE nerfing Garen specifically, without that build path Garen doesnt have as absurd winrates.

Sometimes it just stays in a lane after just moving through it even with a wave being further down the lane, and sometimes it is standing alone in front of the enemy tower and still chooses to follow you once you leave.\nAlso there is still that nasty E bug where ghouls sometimes just don't jump on the marked target. Sometimes they don't even aggro them. \n\nIf I was designing Yorick I would let him choose. to leave his ult in a lane by reactivating it. but if you really want to have that flavor of him not being able to control it sure. \nBut at least some buxfixing would be nice to compensate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2018-08-10T15:32:35.412+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Meddler now that they are revealed can I ask you for the gameplay reasons and or goals of Kayle and Morgana's reworks","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-08-10T15:38:08.300+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"As with most VGUs we'll be leaving the specifics until close to their release.

Judgment and Execute are. Alternatively you could introduce a AD'scaling cap to Passive same as Evelynn has to try and tone down his early perma sustain while also coercing players into finally building him correctly (Sunfire Garen players YUCK!)\n\nYasuo honestly needs no buffs whatsoever. Dude is absolute monster in capable hands and still wins nearly any matchup that isn't against a high damage bruiser with hard CC. He pounds you in lane then he pounds you at late game and the only thing you can do is hope he \"outplays\" himself by pouncing on him as a team when he takes a bad dive.\n\n\nLee Sin you guys need to STOP putting so much power in Q and R. Getting dragons Rage+ Q one shot is so unfun. Also dont forget when Lee Sin is popular he is a INCREDIBLY powerful jungler who has both healthy,quick and high damage invades + snowball. be CAREFUL with how much power you put into him. Him and Kha'Zix are like the twin gods of snowball jungling so they can really set the bar sometimes when good (can your champ fight kha/lee? dont pick em otherwise)\n\nRek'Sai honestly just suffers from a pretty stat check kit so GL buffing her without making her obnoxious. If it was up to me I would make make it so R could be better used a initiation tool or make it so max rage furious bite CONSUMES the rage to heal her or something idk,. I would try and avoid just outright pumping her numbers. You could always of course when you found the time try and do more small scale work on her.

Thusly I think Right now there is not much reason for Rek'Sai to even be in the game anymore. patch by patch she just feels more and more like a tanky knock-up bot with nothing else going for her and I dont think making her Q start one-shotting people again is going to change this...","replies":[{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2018-08-10T21:20:26.755+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen lvl 18 has 127 armor, Pyke lvl 18 has 130 armor...","replies":[{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2018-08-11T02:25:58.233+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats a TERRIBLE nitpick.\n\n1.

Tagetting champs due to their low MMR power seems counterintuitive and you're missing a lot of champs that are overpowered in low mmr (Akali/Zed/Yasuo/Master Yi).
