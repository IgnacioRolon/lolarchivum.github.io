The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n\r\n**Solo Snowball versus Team Snowball**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re going to be looking at how some of the rewards in the game contribute to solo snowball versus team snowball over some upcoming patches. We shifted a few things towards team snowball a while back, aiming to give more agency/impact to roles who needed it (jungle/support at the time) and reduce the degree to which the other positions would sometimes get so individually far ahead they were too hard to deal with. In retrospect we think we went too far in that direction though. That reduced concentration of power makes it harder to get ahead enough to really carry and means that when you&#039;re facing an enemy team that&#039;s ahead it&#039;s a bit too much that they&#039;re all ahead and threatening than that there are particular enemies who are really high threat you need to try and play around/shut down. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re planning to start by shifting shutdown gold back to going to whoever killed the enemy on a killstreak, rather than being split globally with the team. That&#039;s also got the benefit of making it more possible to get back into a losing lane if you can manage to get a kill on someone who&#039;s significantly up on kills on you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf that shutdown gold changes goes well we&#039;ll then look at see whether we should shift any other team rewards back towards solo rewards. Want to make sure we&#039;re getting the desired result before doing that though and cautious about swinging back too far in the other direction. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n\r\n**Next Champion Roadmap**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been seeing questions about when we&#039;ll have the next Champion roadmap start to crop up quite a bit recently so I checked in with Reav3 (who writes them) yesterday to find out. Current estimate is the next post is likely to in mid to late April, so about a month from now. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n\r\n**Homestart tuning and invades**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ll be doing some tuning to the start of game speed boost in an upcoming patch, probably 8.7. Back in pre-season we increased its speed significantly so that we could reduce time until minions spawn without cutting into invade times too much. That&#039;s worked well overall, the exact implementation can be a bit too punishing for aggressors though, given they&#039;ll sometimes be trying to chase down defenders who haven&#039;t yet entered the river and so still have the large speed boost themselves. Looking at adjusting things a bit as a result so defensive positions aren&#039;t rewarded quite as much. That&#039;s likely to look something like removing the speed after passing the outer towers (instead of the river), reducing the speed buff duration a bit, or making the speed boost start higher but decay.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"BrokenKatt","date":"2018-03-21T15:47:35.777+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"THANK GOD please make me winning my lane matter slightly more as a non bot laner","replies":[]},{"poster":"Illâoi Evê Siôn","date":"2018-03-21T15:52:00.383+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Will you leave us means to promote team snowball on champions who don't want solo snowball?

I&#x27;ll pass that on, thanks!\n\nSeems like it might be a solid fix to simply let it trigger for as long as you're on the fountain, up to X seconds into the game. I.E. basically make it two buffs: an X second buff while you're on the fountain, that, once you leave, gives you Y seconds of effect. Triggered only when you first spawn into the game. So if you leave the fountain while the first buff is active, you get the second buff. Otherwise, you get nothing.\n\nYou might have to tune it (or initial few seconds of gold flow) so that holding it on the fountain for some extra gold isn't the optimal situation, but it seems like it would have potential for helping people who load in a little slower.\n\nHeck, you could possibly even backload some minor XP generation into the fountain side of the buff to help slow loaders not be stomped in lane. Something like \"if you've still on the fountain after 1 minute and your buff is still up, get some partial XP flow.\"","replies":[{"poster":"I am Razgriz","date":"2018-03-21T21:20:50.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You're overcomplicating this.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-03-21T21:54:30.455+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=I am Razgriz,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=7lOZPHOi,comment-id=0026000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-21T21:20:50.899+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re overcomplicating this.\n\nIt's not super complicated.

No matter what, getting a solo kill is less valuable than a kill with at least one helper.\n\nPerhaps adjust the baseline kill gold up, and make assist actually take a chunk from the kill's value?\n\nThis drops the pressure to try and force yourself to get an assist in situations you may not have seen one happen (because you are not wasting the 150 assist gold or so), while also rewarding solo plays a bit more than team gang-bang feistas on bot, especially because while they may get a lead, they won't get as much gold funneled into whoever got the kill with the assist draining it out.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-03-21T15:58:43.426+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The inflation of the kill value via assist gold's there so that it's almost always the correct action to work together as a team and that that's clear enough to players too.

When played as a mura user mid land, but mura is far to weak right now on everyone except ezreal who basically gets it for free. He’s also less likely to be top using mura since trying to scale against tanks instead of just blow them out means he’s always going to be outscaled, so it’s not a very viable strategy unless he’s running Botrk cleaver, which isn’t the strongest right now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RavenHusky","date":"2018-03-21T15:52:00.782+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any context on the Lux buff we saw on the PBE last Thursday that got reverted?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-03-21T23:18:41.926+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should be back, with some additional changes to test (ult resets if the target dies within X seconds, not just to the ult) for 8.7 PBE.

Almost anyone can build it, it seems very unfair to AD assassins that it gives 30 armor as well as the attack reduction passive, while merc treads gives only 25MR and no other form of damage reduction. \n\nCould some thing like this work with a scaling reduction based on \"tank stats\" rather than constant flat effectiveness.\n{{item:3047}} \n~~+ 30 Armor ~~\n+ 25 Armor \n~~blocks 10% of the damage from basic attacks~~\nblocks 6% of the damage from basic attacks, increases to 12% when your combined (bonus armor and magic resist) is over +100\n\nEvery class has options for armor now, after the changes to {{item:3026}} now ADs can counter their own class, yay.\n\n----\n\nIf Rageblade is still too strong on Varus will he be more likely to get: \nA) his Attack speed passive nerfed, \nB) W passive nerfed, \nC) W %HP proc nerfed,\nD) his base/per level AS nerfed?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-03-21T15:54:12.915+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ninja Tabi - we're looking at them this patch. Goals there include probably bringing them down in power but also ensuring there's some nuance to when you build them that's harder to assess (not just 'do they have more than X auto attackers' or 'does my lane opponent basic attack'). Don't have a specific approach ready to share yet, will mention once we do. \n\nVarus wise lowering the AS ratio on the passive, at least for minion kills, has been on my mind as a likely candidate if we need to pull power from him.
