{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-09-22T15:47:14.618+0000","title":"Quick Gameplay Thoughts: September 22","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morning all,\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Usual Disclaimers**\r\n\r\nThese posts will often contain talk about future work we're doing, or planning to do, that isn't yet guaranteed to ship. The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Adjusting Summoner Spell Levels Slightly**\r\n\r\nWith the changes to leveling coming in pre-season we'll be adjusting which levels players get summoner spells at slightly to distribute different things that unlock (summoner spells, new game modes, ability to customize runes etc) a bit better. We'll also be shifting a couple of spells so that they're introduced to the player at more appropriate times as well. That'll overall look like Cleanse at level 9 instead of 6 once players are a bit better placed to assess its value, Flash at level 7 instead of 8, Snowball at level 6 instead of 1 etc.\r\n\r\nWe're not making all Summoner spells available at level 1 however because we've seen that be a worse experience for new players, given they're focused on learning the basics of the game and Summoner spell usage, let alone Summoner spell choice, isn't very important at that point. Ghost and Heal are offered because they're the two with the easiest targeting (just push the button) and for a lot of new players that's a really meaningful thing. Leaving some spells, Flash and Smite especially, till later levels does tend to frustrate players making additional accounts somewhat, that's a trade off we think's appropriate though, especially given we're not looking to encourage smurfing more.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Urgot W and damage reflection**\r\n\r\nIn 7.20 we're planning to make a change where Urgot's W treats damage reflection as an on hit as well. That means that, in addition to reducing Urgot's on hits on other to 1/3, his W will also reduce damage reflection he takes to 1/3. That means Bramble Vest, Thornmail, Rammus W and any other possible damage reflect sources won't excessively murder him after he pushes that button.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Balance stuff we'll be looking at in 7.20**\r\n\r\nA lot of our focus, even for the folks normally putting a lot of time into patch to patch balance, is on pre-season at this point. There'll still be some balance changes in 7.20 though. Thoughts on what's likely:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Ongoing work that didn't make it into 7.19 - Sterak's buff, Brand buff targeted at mana restoration for CSing Brands, probably an Ornn buff (might still make it into 7.19 though).\r\n* Monitoring of bigger 7.19 changes - Janna, Azir, Xin Zhao, Vayne and Caitlyn all have some likelihood of needing some follow up work\r\n* New changes planned - Buffs likely to Graves, Karma\r\n* Investigating, but might still leave unchanged - Do we need to nerf Twitch before pre-season hits and upheaves the state of balance for a bit anyway?\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Streaming some runes stuff on Monday**\r\n\r\nWe'll be doing a stream where we talk about some runes stuff this coming Monday, looking at both some previously announced ones and some new ones. We'll be using a pre-recorded recent game from one of our internal playtests for that, so while this won't be live streaming of a game it should be a pretty good look for anyone interested at how Runes behave during normal LoL play. Recommend giving it a look if you're interested in seeing some of the system in action before it's on PBE.\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2017-09-22T16:15:39.361+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":5,"body":"Please nerf twitch before the preseason","replies":[{"poster":"Bank of Veggie","date":"2017-09-22T16:46:22.509+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just looking for a discussion here, to contrast to how others feel about twitch from different communities~\n\nWhat do you want nerfed about Twitch and why, what are the problem points you see in him?","replies":[{"poster":"Blackspy48","date":"2017-09-22T16:51:47.917+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":11,"body":"i hate that he can 1 shot ur entire team from very far away while being extreamly safe so i would nerf his q cd or his r bonus ad","replies":[{"poster":"Bank of Veggie","date":"2017-09-22T16:55:52.198+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":2,"body":"In reality, he isn't 1 shotting anything unless he's 6 items and levels up.\n\nHe is sort of safe, but that's mostly attributed to healing/shielding supports making him really hard to punish for a bad position.\n\n\nDo you have any problems with anything except his ult?

Locket and Sona already approach the AoE shield niche.\n\nHer W could also do with some change or utility. Her old W had a unique mechanic, if a bit clunky and hard to apply.

There was a lot of confusion around it's removal in 5.10, with only the buffing of her passive given as context for it's removal. The shield damage was iconic, and I really believe this NEEDS to come back. Plus, that version of RE seemed way more balanceable than what we have now.\n\n- RW for allies. Perhaps allowing Karma to give up her self-heal to an ally is worth experimenting with? Imo, this change in 5.10 would have gone a lot further to increase her contextual decision making than what we got.\n\n- RW tether damage on the ally cast, could be cool.\n\n- Mantra giving damage as standard again. The bonus root RW seems a bit pointless and hardly worth the risk of staying in that range for.\n\n- Lastly, while not an old mechanic I think perhaps experimenting with RQ either being ground targeted (like Lux E) or like Shyvanna's fireball where she can set its distance, would be good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Queen Sansa","date":"2017-09-23T01:13:13.932+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

No offense taken!\n\nHere's another idea to consider, what if she couldn't cast R+E just anytime. What if instead she had to cast it after a target had already been shielded?\n\nIt could be made so that casting R+E would be what would cause the Bomb to detonate from the shielded target's position while also making it shield allies. By delaying it in this manner it offers enemies time to see and react, while also offering Karma more power by being able to re-shield her target? If needed it could also be given a slowly growing AoE (grows like Galio's taunt) that applies effects to allies or enemies when it reaches them.\n\nSome, all, or none of this idea could work.

Could re-shield the target if more power is needed.\n\n> Personally, I hold that spending mantra is already enough room for counterplay.

I think part of the problem is that it was an instant-cast AoE that had both Offensive and Defensive impact. IMHO it should offer opponents more reaction time that it did before they removed it.\n\n> Keep the ideas coming though.

Other than ricklessabandon grossly missjudging this ability. Or all of Karma, tbh. The thing with the Offensive&Defensive part was, that it could fail. Shield only your team and it was meh. Damage the enemies and it was okay. Hit 10 champions and it was worth an ultimate. But again, why would anyone clump against Karma? It's like people standing in a line to fight Twitch ^^'\nAnd realisticly, you would usually hit 2-4 people.\n\nToday's RE is way more problematic, imo. [Because it always works at peak performance](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/UgL90Jpr-psa-karma-was-at-her-healthiest-when-mantra-e-dealt-damage). There is no counterplay for the enemies (positioning) to make it less impactful. And baiting it out is nearly impossible, since lategame Karma has it all the time... again, a problem introduced by ricklessabandon's idea of making Karma more of a machine-gun with mantra. I dunno what went through his mind, tbh.\n\nThat being said, I am generally a great fan of readability and counterplay. Current Karma has a lot of mechanical counterplay in Q and W already, so I didn't mind pushing a bit of reliable damage into RE. In fact, between 3.5 and 5.10 it was her lowest, but safest mantra damage (only missing RQ's second half was lower). This tradeoff seemed to escape most people though.\n\nBut again, I like readability in spells and a short... warning before the RE seems reasonable, even to diehard Karma fans, as far as I've seen.\n\n>  if you're open to discussing other designs and characters in the future then I would be grateful for the opportunity to do so.\n\nSure, I'd love to help out!\nI must warn you though, I am not that well versed with other champions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"alekzu","date":"2017-09-23T08:45:00.395+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the clarification and also thank you for reaching the Karma community for changes!\n\nThings that I find interesting to experiment with are:\n\n * shieldbomb instead of a massive shield but balanced and equal to the other matraed abilities(unlike pre-relaunch Karma where her shieldbomb was her most powerful mantraed ability and thus why it became so iconic)\n * a new tether, particularly a new RW tether, which spreads it effects when champions pass trough it: damage and root enemies(half effects) meanwhile heal allies(half stacks)\n * a passive that doesn't reward only aggressive play but all kinds of actions like when you heal/shield allies and when you take damage: doing damage increases your healing capabilities, taking/enduring damage lowers mantra cooldown and shielding/healing allies increases the damage you will do to enemies is a good example that Karma is everywhere behind every action\n\nThese are the mechanics I would like to see implemented the most. All the other mechanics suggested by other people, some of which are also very interesting, are welcomed and something I would be happy to see as well.\n\nAgain thank you for taking your time to communicate with us and collect all these amazing ideas that some of the Karma fans suggested, Meddler.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pisces StarChild","date":"2017-09-23T05:07:05.488+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Meddler,\n\nThanks for replying with an insight on what to expect for Karma. You mentioned that some buffs in the near future for her are only going to be basic power and I thank you for that. I think she was perhaps nerfed a bit too much recently due to concerns about her kit posing great synergy with the support items that were getting some changes at that time. Now she's not as effective as other picks in both her respective roles/classes so anything in the form of buffs for her would be greatly appreciated. I trust that you'll come up with ideas on how to give her a power boost (in any form) that'll have her be on equal grounds without necessarily making her overbearing or too strong versus other picks.\n\nAs far as past mechanics that I would love to see you try to bring back, I would like to see her abilities having both offensive/aggressive and defensive/supportive uses once more. I think that's what made Karma unique and appealing to her fans, me in particular. I mean that in the sense that you can either use a spell to deal damage or heal/save an ally (with mantra), or even doing both simultaneously provided that you positioned yourself strategically to allow a spell to be used to its maximum potential. I think that's what made Karma unique back then and definitely made her come across as a leader-type champion. Other than that, I think her skill-shot heal and ally/enemy tether function back then definitely had some potential. I would love to see them return in some form or another. Thanks Meddler :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZapMyHeart","date":"2017-09-23T04:20:00.629+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=2wjE4Iqs,comment-id=000c0002,timestamp=2017-09-22T17:21:44.186+0000)\n>\n> Yep, likely just a bit of power for now and some mechanics changes next year.\n> \n> I think looking at some of her prior mechanics to see if any of them could be made to work well on her is worth a try. Wouldn&#x27;t want to make any promises as to what we&#x27;d re-add, or even if we&#x27;d find we were able to re-add anything, but would definitely look into it. Which particular mechanics would you folks be most interested in seeing us at least experiment with?\n\nShield bomb is probably the thing Karma players miss the most.\n\nI wouldn't mind seeing her old AP passive based on her health return in some form or another, as her Mantra passive should have been tacked onto her R to begin with. It would make dueling much more of an option for her, rather than be a hit-and-run spam Q bot. Plus it would give her an old Karma feel to it, but modernized. \n\nThe issue with the current Karma is that she is heavily reliant on her RE as the choice for Mantra, making the other 2 options not that attractive (not that the other 2 are that great to begin with...). Shifting the power from RE and putting them into a reworked RQ and RW would make her feel better. Heimerdinger's ult is rather great with his 3 choices, whereas Karma's ult is not so much.\n\nAlso, her old role was more battlemage, whereas this one has an identity crisis. Too much pull in all roles due to her mismatch of a kit. Trimming it down and make her more focused would be ideal.

Karma is not getting a VGU anytime soon and she doesn't deserve it over older champions with no identity. Her identity and art problems are terrible, but there are other champions in a worse state than she is. She needs major changes or no work at all.

Meddler, you have to make a decision and communicate with us what you plan to do with her. A buff to shields is not going to cut it.\n\nThe following needs to be addressed or don't even bother with any work on Karma:\n\n1. Address her conflicting gameplay identities with her confusing kit. What is Karma? Is she a midlaner with minor enchanter interaction or is she a shield bot?\n2. Her kit needs to be unique and different from other enchanters and item actives in the game. The least you can do since you don't plan to address her thematic issues, you can change the fact that her R+E is nothing more than an Iron Locket of Solari item active with a speed boost.\n3. Karma falls off mid to late game as a mage. This needs to be addressed if you think about doing anything with her. She shifts from a mage to a dirty shield bot that builds only shield enhancing items.\n4. A new passive that plays off of her theme more. Are we asking too much of you?
