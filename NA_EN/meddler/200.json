{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-02-02T16:25:05.315+0000","title":"Quick Gameplay Thoughts: February 2","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey all,\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Usual Disclaimers**\n\n\n\nThese posts will often contain talk about future work we&#039;re doing, or planning to do, that isn&#039;t yet guaranteed to ship. The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Patch 8.4**\n\nNumber of things going into patch 8.4 below. There&#039;ll likely be a bit more to follow too, and as usual some of this stuff might not ship or will likely change.\n\n\n\nRunes Changes:\n\n* Fleetwork Footwork/Press the Attack - We&#039;ll likely be buffing PTA and/or nerfing FF. Recent changes to FF make it too dominant a choice in Precision at this point, still debating though whether that means we should bring PTA up and/or FF down though. Lethal Tempo by contrast needs bigger work (thoughts on that once we&#039;re starting on it, not as urgent as other Runes work though).\n\n* Resolve non keystones - Likely replacing a rune or two and moving some runes around to make the second slot especially more interesting and appealing.\n\n* Precision Stat Bonus - Splitting with other trees like Resolve does (e.g. Precision+Domination = AS and AD).\n\n\n\nItem Changes:\n\n* Tracker&#039;s Knife - Investigating (might not change) whether this is just too dominant a choice at this point, which also leads to excessive vision especially in organized play.\n\n* Hunter&#039;s Talisman versus Hunter&#039;s Machete - Tweaking stats a bit to make Talisman a better choice on champs it should be strong on.\n\n* Jungle items generally - Potentially increasing mana regen to open up the jungle more (mana gating keeps quite a few champs from clearing effectively early relative to less mana hungry junglers)\n\n* Ancient Coin - Looks too weak, even on champions it fits best on (Janna, Soraka, Rakan). Smallish, simple buffs likely as a result.\n\n* Wit&#039;s End - Buffing slightly in general and a bit more for melee champs (they&#039;ll steal MR faster than ranged).\n\nEdit: AP item changes will also be in 8.4, forgot to include those somehow when writing this originally despite the fact we've been looking at them a lot this week. \n\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n* We&#039;ll be taking a look at Baron Buff and Elder Dragon buff. At present their impact in really long games seems to fall off too much, which means you don&#039;t pay enough of a penalty for playing safe and not trying to contest them. That can lead to drawn out, unresolved games without much happening. In Elder Dragon&#039;s case it also means the value of contesting early dragons, regardless of element, isn&#039;t as high as it should be either.\n\n\n\nChamp Nerfs:\n\n* Ornn - Looking at what enemies should be able to do to respond to him in lane. Details to be determined.\n\n* Gnar - Needs clearer weaknesses enemies can play around, particularly in lane. Details also TBD.\n\n* Kalista - We&#039;re still working on pulling power out of Kalista for pro play without hitting her hard in regular play. \n\n\n\nChamp Buffs:\n\n* Evelynn - Previous nerfs were harder than intended. Looking to give a bit of power back in a straightforward way.\n\n* Volibear - Fingers crossed will finally get changes in 8.4. We&#039;ve been testing a range of things in addition to the previously mentioned brief displacement on champs on E.  That knockback&#039;s still testing well so that&#039;s almost certainly happening. Probably a secondary buff as well (e.g. might have Q MS not fall off so aggressively when briefly facing away from enemy champs to move around skillshots or whatever). \n\n* Fiddlesticks - Is struggling quite a bit in the jungle. Buffing as a result, not sure exactly how yet.\n\n* Talon - Struggling in both mid and top. We&#039;d previously been avoiding giving him power because he was doing well in top lane, he&#039;s just weak all round at this point though. Likely fairly straight forward numbers buffs.\n\n\n\nOther Champion Changes:\n\n* Rengar - Reversion of Q to an on next hit ability will happen in 8.4, along with some smaller changes to other parts of the kit. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Saved Rune Pages**\n\nFor cases like 8.4 where we&#039;re changing non keystone Runes (replacing some or swapping positions of others) we&#039;ll be automatically updating saved Rune pages so that they&#039;re still valid. First goal is to avoid forcing people to remake entire rune pages when the system has only changed slightly. Sonc goal is to make sure everyone still loads into game with a full set of at least ok Runes even if they haven&#039;t yet edited their pages since the changes. We&#039;ll be doing some call outs in the game client as well when stuff changes for people who want to update their pages themselves, getting some defaults in as a fallback too though.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n**Zoe**\nThoughts on Zoe next week. Was going to get some thoughts on how we see her and what our plans are for this post, would like to take a bit more time to talk through issues and approach with the team first though. \n\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n**LeBlanc**\n\nAfter Rengar ships in 8.4 we&#039;ll be looking at LeBlanc. Current plan is for a similar level of change to Rengar&#039;s, likely including some degree of moving back to things about old LeBlanc that worked well (both for LeBlanc players and for game health). Not certain on timing of when that work would ship, goal would be to get it onto PBE fairly quickly and, as with Rengar, work on it for multiple patches while getting feedback on it. \n\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Rework Quinn","date":"2018-02-02T17:28:10.888+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":4,"body":"With the trend of champions who received class-level updates being partially reverted (specifically {{champion:107}}, {{champion:96}}, {{champion:7}}) what are your thoughts on similar explorations for {{champion:133}}?

It also adds a lot of discussion cost to making changes. Spending a couple of hours giving context on what we're trying to do, reading feedback, answer questions etc that would be enough time to instead test the current version and start implementing the next one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xenohaz","date":"2018-02-02T17:12:44.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wanted to clarify, is it going to be replacing one of the existing keystones, or just a new addition?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-02-02T17:18:30.853+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"New.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"InTheory","date":"2018-02-02T16:42:48.786+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":">We'd hoped it would, but it hasn't been working as hoped.\n\nWhy is that being downvoted?","replies":[{"poster":"Carnicore","date":"2018-02-02T17:03:20.455+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Two or more people are downvoting everything.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ereldra","date":"2018-02-02T16:35:32.261+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"Can you give us some specifics about the changes to AP-Items?\nHow big are the changes, is there maybe a new item/changes Passives or is it just tweaking numbers (AP, Gold Cost etc.)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-02-02T16:39:23.313+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":3,"body":"We should have a big context post on them early next week.

Right now we have only 3 types : HP, AS and Adaptative Force, so, its not so hard to allow us to choose betwenn 1 or split 2. If you guys allowing the players to choose freely, you could solve some of the bruisers problems, and open more options to the players, because this status bonuses are restricting a lot of playstyles, and we can agreed that this were not the goal with the new runes. \nFor example, when Resolve only had the HP as bonus status, I was taking Precision secondary on Poppy to scale even more tenacity (with the legend rune) and Last Stand to combo with my W passive (more resists and damage on low hp ;D), but with the new Resolve bonuses, I can't take this combination anymore because AS is not the best status for Poppy. \nIf we could choose the bonuses status for freely, Renekton could take Press the Attack and have AD as runes bonuses, Ekko also could take Press the Attack to combo with his passive, Vayne could take phase rush and AS as bonus and be a relentless hunter, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SCi am I","date":"2018-02-02T18:43:48.359+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:62}}'s passive does not seem to add to his play style or kit.
