The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Diana**\r\n\r\nAs you&#039;ll see on the PBE today we&#039;re continuing to explore Diana changes in testing. Those aren&#039;t intended to be a full fix for Diana&#039;s issues (we still expect to do a small update to her gameplay at some point), but are instead intended to put her in a better spot until then. We think it&#039;s likely the eventual direction for Diana includes auto attacking as a meaningful part of her kit, so one of the things we&#039;re looking it is ways to make that higher impact later in the game.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Garen**\r\n\r\nSpeaking of champions we&#039;re doing smaller stuff on now and plan on giving larger gameplay changes later, Garen&#039;s in the same boat this patch. We&#039;re testing a W change where it&#039;s got a short window where it&#039;s much more effective when first cast. Goals there are to both give him a bit more power but also a bit more skill expression, with the timing on that cast mattering more. Garen&#039;s always been difficult to balance for different skill ranges and part of that&#039;s because his kit doesn&#039;t give the same degree of reward for mastery over many of its elements that other champs do. This won&#039;t fix that by itself of course, but expectation is it&#039;ll help somewhat and we&#039;ll look for similar changes for the larger changes coming later.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Warded Ping**\r\n\r\nIs still coming, looks like 7.15 at this point (another casualty of that shorter than usual 7.14 development cycle, with other engineering work that&#039;s higher priority pushing it back a patch).\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**No Posts Next Week**\r\n\r\nDue a combination of 4th of July having us out of the office and some other stuff going on I won&#039;t be able to do these posts next week. Next one should be on the 10th or 11th of July as a result. One thing worth watching out for next week though&#039;s that we should be getting a more regular series of Runes posts going, starting next week, with a goal of showing off at least a new thing or two each week until close to pre-season when the full system hits the PBE.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Kayn/Darkin**\r\n\r\nNon gameplay sidenote, but wanted to call out that a bunch of us, myself very much included, have very much enjoyed the ongoing discussion about what the deal is with the Darkin based off the new info associated with Kayn&#039;s reveal, including speculation on future possibilities, whether any other Darkin are already in the roster besides Aatrox etc. Some theories that are pretty out there, or speculative, and some ideas that are pretty accurate.

At a glance pretty much the whole Taric main discord agrees that it hurts his skill expression in terms of comboing ability and comes with some pretty major buffs tacked on to cap it off.\n\nFor a champion that hasn't really been struggling it seems a bit extreme and the buffs don't seem to make a whole lot of sense together.  His stun got a damage buff all game, scales CD wise better as it levels, but no longer has a longer stun as it levels up.  So it got an overall power buff as well as buffs and nerfs to both it's early and late game.\n\nHis heal will almost certainly feel nicer to use but there is no longer any game knowledge required to make use of his passive, since if you get even you have to use multiple abilities in a row without using your passive you still get at least 2 charges to bring your Q off CD since it takes 1 second to aa twice anyways so you can just keep proccing your passive so long as you have mana.  As opposed to before where you got maybe 70% efficiency if you were missing out on your passive and not combing properly you now still function at around 90-95% efficiency even if you aren't making use of your passive correctly with the only punishment being more mana expenditure because you have to cast Q more often to get your other abilities up, and even then you are still getting a heal out of it.\n\nThe changes just seem a bit out of place and questionable on a champ that doesn't seem to need huge changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"riste","date":"2017-06-30T16:29:11.935+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Meddler, ristiuMMask here. I streamed Garen's PBE changes yesterday with my audience, and boy oh boy, I was excited about this change.\n\n**This** is exactly what Garen needs. With the first PBE shipment turning Garen's W into just more damage reduction but a shorter cooldown, I was feeling a bit empty about it. But giving this super small window of shrugging off CC with a load of tenacity, on top of a massive amount of damage reduction feels amazing. This will totally raise the skill ceiling for Garen, and playing him actively in Diamond, there is little outplay potential the Demacian soldier has for some lanes. I facetanked an Ashe ultimate yesterday on Stream, but with proper timing, I walked it off in less than a second. It felt really amazing. \n\nThe passive changes I also like. There are many games where I simply don't reach level 16. Having a stronger level 11 passive is so much more impacting than having the current live rendition where I'm just passively having a health potion run out of combat. The spin buffs were the icing on the cake, small, but very appreciated. I hope that the buffs to spin will actually help us fight tanks, as Garen has been struggling with that for a while. \n\nI'm making a video right now about why these changes are good. As a Garen enthusiast, I fully support these changes and many other Garen players in our \"Garen Players NA\" club really look forward to these changes as well.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-06-30T16:56:45.126+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do agree that these changes are a step in the right direction, but \"This is exactly what Garen needs\" sounds like an exaggeration, don't you think? :)\n\nThe W change sure increases Garen's ceiling, but it doesn't solve most of the outstanding issues that Garen has, such as the lack of in-combat sustain, or the lack of interactivity in a lot of melee match-ups due to E being an uninterruptible AoE that you HAVE to get in range of if you want to fight Garen as a melee.\n\nAnd since all of that are just straight buffs without compensation, isn't it too much? Was Garen really in such a bad state? I'm a bit afraid of rebound nerfs...","replies":[{"poster":"riste","date":"2017-06-30T18:58:40.355+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is though if we consider any player who knows how to operate their champion, you're never really going to get a situation where you can hit the enemy without them dishing damage back to you unless they are low and running. It's similar to a Fiora dashing into an Irelia, you're going to get retaliation in any matchup no matter what. Garen may have an aoe spin that can't be stopped once its cast, but that's just a perk of being a juggernaut where most of his competition triumphs him in mobility (Renekton, Irelia, Riven, Shen, Gnar, Fiora, Singed, Camille, J4, Gragas, Hecarim, Aatrox, Jax, Kled, Jayce, Olaf, Rumble, Yasuo, Galio.) On top of that, people who understand Garen's kit will bait him onto their minions, so Garen completely misses the isolation bonus. And to make matters worse for Garen, is that there are many champions that can outdamage Garen even standing in his spin. Irelia, Renekton, and even Shen can do it no problem. Shen has only three abilities to use in lane and **still** beats Garen in a 1v1 even with Black Cleaver.\n\nIt doesn't solve all of his issues, or maybe even binary patterns that typically lower elo's will only express in frustration, but the skill ceiling is absurdly too low for Garen right now. Diamond Garen mains can't even trade evenly with 90% of his matchups. These numbers that are currently testing don't have to be exact. The 90% damage reduction window may even be brought down lower, but Garen's impact in higher elo's falls off tremendously past midgame if his team isn't performing well themselves. \n\nWhat I enjoy about these changes the most though is that his counterplay is still fully intact. True damage completely bypasses every single second of his W, and he still will be countered by kiting. He will have one new short window to deal with cc, but it still will mean nothing against a Tristana with her ultimate up. Sure, lifesteal is really sub-optimal on Garen, but there would be no healthy way I believe for making any item that could literally allow him to heal substantially off of his spin. This new level 11 passive makes up for it, and really will push a Garen players decision making on when to leave a fight to heal up, or stay until the bloody end.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-07-01T01:41:39.190+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There has been discussion on those boards about how you could give in combat sustain to Garen. I can dig up the old threads in my history if you're interested, just hit me up. But tl;dr is: It doesn't have to be Lifesteal. (And for what it's worth, Death's Dance works decently well in my low Gold Elo, anyway.) \n\nIn fact, old Juggernauts like Nasus or Olaf do have Lifesteal, but most modern executions like Illaoi or post-rework Darius or even the recent mini-rework on Udyr all have heals in %missingHP attached to their abilities. Yorick has a plain flat heal on his Q. Mundo obviously has ton of in-combat regen since it's his whole gimmick. Etc. Garen needs something similar, not his current out-of-combat passive, or at least not only that.\n\nCritmaster Garen made an interesting suggestion: Garen's E could stack a buff when it hits champion, and *when the E ends*, it triggers the passive regen even if he is in-combat, for a duration based on how many stack you got. This has many good effects on Garen gameplay, but I invite you to go and read the full thread for all the details, if you haven't already. That's the most detailed and promising suggestion, to the best of my knowledge.\n\nAnd for the records, I do understand Garen gameplay, and I know all the problems you evoked in that second comment. I certainly don't play at the same level as you do (and I love your vid's, it's always a pleasure to watch them, so much to learn, and it's so well presented), but I'm still a Garen main, and I had to go through all those issues myself. But they are more consequences than root causes. Garen damage output is so low compared to other top laners **because** it is so reliable and uninteractive. If he can access his 100% potential as easily as others can access their 80% potential, his 100% cannot be much higher than their 80%, or he would stomp too hard. So of course, when you get to higher levels where people perform more reliably on average, those other Top who were at 80% can go up to 90, but Garen has nowhere to go.\n\nSo yes, we all agree: Garen needs room to fail, if he wants to get a higher ceiling, and yes, this changes are goods. But the point of my answer was more \"this is not enough, this must be only the first of many steps, so let's be careful about saying to Riot that this is 'exactly' what Garen needs\". I'm not too worried, Meddler himself said there would be more work further down the line, it's just a matter of patience.\n\nHowever, I really wonder if they can afford to buff Garen that much. Sure, the W changes will have no impact in Silver and below, but they flat-out buffed the E, and the passive buff won't be negligible in the lower divisions, where Garen is noticeably less struggling than in Plat and Diamond. I hope these buffs are here to stick, and won't be followed by nerfs a couple patches from now.\n\n","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SILVERAMMO","date":"2017-06-30T17:13:38.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanna see the recording lol sounds so cool.","replies":[{"poster":"riste","date":"2017-07-01T00:09:10.955+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ_cETm4-xM","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wet Dryman","date":"2017-06-30T15:28:18.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello Meddler,\nWhat do you think about current state of Gragas?

Really grateful that, while you acknowledge that he needs larger gameplay changes and the window to show skill on the champ is very small or not even there, you give him some love in the meantime cause he is really struggling.\n\nGlad to see tenacity back on Courage, nice thought, the removal of it was one of the (many) things that hurt him, he needs to be able to absorb CC (instead of just punishment) for his team or himself if he gets gangbanged by 3+ opponents. The slow resist + tenacity mastery doesn't give much and it's a common denominator. Since you're experimenting with Courage, I'd like to ask, what's the thought process behind the resistances he gets from the passive part having a cap? Sion has no cap, Nasus has no cap, Veigar has no cap, Bard has no cap etc Why Garen only must have a cap? I don't think it's that OP and game-breaking, especially since it comes in small (and lame) doses of 0,25 per creep kill and I think it would help him a lot, especially in games that drag and he has completed his build.\n\nExcited to see what else you have in store for him. Imho, E and R can remain as is or mostly as is (maybe give the ult AD scaling at long last? Or reduced cd if he successfully executes the Villain?) while passive, Q and W (which seems to be getting at a good spot) can be looked at since they leave much room for work. For example, with Warmog's, everyone can get a free Garen passive at maximum efficiency right off the bat (the requirement is easier now). Hopefully, he'll be able to compete with others with \"overloaded\" kits (he's only viable top, maybe jungle too but not that good, and others could easily bully him out of lane or just straight kill, like release Camille was a nightmare to face and she could be played literally EVERYWHERE).\n\nEnjoy the 4th of July vacation :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lebłanc Bot","date":"2017-06-30T16:05:29.554+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Any update on Leblanc ?

Giving defence against the great mass of bork/ravenous rushing skirmishers top seems essential to toplane balance.  \n\nBut has any thought been given to the way this will make champions like Yi even harder to handle lategame?  Currently a thornmail tank can distract him long enough that an adc can whittle him down.  Now, with deaths dance + bork he is going to slice the tank into little bits, whilst taking an adcs damage with deaths dance and his lifesteal, and then kill the adc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LiteUpSketchers","date":"2017-06-30T22:32:48.644+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cho'Gath?","replies":[]},{"poster":"GrandpaTheGreat","date":"2017-06-30T20:26:01.195+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is Singed's passive on the pbe intended to work with allied champions?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-06-30T18:47:09.367+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler,\n\nIs Cho'Gath still getting his E update this PBE cycle?
