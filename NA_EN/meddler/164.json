The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n**Future Champ Releases**\n\nSome of you will have seen this already in some of Reav3&#039;s posts, for those that haven&#039;t though, or weren&#039;t sure on timings, our current plans for larger champion releases this year currently looks like this:\n\n* Worlds Patch (8.19) happens and does not have a new champ or update in it\n* Sometime after that, Ezreal update (limited gameplay changes, focused mainly on W)\n* Sometime after that, though still expected this year, a new champion\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \n**Mastery curves for same champs pre and post update**\n\nThe last time we shared mastery curves for some champions one question that came up was how they compared pre and post update for some champions. Seemed like a great question to share some more data on. What we&#039;re looking at here are mastery curves for Rengar, Irelia, LeBlanc and Swain. The first pic shows their curves in 2017 between September and December, for players from all regions at all MMR bands. The second pic&#039;s the same thing, except with data from June-August of 2018, so post VGU for Irelia/Swain and post partial revert for Rengar/LeBlanc.\n\n2017\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/xBqV3MK\n\n2018\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/h9b8oDP\n\n\nThe most noticeable change is to Irelia&#039;s curve, which starts a lot steeper than it used to. Both of her graphs are pretty similar beyond about 25 games, with a gradual increase in performance by games player continuing to 50 games. VGU&#039;d Irelia has a much steeper initial curve however, reflecting the need to learn more about how her kit combos and greater mechanical execution. Adding combo and mechanical skill expression can help make a champion feel better to master and tends to be a really good fit with some thematic fantasies (e.g. skilled and nimble in Irelia&#039;s case), it does come with some accessibility costs though. Swain&#039;s a good contrast here, given his curve doesn&#039;t meaningfully change post update, which I&#039;m happy about since one of our goals with him was to maintain his mastery curve.\n\nLooking at LeBlanc and Rengar, their curves are fairly similar before and after. Both still reward games played pretty heavily, though they&#039;re not as punishing in your earlier games. \n\nFinally, it&#039;s worth noting that changes to these champions&#039; kits won&#039;t be the only factor behind differences in these curves. Things like which opponents they&#039;re most commonly playing against, which items/summoner spells are most effective on them etc will also impact what their curves look like (e.g. if optimal Rengar play involves a lot of AA resetting with Tiamat he&#039;ll probably have a steeper curve than if his optimal build doesn&#039;t include any in combat active items). \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n**Context on additional 8.18 changes**\n\n* Aatrox - Previous changes cut down his excessive pro presence. We&#039;re now looking to add some power back in in ways that are targeted more at regular play, with buffs to E healing at higher ranks and R AD at higher ranks.\n* Gnar - We&#039;re hitting Gnar&#039;s base Armor to make him less of a safe blind pick. Shouldn&#039;t be too affected against tanks and magic damage heavy opponents, but should be a riskier pick against many aggressive laners.\n* Viktor - We&#039;re reducing Viktor&#039;s first Hexcore cost with the goal of more frequently letting him hit an early power spike. \n","replies":[{"poster":"Star Weàver","date":"2018-09-05T15:46:37.772+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":1,"body":"hey Meddler any thought about {{champion:163}} in the midlane ?","replies":[{"poster":"BlinkCastBoom","date":"2018-09-05T21:33:24.059+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Logged in to upvote this","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2018-09-05T15:52:56.775+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"Tbh I'm a bit disappointed in the size of the patches since 8.12.\n\nOther than the rune damage/power nerfs \nAnnie, kassadin, and a slight nudge to Crit items...\n\nIt feels like what Is in this patch as well as all the other since then could have easily been two patches instead of six.\n\nAlso knowing that the next patch is likely even smaller makes the game state very stale, imo.\n\nHitting sejuani base dmg and a huge cut to her ult utility will hurt a lot.\nAatrox might be a contested pick again with these changes aimed towards regular play since his champ kind of sits on a thin line.\n\nEverything else is pretty mediocre.\n\n(Not trying to sound negative in case I come across as highly critical, just think these changes are too small except for a few outliers)","replies":[{"poster":"TheKind","date":"2018-09-05T15:55:54.354+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's their aim.

From around 8.10 or so concerns there started climbing to extremely high levels compared to historical average. That, plus our own assessment that our changes had been much more disruptive than we'd intended in 8.10 and 8.11 made us conclude we should pull back substantially on change for a decent period of time. As a result instead of putting as much into regular patches we've had people working on preseason development instead. We are starting to see some people, such as yourself, now calling for more change. Getting the right amount's a balancing act though, with a healthy mid point meaning we'll still be seeing some people calling for less while others are after more. This is also a time of year where, when we've made major changes in the past, reaction's generally been noticeably more negative than positive, regardless of the context.","replies":[{"poster":"Blupor","date":"2018-09-05T16:34:28.518+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it’s also about the direction of change rather than just the magnitude.

Getting variety needs to involve a range of options feeling decent and useful, while 8.11 at least pushed a lot of marksmen into too poor a state. It's possible in retrospect we might have put more power back in than was needed, so might have traded off a bit of variety unnecessarily, hard to tell though given performance and play rate trends lag somewhat behind when we lock patches, plus there's just not the same degree of experience with non marksmen in botlane, so still unclear what optimal from some other picks there looks like when really polished. Glad to still see the occasional other champ get picked there (e.g. Swain), would want to take a pretty gradual approach to get some others back if trying though rather than swinging too hard at once.\n\nJhin's mobility seems somewhat excessive to me. I incline somewhat towards hitting Hail of Blades, at least for Jhin, as a result. I haven't looked into Jhin in depth personally though, so possible there's some other change that would be more appropriate.\n\nI think perceptions of radio silence most commonly happen when the issues people want to talk about/get a response on are ones that most Rioters aren't the right people to answer.

what advantage do i have as a player who is locked to 1 section of the map for the majority of the game and have to fight much harder against another person for my gold and xp? why do i then still lose 1v1s to a role that has the freedom to affect the map throughout the game? when the game was first released, jungle and support were roles that supported their lanes, in recent seasons laners are tools to help facilitate what the jungle and support want to do, its completely backwards and illogical, laners need to have push so jg and support can invade/gank/roam and get vision as they please, its no longer playing around laners or getting laners ahead anymore, because getting yourself ahead is so much more valuable now that you dont get oustcaled anymore when you're ahead on these roles\n\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jTb8Ckvq4kw?t=1703\n\n**Heres how much damage a fed 3/0 jungler did during season 4**, it took 2 full rotations and multiple auto attacks from one of the strongest jungler at the time (lee sin) to be able to 1v1 a laner that face checks into you, nowadays lee can r/q/q e and actually 1 shot you from 100%, nocturn presses R and can literally 100-0 you in 0.2seconds, etc, **by and large junglers are stronger 1v1 than most solo laners for the large majority of the game**, compare that to your games now when even in low elo where junglers dont know how to path efficiently you have junglers who can literally 1 shot you in the blink of an eye like eve nocturne khazix, a tank jungler like sej can 1v5 your team from ahead and still kill your squishy carry, i had a game recently in low elo where i was mercilessly camped mid lane, literally ganked over 10times in a 5min span and never died once, **you would think after such inefficient play that the jungler would fall incredibly far behind right? well you would be wrong**, later in the game the same lee sin 100-0 me with a single combo and went on to finish 5000 gold ahead of any other player on his team - [proof](https://imgur.com/H6hPc6A)\n\n\nit has become so oppressive and nobody is talking about it, i dont get it, how is any role except jungle having fun playing this game?\n\nthis is by far the biggest problem in the game right now, the reason its hard for squishy carries to feel impactful isnt because other carries are doing too much dmg, its because there are now 5 players on the enemy team that do carry levels of damage, i remember playing when fizz could wq 1 shot you, talon and zed could e-autocrit 1 shot you with IE, gragas could q r 1shot your entire team, carries are not doing more damage now then they did in the past, so why does damage feel so much more oppressive now? its because roles that shouldnt be able to 1 shot you are doing so now when they couldnt in the past, jg and support are contributing to how difficult it is to teamfight on a squishy carry, **how perfect your positioning must be to not get blown up in 1 second from 5 damage dealers**, why is everyone in competitive playing carries that provide both durability and damage? swain, vlad ryze, all the bruisers and tanks, nobody is playing a glass cannon role anymore except adc b/c they are forced to\n\nhow many seasons was jungle 1 of the most impactful roles in both soloq and competitive?, does anybody even remember season 4? kakao hard carrying KT, spirit and dandy on the samsung teams, pulling out rengar and overall having unbelievable impact over the game, my video above is a 3/0 lee sin during that season 4 worlds, they literally didnt do even **HALF** as much dmg as they do now yet their impact was through the roof, **nobody could say jg was a weak role during s4**, so i dont understand why they have been buffed for so many seasons straight now\n\nriot decided that for people to have fun there should be no team roles and everyone should be a carry, because in football we have 11 strikers and no defenders right? just the way team games are meant to be played\n\nthe game can never be as fun or balanced again as long as jungle and support scaling is not addressed, back when gold was earned and not given, people enjoyed the game a lot more, who would've thought, if this is fixed, carries will feel more impactful when they get ahead as the supportive roles will not be able to shut them down alone, and the supportive roles of jg and support will feel more impactful because the carry they manage to get ahead will actually be able to impact and win the game for their team on the back of their work, this is how it was, this is how it always should have been, it is more fun to watch and it is infinitely more fun to play, people seek out that rush, the adrenaline of being the god of that single game, where they got ahead and carried, thats what brings them back and that is something they dont have anymore, not on any role except jungle.\n\nHow many pro's and streamers have exclaimed that the game is not fun to play anymore, its been happening for 3 years, what was the fucking catalyst, what happened in season 6? the absolute monstrosity that was the s6 jungle, both the supportive roles were buffed beyond comprehension, and in the years prior, the number of nerfs to carry potential is mind boggling, if you go through the patch notes since pre-season 4, theres xp changes to nerf how far ahead of the map you can get, gold income changes, passive gold income buffs, all of these diluted the power of carries and spread it across the map, **power is being given, not earned**, that is the primary fucking issue for years now, no matter how much better you play then your opponent, there are artificial systems in place that hold you back from getting to the god mode state that gives people the dopamine kick that makes them crave more","replies":[{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2018-09-05T20:51:50.100+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can thank scuttle changes for the jungle issues.

I know you stopped doing class updates since the tank update, as it allows for a more focused attention on problems, but before then you all mentioned the possibilities of work on the diver and enchanter classes. I know the diver class was including definitely Diana and maybe Wukong (and probably Xin at the time) among others, and then enchanters are the infamous enchanters. Are these classes still bad enough for would-be class update candidates? What would be the core problems to fix in these classes even as you go at it with individual champions?\n\n**The second.** I keep trying to find ways to ask without just sounding like \"give us teaser/info\", but the new champ is going to be the color mage from the road map. I'm really enjoying speculating that the color mage (besides hoping for Bandle City / Kumungu Jungle home) is going to have color coded style of moves (that interact with each other, not just Sona's colored spell) or a painter motif (with drawing similar to the slashes and circles used in Okami).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2018-09-05T16:14:31.091+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has there ever been any discussion about bloodrazor? There are a number of people that feel that the item is not in a good place. Right now there is really only one outlier user who uses this item (yi), and even still has a strong argument to go with another option. Literally everyone else who in theory synergizes well with it prefers to go with a different enchant. I think this item needs another ground up work, even more than runic echoes needed one it its previous update.\n\nAnother jungle item note being warrior. This item should follow a closer pattern to the other jungle upgrades in how they encourage building the main stat: cinderhulk -> %health increase, runic -> AP scaling proc, bloodrazor -> on hits generally scaling well with AS. Warrior in the past most often had the issue of having a \"bruiser style\" be too good because it is so stat efficient, to let champs build only that then go into straight tank.\n\nI know there was a post saying there is no intention to make any major jungle changes in the near-ish future but this is an issue that has existed for basically the whole of warrior's existence, and there has yet to be a healthy AS jungle item to be made yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pokemonred200","date":"2018-09-05T15:54:05.865+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How have {{item:3147}} and {{item:3095}} settled post-changes?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fishmaster9000","date":"2018-09-05T15:47:28.032+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Gnar feels super weak and has a low Winrate in solo queue.
