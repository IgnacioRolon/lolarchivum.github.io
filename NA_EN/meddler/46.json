The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Worlds on 8.19**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve got our second and final round of balance changes with more focus than usual on pro play in 8.19. It&#039;ll be the Worlds patch, so we&#039;re also leaning towards conservative changes generally. As a recap the principles we&#039;re approaching Worlds balance with are:\r\n\r\n* An interesting and fun to watch experience is most important from a viewer perspective. \r\n* A diverse meta&#039;s good, but not as important as interesting matches (better low diversity and exciting games than high diversity and slow, uneventful play repeatedly)\r\n* No champions should be 100% pick/ban, or very close to it \r\n* No major disruption (minimal systemic changes especially, changes to individual champs especially are more appropriate)\r\n* While we&#039;re putting more attention into pro balance for the next couple of patches, ideally any changes made should be positive for regular play as well. If not they should at at minimum not be highly harmful to regular balance. That&#039;s the case in particular when it comes to buffing champs, with a fair number we believe could buff into pro play relevance but only by making them inappropriately strong for regular players. \r\n\r\nBased off those principles context on changes we&#039;re currently looking at:\r\n\r\nChampions\r\n\r\n* Ornn, Cho, Sion - Are very high presence in pro play in the play offs. Teams do need tanks though, so our inclination is adjust a couple of items (see below) rather than hitting this champs specifically.\r\n* Janna - Is currently weak in regular play (especially versus historic expectations). Pro play&#039;s also light on enchanters. We&#039;re testing a light buff to her passive conversion. Don&#039;t want to over buff, but interested in seeing if we can get a bit more niche variety at least in the support position. Buffing the amount of damage her AAs and W get from movement speed&#039;s what we&#039;re looking at because those are aspects of her kit that tend to have more impact at higher skill levels and Janna&#039;s historically overperformed at low/average MMR versus high.\r\n* Elise and Kha&#039;Zix - Will potentially receive small buffs each. They&#039;ve both got a bit of room to be stronger in regular games and we think are probably on the cusp of getting occasional pro play. Jungle variety&#039;s been fairly good during playoffs, so don&#039;t want to swing hard here, would be nice to get a couple more non tanks in play though.\r\n* Urgot - We&#039;re looking at him, but trending towards not making any changes. Some risk he ends up pick/ban and/or that mid ends up dominated by tanky picks. At the same time he&#039;s an interesting emerging pick and one that we believe has some not yet demonstrated counters.\r\n* Olaf - Also on watch, but likely not get changed. He&#039;s getting a lot of play, but provides something pretty different in the jungle. \r\n* Gnar - This is technically a really late 8.18 change, mentioning for those who missed it earlier this week though. Gnar&#039;s priority in pro has dropped a lot, so we&#039;ve pulled the Armor nerf we previously had in, doesn&#039;t look necessary. \r\n* Kai&#039;Sa - Is getting a lot of play. We haven&#039;t yet seen the 8.18 nerfs in action though and believe they&#039;ll have some effect. No further changes planned as a result. \r\n\r\n\r\nItems:\r\n\r\n* Liandry&rsquo;s - We&#039;re looking at a buff to Liandry&rsquo;s, both due to its general weakness and so it does a better job as a HP stacking counter. Current direction we&#039;re testing is making it also do 2% damage, so that it can function a bit better as a HP counter without also requiring the correct kit and/or Rylai&#039;s as much. \r\n* Warmogs - Is arguably invalidating damage put onto some champs too much, letting teams recover from punishment in team fights/poke a bit too well. We&#039;ll probably chip some power off it, though won&#039;t be going for any really major changes here. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Rek&#039;Sai**\r\n\r\nA while back I mentioned we were looking at Rek&#039;Sai buffs which never ended up happening. Wanted to share a bit of context as to why since I see them getting asked about a fair bit still. At time of mention our assessment was Rek&#039;Sai was underperforming across the board, so we had room to add some straight power to her. Looking into things a bit deeper though we realized she was performing quite well at higher MMR already and that straight buffs would be inappropriate. She does have a fairly steep learning curve, and underperforms at low/average MMR though, so will feel weak to quite a lot of players. Would like to do some work to smooth out her early accessibility a bit as a result, that&#039;s a much larger task though than just adding power so it didn&#039;t fit within the time we had allocated. Expect we&#039;ll come back to her at some point, not sure on when though. \r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"haenex","date":"2018-09-12T15:52:51.324+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey, meddler this might sound stupid, but if you were to ever design your own champion what would he/she be like?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-09-12T16:01:03.062+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":2,"body":"My first attempt would probably look a lot like this:\n\n{{champion:115}}","replies":[{"poster":"rastarogue","date":"2018-09-12T18:17:41.638+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And so very many thanks for him!

It's small enough that it won't be terribly noticeable, but that exact case can be made for *not* changing the AP value. (If it's largely unnoticeable, then why change at all?)\n\nI just don't get why you would identify the item as an underperformer and still fear adding power without engaging in some sort of tradeoff. If the item were to become dominant, a 5 AP drop won't prevent it from reaching that status. I feel you guys are way too tentative about some low risk stuff and go overboard with delicate balance actors.","replies":[{"poster":"Not Surrendering","date":"2018-09-12T20:00:21.014+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The power increase should be as targeted as possible to the item's purpose in the item system (in this case, countering HP stacking), rather than just a generic power increase. This is to avoid items just being default purchased every game.

But now the item is only as its old version after you burst through 50%+ of the enemy's health bar. \n\nSo can you explain what the item's purpose actually is? Because currently, it looks like it should be an anti-tank and dps item, but it doesn't even earn the item slot against targets over 50% health.\n\n>This is to avoid items just being default purchased every game.\n\nReally? Look at Gunblade users, virtually all of whom barely function without the item. Look at Trinity users. Look at the majority of mages rushing Luden's. Look at the majority of APs across the board picking up Morello second. \n\nWhy is there a double standard for some items and not others?\n\n>We're increasing the top end of the burn to achieve this, but this needs to come with an overall decrease to general power so as to not just make the item overpowered.\n\nMost hp stackers are melee and will build either SV or Mercs. Even with just Mercs, that 2.5% max hp burn is cut to 1.25% or less after MR. \n\nSo you have a Cho'gath with 6000 hp, Mercs, and SV running you down. Good thing you have Liandry's to counter all that hp, right?! Oh, wait, your *empowered* burn deals **65 damage per second** to a 6000 hp target.\n\nMeanwhile, if the very same Cho has 300 armor, one auto attack by a BotRK user deals an extra 160 damage on hit (480 before armor). The same attack with Bloodrazor deals 80 damage on hit (240 before armor)\n\nSerious question here. How is a .5% max hp buff, reduced by MR, anything remotely close to \"overpowered.?\" Moreover, why are you terrified of 7.5% max hp over 3 seconds when the AD % health items easily deal 24% current hp or 16% max hp in the same amount of time?","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2018-09-12T21:06:41.931+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Serious question here.

It's practically anonymous, since you don't release who go what content you're distributing, and given the sheer low capacity of emote codes you gave away (50 per person) there's not a way in HELL that that can satisfy your thousands of fans willing to purchase the emote. \nSo I need to know why you thought it a good idea to lock this emote away, instead of like the 3 random classic Jinx emotes (make 2 give aways, leave one in store, no one is screwed unless you wanted that specific emotion), or just make some unique emote specific to the content creator system.

That would put the item count about the same as far as pen. An AD champ isn't building both reminder and regards in the same game. You also forgot about {{item:3102}} as a defensive item alongside hourglass. Not to mention that a lot of AP items have a ton of hp attached to them. I personally feel like AP burst dmg is way too high and all the AP items together make AP champions way too safe to play. {{item:3040}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3116}} all give AP and some form of defensive stat (HP, Armor, MR, Etc.). There is also less magic resist in the game as of this season and even less for marksmen since their mid season trip to the garbage dump. {{item:3027}} also exists so that just stacks HP for you not even doing anything. Then there's {{item:3089}}, holy shit this item. If AD champs had an AD version of that the world would shit itself. Of the AD items you listed only 4 have defensive stats and that was {{item:3071}}  with it's HP and {{item:3814}}  with its shield, {{item:3026}} which is useless once it's popped, {{item:3156}} is basically the AD version of {{item:3102}} so that evens out. The difference between {{item:3814}} and {{item:3102}} is {{item:3814}} takes 1.5 seconds to activate and {{item:3102}} is mindless as it works on its own without thought or input from the player. So AP items actually already highly benefit AP divers. Oh there's also the combo of {{item:3907}} {{item:3285}} which is pretty scary. Oh then there's this thing {{item:3152}} so even more HP and AP and a dash....\n\nYou're basically asking for pen against champions that can't even afford to get MR unless they are a tank, and really anything over a 50% reduction is useless because dmg is so high even without a pen item.\n\nMeanwhile marksmen get shit on with their items. We can't stack defense if we want to be effective (unlike every other class in the game), yet nearly every AP item in the game has some form of defensive stat or debuff attached to it. #feelsbadman","replies":[{"poster":"Kazekiba","date":"2018-09-12T17:22:50.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3001}} ????","replies":[{"poster":"EyesOfTheFox","date":"2018-09-12T17:46:54.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah, completely forgot about how that just flat out negates dmg and turns it into mana so you can spam more, on top of giving mana and health...
