In mid-season we&#039;ll very likely have some changes to AD itemization, the crit path in particular, along with some defensive item tweaks. Also think it&#039;s more likely than not, though not guaranteed yet, that we&#039;ll have at least a couple of support item adjustments too. Those will be alongside the Vanguard updates as previously mentioned and some other smaller stuff.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Some context on balance changes on PBE**\r\n\r\n* Jinx - we&#039;re exploring the concept of spell that can crit, but telegraphs that behavior heavily, with Jinx&#039;s W. Concept shows some promise, current numbers are certainly wrong though. Unlikely we&#039;ll ship any form of that change in 7.7, though it&#039;ll probably remain for a bit longer at least to get further testing.\r\n\r\n* Lux - Lux still does pretty well in low Elo&#039;s, we see her struggle a fair bit in higher divisions however. We&#039;re looking to add a bit of power that&#039;s mastery based as a result, provide more power when used well, less that&#039;s pubstompy. Not sure yet if the ult partial refund on kill&#039;s the way we&#039;ll do that yet, though excitement from players using it has been high relative to the amount of power it actually offers.\r\n\r\n* Graves - We&#039;re considering two different approaches for Graves. The first, which from memory is still on PBE, is removing the MR from True Grit, making him more vulnerable to some team comps (those with an enemy jungler with significant magic damage especially). The second is a reduction to Q damage early game (less base, more ratio mainly) looking at making his early game dueling in general weaker.  \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Galio** \r\n\r\nHas just had his update go out. Super early days, so far we&#039;re seeing him perform better top and mid than jungle or support. In terms of balance it&#039;s too soon to judge much, looks like at minimum he&#039;s not weak however. Whether that means he&#039;s around balanced or on the strong side we should start to get a clearer picture on soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Elementalist Lux","date":"2017-03-23T19:09:08.735+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":9,"body":"{{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} \n\nConsider letting Lux cast her W while moving. \n\nIf you cast Prismatic Barrier while trying to get away from a melee champion that's attacking you, it will often times just let him get an extra auto off.

I am a Master Tier Player with about 4000 games on Udyr and I really don't like how lackluster he is in season 7.

Her Q is worse than graves' passive as eventually she runs out of places to dash to and MUST take a hit here and there, and it's a must spam, mana restricted spell. \nGraves' passive is manaless, the knock back allows more wriggle room than a dash and to top it off he has his own dash should any monsters get close.\n\n\nMaking graves weaker to a specific team comp/champ is not the way to go. It is like saying here is X and you MUST pick X+1 to beat him with there being no other option.\nWe see this with certain ADC's like {{champion:67}} when she is somewhat decent or pre nerf {{champion:429}}. You don't pick a champion to kill them, YOU MUST BUILD YOUR ENTIRE TEAM COMPOSITION AROUND KILLING THEM! It is similar with some healing champs like {{champion:50}} {{champion:8}} or {{champion:36}}. If someone doesn't get {{item:3123}}  game over because their heals are balanced around its existence.\nThis holds true especially when magic dealing junglers are so weak currently. Only elise and nidalee have a chance of 1v1'ing graves should u nerf that aspect of his kit.\nForcing a champ to have an entire composition built around their death is completely unreasonable. A pro player I can understand, banning his signature pick I can understand. But this should never happen in regular play. I shouldn't have to take graves into consideration every time I lock in a champ in blind pick (we don't have normal draft for those who don't know)\n\n\nAs for your other suggestion of lowering his Q damage. It could work but not as well as you hope. His 1v1 damage with his Q isn't the problem. His obscenely safe clears, tankyness and overall kit damage is the problem (stemming from autos and ult). \nHe can completely clear his jungle faster than almost any other champ and come out with more HP. Faster than shyvana, faster than lee hell even faster than ivern if we include the wait time involved with priming his passive.\nHow is this not considered a problem? To never be at risk to an invade, be able to clear faster than just about everyone while having the burst of an assassin, dps of a diver, tankyness of a vanguard and life steal synergy that makes aatrox jealous.\n\n\nIf you want to nerf graves. Get rid of the passive to make him riskier in the jungle.

We&amp;#039;re looking to add a bit of power that&amp;#039;s mastery based as a result, provide more power when used well, less that&amp;#039;s pubstompy. Not sure yet if the ult partial refund on kill&amp;#039;s the way we&amp;#039;ll do that yet, though excitement from players using it has been high relative to the amount of power it actually offers.\n\n\nAs a Lux main (also love the new lore, and fwiw I had this name beforehand), I have some input here. This at first seemed like areally awesome and broken buff. Late gaem, 15 second ultimate, literally every other rotation, *On the condition you kill someone with the ult*. Thing is, if you kill someone with your ult, you likely one-shot them, and the teamfight is already won. In nearly every case where this ultimate CD reduction proves helpful, you've already won. I don't see how this is \"less pubstompy\" if anythign it enchances her snowball ability and makes her teamfight more feast/famine(not that she really has a famine).\n\nMy friend and I (He's been diamond Lux since season 3) have been discussing various ideas. The most common sentiment among Lux mains tends to be shield buffs. In lane, I 90% of the time skill E-Q-E for trades, as it's just not mana efficient to spend 60 mana for the shield that you get half benefit on. It's fine against DoT's/ignite and feels pretty solid, but in every other instance it means I took a poor trade. I understand the previous nerfs were to the shield due to being extremely consistent as a laner, but that was a while ago in a different meta.\n\nHere's how I see Lux. To carry, you almost always have to one-shot, and she frankly has the tools now, which is great. Locket doesn't grant MR anymore, and there are counterplay options in the form of the active shield, and edge of night as well. What Lux's weakness, and why she will rarely perform well in higher elo is *priority*. When someone roams she has minimal priority, many laners push harder than her, and are not 100% skillshot reliant and not so squishy as to get 100-0'd easily. But that's her balance point, in exchange for being able to sit at the back of teamfights and contribute she doesn't get priority. The problem comes when she can't do her job. Okay I 100-20'd the adc, now what? The adc heals up and it feels pretty bad :/ Her kit also allows for her to kite the frontline pretty well. Kind of. I don't see her kit needing more damage, so another place to give her power is her kiting power (but wait, bind is already 2 seconds and E had slow increased!) I know. So let's talk about her passive. Passive requires her to be within 550 range there's definite risk there, so let's place the utility reward. We could go for CD reduction, like 1(scaling maybe?) second on proc on enemy champions ( not opinions that'd be absurd), as then that increases her up time, for utility. Or give her movespeed, allowing her to independently kite champions like Shyvana better. However that seems rather oppressive in lane, especially with the E+auto+E combo already often allowing you to steal a free TLD trade with them having issues responding. So attach the movespeed gain to ultimate level. \"When proc'ing passive against enemy champions, Lux gains 20% movespeed for 1.5 seconds\" which then increases at level 11 and 16 (mid and late game). This way it's not oppressive in lane and gives her options later on. Alternatively have the movespeed scale with AP so that's not noticeable early game and then beceomes useful for positioning later.\n\nOther suggestions I've seen are W shield slightly lower, but for every ally champion hit, the shield increases in size for the return path. I don't like suggestions to shield in general as it's highly variable and inconsistent.\n\nOne I think would be interesting is causing her passive to reset her auto attack, like Sona powerchord. When combo'ing it can sometimes be awkward, if I E(1)-q-r-auto, then sometimes they will dash out of the E before I pop it because I have to wait for the auto attack. Other combo is E-E-auto-Q-r-auto, but E-Q-auto-E-R-auto is usually smoothest, but causing passive to reset her auto would make it much smoother, imo.\n\nAnyways TL;DR: this change seems to mostly be a snowball mechanic, relying on Lux's ability to oneshot, which generally means she's won anyways. This is a win-more buff, which isn't necessary in the higher elo demographic you want to help out. Most Lux mains want a shield nerf revert, which ought to be considered, since the meta has changed since that was nerfed originally. Other place to look at is her passive to give her utility, as she frankly doesn't need more damage. Passive interaction inherently is risk reward at 550 range, especially as the game continues. CD refunds based on the passive, or movespeed can reward Lux players for proper positioning.\n\nSorry for rambling a bit, didn't expect Lux changes to actually hit the PBE.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DCYOUNG888","date":"2017-03-23T17:27:42.040+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Last week you said you're testing mr/level on champions that currently have no mr growth.

Maybe I'm in the minority, or perhaps even the only person, but I used to ***love*** grabbing Talisman of Ascension as soon as I possibly could, even on champions it was less than favorable on (Sona, Nami, Lulu, etc). As soon as built out of Raptor's Cloak, however, I've neglected the item altogether.\n\nMaybe I'm wasting my time, but I'd love nothing more than for the item to build out of Forbidden Idol again. I appreciate the bonus to healing/shielding so much, and I feel Talisman of Ascension is the support's gold income designed for the specific champions that actually shield and heal frequently to begin with. Raptor's Cloak just feels so out of place on Talisman of Ascension, whereas the bonus healing/shielding would be appreciated so, so much as well as the utility attached to it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2017-03-25T01:39:50.101+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Lux still does pretty well in low Elo's, we see her struggle a fair bit in higher \n\nIf you want to buff her in high elo without to much impac on low elo, then the soft reset on the ult is the exact wrong way to go about it.\nIn Low Elo, squishys get cought alot more often in her burst combo and die to it.\nIn higher Elos, the ult more often also is used to get opponents low so they won't contest an objective, ot for raw aoe in a teamfight rather than just a killing snipe. \nIf you want to give lux more skill-expression, her E would be the first place to look at. Currently, there is very little use iin it's slow-zone mechanic, as instantly popping it is the right call ~90% of the time. Putting a bit more power in the zoneing potential of her E rather than just the poke/burst woud be a great way of increasing her skill-expression, as you finally would have to decide when to pop it rather than instantly explodeing it every damn single time.\nOr put some more power into her passive, like adding a few sec vision on the target when it gets popped, vision would be very fitting for a light mage and usually is more valuable in higher elos than in low elo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Desert","date":"2017-03-24T09:21:55.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"May I ask why the magicshield color was changed for colorblind mode?\nIm not colorblind by anymeans, but I find it easier to spot/keep track of myself in messy teamfights with colorblind turned on.\nThis new light purple/pinkish color is very hard to see for me compared to the old purple.\nWhy was it changed?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nergali","date":"2017-03-24T06:21:24.694+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont get it why wasting time on lux which is really playable while there is dead champs like udyr!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Huudi","date":"2017-03-23T22:43:52.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Graves is my highest mastery champion and I believe the latter approach is better.

We dislike the absurb amount of healing he does with new W, and we can tolerate the fact we are visible in ultimate now. Ferocity decay hasn't even done anything spectacular either, so I have no clue why it was added besides preventing bolas from ultimate.
