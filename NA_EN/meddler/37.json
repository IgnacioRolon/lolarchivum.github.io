The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Champs without Keystone Runes**\r\n\r\nOne of the things we&#039;ll be looking at the most once pre-season goes out is whether each champ has keystones that meet their needs sufficiently. While we&#039;re confident there are multiple keystones that are useful on every champ that doesn&#039;t necessarily mean there&#039;ll be keystones that are good fits for them in the tree they want to go for a particular position. \r\n\r\nA good example of that is Nunu, who if wanting to jungle while going resolve primary may or may not have good choices. Aftershock&#039;s not available to him at all (nothing on his kit triggers it). Grasp of the Undying is available, but looking at how the mastery version of it has gone hasn&#039;t been that appealing on him historically at least. He could take Guardian, especially given BloodBoil will trigger it, though it&#039;s not yet clear if that&#039;ll be worth considering on him.\r\n\r\nAssuming there are champs, whether Nunu or others, who need some help with keystones then we&#039;ll be considering a few options:\r\n\r\n* Changing how some keystones trigger/interact to include otherwise excluded champs. A recent example of something similar is how Sudden Impact now triggers on leaving stealth as well, not just after dashes/blinks.\r\n* Adding new keystones to fill needed gaps. This approach is most likely if there are a range of champions all showing the same problems (DoT mages potentially, though the Arcane Comet changes may have met that need).\r\n* Buffing individual champs. If some champs have adequate keystone options, but don&#039;t synergize as strongly with them as others, the right fix might be to just buff them a bit.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Adjusting some champ and skin VO**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re currently looking at champs and skins that play their VO to everyone, with the aim of adjusting those that are too chatty, resulting in an annoying experience for others. We&#039;ve already made some tweaks to Pulsefire Caitlyn, so if you&#039;ve found the VO playing alongside or against that skin excessive in the past let us know if it&#039;s still a problem. Next up is Super Galaxy Rumble, who&#039;ll get toned down in an upcoming patch (maybe 7.23, not sure exactly yet). We&#039;ll be looking at other skins and champs after that too at some point, so let us know if there are particular ones you think are out of line. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Word Clouds**\r\n\r\nOne of the ways we look champion survey data is by aggregating commonly used phrases into what are called word clouds. Examples of a few of those below, since when we&#039;ve mentioned them in the past some people have expressed an interest in seeing some of them. Each word cloud is for a single champion and reflects what players tell us about them when we run surveys in the LoL client. The larger a word is the more often it was used. We&#039;ve found these to be a useful tool in conveying things like:\r\n\r\n* What players see as the defining features of a champion \r\n* How wide ranging different views of a champion are (e.g. are there words that contradict each other cropping up from different groups of players frequently?)\r\n* Whether or not a champion has a well fleshed out personality (e.g. are all the large words on the cloud purely talking about how a champion&#039;s abilities work or does some of their character also come through prominently?)\r\n* Etc\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Sbl5x\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------","replies":[{"poster":"Jkrexx","date":"2017-11-01T16:30:12.909+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'd love to see more of these word clouds, they're interesting and somewhat comical...

If I could just play Blitz and get multiple S rankings for more chests it would be far more enjoyable... Like first chest get 1 S- on Blitz, then second chest get an S, third get an S+, fourth get 2 S- and so forth.\n\nAnd then there is the limited champion pool... I have earned an S on EVERY support this season and then even some champs most wouldn't consider support...

You mentioned Karma getting a rework a few months ago. You then announced a few weeks ago that the update would be pushed back to next year because of the new rune system. It seems pointless to announce something you are not willing to communicate about. Why did you halt any progress or communication in this game because of the new rune system? What do you want to see happen with Karma and what do you want form us in terms of ideas and suggestions?\n\nYou said she needs a lot of changes. Meddler, you confirmed she will be getting a rework. Thank you. You also stated that you would be open to talking about old moves and other ideas on Karma. What are you doing to live up to this comment that you made since you first said she is getting a rework? You have said nothing, you have done nothing, and you have pushed back her rework . . . . and any further progress on this champion . . . . AGAIN. I just think the Karma community is getting sick and tired of you saying one thing and doing something entirely different . . . which is the same thing every year . . . nothing. We want COMMUNICATION about Karma and what you want from us. You got in trouble with us the first time because you refused to communicate and you allowed Ricklessabandon and other Developers to do whatever the hell they wanted.\n\n========================\n\nSince we are on the topic of VO. One of my friends posted a video of a interaction with the VO actress for Karma, Danielle McRae. These fans were talking to her and she even recited some famous Karma quotes. Well, the only Karma quotes that were created . . . which is like 3 or 4 since Riot doesn't care about her. It got me thinking . . . if a bunch of fans can go up to a VO actress and here some lines, why cannot a company as big as Riot Games pay someone as talented as Danielle McRae to come in and do some extra VO or more work on Karma? The answer is simple. Riot Games have no problem paying to have voice actresses and actors come out for a champion like Ahri or Lux, but when it comes to Karma . . . . for the past 4 years they don't care. You have shown us that no matter what you say and do, you don't give two craps about Karma.\n\nDanielle McRae has more passion about her work than you do, Meddler, and your entire team.

Bit of splash use of precision's possible, Fleet Footwork on champs like TF especially, though wouldn't expect too much of that.","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2017-11-01T16:19:12.673+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"do you think the fact that precision gives attack speed and no raw ad/ap (the set bonus) might be hurting that tree's appeal? I know at first I thought that tree looked really nice for someone like azir, but the loss of the AP and the way comet's cd is reduced had me going back to sorcery fast. I imagine it could also hurt a lot of ad bruisers that want something like press the attack, but also would normally go AD quints not attack speed quints right now (like renekton)","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-11-01T17:07:20.566+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take away the attack speed and it really hurts champions who _do_ want attack speed, though.","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2017-11-01T17:34:14.554+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"guess what I'm wondering is if you should get a mix of stats based on the 2 trees chosen- like precision/sorc gets you attack speed with some AD/AP\n\nI get that the set bonuses kind of replace quints, but its weird to me that certain champs that should probably love precision probably wont ever use it just cus of the stat","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-11-01T17:56:45.028+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could see that helping a bit.
