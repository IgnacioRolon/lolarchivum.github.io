Additionally, if there&#039;s something particularly on your mind gameplay wise you&#039;d like to hear our thoughts on do throw that suggestion into the comments. Can&#039;t make any promises I&#039;ll be able to speak to it, or speak to it immediately at least, always on the lookout for new topics though. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Looking at struggling junglers**\r\n\r\nOne of our focuses for the 7.6 development cycle is looking at champions who commonly jungle who are having too hard a time of it. We&#039;re expecting that&#039;ll mean we look at a range of champions and then make changes to a subset of that group. Currently being considered are Nunu, Fiddlesticks, Nidalee, Amumu, Jarvan and Volibear. You should see changes to some of those champs hit the PBE today, expect some others to follow and some to likely get reverted during the patch cycle as we test them.  \r\n\r\nChanges we&#039;re more confident in are Nid traps prioritizing big monsters over small plus Fiddle getting bonus E damage against monsters and from memory CD/range tweaks to Q/W respectively. For J4 and Nunu we&#039;re looking at W scaling and consume respectively, though need more testing on those to speak with confidence about how promising those directions are/aren&#039;t. Nothing concrete yet on Amumu or Volibear.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Shifting defensive stats from items to base stats**\r\n\r\nA couple of weeks ago I mentioned we were testing moving some stats from items to base stats, making vanguards, wardens and juggernauts at least more inherently tanky. We&#039;ve concluded that approach wasn&#039;t working well enough overall, given it pushed a lot of champions towards more offensive itemization, risked blunting the difference between ahead and behind tanks too much and made some defensive purchases too unsatisfying/unimpactful.\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re still exploring other defensive item changes though and will be investigating a number of concepts (possible need for an item that&#039;s strong against sustained magic damage specifically, efficiency of double defensive item rushes from solo laners, tanks dying too fast in some circumstances late game etc). We won&#039;t necessarily end up with changes that touch on all or even any of exact those issues FYI, but figured there&#039;d still be interest in hearing about the sorts of things we&#039;re considering.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Ninja Tabi**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve seen some recent spikes in Ninja Tabi use, especially in high Elo ranked. Still assessing whether that&#039;s reflective of Ninja Tabi being too strong (they are really gold efficient) or whether that&#039;s a natural and appropriate reaction to some teams stacking a lot of physical damage dealers who auto attack (any game the enemy team&#039;s running a jungle Graves for example Ninja Tabi&#039;s value goes up quite a bit). We&#039;d like to get more confidence we&#039;ve properly distinguished between an item being too strong and an item being an appropriate safety valve basically. More thoughts on that to follow at some point. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Aatrox**\r\n\r\nAatrox&#039;s balance changes should be hitting the live servers shortly. We believe the direction they represent&#039;s a good one, as usual with larger sets of changes they&#039;ll likely throw his balance out a bit, one direction or the other, initially though. Given his optimal builds have likely changed moderately we also suspect he&#039;ll probably perform worse for a little while just after the changes than he will longer term as players experiment with builds and people unfamiliar with Aatrox give him a try.","replies":[{"poster":"Häxel","date":"2017-03-07T18:02:06.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi, i would like to hear your thoughts on 2 ideas i have heared and thought about myself too:\n1: Regarding Ninja Tabi's, do you think making the amount of % damage reduction from the passive scaling with bonus armor would help to tune it down, so the actuall 12% work just for tanks going armor and not for assasins like talon/Zed, which with only bonus armor from runes should have than maybe something like 4-8% reduction?\n2: If you say some tanks die in some circumstances too fast how about an item which reduces %healthmaxdamage dealt to the user? Like current game state has much %healthmaxdamage, even on supports if you look on malzahar and brand support. So if a tank gets ulted by malzahar and 2,3 people attack him he rly melts down. This new item would help against that and you could combine it with your idea of an item beeing strong vs sustained magic dmg.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-03-07T18:21:25.197+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making the Ninja Tabi effect scale with tank stats would be an effective approach if the desire was to make it so they were generally only bought on tanks. That's not a goal at present, though something like that could make sense if it someday was.\n\n%maxhealth damage is intended to be a counter to tankier defense stackers in part, so we wouldn't want to blunt that. Options we're thinking about are things like a Sterak's for tanks (burst of one off survivability), a Wukong passive item (more defense per nearby enemy), AOE damage reduction in some form (lot of the problem is the ambient damage that's not even targeted at melee they have to eat anyway) etc. That's still at the brainstorming stage though to be clear, not stuff we're committed to or anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2017-03-07T19:39:05.271+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Ninja tabi are getting more popular because lethality is out of control.

This was combined with Udyr nerfs in Patch 6.4 and 6.7. Since then Udyr has fallen out of favor for alot of players.\nWith the introduction of Season 7 all things that still held him in a decent spot got changed. SotA got replaced. Power farming, Udyrs most loved task, got flat out removed from the game and strong early game junglers like Kha'Zix or Graves are currently the best junglers in League of Legends.\nUdyr is known for his fast clears, which isn't the case at the moment. Champions like Shyvana are clearing just flat out fasters, which allows them to get earlier on to the map and secure river control. You could say, that compared to Shyvana and Master Yi , Udyr can gank, because of his bear. Udyr can stun, but he can't gapclose, which Shyvana and Master Yi can. These problems can be fixed by just changing some numbers. \nHere are some changes, Udyr Mains like [DoublepainSits, who currently is the best Udyr player after LoLSkills ranking](http://www.lolskill.net/champion/udyr/toplistScore), came up with, to improve Udyr's early and mid game.\n\n**R: Phoenix Stance**\n\nPersistent Effect: 40 / 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 (+45%) --> 60 / 95 / 130 / 165 / 200 (+45%)\nActivation: 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 (+25%) --> 20 / 27.5 / 35 / 42.5 / 50 (+25%)\n\nUdyr's Mid-Late game is completly OK, why the Level 5 numbers are the same, but his first clears are seriously lacking. These changes would allow him to get faster on the map and apply pressure on the lanes or in the enemy jungle much earlier.\n\n**E: Bear Stance**\n\nMovement speed bonus: 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 / 35% --> 20 / 23,75 / 27,5 / 31,25 / 35%\nDuration stays the same\n\nGiving Udyr's level one Bear Stance a larger movement speed bonus helps Udyr's ganking alot. With every rework or new champion are coming more gap closers into the game (e.g. Warwick's Q, Camille's E). Having more movement speed on level 1 Bear Stance would improve Udyr's ganking alot.\n\n**P: Monkey's Agility\n**\nAdding the level 20 change, [as mentioned by Meddler](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/a2ftyl7z-quick-gameplay-thoughts-feb-28?comment=00030000)\nAlso the Jax and Fervor of Battle treatment, so that the stacks fall of one at a time and not instantly.\n\n**Mana cost on all spells**\n\nThe last idea I want to mention is the mana cost. Udyr has 270 - 292 base mana level 1 and 2. So after ~7-8 usages of Phoenix and Turtle he can only auto attack. This forces him to start blue buff most of the time, to have a healthier and faster clear.\n\nMana cost: 47 / 44 / 41 / 38 / 35 --> 43 / 41 / 39 / 37 / 35\n\nThese changes would improve his time after clearing the jungle, while being less dependent on blue buff in the early-mid game.\n\nI would really like to hear your thoughts about these ideas.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Syldaen","date":"2017-03-07T18:36:34.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"out of all these junglers , i didn't see udyr getting any changes , we already only see him once in a bloodmoon , this patch is a good one to help him out in it","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-03-07T18:45:30.559+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, yeah.

Any discussion about Karthus lately?  I'd really like your personal opinion as well as to know whether he's been mentioned internally at all.  \n\nHe has 2 main playstyles:\n\n1) Rylai's or Frostbelt early/All-in with exhaust level 1-3/Focus on landing Q's and dueling the enemy frequently to build a lead via solo kills.\n\n2) RoA early, take teleport, AFK farm from afar and never interact with the enemy laner until minute 40, then press R\n\nMy main concern is how you guys seem to be progressively gimping the first playstyle and forcing him into the much lower skill-expression, much less interactive, and much more boring 2nd playstyle.\n\nNotable changes, in order:\n\n1) When DFT was released, Karthus, Brand, Malz etc. spiked in power.  You nerfed Karthus' wall slow, saying that he should be chaining Rylai's to the initial slow to keep landing Q's.  (Rylai's Q's slowed for 40% at the time.)\n\nThen you nerfed DFT drastically but left Karthus' wall the same, and he dropped to around a 49% winrate.\n\n2) Next:  The Rylai's changes.\n\nRemoving the isolated 35-40% slow he's had since his inception with it meant that he couldn't effectively chain-slow from his now incredibly weak wall slow, and pushed him further towards RoA AFK farm.\n\nThe sad part here was that RoA AFK farm Karthuses will find similar success but Rylai's-based dueling Karthuses are hit hard, so his general winrate floats at a decent level and you see no reason to help him out overall. \nSuppose if AP Ekko was gutted but he was still strong as a tank, so you saw a 50% winrate on him and thought - hey, he's doing fine, no need for increases to his AP damage.\n\n3)Finally, the Exhaust nerf.  \nExhaust clearly needs a nerf, but it's the key facilitator of the highest-level Karthus' strategies.  They use Exhaust to all-in level 1-3 and get first blood.  The 10 MR reduction removal is akin to giving those Karthuses 10 less Mpen for several seconds during their early-level all-ins.  It heavily gimps his early kill potential, which was already fine-tuned to such a point that these high level Karthuses often secured the kills only by weaving auto attacks between Qs.\n\n4) Then I opened this thread and saw you mentioning the possible need of an item to deal with sustained magic damage.  Bluh....\n\nSo, with this all in mind, I'm pretty afraid that you're cramming him tightly into a playstyle of 'Buy RoA, take Teleport, farm for 40 minutes, press R'.  Any chance of a slight change to help the more skillful Karthus playstyle - that is, something to reward him better for landing Qs, or maybe a revert to his wall nerf to encourage him to go for Qs?\n\nThanks for reading.  Please tell me your personal thoughts as well as whether he's been mentioned internally at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hamentasch","date":"2017-03-07T19:07:46.747+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any thoughts on nerfing Ivern and Shaco?

Not to mention Ivern and Elise aren't Talisman _users_ as much as they are Talisman-because-Machete-does-less-for-me-buyers. Hecarim has a pretty painful early clear as mana is concerned too - unless you start on blue, which solves next to everyone's mana problems - and slow clearers like Sej could definitely do with some increased healing. To be fair, I'd just like to see the healing be part up front and part over time so autoattacking Talisman-buyers would be aided ever so slightly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Predatorator","date":"2017-03-07T18:55:47.849+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honest question, how is volibear struggling? i'm not sure about his clears, but he actually seems pretty ok, he can get tanky in a good amount of time, and yet he retains good damage. but hey, i may have missed something. Any thoughts on skarner?","replies":[{"poster":"wogsel","date":"2017-03-07T21:52:16.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dunno why skarner has so low priority... And mordekaiser has higher, but both reworks are just unsuccesfull...\nSkarner was classed as a juggernaut,but he cant  stay under other juggernaut ( darius,morde) in early game because his extremly weak...moreover he has super high manacosts.\nHe says \"I will tear them apart\", \"I will show you a monstrous\"  but even malphite can solo him. Is that really a juggernaut?? Juggernaut that loses against 90% champs 1v1? I am raelly disappointed.. his only common feature with juggernautis that he is super slow (335 ms)\nPlease make his rework a higher priority, because skarner actually is super boring,and he somentimes reminds a worse version  VI or Heca.","replies":[{"poster":"Predatorator","date":"2017-03-08T16:08:49.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fine with morde being a high priority. what bugs me is how low of a priority apparently skarner is. i mean, both reworks were busted, but morde got a very decent and consistent followup, which brought him in a far better spot, while skarner only got his numbers nerfed, and still 50% of his power tied to fixed, contestable zones in the jungle. \n\nright now skarner is more of a vanguard than a juggernaut, due to him having more cc than innate damage, in comparison with other juggernauts. it's really just that juggernaut items still work on him. oh yeah, and he also got stripped of his \"sticky dps fighter\" identity, to have instead a supposedly \"premiere objective controller\" niche, when actually is the \"involve team effort to hold the crystals, or else you'll get 50% of me\" niche, and still lots of champions have more objective-taking potential than him. \n\ni hope he'll get worked on a bit in the mid-season update. because i don't see actually volibear to struggle more than skarner.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
