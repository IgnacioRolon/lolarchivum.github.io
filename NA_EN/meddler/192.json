The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Runes numbers aren&#039;t final**\r\n\r\nIn another note on runes - important to stress that any numbers shown aren&#039;t necessarily final ones. Maybe Ultimore will be really overpowered at 20% when fully stacked? If so 20%&#039;s not the number it should be. Pretty confident at 5% fully stacked for example it wouldn&#039;t be worth taking, so if 20% does end up being too high let&#039;s find that sweet spot in between the two. Important to distinguish between concept (invest some of your pre-game power into a rune that lets you use your ult more) and details (X champion can cast their ult every Y seconds and that&#039;s busted). \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Possible Janna changes in 7.19**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re taking another look at possible Janna changes, with much of the focus there still being on adding a bit more skill expression for Janna and counterplay opportunities for her opponents. Things currently being tested include Q uncharged being weaker/charged being stronger (faster for one thing), E having a longer CD until max rank (windows of vulnerability in lane), longer AA range (incentive a bit more risk taking and active play on Janna&#039;s part). Work&#039;s still going through quite a bit of iteration, so nothing final yet, hoping to have something in for 7.19 though.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Ornn**\r\n\r\nFor anyone that missed it there was another Ornn micro patch to give him a bit more power last week. We&#039;re still monitoring that. In 7.19 we&#039;ll at least be making some changes to how his item upgrades work (minimum level needed, plus the addition of a new item or two). Possible we give him a bit of extra power in some other regard too, getting to the point though where we also need to be extra careful not to over buff him. We&#039;re still seeing a lot of Ornn players struggle, but some of that&#039;s still learning curve not kit, and successful Ornns are starting to do quite a bit better.","replies":[{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2017-09-06T15:43:47.000+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Meddler, seeing as you've chosen the lower range option for Azir, has anything been done to improve the feel of his E when used offensively?

(Although I get the point that Karma was actually designed to be a mid laner on her rework xD)\n\nI was actually pretty excited when her rework got out - but it has left much to be said.
