The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**8.12 Fighter items**\r\n\r\nWe came to the conclusion at the start of this week that we should pull the fighter item changes out of patch 8.12, despite the patch being about to go out and a lot of work/testing having been done on those items. Our belief is that they&#039;re good designs, but that the timing&#039;s wrong for them, both in terms of current power of fighters and amount of change we&#039;ve put into the game recently. Hoping to still do them at some point, with pre-season being the most likely option. \r\n\r\nOur apologies to those of you who were looking forward to those, would expect their removal to be pretty frustrating for some players, especially if you play fighters who aren&#039;t among the stronger ones right now, or who don&#039;t have a broad enough range of itemization. Building up expectations around content like this going out, only for it to then be pulled away, is something we try pretty hard to avoid. In this case, despite the pain that creates, we felt we needed to pull them out though.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**Crit ADCs**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re working on buffing the performance of some ADCs in 8.13. That&#039;ll be focused on those who  need some help like Trist, Vayne or Jinx. We want to get a range of crit ADCs back to being reasonable choices, at least in regular play, quickly - we have no desire to leave that group of champs without a home anywhere on SR. We also want to try and maintain some of the new diversity we&#039;re seeing sometimes in bot lane too though, so are trying not to swing so hard we go back to only seeing marksmen.\r\n\r\nIn terms of what&#039;s getting played at present, it&#039;s not yet clear what optimal is. We&#039;re seeing a range of different things tried in pro play for example, with a wide range of success and failure. Also seeing a lot of player discussion around non marksmen dominating bot, though in most MMRs/regions play rates of non marksmen are extremely low still (some exceptions).\r\n\r\nIn terms of how we&#039;ll be buffing the thing we&#039;re planning to target first is the performance of those struggling champs in the 1 to 2 item spike range. Looks like we pulled the crit users back too far in that period, leaving them too dependent on getting to 3+ items to contribute. Given their multiplicative power late game we do believe champs using those builds should be weaker mid game, but not to the extent they are right now. That also ties in with lane diversity, which we think is driven significantly by really early game power, so buffing mid game should be compatible with both putting crit ADCs in a better spot and keeping some increased lane diversity for those who want it.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Gold Funneling**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ll be nerfing gold funneling strategies in 8.13. Gold Funneling, for anyone unfamiliar with the term, is where you give one champion much of the gold/XP from multiple positions. Taric Mid/Yi jungle with Yi getting really farmed, or Karthus mid/Nunu counter jungling, with Karthus taking most of the allied jungle, being current examples.\r\n\r\nThe gold funneling we&#039;re seeing now results in what&#039;s usually a pretty interactive, interesting, and often playmaking lane (mid) becoming very passive, with one laner just doing their best to interact with the other player as little as possible and getting rewarded for that. In cases where the mid laner isn&#039;t CSing that problems exacerbated further, since CSing does at least create small windows of vulnerability, earlier in the game especially. While there&#039;s likely some counterplay to gold funneling that hasn&#039;t emerged yet, we&#039;re doubtful it&#039;s going to be around as easy to execute as gold funneling itself is or particularly fun/interesting in its own right. We held off on changes to gold funneling initially when it wasn&#039;t clear if it was a pretty niche thing that would bring some variety occasionally and be worth a bit of game health cost, or something that would become more dominant and need to be addressed even if it offered strategic variety. Pretty clear at this point it&#039;s the later.\r\n\r\nIn terms of how we&#039;ll address it we&#039;re still testing exact tactics. Possible changes include returning the overlevelled XP penalty on jungle camps that got removed in 8.10, individual adjustments to champs like Yi (lane minion damage on Q for example), jungle items giving XP penalties for lane minions to offset the increased XP from jungle monsters etc. Should have more details soon.\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"ΚAΤΑΘΛΙΨH","date":"2018-06-14T20:15:28.130+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hi Meddler,\n\nHow Riven is feeling now without starting CDR?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brandoro","date":"2018-06-14T19:08:20.098+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"i don't know if this may be too late to ask some questions, but since this update is partly about fighters and their disappointment, i would like to just ask about your view on Riven atm? \nRiven is a very interesting case, because she can be played as an assasin or bruiser. So balancing her might be tough, but since I main Riven (at around  800k and plat+ and played A LOT ranked games this season and also played riven before this Season) im confindet to say that she wasn't adressed as much as other toplane champions. I really think her base stats or maybe passive needs to be looked at, because currently she gets outshined by camille,fiora or irelia in terms of teamfight contribution, survivability and also dmg, because they all have some kind of tank-shred gimmick to their kit plus self heal/sustain in lane in their kit.

Aatrox is now a copy of her with more range on the abilities and will even do more damage than her do to the kit.\n\nCan we expect any Riven changes in the near future?\n\nWhy? :\nYou guys nerfed her CD's because of the early 10% CDR from the runes. now you only get them at lvl 10 if you take the rune.\nHer health regen is the lowest of all fighters/bruisers/skirmishers in the whole game and thats because Riot nerfed it due to Riven players building Tiamat early on the game. \n\nCurrently, You get a warhammer first, a kindlegem 2nd. and then boots most of the time to not die in lane or Phage for more health and the movementspeed. If everything goes well, you end up with 30% CDR at about 15min into the game without having your Cleaver even completed.\n\nThe Riven mains subreddit also asks what you guys will do about this as Riven is the only champion that has no sustain in her kit and is less rewarded for the complex animation cancels than an Irelia which doesnt cancel anything but still all ins you whenever she wants to.\n\n\nAs a Champion who has to put autoattacks inbetween her spells in order to put out the most of her damage, she should be getting rewarded more for that rather than just doing equal trades and then get outsustained by the enemy due to their kit.\n\nFrom what we, the Riven mains subreddit see is, that she is pretty much useless in the laning phase and will make the team lose in a 4v5 if she gets behind the slightest bit due to the current state of the game where a champion like Riven has no way of coming back after she lost the laning phase.\n\n\nIt would be really nice if you guys could maybe reach out to the likes of Viper, Adrian, Dekar and BoxBox and maybe other players which arent OTP's such as Huni, Lourlo, Ssumday to ask how you could manage to bring her back into the game without overbuffing her.\n\nCurrently 48.96%  Winrate according to OP.gg which isnt bad but i hope you guys get what i mean.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zecastar","date":"2018-06-14T16:17:17.232+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":12,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=bz0HUP5U,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-06-14T15:20:35.082+0000)\n>\n> Hi folks,\n> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> \n> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \n> **Gold Funneling**\n> \n> We&amp;#039;ll be nerfing gold funneling strategies in 8.13.

The most interesting part of JG was often getting a fast level 3 and invading or ganking. That's already been reduced. It takes me 15 minutes to reach level 10 and frequently 8 to hit level 6. I also don't think there should be an outlevelling farming penalty for camps or lane. This kind of stuff really screws the meta and champs. Sometimes you want to split push as jg or to push with your laner to get a safe back. There are so many things you can mess up with that.\n\nWhat you're seeing is partly a result of JG being nerfed so hard early and thus having less influence in lanes to offset such funneling strategies. Secondly, support items are cheap and strong still. Third, many waveclear champions got nerfed so they struggle even more vs these champions. Mana regen also got nerfed. Don't mess with JG XP or Gold again please. Do you even realize how absurd this gets for jgs? The role feels TERRIBLE when you can't rely on ANYTHING and Riot treats it like an endless beta test. Every season, JG is changed, now mid season we have huge nerfs and many jg routes no longer beinv viable... can't even hit level 3 fast,  all randomized again, more RNG added for literally no reason (scuttler spawn should always be known and everyone hates this aspect) etc. It feels like you guys just want to make us suffer at this point lol. Why does JG have to do so much more work to remain relevant every patch? If I main mid lane or top, I don't have to relearn the whole game every few months. Yeah, some items change, but not fundamentals. It's getting ridiculous at this point. It's disrespectful towards people's effort and time. Moreover, it was preventable if you guys grasped the consequences of your own changes better or didn't treat this like an alpha game during a RANKED season. So many changes have been at best neutral and created massive disruption. JG wasn't even OP previously. Lanes were just bad. In competitive, JG was basically a support role. \n\nI can't rely on anything you guys do and that's made me essentially give up on taking this game seriously and putting real effort in it. Items, strategies, clear optimizations, EVERYTHING is just in an endless loop of change and often unmotivated and unasked for change too (besides minorities on Reddit and Boards). Nothing can be relied on. There is no foundation. It's like if I play chess and the pieces get different moves half way in the game or the board changes. It's just a waste of time investing in something like that. Games that have longevity and are worth learning, are STABLE. You can trust that you'll have the same rules in 5 years as in the next 5 minutes and your effort in getting coaching, understanding, reading books etc. isn't a total waste. It's no coincidence that this game was taken most seriously and was most respected in the S4 era when things were moving much slower. Remember Reign of Gaming and the detailed analysis posts on items, XP, itemization etc.? Where is that now? People basically gave up because their time investment was disrespected and they can't trust this game to be what they enjoyed or worked on in another few months.","replies":[{"poster":"Gilad","date":"2018-06-14T17:52:02.283+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"To add onto this - Please for the love of god don't nerf jungle again.

Putting slow down xp on jungle makes it feel so so bad, earlier in the season with catchup xp being a bit overtuned and having slow down xp there was almost no reason to get ahead of the enemy jungle, it was better to just gank as hard as possible then take a couple camps and you would be caught up. With the recent nerfs to jungle spam ganking is not as effective anymore, unless you get one of the few great level 2 gankers. One of the few saving graces of these nerfs was that getting ahead of the enemy jungle actually matters  much more now. If that were to be taken away the jungle role would just feel empty, it just doesn't feel right that every lane is allowed to snowball on their opponents except for jungle. \n\n\nI think the real issues of gold funneling comes from supports/support items being overtuned. In the taric/yi combo taric is taking 0 resources off the map yet he is still generating a good amount of gold from thin air. With this gold he is able to purchase incredibly gold efficient items like ardent or zekes and buff a yi who has had nearly double the amount of resources he would normally have. I always though supports received gold generation because they needed to buy items like sightstone, oracles, and wards but those were all removed 1 by 1 while the gold generation remained. Sightstone is now built into an item that is gold efficient already and is basically required to be built which means supports are able to focus on building other items. \n\nI think it becomes a problem because with these items they are able to give away literally all sources of income and remain relevant in the game, and it is very hard to counter because they don't need to do anything to reach these items. Maybe I am just a bitter hardstuck d1 jungler but I have listened to the opinions of a lot of players that are better then me (Imaqtpie/scarra/apdo just to name a few) talk about how the support role is not only a very strong/impactful role in the current meta, but also much stronger then it used to be. I think that can be seen as champions like Lulu, Taric, and Karma are taking over other roles in the game. \n\nWould really like to hear your opinion on this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bunni","date":"2018-06-15T08:04:22.351+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey meddler, What you think about riven right now because no starting cdr, no armor shredding or true dmg in kit like other bruisers???","replies":[]},{"poster":"FafliX","date":"2018-06-14T16:43:22.204+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you guys have plans for Karma yet?

I mean, the idea is that you are having a player give up their gold for another to get really strong. But because of the way support champions, their income and their items are tuned, it results in the first player giving up too little. Its the support role's fundamentals that make the strategy unhealthy, not the strategy itself. Heck, the strategy will probably be solved and countered in a month's time and become a niche strat that we'll be seeing once in a blue moon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lol you wild wyd","date":"2018-06-14T15:28:07.107+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"World Cup and some Gameplay Thoughts, lets get it!\n\nFew things I would love to hear your thoughts on @Riot Meddler:\n\n1. Snowballing in the game. I know you mentioned that you guys are working on solutions but when stuff like this happens and then seeps into professional play, do you prioritise the pro scene more? or do you try to find a balance between pro and retail environments. Because both parties are equally effected. People like to run scaling comps/champion and the new Crit changes kind of contradict the snowball meta at the moment.\n\n2. A more general point, how do you feel the new Rune System has been received? Recently there has been a lot of concern that the system kills variance and diversity, something that Runes Reforged aimed to promote. Instead we have nerf after nerf funnelling our choices into cookie cutter builds to fit the meta or fall behind. Is this the right view or has diversity/creativity/off-meta not been hindered by this? \n\nCheers in advance :D","replies":[]}]}
