The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Happy 2019!**\r\n\r\nHope the year&#039;s treating you all well so far. To kick things off as these posts resume I wanted to get some feedback on the posts themselves, in particular:\r\n\r\n* What types of topic would you like to see more of in these posts? \r\n* How often do you want to see one of these posts come out? Twice a week&#039;s been the regular schedule for quite a while now, would once a week and a bit longer be more appealing for example, or is shorter but more frequent better?\r\n* Who else should we be learning from? Would particularly love to hear your thoughts on communication from other game developers and what approaches and techniques we should be adopting.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**Changes in 9.2 and beyond**\r\n\r\nAs you might have seen Maple Nectar talking about on Twitter we&#039;ve just picked our likely targets for 9.2 as below. As usual not guaranteed we&#039;ll necessarily ship changes for all of these cases and we&#039;re still in the process of testing what exactly we&#039;ll do. \r\n\r\nBuffs:\r\n\r\n* Sunfire Cape\r\n* Aurelion Sol\r\n* Dr Mundo\r\n* Jarvan\r\n* Neeko\r\n* Renekton\r\n* Shen\r\n* Shyvana\r\n* Volibear\r\n* Yorick\r\n\r\n\r\nNerfs:\r\n\r\n* Oblivion Orb\r\n* Relic Shield line\r\n* Aatrox\r\n* Brand\r\n* Camille\r\n* Cassiopeia\r\n* Galio\r\n* Irelia\r\n* Jax\r\n* Kassadin\r\n* Rakan\r\n* Urgot\r\n* Zyra\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re also looking at some more Akali work, though that&#039;s looking at counterplay, pro versus regular play power etc rather than a straight buff or nerf. Part of that includes assessing the recent shroud changes to see how much they have or haven&#039;t moved the needle and whether further shroud changes are a good tactic. \r\n\r\nIn terms of longer term work (likely changes over more than one patch, which might or might not include 9.2) we&#039;re also looking at some wider issues. The key ones there are how damage is distributed across the game (including which sources contribute how much damage), ADC itemization (crit primarily, possibly a bit that affects other build paths too) and reducing jungle influence a bit (lower camp reward scaling, less damage from the Smite upgrades).\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Allowing a few champs to go beyond level 18**\r\n\r\nWanted to get a gut check from you folks on a concept we&#039;ve kicked around occasionally internally. How does the idea of allowing a few specific champions to exceed the level cap slightly (level 19, maybe 20?) sound? If for example Zilean&#039;s passive, in addition to allowing him to give XP to allies, also allowed him to break the level cap a bit just for himself is that something that feels natural? If so, is it something that would feel out of place if a few other champions could do the same? Not something we&#039;re immediately planning to do, but could be an option for champs who could do with a bit of super late game power and a bit of extra relevance to their passives. Was curious as to whether it was something that generally sounded appealing versus boring, fair versus unfair etc to you all. \r\n \r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Shaian","date":"2019-01-09T17:06:31.689+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":6,"body":"What are you intending to do on Zyra? The thing that breaks her is her passive, there is the feeling that she currently has no skillexpression or any required mastery in playing her. \nOn the other hand thats the only thing Zyra can do well, since her single spells are not strong enough to be relevant without plants or short duration plants later in the game. She must win earlygame nowadays.\n\nImo the correct approach would be to gut the passive early game by increasing its CD by 3 times (maybe add 0.5s reduced CD everytime you damage an enemy).\nSince this is an insanely big nerf it would open up room to buff her Q damage (skillexpression). You missed making Qmax a viable option last year in her „midlanebuff“ which resulted in even less players playing her successfully mid, with the changes you have done at the time. And revisit her plant HP, there are too many wrong interactions and coding since a year now, even though the concept looked good on paper. The gameplay feeling is just not doing it.\n\nMake Zyra good on good players, not all players.","replies":[{"poster":"4Teebee4","date":"2019-01-09T17:52:39.451+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have to jump on this.

Sample topics:\n\n* Why does damage/burst feel so high? Is it intended as part of an overall design choice, or is it a problem to be solved?\n\n* Why are so many recent new/updated champions so goddam frustrating to play against?! Do champ designers account for frustration in a vacuum, or are they sensitive to cumulative frustrations?\n\n* What is your advice for players who feel orphaned after their favorite champs (or even their entire pool of mains) are reworked into something unenjoyable or even unrecognizable? How does/should Riot show concern for these players?\n\n> Nerfs:\n>\n>  Oblivion Orb\n>   Zyra\n\nInstead of double-nerfing Zyra, could you try fixing her her structural issues instead? The passive is toxic and was always destined to be a balance nightmare. Her plants are too squishy and unreliable in fights, but they're too consistent and oppressive for lane poke. Her damage scaling is completely fucked up, with multipliers that are too reliant on plants and base damage, then falling off too hard when it's time to rank W.\n\nI just cannot for the life of me figure out why you guys won't try *any* of the numerous suggestions to make her more fun to play and less miserable to play against. A million mastery points into this champ, and she's just too infuriating to enjoy playing. I sincerely have more fun playing Katarina into Kassadin and Malzahar than winning a game on Zyra.

As it stands she can solo dragon really easily at level 3-4 depending on what type or dragon it is. At Plat+ mmr, most people know this so yoi can get away with most sneaks, you usually need at least one other person on yoir team bodyguarding you. Sneaking Dragons isnt a very enjoyable playstyle, unless you tripled her damamge to dragons bonus or something like that.\n\nInstead, why not add more movespeed to her w? It would help her out a lot pre 6, when shes already pretty low on the power curve compared to most popular junglers atm, like lee sin, jax, graves, kindred.\n\nAlso, are you trying to push the AP Shyvana playstyle? Although its currently suboptimal, I do think its possible to push. As it stands you can usually only get 3 E’s off in Mega before changing back unless youre close enough to auto. Why not make it so she can gain some fury from hitting enemies with her abilities like on renekton?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Secyremeneis","date":"2019-01-10T06:51:06.752+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why does it have to be a buff directed at jungle though? Shyvana top has been a thing since S2 and could benefit from a buff as well (win rate on op.gg 45%) Her passive already makes it hard to justify her top lane. If you really want to focus on her jungle though why not add an additional effect on her depending on what dragon has been slain. Slaying an Infernal for example could give her extra burn damage until the next dragon spawns. Again I am not a fan of making her passive so team and position reliant in general but if you really wanna go that route and make her all about controlling dragons that would be the best way to make it more fun imo.

Something like doing additional damage to neutral _and_ enemy monsters, to encourage invades.

However, I would like to point out that Shyvana's passive used to practically be base stats (now she fights to control an objective to get those stats) a long time ago and even longer ago she was a top/jungle champion and not a jungle exclusive. Shyvana's viable roles have narrowed to jungle only (partly enforced by her passive) and she ranks low among those in her role. Being that Shyvana has long had the ability to kill Dragon shortly after spawn (she has to clear the other camps still) and spawn times haven't changed the main outcome is Shyvana will have more health after sneaking first dragon. However, right after Shyvana kills first Dragon the honey fruit spawn or have spawned, allowing her to heal back up. So the results look identical before and after further increasing damage to Dragons.\n\n\nFirst Dragon buffs are stronger, but as a Shyvana player I care more about getting 2nd Dragon. At 2 dragons Shyvana breaks even with the effective health of her pre-rework human form. You can find the math on that here: https://www.reddit.com/r/shyvanamains/comments/5e27w6/shyvanas_new_passive_because_a_buff_after_2/da9rtj0/\n\n\n\nBut I find the focus on killing Dragons so she can have a passive to be missing the point of making Shyvana better champion for League of Legends since killing dragon is a tactical goal for every team anyway. Other juggernauts and divers simply get their tankiness boost. Garen's W just works. Warwick's E just works. Thus, they can be tough enough to be juggernauts and divers.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2019-01-09T20:26:42.019+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where's the Karma rework that was teased by Riot NeuroCat a few months back? She said we would see that around 9.2. Was it scrapped? \n\nHere's the link if anyone is wondering: \nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/TkiBEVYV-karma-gameplay-change-preview?comment=0094","replies":[]},{"poster":"Winterkill","date":"2019-01-09T17:07:00.837+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"What is going on with Karma, Meddler? The proposed rework last year was largely disapproved for the following reasons:\n\n1) It didn't unify the 3 gameplay styles that Developers created for Karma for the past 6 years. There was a failure to do anything meaningful on Karma for the past 6 years, which could have solved the problem of a divided fan-base. Karma has a mage, support and tank following. The proposed rework didn't solve that problem and bring Karma back as a battlemage/support but opened up the possibility of her being a jungle now. So now Karma will have 4 playstyles with no specific arrow pointing towards who she is.\n\n2) Karma's Mantra functionality and gameplay identity is still all over the place. This technically should fall into number 1 but having an actual gameplay identity would allow Karma's Mantra to be more successful and solve the problems. Simply buffing damage on an already annoying champion with damage was never the answer and the community didn't ask for that. The community asked for more utility (such as Mantra healing explosion) and the ability be ground targeted. Not a single person asked for a pathetic number buff (another one that will probably be nerfed) to Karma's only damage move. The Karma community wanted more damage options through-out her kit, Mantra functionality changed, and an actual gameplay identity to finally solve Karma's problems.\n\n3) The two biggest things players wanted back on this champion was her fans and shield bomb. Both of these things were removed and not replaced with better content. The Mantle of Decorum and Karma's new theme are alright but if something as iconic and memorable as Karma's fans is still talked about today, why has there been no attempt at bringing it back? Karma's Mantra E literally exists in the game and Developers continue to ignore the obvious problems with it. Players want shield bomb back and returned to the champion it belonged to. No one wants to grant mass AOE shields with a speed steroid when half of the champion roster and two item actives on support items can do the same thing. Bring back her fans and shield bomb.\n\n4) No art problems are being fixed or even looked at. The recent running animation is a pathetic attempt at best. The Mantle of Decorum and dress have major clipping issues and this is the result of a poorly conceptualized visual update. The visual update for Karma was rushed 6 years ago and it is sloppy. None of that is being addressed.\n\nYou need to explain to us what is happening with this champion Meddler, because players are now going to hold you guys accountable for more mistakes and failure to communicate. It's 2019 and all of you should be doing better than what you have been for the past couple years. There are no more excuses, diversions, or anything else. Riot Game Developers worked on this champion 6 years ago, refused to work on Karma at all for the past 6 years, and decided to finally work on Karma 6 years later but the rework is the same work ethic she always gets and reception for it is not good. Why did you guys ask for community feedback if you didn't use any of it? Why did you make players wait 6 years for another rework that is one sided and gives us nothing we asked for? Why are Riot Game Developers essentially silent about the issue and basically telling the Karma community to, \"Get over it or move on?\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frolo","date":"2019-01-09T22:14:41.047+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"personally i dislike the idea of breaking the level cap. \n\nlevels are one of the only things that has been consistent since the beginning of the game and therefore is one of the only systems you can currently count on not having to relearn","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noxian Might","date":"2019-01-09T20:30:26.318+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"What about spear of shojin?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sw4de","date":"2019-01-09T16:59:27.036+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":15,"body":"I just want JG to get outscaled again like they did for 8 years, logic dictates that the role that starts with the most agency/influence should scale down with game time while the roles that are restricted to an area of the map and are fighting PVP for all their resources scale up with game time\n\nThis is how its always been, why are junglers scaling with laners now, its so ridiculously oppressive that i have to be scared of fighting the JG 1v1 as a solo laner from min 1 to min 50 every game","replies":[{"poster":"Mirage Main","date":"2019-01-09T20:25:48.147+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"You have posted this like 100 times now on reddit and forums and you still don't get how wrong you are.

I understand it’s to make it so that if she hangs around so long you can’t just summon her as soon as she dies but wouldn’t a better buff be letting the CD tick down in the background while she lives to a  minimum of 60/45/30 seconds based on level?(not affected by CDR)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rehlazor","date":"2019-01-10T11:05:33.718+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:136}}  This Aurelion Sol (Q) min. stun duration is a HUGE NERF, imagine stunning someone from low range, cause mostly we need that stun ASAP....and they have {{item:3111}} MR boots, which reduces 30% stun duration.

Issue is exacerbated with grevious wounds being so easily accessable.\n* Has very poor itemization. Needs some damage to reliably get people into execute range for his W. Needs Tankiness to survive long enough to (maybe) reach his target. Struggles at accomplishing both. \n* Scaling is all over the place. Ties into previous point. He cannot build AP to take advantage of his AP ratios, otherwise he is dead before he can reach his target. Only usable scaling is on his W. This is easily countered by heals and shields, or simply buying armor since Voli does not scale well with armor pen. \n* Base stats are below average for a juggernaut. \n\nVoli is a champion that often struggles to reach his target. When he does reach his target, he struggles to get off more than a few autos before they dance out of his reach. When they don't dance out of his reach, he struggles to survive thoguh the plenthora of executes, ignites, and burst damage, all of which counter his only form of built-in tankiness.\n\nReducing the delay between ult bounces does very little when **Voli struggles to get autos off in the first place. \n**\n\n**Suggested Buffs**\n\n* CC reduction built somewhere into his kit. Voli is too easy to kite. He would have to be incredibly overbearing once he actually reaches his target in order to counterbalance this. Buff his ability to reach his target, then adjust his damage against squishy targets if he is too reliable at landing the kill.\n\n* Buff his innate tankiness. This can be done in a number of creative ways. Ult autos grant a shield based on the number of bounces, ect. His passive is very underwhelming in its current state. \n\n* Fix his scaling. Voli does not have the luxury of building AP. He also does not have the luxury of building Armor pen to make his only source of scaling, his W, deal significant damage against targets who have built armor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Anivia OTP","date":"2019-01-10T19:35:10.191+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"if we could at least end a game as level 18 then we could think about having more levels.\n\nanyway,\n\nLevel 18+ can be a good idea however there has to be one drawback,\n\ni mean {{champion:77}} would simply be able to get all his spells maxed out.\nbut {{champion:141}}  would make him a very late game monster\n\nin majority, the spell buff cap has made it harder to balance since you often wants to add point in a spell because you use it a lot.\nor it's more \"worth it\"\nwhen playing jayce or ryze i'm not disturbed by the subsequent point i can put after 5 upgrades.\nand often you happen to nerf that particular ability that seems broken , and the build changes (Mordekaiser swapped from max Q to max W)\nand are'nt less viable.\nOn some champion , getting another point is almost completely meaningless ({{champion:136}})\nwhereas on other ({{champion:58}} ) they completely defines the powerspikes.\n\nadding level simply for stats is okay , but be wary, having more point in the game would make it disturbing if available to all champ.\n\nALSO\n\njust like in pokemon , you could have balanced exp gain by changing the needed exp for a champion to reach another level.\nthat could help a LOT for balancing champion you don't want to reach lategame as soon as others.\nbut i guess that's just my pokefan opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Develyn","date":"2019-01-09T22:11:34.336+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meddler, this orb of oblivion nerfs is very concerning.\n\nRight now orb of oblivion is a necessary and early buy for AP jungles ({{champion:60}} {{champion:28}} .
