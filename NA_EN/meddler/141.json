The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png   \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Average games per champion**\r\n\r\nWanted to share some somewhat different data today that looks at, when you encounter a particular champion, how many games on average the person playing that champion will have played on them. This is related to the mastery curves talked about previously, showing how far through a champ&#039;s mastery curve your opponents or team mates will likely be. Figured this would be good to look at in part since common arguments I see are &#039;X champion only has a high win rate because only mains play them&#039; or &#039;Y champion is OP despite a low win rate because most of their play is new people bringing their win rate down&#039;. It&#039;s also a pretty easy to display piece of information, compared to something like mastery curves, so for once we can show all champs easily, rather than just a subset.\r\n\r\nAs you&#039;ll see below the average number of games at the high end and low end can vary radically. That doesn&#039;t necessarily mean equate to &#039;most popular&#039; and &#039;least popular&#039; though. Some champs are popular and have player bases with a lot of average games played (e.g. Yasuo and Lee Sin). Others are pretty niche, but, when you do encounter a player, they&#039;re probably played that champ a lot (e.g. Anivia). At the other end of the spectrum new champs especially have low averages because, well, they&#039;re new, and people haven&#039;t had time to build up as many games yet, even if they&#039;re really popular picks (e.g. Kai&#039;Sa). Some champs also have low averages because people are interested in trying them, but conclude what&#039;s on offer isn&#039;t for them (Ivern&#039;s a good example of this). That&#039;s not to say those champs don&#039;t have mains who&#039;ve gone really deep on them too, just that they represent a smaller proportion of total games played on that champ.\r\n\r\nData below. This is from all MMRs, in all regions.\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/KCtchUZ\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Odyssey**\r\n\r\n\r\nHope you&#039;ve all been enjoying Odyssey! Keep an eye out if so for a dev blog coming next week that will talk about its development, looking at things like the intended feelings to capture, approach to difficulty levels, work in progress augments (some of which didn&#039;t make it) etc. Additionally once the mode&#039;s been out for a while we&#039;ll pick your brains on how various parts of it feel (e.g. augment system, Kayn fight etc), so that if we take another crack at similar PVE in the future we&#039;ll be able to use that feedback to improve things further.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re still having problems with the mission of augment systems, apologies. We&#039;ve addressed a number of problems that cropped up with those, still working on some though. This has been a demonstration that the mission system especially needs to be bulked up somewhat if we&#039;re going to be putting this much weight on it. I expect we&#039;ll continue to do a lot of mission stuff in the future too, so we&#039;ll be investing more time into making that system more robust. Those issues are ones that the PBE can&#039;t catch either unfortunately, given they&#039;re about load on various server functions that PBE doesn&#039;t push the boundaries on enough to reveal problems (nor do some of the smaller regions either incidentally).","replies":[{"poster":"Support 4 Lyfe","date":"2018-09-14T17:43:07.307+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey @Meddler, can you please talk about Zyra {{champion:143}}  and the bugged plant AI not attacking anything when spawned, even in range?  \n\nAlso, can you discuss the plants' hp changes and if they're ever going to be changed/reverted?","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmic Warper","date":"2018-09-14T18:27:00.634+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LaughsInTeemo,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=Jj6ULKw7,comment-id=002f,timestamp=2018-09-14T17:43:07.307+0000)\n>\n> Hey @Meddler, can you please talk about Zyra {{champion:143}}  and the bugged plant AI not attack anything when spawned, even in range?  \n> \n> Also, can you discuss the plants&#x27; hp changes and if they&#x27;re ever going to be changed/reverted?\n\nPLEASE TALK ABOUT THIS.

It was a primary tool to spawn plants out easier compared to the circle one, but with the cost of smaller width and shorter range. \n2. This doesn't affect in lower/average MMR but greatly  in higher MMR, especially mid lane, where enemies can easily predict and dodge her rectangular shape by simply walking a bit backward or toward her. \n\nOld Q shape (circle):\n1. Make Zyra pokes feel more impactful when rooting multiple people, and a better 1v1 dueler in mid lane because of bigger width and a tiny bit higher range compared to rectangular shape. It also feel and sound really really good when you hit it. \n2. Effective for all MMR elo. \n3. Might summon less plants but can easily be solved if add an outer layer to proc the seeds like the current shape. \n\nTo be honest, I never feel good at poking enemies down when the Q got changed to rectangle shape since it doesn't do much damage, easy to dodge, and feel less impact. I promise that reverting the Q shape back to circle is a right direction to satisfy all elo. You can make a vote again, but please keep it to the Zyramains since they are the one who cares about Zyra deeply and her gameplay. We don't want her to feel like a nightmare to play against, but just feel satisfy playing as her and rewarding when landing skillshots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shaian","date":"2018-09-15T09:39:24.059+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just few points i keep it short:\n\n- r/Zyramains did once a survey as well and new Q won. Do you know what the reasoning behind that was? Because people consider the outer Q range as well and think if you move to old Q they would lose that. I was even attacked when I said old Q could have that, too, like „how can you know and say that do you work for Riot?“\n\n- Zyra does not need more plants to be good midlane. When old Zyra had 2 seeds in 34s, new Zyra has 7-8. But, shes worse than before, because she needs plants with quality instead of quantity.\n\n- Zyra mid cant work as long Q is trash. You cant max it first like you used to. Zyra cant put any skillexpression pressuring enemies with Q. I mean its a Malzahar Q with less damage, less range and more given reactiontime for the enemy. And theres still no Malz who maxes Q for anything. He just farms with E and scales. Could work for Zyra too, but she doesnt scale. You did not want Zyras Q to be the same like Syndra Q you said in S6 but thats exaxtly what it needs to be. It makes no sense to have her Q at the right angle of her E. \n\n- Zyras per lvl stats are different from other mages (main issue HP)\n\nYour changes to midlane looked to help her Mid, but at the end she was only more frustrating to play with those plants and lack of scaling. The biggest 2 waves of midlane Zyramains quitting was some time after MYMU S6 and Season 8 plantHP changes. Both made her worse and less satisfying on that role.\n\nIf one says her immobility is her biggest weakness in mid, they probably dont play other Champs at mid. There were Proplayers picking Zyra Mid as counterpicks in Soloq. Huhi would use Zyra as counter to Zoe, PowerofEvil would pick her into Galio successfully for some time. But, the Champ loses all its use because shes not scaling. She gets access to all her power in the first few levels and thats it. With W resets being a thing she has no use skilling her W, her Q has no scaling. Her entire kit is basically E and R after laningphase. Shes balanced around her passive. Thats the biggest issue. If you shift power out of her passive into Q and plants she will be good.\n\nWe could always make her work in some way in the Midlane. But, preseason 8 brought more issues than help for her.\n\nI moved to LB, others to Lux, Velkoz, Ahri, Cass, Karthus and Syndra.","replies":[]},{"poster":"meteorbreaker","date":"2018-09-14T19:21:10.000+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=Jj6ULKw7,comment-id=00360001,timestamp=2018-09-14T19:01:32.012+0000)\n\n> Q shape - We considered doing so earlier this year, based in part of feelings from a few of us here that it might be the right move.

You nerfed her power curve by deleting pen. You nerfed her consistency and late game by gutting plant hp. You nerfed her itemization with the AP item \"buffs\" and effectively deleted her core item. She was better in mid during season 5, 6, and 7 than in season 8 after you \"buffed\" her for mid lane.\n\nIf the needle isn't moving, should you accept it as evidence that plant hp was over-nerfed? Why do you skip past all the other explanations and conclude that mid/supp balance is unsolvable?\n\n> At low/average MMR she does ok already statistically though do see some vocal dissatisfaction from players about her mid lane state on Boards and Reddit certainly.\n\nWhy do you think you see \"some vocal dissatisfaction?\" Maybe because the mid \"buffs\" were a shitshow? Because the hp change being a net nerf was 100% predictable?  Because the \"fix\" to plant health that was allegedly in the works has not materialized **10 fucking months later?**\n\nBut no, let's buff Janna and add more lethality to Duskblade. \n\n> In particular her E as sole defensive tool, but also farming/harass tool, leaves her really vulnerable in mid. \n\nHmmm...if only Q was a functional spell for farming and harass. \n\n> Combine that with things like weaker than most roaming, lack of safety, we'd need to change quite a bit I believe to make her mid competitive with her support play.\n \nAnd yet the playtest team's assessment of the seed refund was that her lane phase was too oppressive. That was used to justify the plant hp nerfs, which made Zyra mid strictly worse into all of her hardest matchups. So which is it? Is she too weak and vulnerable in mid, or is it game-breakingly oppressive to require melee mids to hit plants twice? To recap, she's high-risk in mid lane and has the game duration scaling of an assassin, but she isn't allowed to be a lane bully on par with champs that are equally risky or have a mid-game victory win condition.\n\n**EDIT:** Salt and snark aside, you guys are way too cavalier about changing champs and then not giving a shit when players get left behind. After 4 seasons and ~1200 ranked Zyra games, my Zyra stats this season are worse than my first season of League...when I had never played a MOBA in my life. Worse this season than when I mained her top lane in season 6 and the lethality and ardent metas of season 7. That's not because I'm a worse player now; it's because you're perfectly content to break a champion and not look back.\n\nYour response (if there is one):  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯","replies":[]},{"poster":"CheesecakeRising","date":"2018-09-14T23:43:23.692+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reverting Zyra's Q shape would really help her in mid.

A lot of that is the sheer amount of complexity they add to the playing against experience. They feel really cool IMO because they're such dramatic changes to a champion's normally functionality and can be combined in rather broken ways. That's great in PVE. In PVP it's an enormous amount of extra stuff to remember and play around game to game, when there's already a lot to track. We saw issues with that during Runes Reforged development when we had somewhat more play altering Runes than there currently are. That already felt excessive, changes like the Augment System, fun though it is to use, would be pretty painful.\n\nNow, more PVE with things like the Augment System?

Passive (P): if your passive on 2 sec CD, you use your E it will be ready as any ability reduce passive CD by 2 sec, but once your passive is ready after using E, your passive or next attack will never apply on hit effect ( ex. {{item:3077}} passive).\n\nB. Infernal chains (W): sometimes it does not deal dmg at all.\n\nC. Imperial dash (E): sometimes Aatrox will freeze and stop auto attacking and moving after using it, this is the most annoying bug cuz sometimes you are chasing someone that has 10 hp left and you need that auto, but once you use your E you just freeze.\n\nD. The new bug happened this new patch, where your (Q) will never knock-up on hitting sweet spots, also it never knocks up minions, is that intended? \n\n2- Aatrox improvements that are necessary to make him playable:\n\nA. On patch 8.14 you made this change: While reviving, now locks The Darkin Blade recast timer. \n\nBut what is really happening that if I used my Q2 and my Q2 did no dmg I will back to Q2 instead of having Q3, this is too bad experience to have, because if I gonna use my Q 2 and deal no dmg I would do that to get able to get Q3 because the enemies will get close to me and I need to defend my self with my Q3, So please fix it in order that even if Q2 deals no dmg, I will get my next Q3 after revive, so that I am able to defend myself when enemies are waiting for my revive to end so that they kill me again. \n\nB. after your mini rework on Aatrox on patch 7.5, you took our feedback about how useless Aatrox was after revive, so you come up with these changes on patch 7.6:\nBlood Well \nNEW EFFECT: Is filled to 100% after Aatrox revives.\nBlood Price / Blood Thirst \nREMOVED: Stack counter resetting after Aatrox revives.\nWhy am I bringing this up? here is my answer:\n\nif you play Aatrox in solo/due and assume that you are in laining phase or split pushing, getting dived or outnumbered you will use your ult and eventually you will revive, once you revive where 2-3 enemies around you because eventually, they followed you while you were thinking that since you can move while reviving then you are safe (happens 90% of my games), you end up after reviving with no abilities to help no passive and nothing to do, you just feel useless, exactly what Aatrox was in 7.5\n\nSo how to fix it? here are my solutions:\n1- your passive \"Death bringer stance\" will reset after reviving ( This feels the same solution as when you removed that stack counter reset on old Aatrox W)\n2- if Aatrox received dmg from enemy champs, or dealt dmg to enemy champs during the first 2 seconds after reviving he will refresh the bonus AD buff from his ult 'The world ender\" till he is out of combat (old Aatrox used to keep his additional base dmg/attack speed buff after revive if he took or dealt dmg)\n\nCombining these changes with the Q changes I mentioned will improve the way Aatrox work and will make a better experience playing with him \n\nC. The last thing Aatrox need is base state check: \nThe reason I am mentioning it, because you Meddler used to tell us Aatrox mains at the old Aatrox days (before mini rework) that Aatrox can't have good base stats due to his early game revive, new Aatrox has no early game revive so giving him bad stats is not fair at all, at least make his base stats close to what they were \n\nAatrox base stats nerfs that he received after rework:\n\nAttack speed growth reduced to 2.5% from 3%.\nBase attack damage reduced to 60 from 70.\nArmor growth reduced to 3.25 from 3.8.\nHealth growth reduced to 80 from 85.\nBase health regeneration reduced to 5 from 6.5.\nHealth regeneration growth reduced to 0.25 from 0.5. \n\nI think that his health regen nerf is the most annoying thing right now, he is the only champ that after a team fight I need to base or to go farm jungle to heal up because it takes him years to regenerate his health unlike any other champ in the game, but also I think that you have to revert those base stats nerfs, or at least give us a good reason, your old reason was his revive, now what is your reason when I am against garen and Garen can beat me lvl (1,2,3) without risking anything on his side.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deathfall","date":"2018-09-14T18:04:55.222+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"How are the Karma changes coming along?
