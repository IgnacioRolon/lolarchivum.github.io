Really looking forward to seeing how you folks find it and how it changes our perception of what needs work in 7.10 and beyond.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Usual Disclaimers**\r\n\r\nThese posts will often contain talk about future work we&#039;re doing, or planning to do, that isn&#039;t yet guaranteed to ship. The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**More 7.10 changes**\r\n\r\n7.10 should be hitting the PBE today, and with it some in development work. Since we&#039;ve had to start development on that before mid-season was live it&#039;s more likely than usual that we may need to change direction a bit on some of this stuff. Changes include:\r\n\r\n* Ivern: Lowered movement speed, higher health and mana cost per camp taken. Dude&#039;s just straight too strong\r\n* Rakan: Shifting some power from his E (lower shield strength) to his Q (100 more range) and probably W (bit more damage at present). Looking to ensure his play&#039;s not too dominated by just ally shielding. Probably power neutral overall.\r\n* Rumble: Shifting some damage from Q to Overheat auto attacks, with the goal of making his laning a bit more interactive (Overheat autos require him to draw minion agro). Also aiming for power neutral, but with better game health.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**PSA on Rift Herald**\r\n\r\nOne thing I&#039;d suggest watching out for with the new Rift Herald that goes out tomorrow is that the channel to summon it is interruptible. Hadn&#039;t thought about that myself much until yesterday when during a playtest I tried summoning it just as a teamfight was starting to break out for a bit of extra pressure and someone promptly CC&#039;d me, stopping the channel which also consumes the item. Recommend learning from my mistake on that one and either hanging back a bit when summoning or taking advantage of opponents trying to do so too far fowards.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Mid Season Spotlight**\r\n\r\nI&#039;d imagine most of you have already seen it, for those that haven&#039;t a Mid Season spotlight went out yesterday though. Worth a look, and also at the end includes a brief glance (super brief) at one of the screens from the 5 ban system for ranked/draft that&#039;s being worked on right now.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fl2Wg5rkew\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**ARAM Followup**\r\n\r\n7.8 contained some adjustments to ARAM. We&#039;ve been analyzing how those have gone and will probably be doing a bit of further followup work, hopefully in 7.10. Details to follow.","replies":[{"poster":"pulledchicken","date":"2017-05-02T15:53:16.784+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":49,"body":"> 7.8 contained some adjustments to ARAM.

I mean, sure Rumble isn't exactly the epitome of healthy gameplay, but the reason why majority of Rumble players prefer to just spam Q from range is because trying to actually make use of Rumble autoattacks nowadays is a suicide (compare Rumble's autoattacks to {{champion:157}}, {{champion:164}}, {{champion:58}} or {{champion:105}}) . \n\nIn a world where every single champion in the top lane has really good trading ability and both miles better autoattack animations on top of having really responsive animation cancels, if you cut down Rumble's Q damage he'll just get piledrived by any top laner. I'm not taking into consideration just the Q nerf here, I mean, given that Rumble has already been immensly weakened by all the changes, I mean, Season 6 and latest changes still left a ton of scars on Rumble ({{item:3156}} completely shuts down Rumble no matter how ahead he is, Rumble doesn't benefit from Keystones as much as other champions, {{item:3107}} and {{item:3190}} basically make you question why the hell did you pick Rumble if a ~2400 gold item migitates your entire ultimate).\n\nAnd now with the mid season update, we'll have much more ways to not let Rumble player have any satisfaction of playing Rumble (Adaptive Helm comes to mind most notably), on top of tanks getting more popualrity and from what we could have seen, majority of these tanks will still indeed have a really significant damage. By nerfing Rumble's most important damage source and shifting it to the most unreliable and the worst feeling to use part of his kit, what exactly do you want to accomplish? It should be pretty obvious that due to Rumble autoattacks just feeling outright ***SHIT***. The wind-ups are way too long, the attack command seems unresponsive, when the animation finally finishes it doesn't even feel like Rumble even completed it in the first place, let alone did anything meaningful, even ***with*** the Overheat bonus. \n\nSo with all these unfavorable odds against Rumble, please, if you are going to go this direction, I believe it's finally time Rumble autoattack animation stop being so awful.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-05-02T19:58:45.632+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're planning on looking at Rumble's AAs at some point.

Why....ok this is my opinion. You can lower the base value late game but why not increase the range of the shield more.  I have been playing Rakan and when I dont have a Xayah adc i really am crippled cause my adc sometimes just a little bit out of range and I lose a lot of health after using my grand entrance. \n\nSomething else you can consider. lower the base shield, revert the W damage back to how it is on live and instead give the W a new effect. Damage reduction just test it out. When Grand Entrance is used Rakan gains um [[#]] damage reduction for 2 seconds. In team fight i get popped so easy when i W in and ult...the damage reduction can help him be less squishy when he dives in. I hope my idea is considered or listened to at least. Rakan is squishy and increase damage doesnt solve his issue. Giving some damage reduction or even bonus armor and magic resist in his W or Ult for 2-3 sec can really help him out.","replies":[]}]}
