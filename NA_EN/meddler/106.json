The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**Game Modes and Events**\r\n\r\nWe've had fewer temporary modes available this year due to our focus on other work, TFT especially. We do want to get back to offering new or variant game modes more often though in the future, especially when there's a larger event happening. We're still figuring out details of how we'll approach that, wanted to mention that this was on our minds however. We agree with feedback that events are a lot better when there's something different to play in them in addition to missions, new cosmetics, etc. \r\n\r\nLooking at how past modes have performed we've generally seen that players tend to play the most in modes that are fun variations on existing gameplay (e.g. One for All, ARURF, the ARAM events, Hexakill etc are SR/ARAM with a twist). It's likely we'll mainly be exploring options like that as a result. Modes that deviate significantly more from base LoL (e.g. Project: Overcharge or Dark Star) do generate a lot of initial excitement. Their play rate then plummets extremely quickly though. We’d rather spend time working on things players will enjoy for longer, hence that choice of focus.\r\n\r\nIn terms of timeframe that approach is going to be reflected next year in particular. Sometime in the remainder of this year we should have ARURF back at some point. Hoping to also get something else out there, though still discussing what's feasible and for when. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**Ranked Regalia/Borders from TFT**\r\n\r\nShort note on these for anyone wondering. Right now we're using the regular LoL ranked art (borders, regalia etc) since that's what we had available for TFT launch. Longer term our plan is to make some TFT specific art to both better match the tone of the mode and make it clearer where someone earned a particular rating. We think it’s good for regalia etc to be displayed in a variety of contexts for people looking to display their accomplishments. Should also be clear though what exactly is being represented and shared art makes that somewhat unclear at present. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**Some context on the next few patches**\r\n\r\n9.17 \r\nChanges are locked at this point and we've ended up pulling Aatrox and Akali from the patch. \r\n\r\n9.18\r\nPlan is to take another pass at Akali and Aatrox. Rather than just stats nerfs we'll be investigating small mechanics changes that are solo queue positive/pro negative if possible. \r\nWe’ll also have some Teemo quality of life (ish) stuff likely in 9.18 too. \r\nLikely to be a fairly small patch overall, given focus on preseason and desire to keep things stable. \r\n\r\n9.19 \r\nIs the patch Worlds will be played on so will also be fairly small on the SR side. Will have some balance changes in it based off whatever’s needed at the time, not planning anything beyond reactive balance work for it though.\r\n\r\n9.20+\r\nHere we'll shift focus more towards a mixture of solo queue driven work. Shaco and Garen work potentially land in or around 9.20 for example. \r\nThe SR team will also be spending a lot of their time getting preseason changes ready.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------        \r\n**Preseason: Potential Edge of Night change**\r\n\r\nSpeaking of preseason we're looking at updating at least a few items in preseason. One case that's been testing well so far is Edge of Night. Current plan is to change the spellshield on it to a Banshee's Veil one (refreshes every X seconds while out of combat instead of having it come from a channeled active. For those of who you use EoN regularly, or have in the past, would love to get your thoughts on how you'd feel about such a change? \r\n\r\n \r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Amaterasu65","date":"2019-08-23T16:40:00.983+0000","up_votes":68,"down_votes":3,"body":"A lot of players loved the PvE modes you brought to us.

As someone who plays mostly tanks (and tends to build anyone who isn’t a tank as a tank anyway) I find the current setup of spirit visage for healing, adaptive helm for well, adaptive helm situations, abyssal for damage amp and mana, and wits end for an offensive option to be pretty solid. Sure there isn't as much diversity in options as there is for armor, but it still works pretty well, so I am curious as to what you’re seeing there.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2019-08-23T17:11:12.982+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just believe that especially adaptive is so situational that building it in sub-par situations is beyond terrible since its stats and build path is very weak.

Assassins are some of the most slippery champions in the game with built in mechanics of getting in and getting out, one of their main weaknesses is Hard CC, most assassins will die if they get hard CC. But now lets imagine you give them this change, instead of having to choose and think about when they should use it they can just have it all the time, champions like talon, zed, yasuo, shaco, who are already hard to pin down, can now have a shield all the time that you have to first use a spell first to break then have another spell to hard CC them, and lets not forget they already have one item to get out of hard CC QSS, if they had both it would be nearly impossible to catch them. \n\nAnd assassins aren't the only ones who would might abuse this, imagine an ADC or AD jungler with this on, unless the out of combat is like 20 sec it wouldn't take that long for just sit and wait for a free spell shield to come back, now stack that on top of Morgans black shield, QSS, Sivir spell shield, or any AD champion with a dash or CC removing ability, it would be a nightmare. {{champion:56}} (thats another thing, nocturnes E is also a spell shield) \n\nThe current Edge of night offers a lot and its lasts 7 sec to get in and fight which is a long time for certain fights, and it gives the enemy away to combat it by waiting it out. Its strong but has counter such as assassins needing to time it right and enemies can wait out the shield. But if you make an assassin item have a permanent free spell shield on all the time, that removes a lot of counter and just stacks on to the options assassins already have in ways of getting in and removes ways for enemies to fight back. So this change is bad and i think if it was pushed would lead to nothing but frustration in trying to fight assassins or any AD champion who can take advantage of this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jabalor","date":"2019-08-23T16:37:26.212+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"What about PVE modes like Odyssey: Extraction?","replies":[]},{"poster":"PkMange","date":"2019-08-23T16:49:33.442+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you're at it, could you also make Banshee's spellshield look the same as EoN's?

What I mean with that is that her Spells don't line up well and don't really match together, as most other champions' spells do. Especially for a burst mage that becomes a major problem.\n\nExamples of these anti snyergies are:\n\n* her spells' ranges don't match eachother in any way. \n\nE's range is higher than Q's range, which means you have to walk up after rooting someone. R's range is lower than Q's range, wich means you have to walk AGAIN to do your fullcombo. And W? It's somewhere inbetween, higher than Q but not as high as E and that doesn't make any god damn sense. Especially simce she has to stop and stand still for every spell, unlike for example Syndra.\n\n* her spells' shapes are a mess. \n\nE being a line but Q being a rectangle is really anti-synergetic because you can't hit two people with Q if you rooted them with your E. And that's just bad and unfair. Not to mention that it defeats the purpose of AoE - Mage.\n\n* Zyra's base stats are really strange. \n\nHealth and armor start off pretty high, but they scale really badly. At level 18 she has amongst the lowest health pools and armor values of all mages, even being \"outtanked\" by higher ranged champs like Xerath, Ziggs and Heimerdinger. And that's strange because it should be actually the other way around. Zyra's early, as we all know, can be really oppressive because Plants are a real threat. However, given how badly they scale and how fast they die, they don't pose much threat to bruisers or tanks in the late game. Making her much easier to kill in the later stages, especially since her actual spell ranges aren't even that high and she basically has to be inside of enemies to set a good R. That's why a lower base HP and armor, but a higher growth would make a lot more sense.\n\n* Zyra's level-scaling basically stops at level 13.\n\nThe only thing that Zyra gains from level 13 onwards is a really, REALLY low amount of plant damage and a few seconds off of W CD. And that's almost nothing. Which means the only \"scaling\" she has at that point comes from items. But oh wait, her item scaling is bad aswell, since she doesn't have major AP scalings. While other mages and support are still gaining shieldstrength, damage, healing, attackspeed and other stuff from level 13 onwards, Zyra is left behind and falls off. In all instances. The R buff can possibly change that a little bit, because the new cooldown on rank 3 is pretty nice actually. But her scaling is still... pretty bad. And by that I mean exp AND gold scaling. \n\nSorry for the rant, but I really love(d) Zyra and it honestly makes me sad to see the state she is in. It's not like she is bad. But she is in such a weird spot that her winrate is just so stable because her early game is super oppressive and her late game non-existant. Of course I know that not every champ can scale the same, we need early strong and weak leate kinda champs. But to my mind Zyra's case is just unreasonable.\n\nA smoother scaling and a smoother powercurve could make her, once again, more interesting for high elo. It could prevent her from being too oppressive on support while also making sure that she is not useless in late game or when she falls behind. AND it could/would make her midlane a lot more viable because the exp and gold ressources that she gathers are no longer wasted.","replies":[{"poster":"hpp3","date":"2019-08-24T06:29:33.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> her spells' ranges don't match eachother in any way.\n> E's range is higher than Q's range, which means you have to walk up after rooting someone.

Especially simce she has to stop and stand still for every spell, unlike for example Syndra.\n\nGoing to have to disagree with you here. I know the issue you're talking about regarding different spell ranges (Syndra...) but Zyra really doesn't have that issue. Her E is 1100 range, but it's pretty much impossible to actually hit a max range E. In practice, you almost always end up fighting at around 800 range, which allows you to hit all your spells while still staying out of targeted gapcloser and auto range. Even if you do hit a max range snare, you can immediately follow up with ult (and no, you never have to walk to use your ult because it has a radius of 500; just cast it at its max range). You have all the time in the world to walk up and land your Q after you get off that CC chain. Her combos being so smooth are part of why I love this champion.\n\nThe rest of your grievances are true but are just minor distractions compared to the most critically important problem with Zyra right now: PLANT HP","replies":[{"poster":"FeatherPaw","date":"2019-08-24T10:48:38.290+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's a pretty shitty logic. \"You never hit E on max range anyway so it doesn't matter wether the spell ranges don't allign\" is pretty bullshit, sorry for my vulgar language. \n\nHitting Zyra E on max range isn't that uncommon, it's almost as fast as Lux' Q (1200 misslespeed vs 1150). Just that Lux can inmediately follow up on her Q with E and R. \n\nSyndra has the same range difference between her spells as Zyra, her Stun can have an above 1000 range, her W has a 950 range, her Q 800 amd her R 675. However, she can cast her seplls while walking, means she loses no time while she walks in closer to follow up on her stun.\n\nZyra does. When she hits a root on max range, which definitely isn't as uncommon as you make it sound, she has to walk closer into Q range, stop to cast it, walk closer again for R and stop to cast it again. And given how delayed her spells are, that's just really bad. You lose time. Time in which your enemies are CC'ed. Time that you would actually want to use to secure the knock up of your R (max E root is 2 seconds, R knocks up after 2 seconds). However, because you have to walk up TWICE you aren't guaranteed to hit.\n\n Unless you place your R slightly in front of them instead of durectly under them. As you said, it has a big radius. However, that's kinda bad too. On this way you delay the damage and also shorten their way out of the R, because they are not in the center but at the rim of it. Zyra's spells don't allign. At any point. \n\nThey only \"fit together\" when the enemies are pretty close to you. And that on a squishy mage with no defense or mobility and no disableing hard CC.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Smeagiul","date":"2019-08-23T16:44:02.455+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"8 months later and still no changes to the support role or any sort of discussions","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-08-23T17:19:10.007+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"There'll be some support stuff in preseason, highly likely including changes to support gold gen items to address some issues those create.

Here is why:\n\nAs a mage, you are usually the target for the enemy team so they will be trying to catch you off guard and pick you off.  This is where the banshee's veil comes in.  It's shield (assuming not on cooldown) is always up, ready to save you from any unexpected attempt by the enemy team to catch you out. \nAs a champion that builds edge of night, (usually assassins) you are going to be the one that is proactively making the plays and deciding when you want to strike.
