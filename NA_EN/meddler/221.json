The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Some things we&#039;ve been trying on Karma**\r\n\r\nFor anyone that missed it Neurocat posted a piece on the NA dev corner earlier this week talking through some of the changes we&#039;ve been trying for Karma. We wanted to see if the clothesline gameplay that Karma used to have years ago (tether to an ally, then hit enemies with the tether to CC them) could potentially be brought back. It was really distinct and could be pretty cool to play with. Conclusion we came to was that, unfortunately, while it&#039;s a cool sort of spell, it doesn&#039;t fit with a squishy caster who wants to be at a distance from he enemy team. Would be a good skill to put on someone who goes into the enemy team more (e.g. diving fighter or initiating tank) and we&#039;ll keep an eye out for a fit somewhere on a new or updated kit. Run through on the different major versions we tried below.\r\n\r\nLonger version:\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/KaRmzNlN-clothesline-karma-mini-retrospective\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n\r\n**Ranked Skin reward if you don&#039;t own the champ in question**\r\n\r\nSince it&#039;s the time of year this question crops up a fair bit: If you don&#039;t own the champion that gets a Victorious skin, but you do qualify for the skin by being Gold+ in ranked, then you&#039;ll get given both the skin and the champion themselves. So, for example, last year, if you were Gold at the end of the ranked season, but didn&#039;t own Graves, you were given both Graves and Victorious Graves.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Some context on 8.20 balance changes**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re still more focused on preseason than the next couple of patches. 8.20 will have some balance work in it though. Thoughts on changes on the PBE, or probably on it soon, below. As usual some of this stuff will likely change as it gets tested.\r\n\r\nNerfs:\r\n\r\n* DH - Too strong early for a scaling rune. Looking at cutting early base damage as a result, Electrocute should have a longer period where it&#039;s the stronger pick. Also seeing it put out a bit much ranged harass for low risk early too, possibly ranged and melee values get adjusted differently. Scaling will likely remain the same.\r\n* Ahri - Rank 1 and 2 ult CD up, reducing her ability to snowball early and general safety. Same ult CD at max rank.\r\n* Graves - Looking at his AA AD ratio, with thinking being his scaling doesn&#039;t need to be as good as it currently is given he&#039;s strong early. Not concerned about nerfing him and Dark Harvest in the same patch given his performance with other keystones is also strong.\r\n* Nami - Currently looking at the degree to which her healing later in the laning phase can be pretty dominant, having a chilling effect on interaction. Testing a lower heal rank up on the W as a result (damage unchanged)\r\n* Sion - His recent W buff to permanent HP gained effectively also increased his regen, given the extra health acquired adds to current health as well as max. Likely cutting his HP5 down a bit to compensate (goal was to buff his HP stacking, not his laning sustainability)\r\n* Evelynn - Looking at reducing her ability to kill squishies without using her charm when she isn&#039;t pretty fed. Possible target as a result is R base damage. As with Graves not worried about hitting her and DH at the same time, given she also does well with other keystones.  \r\n* Jhin - His best builds at present are both the fastest and some of the hardest hitting. Looking at a lower AS to damage ratio as a result, with some compensation elsewhere to make it so there&#039;s more of a trade off between mobility and damage. \r\n\r\nBuff:\r\n\r\n* Corki - Aiming to get some changes in to help him out, though moderately likely those take a bit longer and end up in 8.21 instead. Possible directions we&#039;ll test include buffs to the Package and to his ult, though unlikely we do both at the same time.\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Rouge","date":"2018-10-03T15:53:01.590+0000","up_votes":73,"down_votes":15,"body":"Context on not nerfing {{champion:84}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:412}} for 8.20?\nThey're all bonkers in soloq (most of them are also broken P/B or very good in competitive in 8.19, so that's a big hint).\n\nEdit: Also pretty sad that you didn't nerf/further nerf {{champion:84}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:12}} even though you knew they were probably going to be problematic in pro play.

I just don't understand why you've been so heavyhanded with enchanter balance when they aren't the champions that have been causing distortions in the game. The meta is always Alistar Braum with some special guests unless you miss the mark olympically on item balance (Ardent Censer, Redemption).\n\nSpeaking of ratios, a few weeks ago you guys talked about preserving and encouraging off-meta builds. On the subject of Corki, every time you introduced nerfs in the past you unduly nerfed AP ratios, in fact nerfed the AP ratios more than you did AD ones for some unfathomable reason. AP Corki had a distinct playstyle to AD Corki that you guys all but killed with balance passes. Is it possible Corki gets the Shyvana treatment from a few patches ago? Corki's overnerfed ratios are, for example, the reason why he can't itemize for magic penetration he would benefit from, and his abilities unfairly scale much harder with AD than AP (package in particular is obscene, but also true of Q and R) considering AD contributes to auto damage that AP Corki doesn't get to tap into. This was a fun playstyle that was stifled and is sorely missed.","replies":[{"poster":"Support 4 Lyfe","date":"2018-10-03T17:35:00.708+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"I agree with this so much, not only is Nami's W the most mana-expensive (non-ult) ability in the game, its heal also scales very poorly, with a measly 35% ap ratio, I mean she already struggle pretty hard early game with mana management and how high of a cooldown W has before cdr.  \n\nAlso, it's not one of those spells that you can spam in lane, it has a really high, static cooldown compared to every other poke ability (Lux's E, Brand's W, Sona's Q, Soraka's Q) and the high mana cost makes it impossible to spam in lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bogdan1945","date":"2018-10-03T17:10:33.367+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"They should've increased W mana cost and increase regen a bit","replies":[{"poster":"OtterlyLost","date":"2018-10-03T17:36:59.793+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"They should not increase the W mana cost.

She's a bad champ. She isn't good, everyone around her got nerfed and she's left. Can't wait to hear LS complain about this one, it's Quinn 2.0. The frothing masses cherrypicking winrates and negligble changes really have no business commenting, they can't see the big picture.\n\nQ cooldown buff didn't matter. You aren't using Q off cooldown. It exists purely as a tool to zone ADCs away from cannon minions, outside of Jhin W. So much about Nami's kit goes from terrible to great in the presence of Jhin, which is odd because he's a much newer champ.\n\nYou did a great job explaining why W isn't spammable. Most of her utility is based on following up on Jhin poke, or enhance short trades from aggressive early laners. Outside of short trades where it can bounce, you're getting next to no value for the mana, which is - like Q's delay and size - balanced around your opponents screwing up rather than you doing well.\n\nNami's only proactive ability is Tidecaller's Blessing. Depending on how much damage the buffed target takes back, and whether they got 3 autoattacks off, it's arguably worse than Janna or Lulu's respective abilities. Again, Jhin's ammo system makes this WAY better on him. Frankly, I'd rather have Rakan or Soraka CCing them with E than a bit of extra damage, but I'm no ADC main, I just like the consistency CC provides over some extra damage.\n\nAnd that's really the problem, when you compare Nami to other supports. What ADC besides Jhin wouldn't rather double down on Q's utility and have a catcher, or pass on Q and have a real enchanter like Soraka, Lulu, or Janna? What _IS_ Nami's strategic niche? Jhin's slave? A fallback when other Enchanters get nerfed around her? That's not a niche, that's a design flaw.\n\nRiot once sent me a survey asking if I would buy the SKT Nami skin.

On top of this there seems to be a weird minion aggro bug with Zyra's AAs, she can AA a minion while her wave and an enemy wave are attacking each other and momentarily draw minion aggro to her for ~1s before, 99% sure that's not intended either.\n\nAnd rank 4 and 5 E doesn't apply a high priority mark so plants do not attack E'd targets (instead either continuing attacking the previous mark or the nearest target to the plants). Ranks 1-3 work fine.\n\n2 of these bugs (aggro and targeting) have been in the game for months (?) now.

Wanted to share a bit of context as to why since I see them getting asked about a fair bit still. At time of mention our assessment was Rek'Sai was underperforming across the board, so we had room to add some straight power to her. Looking into things a bit deeper though we realized she was performing quite well at higher MMR already and that straight buffs would be inappropriate. She does have a fairly steep learning curve, and underperforms at low/average MMR though, so will feel weak to quite a lot of players. **Would like to do some work to smooth out her early accessibility a bit as a result**, that's a much larger task though than just adding power so it didn't fit within the time we had allocated. Expect we'll come back to her at some point, not sure on when though._\n\nI almost died of shame to think it was my imagination.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"InTheory","date":"2018-10-03T15:41:07.058+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":26,"body":"I said it before and I say it again: The day you decide to nerf Nami officially shows how insane the balance team is. The fact that players actually asked for nerfs to Nami because they were reading a Number > 50% is a confession of failure on players’ side as well. That Nami evolved a high winrate is caused by a bunch of factors:\n\n>- nerfs to enchanters on a global level (cutting heal & shield power) did not affect her as much\n\n>- nerfs to shield enchanters (shield durations, decay) did not affect her at all\n\n>-  nerfs to enchanters on an individual level when they provided too much peel for their marksmen without bringing anything else to the table did not affect her of course\n\n>- nerfs to supports that were pick/ban in LC$ (Tahm Kench, Braum, Rakan, Shen) did not affect her\n\n>- nerfs to support itemization resulting in one less health pot at the beginning of the game did not affect her as much\n\nResult: The competition around Nami on the support position has systematically been nerfed to a point where supports are slaves again. All the points that I mentioned that are nerfs to the support position but still favors Nami because she is most likely to play against an opponent that suffered way more from any sort of nerfs before. Asking to nerf Nami is asking to further nerf the support position. You want to be autofilled even more into the support position? Go ahead and ask for further support nerfs. \n\n---\n\nNami has always been top tier in terms of\n\n- Gameplay Design: She’s no stupid heal/shield bot but is really fun to play. The player can actually decide to play passively or aggressively depending on circumstances and how lane plays out early without being dictated one playstyle by the “balance” team. \n\n- Fairness: Even though she has an over average high winrate she remains a super low ban rate. Players always liked to play against a Nami and even do so when she’s that strong compared to her direct competitors. \n\n- Balance: Nami barely ever found her way into patch notes outside of a) bug fixes or b) general stat changes that affected a whole bunch of champions at the same time anyway. Even the last real buff was surprising and unnecessary but the “balance” team went through with it anyway for reasons. \n\nI asked several times that if they’d ever think about nerfing Nami they should just revert her Q buff. She was balanced before that change, rather balanced even afterwards. Now they go again with some experimental changes because that has always worked out as we all know.\n\n---\n\nTaking a look at top supports in diamond plus via leagueofgraphs.com shows that the top supports are all focused on either poke-damage or all-in damage. Nami with her strength to heal up poke damage especially in a situation where she can get the double bounce and her strength to counter all-ins if played properly put her on top of the current meta. All that is not because her numbers are good but because her gameplay favors the meta and everything that could do the same job is basically nerfed to the ground. Asking to nerf Nami because of that is basically asking \n\n#PLEASE RIOT WE NEED MORE DAMAGE ORIENTED SUPPORTS PLEASE ADD MORE DAMAGE TO THE GAME.\n\nIf you ask me you should ~~fire~~ move whoever came up with that nerf to a different area in the company like the cafeteria. But make sure to not let them pile food because they don’t really know how to balance things properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Alter","date":"2018-10-03T19:17:28.228+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Athene's buff made her even better compared to the other enchanters since she could make really good use of it even early on.

She was a caster-naut, and her rework and subsequent balance changes kept removing that.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-10-03T16:22:21.897+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah, I'd agree old, old Karma (pre 2013) went deeper into fights, though even then not as deep as some champs. One of the issues we run into here is that the majority of people playing Karma at this point never played that original version of Karma. If we're making changes using that as guideline of what's desired we're then serving a small subset of the Karma player base ignoring feedback from a lot of others. Reverts on things like that can work a lot better when the change was more recent by contrast and the majority of the engaged audience have experience with the older version.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2018-10-03T15:46:04.180+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey Meddler, a few questions regarding Karma's update:\n\n1.

One could say it's high risk high reward, but the risk is too high because Ziggs simply dies if he gets in AA range, especially late game. \nPLEASE think about giving it like 100 additional range so he can finally compete with outperforming Champs like Syndra and Orianna.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AgentAl21","date":"2018-10-03T16:25:21.869+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there,any potential changes to {{champion:37}}  gameplay,visual or lorewise planned ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2018-10-03T15:40:38.422+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hoping the corki buffs help him out well. \nHis last set of buffs were actually kinda big and he is still OK in winrate and not played much.\n\nEven though I feel Corki is just one of those champs that isnt played in solo Q regardless of being OP or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-10-03T15:45:47.445+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, putting power out of the equation, he's a champ you'd expect to get less play than many, given his theme's a more niche one and his art/VO are older.
