The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n\r\n\r\n**Clash**\r\n\r\nWe've now run tests of the new Clash system in Turkey, Latam South and, just this last weekend, NA. They've gone really well overall.  In the NA test we did see some significant lag spikes in a few games, digging into it those were caused by some new server hardware that needed to be configured slightly differently than the existing hardware. We've corrected that so, fingers crossed, shouldn't be seeing that issue again.\r\n\r\nLooking to the future we'll have some more details about next tests in other regions in an Ask Riot post next week. Assuming those go well we'll then be looking at a global beta in every region.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------         \r\n**Teemo changes in 9.18**\r\n\r\nWe've got some Teemo changes coming in 9.18. They're based in part off some of the larger Teemo work we explored earlier in the year. Focus here however is more on useability/clarity and fixing some points of unneeded frustration, rather than attempting to reshape his strengths and weaknesses a bit as well. Details:\r\n\r\n Q \r\n\r\n* Blinded enemies now have a light green tint on their screen to make it clearer they're blinded\r\n\r\nW \r\n\r\n*  Now has a clearer timer for remaining duration of the buff\r\n\r\nR \r\n\r\n* Shrooms now check for nearby enemies more frequently. They should feel a bit more responsive in general. Also ensures enemies moving really quickly can't pass through some of their area without triggering them.\r\n* Shrooms no longer detonate on Scuttlecrabs who aren't in combat. Makes keeping shrooms in the river much more practical.\r\n* Shrooms can bounce off other shrooms multiple times, letting you deploy them a bit further away in some circumstances.\r\n* Max ammo's now 3/4/5, increasing late game relevance a bit\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------        \r\n**Initial thoughts on 9.17 balance**\r\n\r\nEarly days, a few initial thoughts though:\r\n\r\n* Panth seems to be performing pretty solidly now post buffs. No plans to add further power to him right now as a result, keeping an eye too to make sure we haven't now made him too strong.\r\n* Ryze currently seems to be doing quite well in solo queue, especially compared to his historical average. Feeling really glad we went with only one of the buffs we were testing during 9.17 development as a result.\r\n* Aurelion Sol and Kayle are both looking a bit weaker statistically. Both have had moderate changes to how they're optimized though and are getting a lot more play than previously. Giving them some time to settle as a result. Wouldn't be at all surprised if they're stronger on 9.17 than before even if it takes a bit more time for that to become really clear.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------        \r\n**TFT AI bugs**\r\n\r\nWe fixed some TFT AI bugs in 9.17 that should address at least a fair number of cases of units freezing up in the middle of combat. We're still looking into some other possible issues, including around melee unit pathing. If you're still seeing units freeze feedback/details much appreciated, getting those issues addressed is one of our priorities for TFT. \r\n\r\n \r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2019-08-30T14:37:00.934+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":5,"body":"Are there any plans to revisit Karma's gameplay update at some point?","replies":[{"poster":"ARE YOU PC BRO","date":"2019-08-30T16:14:10.956+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IxtaliKing,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=Inh8Ut1d,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-08-30T14:37:00.934+0000)\n>\n> Are there any plans to revisit Karma's gameplay update at some point?\n\nTHIS ^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jenivie","date":"2019-09-01T22:52:03.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly I just want a new passive, a shield animation, and for her model to reflect how she looks in the awaken cinematic.

Much appreciated. :)\n\nNow to my 2 cents:\n\n(I feel like P and E are by far the most boring and least essential parts to Shaco and are the 2 spells that should be changed if he were to get a rework some day. But if we are sticking with the current kit:)\n\n\nQ - In my opinion Q really doesn't need base damage at all. The utility it provides is plenty and pretty much guaranties an AA as long as it's duration is long enough. And since you want Deceive to benefit from the passive, how about you make it multiply the Backstab, when proc'd from stealth (for example 1/1.5/2/2.5/3 x P)? And in return we get the flat 3,5 stealth duration.\n\n\nE - Just make the spell deal more useful than an auto-hit. xD Also, if Q doesn't have enough level incentive, the passive slow could be moved to Q.\n\n\nR - I heard rumors you wanted to let him control the Clone explosion. Since E is point and click, couldn't we use that to proc the clone explosion, maybe with an alternative range, similar to Rakan's Battle Dance? So as Shaco you can Backstab your clone with the E instead of the opponent to trigger the explosion?\n\nAnyway, thanks for listening and have a nice day. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sesshőmaru","date":"2019-08-30T15:32:07.585+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hi,\nI am a {{champion:35}}  main with over 1.2 million points on him and it looks good, except of the boxes on his R getting not removed and I think they should get removed because a assassin should not have a high utitlity and burst dmg combined.

Back to when Top/Midlane had the highest lvl and Toplane mostly always having 1-4 lvls above every other laner depending how well they farmed or sometimes just by default. Such as Top having 2 lvls on Botlane way back in season 4-7. But I don't know when it got changed but now even Supports can have the same lvl as a Toplaner and that brings in 1 Problem, they can be as tanky as they are at that moment and ontop of that the Toplane Tank itself isn't tanky enough to handle a laneswap or a Botlane that snowballed. \n\nWhich is why everyone get's one shot in a span of 5 seconds these days. since when Does Nautilus look so squishy? even when he was in toplane he Q's in then dies instantly.\nI can have 300+ Armor as Ornn but due to the ADC being the same lvl as me, His dmg is enough to just melt me instantly and I can only use 1 rotation of spells before I'm a goner.\n\nMy Point is that Champ stats need a rework, atleast The Melee to Juggernaut to Tank ones. to where they actually gain a lot of HP per lvl or more Armor.\nAn example is like this: Not certain how much a basic Tank is gaining these days but this is just a sample.\nMelee: 50 HP per lvl , Juggernauts/immobile Melee's like Olaf: 75, Tanks: 100\n\nSo the equivalent of it is 1.0 > 1.5 > 2.0 and every other Champion has values below that to show that they are suppose to be squishier and even if they're items are heavy in HP like Morrello's and Liandry making LB's have 3k HP these days, atleast a Swain which is Mage that should have the HP stats of a Juggernaut or Melee, so he would be atleast be around 4k HP compared to the LB's and other Mages stats. \n\nThis would also move the meta away a bit from Crit heavy to Bork and On-Hits a again bringing more Variety to the adc pool, Vayne is always decent, but we'll see more Twitch/Kog/Ashe I guess.\n\nAlso How's the item shop rework going? Plz tell me you're optimizing item builds and making something like:\n{{item:2053}} +{{item:1011}} ={{item:3742}} \n{{item:3512}} +{{item:3056}} = New Item called Who knows what since I heard both are being removed and remade into one item:\nEvery  big Voidling Spawn from the Portal will Disable The Tower for X Seconds scaling off of Champion lvl.\nRot Portal's HP scales with it's user's HP, Armor and MR. (Spells can be used on it)\nVoidling Spawnrate scales with HP, Spawnrate is increased by 0.5x /50% per 500HP.\nVoidling Dmg scales with Champion lvl\nVoidling distance scales with AP \n\nPlz tell me Atma's  {{item:3005}} is coming back in pre-season and Will have a HP component like Jaurim fist or Kindlegem since it's HP based. and Will Cowl {{item:3211}} be buffed since it's price is pretty high but shitty effectiveness these days...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slachhh","date":"2019-08-30T15:47:44.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler,\n\nI have a suggestion that problably the whole LoL community will like.
