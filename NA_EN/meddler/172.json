We should have an overview of the mid-season gameplay changes coming out later today, with a bunch of additional details to follow Tuesday next week. \r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Non mid-season stuff in 7.9**\r\n\r\nWe won&#039;t be doing much in the way of regular balance changes in 7.9, given the mid-season changes will shift a lot of balance issues around anyway. We are still putting time where possible into looking at some issues we think we&#039;ll want to return to after the mid-season regardless though. Those include an assessment of Gunblade&#039;s status, looking at getting Malz back to solo laning effectively and further exploration into possible Heimer changes (small ish in scope, wouldn&#039;t want to ship them unless we felt we could give him both better counterplay overall and more power overall).\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Unanimous Surrender at 15 minutes**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ll be getting back to looking at/talking about the status of the test in Oceania soon after mid-season. Bunch of thoughts on how it went and what we should or shouldn&#039;t do next then.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Rek&#039;Sai**\r\n\r\nSpeaking of post mid-season things we&#039;re finally in a place where we&#039;ve got some of the needed art time to work on Rek&#039;Sai&#039;s mini update. Apologies for the delay on this one since we first mentioned it, in retrospect it&#039;s a case where we might want to have waited until the schedule was a bit more locked down before talking about its progress.","replies":[{"poster":"Fenikkuro","date":"2017-04-14T16:44:40.336+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are your thoughts on the state of the jungle?  I feel like this season has been really rough for Junglers.  At first we were the strongest role, probably much too strong, and it the role overall was nerfed, but I feel like in the course of a month or so, Junglers went from one of the stronger roles, to almost the weakest, aside from probably supports.  It's so ridiculously hard to keep up with XP unless you steal farm from lanes, or find a side lane to farm.  Usually I'm the same level as an ADC which seems wrong to me.  And before the response is that I'm low elo and no idea what I'm doing, the same is being said by higher elo players who know far more about the game than I do.  If at any point in the game you fall behind as a jungler, or your lanes lose and you lose priority in your jungle, you're basically out of the game with the way XP works now.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-04-14T16:57:37.885+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"I believe the jungle's around the right level of impact at present. It's a role with an enormous amount of influence over the early game in particular, with the ability to create uneven fights then better than any other. Equal average XP gains as solo lanes isn't appropriate as a result. It's also a position we've put through more disruption than most, so we'd really like to leave it in a stable place systemically for a while if possible.","replies":[{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2017-04-14T19:19:06.419+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"I hope you understand that you're solidifying a meta where **only** early game junglers (like {{champion:60}} and {{champion:64}}) and supportive junglers (like {{champion:20}} and {{champion:427}}) can thrive.\n\nJungle diversity is going to be a thing of the past: mages went into extinction long ago, so I guess that now it's the turn of farming-oriented carries like {{champion:102}}.","replies":[{"poster":"ofart","date":"2017-04-14T20:19:23.262+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RUCK FICKY,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=FUeAGTc6,comment-id=000900000002,timestamp=2017-04-14T19:19:06.419+0000)\n>\n> I hope you understand that you&#x27;re solidifying a meta where **only** early game junglers (like {{champion:60}} and {{champion:64}}) and supportive junglers (like {{champion:20}} and {{champion:427}}) can thrive.\n> \n> Jungle diversity is going to be a thing of the past: mages went into extinction long ago, so I guess that now it&#x27;s the turn of farming-oriented carries like {{champion:102}}.\n\nI kind of agree with that. XP and camp respawn nerfs make only one style viable and that involves a lot of early pressure. Strategically pathing correctly to maximize farm and counter-jungling at the opportune time when the enemy jungler is ganking etc. is no longer a good trade off. You have much less freedom to express a particular jungling style or fine-tune strategy. The true rank 1 player last season explains the problem with JG [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulAcw3_jF2w). He was unfairly removed from the ranking lists for toxicity/boosting. \n\nWhy do I say unfairly? It's true he didn't deserve a Challenger Jacket or a chance to got to the scouting competition because he broke some non-gameplay related rules but he DID earn rank 1. Pretending he didn't because he was a jerk etc. is a lie and a political move. You can choose to not reward him but don't falsify reality to meet your beliefs. For example, if a runner beat the world's fastest time for X on his own and without any doping, you can't say \"Oh but he calls everyone else mean names and is an asshole with cooky opinions so we'll pretend he didn't beat the world record.\" Not liking someone or not choosing to reward a certain type of behavior is fine but lying about said person's performance is a low blow and very unfair.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-04-14T17:10:27.249+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Aren't there junglers who benefit more from late game rather than early?

No one cares if magic damage is better against blue. If they want mana, cdr and not to be half hp after a buff camp then they'll start blue every time.\n\n\nThe end of season 5 and most of season 6 was paradise for us.

Meddler created a topic one year ago and was apologizing us for being quite. And now he is still silent.    \nI have 1.5kk on skarner, so i am really curious about he is current state, because at the moment he is one of the worst champion in the whole game.  Im sad, because before the rework he was really funny to play and now he is just a garbage... 335MS is a joke if you compare  to his SUPER low damage and high manacosts. \nAnd you can say he needs high manacosts, because he has spires. So what's the point of mana in skarner, since he has the spires gives him unlimited mana? I dont get it, mana just makes difficult to play him toplane.  I reached D3 or D4 EUW by playing skarner only top and that's annoying when  other juggernauts like Darius or Morde, even diver like Riven can oneshot you lvl 6... Skarner is not a junggernaut, at the moment he reminds a vanguard with a syndrome of down, because he is weaker than malphite 1v1. Of course im talking about early game, because after tri he is playable, but what's the point playing him when u have his 2 or 3 better versiors- Hecarim, Vi, Udyr.\nI soloed as a warwick lee with double buff + gragas, but as a fed skarner i coudln't solo lee without double buff+ blitzcrank in the spire...","replies":[{"poster":"WiccanBKaplan","date":"2017-04-15T00:37:03.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly you need to relax, Meddler tries to respond at 2 different times almost immediately after the post and later in the day but sometimes he can't come back to the post like he wants to and you never know, it may be answered in an AskRiot post or something else.","replies":[{"poster":"ZadloBoze2010PL","date":"2017-04-15T10:33:02.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you may have misunderstood my comment.
