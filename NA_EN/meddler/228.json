The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**8.3 Balance Changes**\r\n\r\nAs previously discussed 8.3, like all odd numbered patches for at least a while, is going to be a small patch in terms of balance changes. Even numbered patches will be larger than normal. Things we&#039;ll be looking at for 8.3 below. Unlikely much else gets added and possible some things get pushed to 8.4. For small patch balance changes we&#039;re generally focused on things that are either in urgent need and/or are fairly straightforward to work on (e.g. base stat buffs), though there&#039;ll be some exceptions to those rules of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNerfs\r\n\r\n* Jarvan\r\n\r\n* Katarina (previous nerfs didn&#039;t do enough)\r\n\r\n* Magical Footwear\r\n\r\n* Kalista (potentially taking power from her ult)\r\n\r\n* Manaflow Band (less certain on this one, but looking at it again at least)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuffs\r\n\r\n* Master Yi\r\n\r\n* Tryndamere\r\n\r\n* Caitlyn\r\n\r\n* Volibear\r\n\r\n* Viktor \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Counterplay**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigured it might be good to talk a bit more about part of our philosophy on counterplay. To start by stating the obvious, we think it&#039;s really important that champions have counterplay. There should be things you can do to foil your opponent&#039;s plans, ways to counter their actions and accomplish what you want instead. That&#039;s not the same though as putting counterplay in every element of a kit and every moment playing against it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChampions as a whole should have counterplay, they should also have moments of reliability though, moments that give them a payoff for successfully dealing with their weaknesses. Any easy example of that&#039;s Nasus Q. If Nasus is on top of you and has a bunch of stacks you&#039;re often just screwed - it&#039;s a basic attack modifier there&#039;s no way to  outplay at that point. There&#039;s a lot of counterplay to Nasus as a whole though around keeping distance from him and shutting down his ability to build stacks and needed items in the first place. Counterplay&#039;s spread different parts of the game, from how you mechanically use your abilities, to how you play strategically (e.g. when to roam), to what items to build, to what champs you pick, to taking advantage of long enemy CDs etc. Sometimes conversations around counterplay get really focused purely on &#039;can I dodge the ability&#039; and/or &#039;what can I buy to counter this champion&#039;. Both of those can be good types of counterplay certainly, tunnel visioning only on those risks ignoring a lot of other good options though.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Stuff on PBE that doesn&#039;t ship**\r\n\r\nSomething you might see a bit more of, particularly during small patch development cycles, is content on the PBE that doesn&#039;t ship in the next patch. It&#039;s likely some things end up on the PBE during the 8.3 cycle that will end up in 8.4 for example. That could include things like Rengar changes or items with Frost Queen&#039;s/Talisman&#039;s actives. We&#039;ll be putting things like that on there earlier to get both more visibility into bugs and feedback on gameplay direction. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"World Ender","date":"2018-01-19T16:17:09.050+0000","up_votes":59,"down_votes":13,"body":"When will top lane be fun to play again for bruisers?\n\nTanks win nearly every matchup top. If you want to beat a tank, you either play another tank or a ranged bully like GP, Gnar, Teemo, Jayce, etc. Bruisers have no room to breathe unless you're lucky enough to face another bruiser. And even then, how are those bruisers supposed to impact the game when the entire game revolves around bot lane? Top laners have been forced to take TP for multiple seasons, just so they have a _chance_ to impact bot lane. Gone are the days when top lane was skill based, laners took ignite, exhaust, etc and actually FOUGHT their laner. Now, if a bruiser tries to fight a tank or a ranged bully, they simply lose. Bruisers are totally reliant on the jungler to get ahead, but why would the jungler gank top when they can gank bot, get 2 kills, and get first tower+dragon?\n\nBruisers have had the short end of the stick for so long now and it seems like hardly anything is ever done to fix it. ADC's abuse their items, and so those items get nerfed. Tanks have better base damages, more survivability, and more ability to impact the game in teamfights. Tanks also have the ability to splitpush because they have so much AOE. Have you watched LCS? The last time a bruiser was picked and tried to splitpush, the tank Maokai or whatever can just sit under his turret and waveclear. \n\nTanks are encouraged to build tank items, and many get damage for building these tank items. Meanwhile bruisers have to build some damage items to be a threat, but if they do this also have to build some resist items to be able to survive since they are naturally squishy. Not to mention tank items are much less expensive than damage items that bruisers want to build. Pretty much every class has a cheaper build than bruisers right now. Crit is cheap. Lethality is cheap. AP is cheap. Defensive items are cheap. Meanwhile a bruiser that needs some combo of Titanic, Triforce or Sterak's to get their spike has to spend several hundred more gold than other classes to get their items.\n\nWhere are bruisers supposed to be strong? Early? Mid? Late? Right now they don't seem to be strong in any situation. They get beaten in lane, they have less impact in the mid game than tanks and assassins, and late game they're usually relegated to splitpushing because every tank is more useful in teamfights than them. \n\nI really would like to know what Riot are doing to remedy this situation, if they are doing anything at all. The top performing champions are all tanks or champions that bully melees. That should say something about the state of bruisers.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-01-19T16:47:01.839+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":3,"body":"Placeholder: Want to respond to this, but need to do so once I've got into work in a bit and have the time to do so (not a short, simple answer). \n\nEdit: Thinking about it, might be long enough and of enough interest it'd be better off in next week's first post (can get it translated for other regions too that way).

I would like to request please whatever you change about Yi, please do something impact full about him, because he is in such a shit state that is not even comprehendable. Now, I know what ever buff's you are going to do to him, it won't make him highly ban-able because Yi's kit is quite simple and punishable. So following are some points that I want to highlight.  \n\n* Yi isn't Riven or Akali or some other champion whose kit are so forgiving. Yi is a simple champion and has one dash 'Q' and that is all he can use to counter play or whatever. He is like a Garen who will never be picked/played or reach Master/Challenger, because he has a linear kit. I am ok with that, I am ok with him getting shit on in that elo if picked, but at-least he should be doing reasonably good in the lower tiers, no?\n\n* With so many updates all these years, Yi is not an assassin anymore. He is a bruisery diver, assassin have in and out mechanic which yi doesn't have talon has stealth, khazix has stealth/reset jump, zed has his shadows, eve has stealth, shaco has stealth, lb has clone dash, rengar has stealth etc. When ever yi engages, YOU see him coming from a mile, and he goes in hard and stays in.\n\n* Half the champions out run Yi, mid laner malzahar, outruns just because he brought ghost + flash as his summoner spells. Nasus with phase rush. Lulu, janna, karma bot lanes + fleet of footwork etc. Later on people with Tri-force and adc's with zeal items. Onhit-Yi doesn't do zeal items or triforce, ghostblade, so from where does he have to bring his own movement speed?\n\n* He can not be played as assassin, he is just too squishy and he is so fked by cc, well this was true before but now with the changes, like bramble vest, ninja tabi's, aftershock and toplane tanks he is even fked more than before. Alistar, leona, braum fk him in the bot, and maokai, Ornn and other tanks fk him in the top. And those aren't even hard to hit skills, well at-least you can try to dodge Malphite ult but what do you do with the rest of them. \n\n* You guys have pushed the game to be more of team fight game. It's so hard and nearly impossible to split push with Yi. Udyr can at-least do that because of his constant E spam, Jax can do that with his E Q, Camille can do that with her sling shot, Tryndamere with his E. How do you even do that with Yi, his ult is on such a high cool-down. \n\n* Before I had no problem's climbing with Yi, but even in the shitty elo, I am being forced to play shyvanna, xin, warwick etc. just to win.  \n\n* He is so bad, OTP's try to bring red smite and exhaust in jungle with him now. He can't even 1v1, Udyr, Jax, shaco, shyvana, xin etc. So many people fk him. More than 95 % of champions counter Yi, directly or indirectly. \n\nIt's just so awful playing a champion with good pick-rate doing so bad, even in bronze. I don't even have a reason to pick him any more, like really.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Illâoi Evê Siôn","date":"2018-01-19T16:33:46.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I assume after the Aftershock changes and the Kleptomancy nerfs it will be more diverse.

She's probably the strongest ADC right now and one of the most overperforming champions in the game. Are you looking into some nerfs for her? On a similar note Gangplank is also doing very well toplane (although nowhere near Vayne), I know you previously said you're still looking into it have you clarified your thoughts on the matter?  I personally tend to believe some base stat or W nerfs (reducing his overall sustain in lane or making his orange be more rewarding when used properly, something like lowering the overall heal but increasing the heal if he cleanses CC with it but I suppose that's a stretch) would suffice but he does need some changes imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HP Crookshanks","date":"2018-01-19T16:34:14.780+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"Nothing about Ahri, Lissandra or Syndra? {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Johan14","date":"2018-01-19T15:59:29.311+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still nothing about the buisers keystone??","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-01-19T16:03:00.184+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":6,"body":"Still being worked on.

The 8.2 patch seems rather average in terms of champions balance (doesn't feel anything big beside the nunu buffs), the thing that makes the patch big for me are the support items rework and runes changes, so my question is: does the difference between a big patch and a small patch are the potential big item changes and big champion changes (beside champs reworks that can be in either of them), while the small patch will mostly have numerical changes like 7.24 b? \n\nAlso what are your thoughts about duskblade? AD assassins seem to be balanced around it, but the item itself lacks counter play, giving huge AD on a auto which are mostly undodgeable and bringing back the \"lol one-shot\" in less then a second without even using ultimates (zed and blue kayn being the biggest offenders). Now my biggest issue with the item is that it doesn't feel like I can outplay it, I can't dodge/block the damage as it is on a auto and I can't actually wait out for duskblade to wear off as most assassins have a way of getting a second proc in their kits.","replies":[]}]}
