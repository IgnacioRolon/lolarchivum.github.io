The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Anti Shield Tools**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve mentioned this previously, but not particularly visibly. At some point post pre-season we&#039;ll likely get some anti shield items into the game, intended to be responses to enemy teams stacking shields really heavily. We&#039;re planning to use items, rather than things like Runes or Champion abilities that you have to commit to as part of the game, because such effects are intended to be more like safety valves you opt into when needed, rather than things to run purely based off the enemy comp at game start. \r\n\r\nNot yet certain whether how many items we&#039;ll do, suspect a couple is likely, with the mechanic on them probably something along the lines of &#039;deals X damage when Y happens (AA? spell?). This damage is doubled against shields&#039;. Something to bring shield heavy teams down a notch, not serve as a hard counter, hence not going with something like &#039;removes all shields&#039;.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Possible Item changes in 7.19**\r\n\r\nIn addition to the champ changes coming in 7.19 we&#039;re also going to be looking at some items for balance adjustments. Likely candidates there include:\r\n\r\n* Sterak&#039;s gage: Buff, potentially with a melee/ranged split if needed.\r\n* Zeke&#039;s: Buff, details TBD.\r\n* Edge of Night: Buff, details also TBD.\r\n* Stoneplate: Investigation, looking in particular at whether it&#039;s too attractive an item on fighters (is the trade off they&#039;re making for it meaningful enoguh?)\r\n* Righteous Glory: Investigation, looking at whether it&#039;s too strong when rushed especially\r\n* Ardent Censer: Nerf, potentially including removing one of the three benefits it gives (AS, heal on AA, damage on AA) with a portion of the removed power being then put into the remaining effects.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**A few more champ changes likely in 7.19**\r\n\r\nIn addition to the previously mentioned Azir and Xin Zhao updates, plus possible Janna changes being explored, we&#039;ve got some other changes coming, many of which were previously also tested on the PBE in some form:\r\n\r\n* Malphite: Significantly increased armor while his passive&#039;s up, with some power pulled elsewhere. Likely hitting Q less than previous version tested.\r\n* Aatrox: Second half of Q being non uninterruptible, with a likely buff elsewhere as well (still determining what)\r\n* Vayne: Buffs and game health, with Q bonus damage no longer able to crit, Q AD ratio up, W minimum damage up, W starting % down (same at max) and R duration extending on takedown.\r\n\r\nNotably missing there is Udyr, despite some changes being tested a while back that got put on hold for other work in 7.17 and 7.18. We need to take another look at those, assess if they&#039;re on track to do what&#039;s needed or if we should look for a different approach.","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2017-09-08T16:38:26.280+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":3,"body":"The anti-shield implementation just sounds like round 2 of the Grievous Wounds issue.\n\nInstead of just properly adjusting healing, Grievous Wounds was (re)implemented, so now healers get to feel like shit when GW is bought, and their enemies get to feel like shit when GW isnt bought, making it fairly one-sided either way.\n\nNow, again, instead of taking the time to properly adjust shields, a band-aid fix is being applied while the wound can continue to fester beneath.\n\nCan't say I'm a fan.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2017-09-08T17:02:35.199+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this. I was optimistic awhile ago that we would someday get rid of GW, but that hasn't happened. It's especially annoying that the mage item with GW *isn't* an opt-in item; it's core on many mages. \n\nI think it at least works better with Mortal Reminder, because that *is* an opt-in item that has a very close analogue that is clearly superior if the enemy team doesn't have much healing. If we're going to keep that tradition, I would love to see an analogue to Morellonomicon that makes that trade, so GW is opt-in.\n\nI also hope Riot keeps this in mind when designing the new items. Having a third last whisper item that has this shield break mechanic makes a lot of sense to me at the outset by giving the adc a way to itemize against various kinds of defenses. If mages had those same three choices on their pen item, that would create a very easy system to optimize and balance. \n\nThe complexity of League is valuable, and I know we want to keep some of that. But when already complicated systems meet the item system, something's got to give. They're on the right track with the Last Whisper line. Let's see more of that.","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2017-09-08T17:16:48.869+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with that wholeheartedly. Mage items are in need of diversifying as it is, but giving items trade-offs in that you lock yourself out of the other version is something I do think is good for the game. \n\nLW items do this pretty well, placing the anti-shield on an LW item would continue this trend.\n\nMorellos is too ubiquitous, the only real reason a mage wouldnt rush it is if they're manaless or are pigeonholed into a Catalyst item - or have to rush something defensive in a losing matchup. If I remember correctly, Last Whisper used to be bought on just about every AD Champion (around 3rd or 4th slot), until Riot split the item into two and gave differing bonuses for whichever you opted towards (as well as changing the ArPen from total % to bonus %). We need that to happen with Morellos. \n\nGranted, the ideal solution for me is forgoing this mechanic and removing GW, and also fixing healing and shielding across the board (something I'd like to see a lot more of are Taric's %hp shields rather than the flat shields the likes of Janna can bestow), but that seems to be a forlorn hope at this point.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2017-09-08T17:04:52.128+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"gotta agree.\n\nI hate how Grievous wound gets used as an excuse to not properly balance healing.

No matter how fed Ahri be, she will always not be as much of a threat to the enemy team because of her horrible scaling. Are you looking into this soon? Will it be possible that there will be another rework for Ahri? \n\nWould you look into the W skill range for Ahri? It is less than her auto attack range(making it hard for lichbane to be an effective item to build) when it is supposed to be the same range. Thanks!","replies":[]}]}
