We&#039;ve got all the content on the PBE now from memory, though some of it still needs final balancing, bug fixing or asset polish still.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Rift Herald**\r\n\r\nSpeaking of ongoing polish there&#039;s a lot currently going into the updated Rift Herald. As a heads up there&#039;ll likely also be a bit of further polish that comes in 7.10 as well. We&#039;ve got some finishing touches that probably won&#039;t be ready for 7.9, so we&#039;ll be looking to get those in quickly after as a result.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Ivern**\r\n\r\nUnless anything significantly changes we&#039;ll be doing a balance pass on Ivern in 7.10. As mentioned previously 7.9 won&#039;t contain many individual champion balance changes, given both that the systemic changes will affect balance on most champs to some degree and that we&#039;re still very focused on finishing mid-season itself. We are starting to line up likely projects for the following patch however.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Starting Items for Passive Support Playstyles**\r\n\r\nOne of the concerns we&#039;ve seen expressed since we revealed the changes to the Ancient Coin line is that it&#039;s no longer a good option for a really passive playstyle. In terms of how you get rewards as a support that&#039;s very much intended, we want reward to be tied to action with a meaningful difference between good and poor choices, something old Coin didn&#039;t have. We certainly do want to ensure Coin feels like a good option on squishier ranged champs though, so will be tuning things like coin drop position and pick up radius to ensure trying to get them isn&#039;t suicide for non tanky champs. We&#039;ll also be watching champs like Soraka and Janna who often aren&#039;t great fits with Spellthief&#039;s to ensure they&#039;re not just left without a good starting item.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Non Gameplay Impacting: Feeney Art for Rakan and Xayah**\r\n\r\nA while back we put up a dev blog talking about Feeney art (light hearted temporary loading screen art for champions in development). More about it at the link below. Now that they&#039;re out we can also share the Feeney art for Rakan and Xayah for anyone interested, which was what we see loading into playtests for many months before the final splash art was done. As with the final splash art for duo the Feeney art was also made as one piece, then cut in half with that intent it would be shown side by side. That had the added little benefit of being a fun way to test that some code changes to ensure Xayah and Rakan were positioned appropriately on the loading screen worked as intended too. \r\n\r\nhttp://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/02/before-theres-splash-art-theres-feeney-art/\r\n\r\nRakan Feeney art: http://imgur.com/HmNAVpC\r\n\r\nXayah Feeney art: http://imgur.com/YyPmpFM","replies":[{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2017-04-20T17:40:08.548+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":14,"body":"i hope you do realise that according to LOLKING Lulu has close to 90% ban rate in master tier above\nwhile having ~~50% ban rate in plat+\n\nwhy aren't you talking about her? it's been since 2 months her ban rate spiked while her win rate is high\npeople are tired of playing against an overpowered champion\n\nisn't the goal of league to balance the game and nerf overpowered champs? cause this logic doesn't seem to be applied to lulu, she's COMPLETLY INVISIBLE in your threads\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kC2OZUzvif8?t=4641\n\nher laning phase is TEN TIMES WORSE than malz, and malz gets nerfed first\n\ni don't know how, as a support main, i literally don't know how to deal with a point and click 650 range nuke + empowered AA\n\n**and so do all those people baning her**","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-04-20T17:51:53.986+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":"We'll probably be considering Lulu in 7.10 too, though that's not quite as certain as Ivern and she's more likely to be affected by the 7.9 changes. \n\nLulu's also an example of a champion with very different perceptions by region.

Surprise surprise, the one support (no Nunu doesn't count) that gives both attack and movement speeds off a single ability is suddenly higher in priority.\n\nShe was also a laning counter against Malzahar because of her passive's interaction with voidlings before this latest patch, where now a mild breeze counters him just as much. Lulu's further designed to be strong against aggressive diving, and with champions like {{champion:107}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:121}} seeing high focus… Hell, bot lane is still the primary party lane since the bot turrets don't get any reinforcement like mid and top do.\n\nThe issue isn't Lulu.

You changed the support starting items a few years ago and the gold income. None of those changes solved the problems with support role. You added more shield/heal enhancing items into the game in an attempt to make the role more interesting. The problem is it made enchanters like Karma, Janna and others do nothing but sit and the back and not be interactive. Boring gameplay and lazy work on a role that is already lacking interaction and gameplay. I just don't think your Development teams or you understand what the real problem is.\n\n1) The support itemization is terrible and is not every interactive. Other roles have all of these neat items that do a bunch of different stuff . . . and all supports have are 4 or 5 items that increase the effectiveness of shields and heals.\n\n2) Your past work on supports was very lazy. At least with new support champions, you are doing their heals and shields in a different way that makes it more interactive and unique. There is no distinction or really any interesting gameplay between Karma, Janna, Lulu, and Sona mechanics. They are all very bland in terms of champions, build the same items, and their kits are eerily familiar. To this day I do not understand why you removed Karma's shield bomb . . . that would have made her stand out amongst other enchanters and even some midlaners. Janna and Lulu seem like a missed opportunity . . . . . with so much in their lore and what you can do with them . . . . you give us this . . . .\n\nAdding a stupid quest system and changing the starting support items is not going to solve the problems with the support role. You know what the issues are. You just don't care. I can sit here and suggest so many ideas for new support items and changes to existing champions to make them more unique, but you wouldn't care. Players have been telling you this for the past few years and you seem to think the only thing that needs attention is, yet again, the starting items. Please listen to the community.\n\nHow do you think adding mundane little quests to support starting items is going to solve the problem and make the role more interesting? We are still going to have a role that is not very impactful, the itemization is still bland with a ton of heal/shield enhancing passive attached to it, and almost all of the champions build alike and have the same kit. It just seems like you don't care about the role . . . since you keep pushing it back for another tank, adc, or ad role update. The support role needs the next gameplay update.
