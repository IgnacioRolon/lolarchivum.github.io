{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-07-06T15:44:21.394+0000","title":"Quick Gameplay Thoughts: July 6","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi folks,\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Usual Disclaimers**\n\nThese posts will often contain talk about future work we&#039;re doing, or planning to do, that isn&#039;t yet guaranteed to ship. The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**Impact of 8.13b**\n\nWe&#039;ve been looking at the impact of the mini patch from earlier this week (8.13b). Looking reasonable so far, with moderate amounts of power as hoped added to Trist, Cait and Varus. We&#039;re keeping an eye on Aatrox, since we&#039;re starting to see some really strong performances from him on players who&#039;ve got passed the initial learning curve. Also watching a couple of ADCs who were doing well before the changes who&#039;ve benefited a bit from the Stormrazor change (e.g. Draven). No immediate plans to make changes to them, but want to make sure we haven&#039;t over buffed. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n**Lissandra**\n\nAs mentioned previously we&#039;ve been testing a new Lissandra passive internally for a couple of weeks. It&#039;s been going fairly well, so figured I&#039;d share a look at it as a result, despite some risk it still might not work out. Given this is still earlier in testing I&#039;ve also omitted some numbers and those that are listed are more to give an example of how it works than because they&#039;re necessarily what could ship.\n\n&quot;Iceborn\n\nWhen a champion Lissandra has damaged within the last 3 seconds dies they become a Frozen Statue. Frozen Statues slow nearby enemies by 30%. After 2.5 seconds Frozen Statues shatter, dealing X (+Y AP ratio) magic damage to nearby enemies.&quot;\n\nIntent is to help Lissandra&#039;s contributions to multi enemy fights after she&#039;s used her initial CDs. Use cases include getting a zone of control after diving in and killing a backline target and helping zone enemies after killing enemy divers or other front line. Doesn&#039;t have as much impact early game, but has proven useful in some early 2v2s when both junglers show up and early objective fights. If going ahead with it would be paired with some mana cost reductions to her kit. Statues also count as terrain, so they&#039;ll both block pathing slightly and can be combo&#039;d with things like Gnar ult, Poppy E etc. \n\nIn terms of time frame, we&#039;ll probably have a clear enough read on whether the gameplay&#039;s solid pretty soon, so will likely make a call on whether or not to go ahead within a week or two. One of the downsides of changing abilities like this however is that, where it&#039;s a big departure from previous functionality, there&#039;s a need for a bunch of art and audio work. Not sure yet what the likely timeframe on that would be, would take a while though.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**More 8.14 changes to hit the PBE today/next week**\n\nFor anyone wondering why the PBE&#039;s been pretty quiet and where followup changes to various mages stuff&#039;s still coming. Should be some more balance changes to champions getting into the patch today and in the first half of next week. Since 8.13-8.14 is a 3 week patch we&#039;ve been taking some time earlier in the cycle to work on other things, champ changes still coming though. \n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Yesterdawg","date":"2018-07-06T15:48:01.456+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wow!

That's been testing quite well by contrast, with shorter casts feeling more useful but longer casts still valuable.","replies":[{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2018-07-06T18:27:04.562+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why not give her W a charge mechanic like Galio's?

I hadn't accounted for that interaction at the time, so the passive went off and a frozen Sion statue appeared. Because of the way it's scripted however that's basically a copy of the killed champion, with the real one hidden from view until they respawn (avoids a lot of bugs doing it that way). In this case Sion's passive still went off however, which meant there was a frozen Sion statue sitting there while an invisible zombie Sion beat people to death who were very confused by what was happening...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-07-06T16:00:34.390+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right now, not honestly sure, it's a specific enough interaction I didn't feel the need to check before putting it into testing.

I would be happy with reverting the 8.10 changes, or at least moving some of the exp from scuttle back into the jungle.

If you hit the 4 man ult in teamfights, you already did so much you win most of the time, and if not then you are usually so far behind or outnumbered that it doesn't matter anyway.\nIt is useless in lane, one of her biggest weaknesses right now.\nIt is useless in any 1vs1 scenario, and even with more people you would need to hit an ability that you can't aim and that has a 2.5 second delay.\nNot to mention that creating terrain that you might not want can easily be a downside.\n\nDon't get me wrong, thematically this is nice, and her old passive was strong, but it was basically just a lot of mana regen. If her base costs are lowered this would be a non factor.\nBut anyway. It just sounds so... weird. Maybe I was just hoping for something more skill and outplay based. Like getting rewarded for hitting many Qs in a row or something, or for hitting a specific window of opportunity, or not getting hit.\nThis rewards you for doing something difficult, sure, but you don't really have much control over it. You can't really control how much use you get out of this by playing well.\n\nIt's almost like Cho passive (okay, not that bad, but still). You get more for doing something you already want to do. It doesn't actually change your play pattern.\nYou can't go \"Yeah I used my passive this way and got something for it!\".  \nWhen you get a kill because of it, it's more like \"Yeah, I didn't do anything different, and got this kill just because!\"\nUnlike reset passives, you don't actually get to do something after getting the kill. You just watch as it happens and maybe works... or not. Not like you can do anything to help really. You may in very few situations be able to hold them in place with your W or R, but how often do you really kill someone with one of those still up and them standing next to someone. If people stand together you already want to use your W and R on them. You don't want to wait and hope one of them dies to then use your spells to hold them in place. It's not like waiting to kill your opponent or something like that is actually a good idea, no matter how good this passive is.\nYou just have to hope your opponent dies in a good position. \n\n\nI love the idea for her E though, that sounds like it would really help and be very fun to use.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Mainguy","date":"2018-07-06T18:28:37.497+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a super cool thematically relevant and interesting game play passive.
