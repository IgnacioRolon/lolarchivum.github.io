{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-07-05T15:15:57.840+0000","title":"Quick Gameplay Thoughts: July 5","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi folks,\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**Usual Disclaimers**\r\n\r\nThese posts will often contain talk about future work we're doing, or planning to do, that isn't yet guaranteed to ship. The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Why we turn practice tool off sometimes**\r\n\r\nAs you might have noticed we've had practice tool turned off for some periods of time on some servers recently. We do that in periods of really high player count because it allows us to get more players into games. The amount of server time a game takes is composed of two things. The first is a cost for the game itself existing, which covers things like processing time for minion AI/movement, tracking the states of things like buildings, reporting information post game to match history etc. The second is an additional processing cost per player that's in the game. What that effectively means is that players in practice tool games take up more server capacity than players in other game modes. Turning practice tool off, while frustrating for those who want to use it, can therefore allow more people to play at once.\r\n\r\nExample with numbers (made up, but they get the idea across):\r\n\r\n* Flat cost of a game - 5 units\r\n* Additional cost per player - 1 unit\r\n* Total cost for a practice tool game = 6 units (for 1 player)\r\n* Total cost for an SR game = 15 units (1.5 units per player)\r\n* Trade off for 15 units is therefore allowing 2.5 people to play in practice tool or 10 people to play on SR\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**TFT and integration with other systems**\r\n\r\nNow that we've got TFT available for wider play one of our next focuses is looking at where and how it should or shouldn't interact with other game systems. Making it so event passes let you earn tokens in TFT now too is an example of the sort of integration we're talking about there. Other systems we're talking about include things like Honor (does it make sense in a FFA with minimal chat to turn Honor on?) and Leveling (current leveling system isn't well suited to TFT play given rewards and things it unlocks, but adaptations could be made). We're particularly interested in addressing situations where players want to spend their time playing a mixture of regular LoL and TFT but the way we've currently got things set up makes that feel a bit awkward or punishing. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**Soft Champion Counters in 9.14**\r\n\r\nWe're currently testing some balance changes to a range of champs that give them a bit more of an edge against specific types of enemy champ or make them a bit more vulnerable to specific enemies. Goal there is to add a bit of extra weakness to champions who could do with another way to deal with them without going so far as to make it so a game is overly decided in champ select. Expectation is that blind picking certain champs should become a bit riskier, especially in organized play where teams are more likely to counterpick.\r\n\r\nChanges we're currently experimenting with under that philosophy:\r\n\r\n* Ahri charm stops dashes in progress (anti mobility niche)\r\n* Akali's W is a standard invisibility (gives her more vulnerability to enemies with reveals on their kits)\r\n* Blitzcrank R and Renekton W destroy shields on the target before dealing damage (anti powerful shield or shield stacking niche)\r\n* Cassiopeia and Poppy have their anti mobility effects buffed, with no minimum cast range on Cass W and Poppy W grounding+slowing enemies it stops mid dash\r\n* Kat R and Kled Q have a stronger form of Grievous Wounds at 60% reduction (anti sustain niche)\r\n* Leona W has flat damage reduction (makes her a stronger pick into DoT champs and others with effects that deal a small amount of damage many times like Kai'Sa Q)\r\n\r\nNo guarantees those exact changes go through yet of course, still investigating. Hope is careful use of tools like this help us balance some champs, both those with said tools and those they're stronger against, better for both regular play and pro at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-07-05T15:26:59.419+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":19,"body":"Also please don't give renekton that shield breaking mechanic, the champ is already very strong, and offers no counterplay as is.

Here are some thoughts on a Leona Main (playing her since Season 2).\n\nI don't know if it is really a powerful effect. The trade of isn't worth the change. Here is an example for \"normal incoming dmg\" from the Leona mains subreddit:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LeonaMains/comments/c801dd/pbe_changes_being_released_for_testing_on_our_girl/esiu5ds/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LeonaMains/comments/c801dd/pbe_changes_being_released_for_testing_on_our_girl/esivuyj/\n\nIn my opinion Leona has a many soft counters. Janna, Thresh, Morg, Lulu and some other supporter are very effective against her already. Give her more strength against almost non-existing champs on bot lane (dot champs) isn't adding a soft counter. Leona needs to go ahead in lane to be relevant in the mid-/late game. \n\nAlso the changes on her Q are quite strange. The lower stun duration (0.25 seconds) hurting your E > Q > R combo quite insane. Leona brings CC with her kit and you are removing a stun lock combo and adding her some power back that she can stun more often. I don't know what I should think about that change. In my opinion it hurts her and her kit more than the buffs can help.\n\nHopefully the changes don't come in this case. Maybe return to the drawing board and rethink the counters/soft counters of some champions and how they get applied.\n\nThanks for being around!\n\nPs.: English is not my native language.

At least there you still know how much HP you have to rely on even if you don't have as much sustain (and again, you'll notice that you're not healing the normal amount). However, shields are supposed to be relied on and many champions such as Ekko and Riven depend on them to even attempt plays at lower HP. if they can't count on the shield being what it claims, it ruins their entire playstyle and is just very deceiving. The whole point of these temporary shields is to give you momentary power to go in when you otherwise would be afraid to. You have a window of a few second and need to make it count. \n\nEven if some mechanic for weakening shields exists, it should NOT function by just completely removing them. This is unintuitive, unfun to face and just makes too much of a champion useless just by virtue of another champion existing. It defies expectations and doesn't have much counterplay. \n\nIf it's to be introduced, it should at least be something more gradual, perhaps a softening mark on the shield. Even making the shield half size would be more welcome and fair than something this game breaking. That wouldn't completely deny champion playstyles/kits in a hard counter rock/paper/scissors manner. It would also be something you could understand and adjust for, as opposed to simply having your shield removed and your play unviable. I think the total removal of a shield by an ability is just terrible design and especially so because shields are supposed to encourage outplays at low HP. Imagine if grievous wounds just removes ALL healing completely.

And why is the grievous wounds stronger than the ordinary grievous wounds debuff?\n\nThe Poppy change I like, but it's a waste since she already countered mobility now she's just gonna do it more, we need MORE champions to have these tools, not to have the 2 champions that have the anti mobility effects have them powered up more.
