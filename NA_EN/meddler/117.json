As a reminder some of what gets discussed in these posts is tentative, or theoretical, not a thing that&#039;s definitely happening that we&#039;re just failing to share all the confirmed the details about. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Rek&#039;Sai**\n\nRek&#039;Sai&#039;s mini-update (similar in scope to Shyvana and Alistar&#039;s ones last year) is coming along well gameplay wise. Goal is to shift her so she&#039;s more fighter/less tank than she currently is, with more focus on personal kill potential and less on CC/team initiation. Also looking to improve satisfaction on the ult, with that likely being the spell that changes the most. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**10 Bans in Pro**\n\nWe&#039;re still monitoring the impact of the new ban system on pro play. So far it looks pretty good from our perspective, with some increase in champion diversity and champ select interest likely attributable to the ban changes. We&#039;ve still got some caution that the setup of the second ban phase might be overly favorable to red side long term though. Some degree of that&#039;s deliberate to offset blue advantage earlier and map geo that often favors blue. At present there&#039;s also a pro team consensus that certain champs are must ban for red side, which makes pick/ban pretty rough for red. Some skew in red&#039;s favor later in the draft&#039;s helpful on those grounds too, at least right now. \n\nAs a side point we&#039;re also currently looking at what work we&#039;ll need to do so that the 10 ban pro system is available in tournament draft custom games once the new client ships. Regular matchmade games will use a different 10 ban system. We do want to make sure players seeking tournament style practice, or looking to run their own tournaments, have the option of doing so though.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Mid-Season**\n\nMid-season looks like it&#039;ll probably be patch 7.9 or 7.10 based on our current planning. We&#039;ll be doing a Vanguard update, some changes to defensive items and probably a couple of other things that aren&#039;t far enough into testing to talk about yet.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n** Default Recall Animations**\n\nFor anyone that missed it yesterday Ququroon made a post yesterday (link below) that talks about how we&#039;ll be making it so champions who don&#039;t have a recall animation use one of their other ones when recalling so they&#039;re not just standing there awkwardly.\n\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/IngzHFRs-adding-simple-recalls-to-older-champs?comment=00130000","replies":[{"poster":"xScarfy","date":"2017-02-21T18:12:24.377+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will rek'sai get a completly new ult or are you just making changes to the current one.\nI can't really imagine something under “improve satisfaction“ x)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-02-21T18:14:17.352+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"What we've got in testing at least is almost a new ability.","replies":[{"poster":"HowPlayGAEM","date":"2017-02-21T19:27:44.238+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-02-21T19:51:20.954+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completely agree.

I suggest reading this [blog from last year](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/dev-blog-classes-subclasses) & this [full list as well](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/3A5uuBw7-champion-subclass-list). Vanguards are offensive tanks who basically start the teamfights. Shen falls into the Warden sublcass of tanks, meaning that they're more defensive tanks who protect allies & lockdown enemies trying to kill their teammates. I don't know if they plan to include Wardens in the tank update. Even if they do, I don't know if Shen is being looked at.\n\nEDIT: God damn it Meddler....., anyway, what Meddler said.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Floupi","date":"2017-02-21T18:48:52.371+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"xScarfy","date":"2017-02-21T20:28:46.932+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Squishy Support,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=g5KtHmpX,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2017-02-21T18:48:52.371+0000)\n>\n> - What about {{champion:40}} &#x27;s completely passive and boring playstyle?

He seems to be completely abandonned while also looking recent (and not in need of vgu)\n\nI'm not Meddler, but Ghostcrawler did answer this in his tumblr blog.\n\nEssentially, some champions with minions/turrets can't be balanced towards professional play as they'd overpower the lower levels (Plat and below).  This goes for Heimer and Yorick, mostly.  Ghostcrawler uses the Torbjorn example from Overwatch as the main explanation.\n\nOf course, this doesn't really explain why Ivern, Malzahar AND Zyra can be balanced for professional playyet Heimer and Yorick can't.\n\nMy cynical guess would be that Riot really, really doesn't want to see a world where Yorick is firmly in the meta and Heimer is just an innocent victim in their fervor.","replies":[{"poster":"fpython","date":"2017-02-21T20:00:25.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's a much more innocuous reason. Ivern and Annie's minions are part of their ults and so they are limited in strength by the not-insignificant choice of when and where to use them. Malzahar and Zyra's are to be used aggressively, as they are extremely flimsy, and in lower elo's the choice of how to use them creates a high enough skill barrier as to prevent them from being overbearing. If they get too strong, they can just have their damage tuned down or shifted around without hurting their viability across the board. Meanwhile, if Heimer were to be competitively strong, he would end up crushing lower elo's as his turrets are comparatively very simple to use in and his anti-siege would be extremely hard to beat. Yorick has a similar problem, in that his minions are simple, autonomous siegers, so in lower elos his splitpush would be unanswerable if his numbers were tuned to pro play.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"robotmaster","date":"2017-02-21T19:19:25.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plans for 10 bans coming to ranked draft or just tournament draft?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-02-21T19:53:05.144+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"10 bans in ranked at some point yes, though it'll be a somewhat different format (all bans up front for starters).
