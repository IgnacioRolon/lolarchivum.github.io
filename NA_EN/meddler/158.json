The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Gold funneling**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re aiming to have a nerf to mid/jungle gold funneling in 8.14. It&#039;s an issue we&#039;ve been looking at for a little while now, given it creates lanes without much interaction and putting two income streams on one champion produces a range of balance issues. We haven&#039;t been able to find a fix that&#039;s low enough on collateral damage to regular jungle play, low enough on disruption for a regular patch and that meets our design values, especially on things like intuitiveness and clarity. \r\n\r\nWe&#039;re at the point though where we don&#039;t think we should let the issue persist while we continue to work on those constraints. We&#039;ll be going with a temporary solution as a result that&#039;s pretty ugly on the intuitiveness/clarity side, with the intention of replacing it come preseason when it&#039;s more appropriate to make larger changes. That temporary solution is heavily reduced gold from lane minions if you have a T1 or T2 jungle item and have the most gold on your team. \r\n\r\nWe&#039;re targeting gold on the champ being funneled to here because that&#039;s where the biggest discrepancy lies, with that champ having around 50% more gold at the 15 minute mark than the opposing mid laner. We also took a look at solutions that involved hitting XP instead, difference there&#039;s much smaller most of the time though (~10%). We considered nerfs to the support items too, to hit the other side of the equation, but conclusion was that wouldn&#039;t actually address the issue, given how impactful the gold lead on the champ funneled to would still be regardless. A penalty to lane gold when ahead by contrast is, despite being rather ugly and heavy handed, targeted directly at both funneling and the resource (gold) that&#039;s causing the problems. From internal testing so far affect on junglers who aren&#039;t funneling&#039;s been very small to non existent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n\r\n**Nerfing Conqueror**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re planning on nerfing Conqueror somewhat. That probably happens in 8.15, though there&#039;s a slim change it slips into 8.14 still depending on how work this week goes. Details at time of writing still to be determined. One of our primary goals though is to get tanks back into a more appropriate spot, with things having swung too hard against them. Doing so initially by looking at systemic things like Conqueror that affect all of them, before getting into individual champion changes. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Runes selection UI**\r\n\r\nNot sure yet exactly when, but at some point after the cursor changes are out we&#039;ll be doing some work on the runes selection UI. At a minimum that will involve looking at which rune gets replaced when you&#039;re trying to change your secondaries. Might also do some work on things like color coding of rune trees, not sure yet. Possible it takes a while to happen, given we&#039;ve got a few other projects also on the team doing that stuff, definitely planning to do so though. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**Non LoL: Game Design Links**\r\n\r\nFor anyone interested in discussions around game design and development processes the site below&#039;s worth a read.

I have been playing since Kog'maw was released and as much as I LOVE this game I just can't find that much enjoyment in it at the moment. It's getting less & less enjoyable to load up and play. Hell I don't think I've played a serious game since early June or late May and I'm the type of player who used to play 6-10 Ranked games A DAY and would go for the Gold or better every season to get the exclusive skin, now I just really don't care. And yes you can dismiss me as a scrub for being happy with Gold or Plat, but the majority of the player base is Plat and lower. Ignoring Plat and lower players is actually a fairly risky/dangerous gambit on Riot's part (Though I doubt that is what they are actually doing).\n\nTo be honest it all started with the Rune changes for me, the lack of anything significant as a refund (the Blue Essence was nice but did not make up for the YEARS of grinding to get 20 full pages and didn't matter much to those of us who had all the champs at the time) and the feeling that I actually had less options than I did previously under the old Runes/Mastery system. It just didn't FEEL good to me and I know at least 3 players who stopped playing the game with the changes. I also simply feel we have seen too many changes in too short a time frame. Many that seem to have fallen flat or simply failed, most notably for me with the champ re-works. \n\nPsst, it's okay to let a champ be niche ({{champion:3}} & {{champion:39}}  & {{champion:266}} ) if that champ has a dedicated group of players who really love them. One of my friends stopped playing because he loved Galio, and the new Galio simply WASN'T Galio anymore. Also, poor gbay99.\n\nI can tell you this much, and this is anecdotal, but I have at least 8 friends (including the previously mentioned 4) that have stopped playing over the past two years due to the constant changes and state of the game.

I mean,Mundo builds full tank because is the best option since he can't really use an offensive item like his juggernaut brothers like Darius so he ends in a pretty tough spot in terms of itemization because his only scaling is laughable and it's not going to be relevant unless you somehow manage to get like 1000AP. My idea is basically make Mundo a proper juggernaut and make him build atleast one offensive option in order to keep his dmg relevant instead of smacking people to death with base dmg while also being unkilliable because you build full tank. I suggest ap scalings in order to make Mundo more unique,you know? We have a lot of ad juggernauts but only {{champion:82}} is an proper ap juggernaut so i think Mundo can join him and build things like Liandry(i'm pretty sure liandry was one of his recommended itens for a while :P ) or any other Ap + Health item.\n\nEnglish is not my main language but i hope you can understand what i'm trying to say ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2018-07-11T17:17:12.471+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"For tank jungle mains, everything has been awful since the scuttle meta began.

Now tanks have been in a bad spot for Al couple patches, and immediately you start talking about getting them back into tot meta. How is tanks being bad for 3 patches a problem, while bruisers are disregarded for half a season?","replies":[{"poster":"Lesurous","date":"2018-07-12T06:18:15.491+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's because of the role tanks play in a team comp, i.e. frontlining for the backline. It's one of the reasons traditional ADC's have been outclassed by Mages in the bot lane, since things like Brand/Vlad/Swain aren't too bothered by this (Brand just needs to get one combo off or at the very least his R and there's his teamfight contribution, Vlad has his sustain/pool, and Swain has his ult+passive), and when teamfights that the ADC is a part of there's just nothing stopping the Talon/Zed/Vlad/HEIMERDINGER/etc. from obliterating them, since they'd also obliterate the bruisers.","replies":[]}]}]}
