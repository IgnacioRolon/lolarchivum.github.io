I&#039;ve been pretty happy with how this style of post has been going so far, so going to stick with it for a while at least. Around 3 posts a week seems to be about right at present in terms of how much we&#039;ve got to talk about so should be able to expect that sort of cadence for now. Imagine that&#039;ll spike up and down a bit during some periods (e.g. around mid-season). As a reminder since I work primarily with the gameplay teams these posts will mainly talk about gameplay stuff, so a lot of the time I won&#039;t be able to speak in an informed manner about other non core gameplay stuff like skins, matchmaking, rotating game modes, Esports rules etc. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Older champ polish passes**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve got some small sets of non power impacting changes coming to a few older champs in 7.5. Those are changes designed to give some improvements to how a champion with older art feels to play by better synching up some of their animations and visual effects with the actions being performed. That&#039;s something we put quite a bit of time into doing with new champs, so we figured it&#039;d probably be valuable to do a pass on older champs and see what wasn&#039;t quite lined up right back in the day. \r\n\r\nQuick version of what that&#039;ll look like in 7.5 (more details to come in the patch notes):\r\n\r\n* Jax - Better sync between attack animations and actual impacts, attack sequence for the ult, some E clarity\r\n* Cho - Better match between W spell effect area and actual area affected.\r\n* Nocturne - E tether range indicator for Nocturne, R slight animation adjustments.\r\n\r\nA lot of the other older champs we&#039;ve looked at so far didn&#039;t have much we could adjust in this way. We expect we&#039;ll find at least a few more similar cases to hit though, so should get a bit more like this into upcoming patches too. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Tooltip Tweaks**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve got a few tweaks to tooltip color and format going out in patch 7.5. Please do let us know how those feel once you&#039;ve had a bit of time with them, we&#039;re interested in tweaking them further. Longer term we&#039;d like to do a bigger tooltip overhaul too, when&#039;s unclear however (people that would do that are working on other stuff for a while). For now though we&#039;re looking for ways to polish the current ones so they&#039;re in a better state.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Some possible 7.6 balance targets**\r\n\r\n* Morgana - Potential small buffs.\r\n* Shen - Likely nerf target. Tough case because he&#039;s out of line specifically for organized teams (not just in pro, though that&#039;s the most visible case of course). Currently looking at pulling power out of his ult which is where the difference in effectiveness for those different contexts lies with ongoing discussion as to what changes we could make to make him closer to balanced for both solo queue and organized teams at the same time.\r\n* Quinn - Potentially still too strong after the Edge of Night and Ghostblade nerfs in 7.4. If that doesn&#039;t look like the case closer to ship might go for some power neutral changes instead. Aiming to make her gank pattern a bit more interactive regardless.\r\n* Cho&#039;gath - Might need buffs. We&#039;ve seen a number of struggling Cho&#039;gaths after the 7.5 changes, having said that though his play rates shot up massively, so a lot of that could just be people unfamiliar with Cho and people experimenting with different builds given the changes. We&#039;re prepping some buffs should they be needed, might pull back on them if appropriate though.\r\n* Lissandra - Is struggling a bit at present, and should do ok in a meta with a decent number of assassins played. Looking at possible buffs as a result, with the secondary goal of making her passive more satisfying.","replies":[{"poster":"InTheory","date":"2017-03-03T18:15:14.105+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Bisaknosp","date":"2017-03-03T18:35:52.789+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"make the shield scale of the ally's missing hp maybe?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-03-04T00:36:54.638+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"We've actually got exactly that in testing :).","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-03-04T15:17:26.807+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Any idea if you're considering lowering the base values and changing the AP scaling to bonus HP scaling?\n\nNobody really plays anything but tank Shen anymore, so enforcing build diversity isn't even a factor anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-03-04T20:32:46.727+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taking off the AP scaling wouldn't give us any power budget to add HP scaling.

Quite frankly, she could use a different passive entirely, and if the life leech fantasy appeals to you, move the sustain to her W or R while also significantly Increasing the values against champions.\n\n\n- W - Tormented soil\n\n - The skill is borderline useless on its own, and only useful when used in conjunction with her Q and sometimes her R, maybe re-balance the damage so it deals more guaranteed damage on the first tick, or the first time it ticks a target, or add something to it so it's bit more menacing on its own.\n\n - possible spellvamp being moved from her current passive\n\n- R - Soul Shackles\n\n - Arguably one of the worst ultimate in the game, not because it is bad perse, it does okay damage and has some utility, but because it is borderline unusable in the first place. The delay between the 2 ticks of damage is too long and Morgana doesn't have the tools to survive for the whole duration. It is so much weaker than all the similar R, Galio, Kennen, Fiddlestick, Zyra, Orianna, Cassiopeia etc are much better, Morgana R can be interrupted, the chain can be broken, can be escaped, she can be killed and the damage is delayed. The only way to use it realistically is to cast it in conjunction with Zhonya's Hourglass at which point people can still walk away from you. When was the last time you caught more than one person with the stun on the second tick? It just never happens.\n\n - Lots of areas that could use work, some ideas: decrease the delay between the 2 ticks; increase the slow; add spellvamp / healing over time (akin to Swain R); add damage over time.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\n- Alternatively, I think Morgana gameplay could use an overhaul, her character has a lot of potential, the Black Angel / Vengeful Spirit / Succubus persona is a rich and popular thematic, and Morgana doesn't quite deliver this fantasy. \n- For example, R should be a death sentence, you only have a couple seconds to escape death itself, with a small music similar to Jhin R, and if you don't manage to escape your death, you are \"judged\" similar to Garen R Demacian Justice followed by some big debuff/effect/damage/something cool.","replies":[{"poster":"MisterHealYoGirl","date":"2017-03-03T23:00:47.318+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Kayle and Morgana are on the rework watchlist as an item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GD Reaper1","date":"2017-03-03T20:51:29.224+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually just the other day I landed a 2 or 3 man ultimate as support Morgana as the other team tried to run from a losing 5v5 fight, as the people I stunned were just running into their inhib turret.
