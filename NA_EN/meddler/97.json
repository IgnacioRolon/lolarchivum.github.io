The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Final round of 7.18/Worlds Balance**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re approaching our final set of balance changes for Worlds at the moment. Before locking changes down we&#039;ll be assessing play over the next week, pro play on 7.16 this coming weekend in particular. We&#039;ve got some potential targets we&#039;re already considering changes for as well though of course, quick run through on those below:\r\n\r\n* Possible champion buffs - Azir, Ryze, Nidalee, Ivern, Fiora, Urgot\r\n* Possible champion nerfs - Kalista, Tristana, Elise, Jarvan, Gnar\r\n* Possible item buffs - Spellthief&#039;s line\r\n* Possible item nerf - Knight&#039;s Vow\r\n\r\nAgain, these aren&#039;t guaranteed changes, just the things already being looked at. We don&#039;t have specific changes at time of writing for many of these either, though investigation&#039;s underway so we&#039;ll have something ready if we conclude they do need changes for 7.18 specifically. These are also in addition of course to other changes already in the patch on PBE already, not a complete list of 7.18 balance changes. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Looking at gold/XP as possible pre-season projects**\r\n\r\nSpeaking of possible work we&#039;re also starting to look into some secondary pre-season projects. The big focus of pre-season gameplay wise will be runes, and changes like balance adjustments to champs and items to compensate for the impact runes has. Pre-seasons and mid-seasons are also the best times to do various systemic changes that can be pretty disruptive at other times of the year however. We&#039;ll therefore be looking at gold and XP acquisition, some examples of possible directions. First step will be figuring out what definitely needs changes, rather than just being something to investigate. We&#039;ll then look at what it&#039;s feasible to get done in time without sacrificing needed work on runes. Some, or possibly all of these projects will not ship, so extra important to emphasize here this is visibility on things we&#039;re investigating, not a promised set of changes:\r\n\r\n* XP gain - Jungle XP in general, XP from specific camps (Raptors start especially), XP reliability (how big a difference between a successful and an unsuccessful game should there be/is there?)\r\n* Gold - Degree of gold that comes from inherent GP10, impact on support income from Bandit removal, degree to which gaining map control and then just farming lanes and both sides of the jungle may be over rewarding non risk taking play\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Getting games going quicker**\r\n\r\nLater in the year, potentially also around pre-season, we&#039;re aiming to have some further improvements to a few things to make it quicker to get to playing the game. Main things we&#039;re targeting right now are trimming a bit of time before minion spawn (with faster start of game homeguards at least to still allow jungle invades) and letting teams with two picks in a row in champ select do them both at the same time again. Matchmaking&#039;s also being worked on as usual of course, though that&#039;s often more a gradual series of improvements than an individual change to call out.","replies":[{"poster":"what you deserve","date":"2017-08-25T16:41:16.588+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":28,"body":"Also, obligatory:\nWhen will Riot stop hating Shaco and Rengar?","replies":[{"poster":"Tectonic Marvel","date":"2017-08-25T16:53:09.541+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":2,"body":"Whenever giving them buff won't make them obnoxious and without any interactivity, fair to deal with and with obvious weaknesses.\n\nYou are talking about champions that are thriving in unfair conditions and without any chance of the adversary to react.

I can't understand why Supports, and to a lesser extent, Tanks are relegated to subpar gold-efficiency items in contrast to the more offensive classes. Even without increasing income, wouldn't it augment general player satisfaction to know that at full build, everyone in the game has similar efficiency?\n\n2; Towers losing effectiveness as tanks grow in power and as the game progresses. I understand that games need to end, but it feels to me like there should always be a risk to tower diving, which (although not as bad as it's been at some previous points) feels completely safe for several champions who can get in and out very quickly or too reliably. I understand we can't give Turrets %Max Health true damage, as much as i'd love it, but do you feel like some mechanic could be implemented to augment tower reliability as the game goes on?\n\n3; In the Assassin update, you wanted to make the main Assassin squad have some window of opportunity for the poor victims to defend themselves, however there are several other sources of insane burst in the game that allow for just as little counter play as assassins did before the update. Item actives like Gunblade combined with several mage's high damage kits, lategame ADC crit damage against squishier champions, and animation cancelling or attack resets on several champions early game, like Renekton. (And yes, my main love AP Sona too can get just as absolutely ridiculous when ahead, that undodgeable Q-AA-Lich's combo gets insane.)\n\nThese questions are coming from a guy who likes his games long and planned out, so i understand i'll meet opposition from the more hot-tempered, quick-enders out there, but hey.","replies":[{"poster":"Northmund","date":"2017-08-25T18:32:11.715+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer longer games.\nWhere good team fight decides.\nNot when my bot lane feeds and game ends :|","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LordRedStone Nr1","date":"2017-08-25T16:51:05.624+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are your thoughts about Ornn? \nOn the Reddit AMA some Rioters confirmed he was on the weak side in their opinion, what would be the right approach to buff him?\n\nPersonally his Q feels underwhelming in lane and only usefull to combo with E, maybe give it a bit more damage?\nOr some base HP and Armour?\n\nHowever it turns out, I just have one word to describe his charakter: Good.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-08-25T17:14:42.899+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude looks weak, trying to figure out how much of that's actual weakness versus learning curve.

It seems(ironically because he can craft items on the fly) that items don't actually give him all that much. His damage is mostly flat max% or %current hp of his target dealt, with no scaling, the Q deals physical(with a good ratio but being the only ad scaling skill) and the ultimate deals magic with a terrible 20% scaling meaning he lacks the option of effectively building offensively in case he thinks he needs it.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, he's actually quite sturdy and hard to kill, but honestly feels more like a support than anything else, except he's clearly not designed to be one considering his unreliable cc and high mana costs when laning(undoubtedly deliberate to force him to recall since he doesn't need to do so otherwise).\n\nPersonally I would love to see some ratios on some skills, would love to hear your opinion on that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2017-08-25T17:08:59.796+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"How do you feel about {{champion:203}}, {{champion:56}}, and {{champion:6}} right now?\n\n{{champion:203}} still hasn't lived up to the promise made by a riot that they're make them viable again, the champion overall suffers on multiple angles. I'd particular like to see if power budget from their ult was shifted around, or alternatively if a rek'sai scope update could be a future plan on them to change an ability (maybe one specifically related to wolf to balance thematics). Wouldn't mind a return of the W SFX as that was pretty special for their character, maybe even return it during the healing of their ultimate?\n\n{{champion:56}} I can't tell if he's weak, or if he's strong, but he's just in an odd spot right now, with low playrate but decent success. I'd love to see his early game helped out just a bit, so he can get to his mid game relatively better since dominant junglers like elise, lee, shaco, and eve make his early hell and the other tanks just make his late even more hell.

That's an estimate not a guarantee however.\n\nNocturne - I think Noc shows his age pretty hard, in particular his dependence at this point on going in and bursting someone down as only real path to success. Power wise I think he's ok, and his ult's still I'd argue one of the coolest skills in the game. Would love to see a mini update on him at some point, lot of folks we should do first though (Azir, LB for sure, likely others like Garen, Karma, Ez etc).\n\nKindred - We think the bigger issue with Kindred is satisfaction, rather than power. If the definition of viable being used is 'not pro viable' then yeah, they're not viable, though there's a general issue with carry style junglers in pro there. Imagine we'll put some work into them again at some point, would be surprised if it was until solidly after pre-season at the earliest however, barring new developments.","replies":[{"poster":"murloking","date":"2017-08-26T05:31:23.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hello meddler !
