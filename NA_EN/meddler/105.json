Update to the Wukong changes on PBE below, these should be there sometime later today. A few reminders before we get to the changelist itself:\r\n\r\n* These changes will sit on PBE for a while (about 3 more weeks), then come off PBE. We’ll then make a call on whether to make the art for them or not. Means it’ll be a while until they’re live if we decided to go ahead with them.\r\n* Numbers here are still pretty approximate (they haven’t been through a serious balancing pass yet). Feedback on the general direction is helpful, especially what functionality a skill has. Things like comments on whether a 0.2 or a 0.3 ratio would be most appropriate aren’t helpful yet by contrast.\r\n* PBE is a messy environment, where many players don’t play seriously, we don’t have much match history to base matchmaking off, many people are playing with much more ping than normal etc. Feedback from it’s useful, but needs to be treated with a lot of caution when it comes to perception of power in particular.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n\r\nPassive\r\n\r\n* Damage amp no longer affects structures (was unintended that it ever did and Wukong’s pushing power's going up with new W a lot already).\r\n* Damage amp no longer increases true damage (never intended to, damage amps and damage reduction don't affect true damage).\r\n\r\n\r\nQ\r\n\r\n* Q magic damage now has an AD ratio attached. Currently 0.2 bonus AD. Base damage is down from 20-100 to 20-80.\r\n* Q mana cost is 25-45 (was in the previous version too, forgot to include it in the notes however)\r\n* Now has the truly inspired name of ‘PLACEHOLDER NAME’. Looking for a replacement name here at some point.\r\n\r\nW\r\n\r\n* Now casts in the direction of the cursor, rather than going off Wukong’s facing\r\n* Now goes through thin walls. Not sure this is the right call yet, wall crossing does mean he’s put one of his most potent tools on CD though and it’s thin walls only right now. Also allows for some nice mind games running at a wall and then hitting ‘S’ potentially. \r\n* Clone now gets the E Attack Speed buff if Wukong has it when he casts W\r\n* Clone now gets the Q on next hit buff if Wukong has it when he casts W\r\n\r\n\r\nR\r\n\r\n* R CD now starts immediately so Presence of Mind works with it. Can still be cancelled by reactivating the R though. This is a change we’ll put into 9.11, since it’s a bug fix and low power impact, so doesn’t need to be balanced around.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Not changed:**\r\n\r\nA bug where Wukong can get stuck in the W spin animation occasionally until he casts W again. Would fix it before going live of course, isn’t severe enough to interfere with playtesting though so not spending the time on it right now. Hope you enjoy the ballerina impression in the meantime!","replies":[{"poster":"Wukong Airlines","date":"2019-05-21T16:15:38.075+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey Meddler, \n\nthanks again for the constant review of our feedback.\nAfter much testing with the new Kit, I find it promising and in the right path. But there's still something missing to make Wukong a better bruiser:\n\n1) He lacks CC. we all know any bruiser in order to function properly specially in this meta , they need CC, we dont need a hard one. Lets say we need a CC that will help Wukong to activate [Aftershock] pre-level 6, or in laning trades.\n\n_Suggestion 1: _Landing the 2 ranged AAs (AA after [E] and after [W]) will mark the enemy/enemy champion, landing [Q] on them will stun/some sort of CC the enemy for small duration\n_Suggestion 2: _If wukong's clone AA enemy target 2 times, will mark the enemy and the next [Q] will stun the enemy for X duration.\n\n2) The [R] has to change. The damage is too slow, possibilities for [R] changes can be:\n\n* Ticking speed has to be increased\n* Over-all duration of the [R] has to be decreased\n* Type of damage to change over-time, or add a passive to it to unlock rewards after [for example: dealing damage for more than 2 seconds, it unlocks true damage/hybrid damage/slow the enemy, etc..]\n\n3) Most of other champions have reliable hybrid/true damage/Percentage damage\nI know the new passive adds \"increased damage\" and there is now [Magic damage on the Q], but I feel like wukong has lost a lot of damage after he lost the 30% armor shred, and since he's a AA reliant champ, he can be easily countered with Tabis. I feel the [R] could benefit from percentage/true damage since it's on a high CD so that Wukong doesnt abuse more than 2 types of damage pre-level 6.\n\n\n**_Edit_**\n\nSince we're trying to figure out a better name for [Q], I suggest:\n\nThe top's end/ top's end/ top's peak\n","replies":[{"poster":"Death the Kidd","date":"2019-05-22T02:08:01.371+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I truly agree that Wukong needs some CC. not hard, slight CC is good enough","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Razgriz","date":"2019-05-22T01:29:54.173+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wukong Airlines,realm=EUNE,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=HhLvjhhB,comment-id=0016,timestamp=2019-05-21T16:15:38.075+0000)\n\n> Since we're trying to figure out a better name for [Q], I suggest:\n\nPOWER POLE","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BOSSKONG","date":"2019-05-21T14:20:41.284+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":18,"body":"when these changes gonna hit the pbe?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-05-21T15:11:58.748+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"Update to the Wukong changes on PBE below, these should be there sometime later today.\"\n\nSecond sentence above.","replies":[{"poster":"Hatiru","date":"2019-05-21T18:30:18.488+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":34,"body":"I get you're a game designer but that doesn't mean you should behave in a passive agressive way to that guy. \n\nThis is exactly what's wrong with Riot Games.

This isn't a problem but, in my opinion, as Wukong is Master Yi's student, this seems to show that Wukong has a stronger ability than Master Yi. \"Alpha Strike\" seems like a downgraded ability of \"Wuju Strike\" - based off of the name of the ability.\n\nThat being said - it's difficult to refer to the technique of \"Wuju Style\" without using the term \"Wuju\" in the ability's name (if you're trying to link Wukong to Master Yi in the sense of \"Wuju Style\"). Also, some people may believe that Alpha > Wuju instead of Wuju > Alpha.

The wall jumping is very interesting and the clone direction towards cursor is quite nice as well. \n\nI can't help but notice that these changes are not very large. I had imagined more iteration, more versions being showcased and discussed. \n\nFor example, letting E drop \"stand clones\" (like live) or experimenting with W cooldowns / durations in order to address the increased \"effective cooldown\" of W at high CDR compared to live. Perhaps trying versions where Q does something other than heal (stuns after max crushing blow stacks or just slows?). Trying versions where W doesn't auto but the spin slows / knocks up / stuns? Trying versions where Wukong heals for damage taken / dealt by clone?\n\nWould this mean that this general iteration / direction is more or less \"the chosen one\" or might we expect to see _more differenter_ versions?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-05-21T15:11:26.001+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"It means that this direction is showing quite a bit of promise. Original goals here included now deviating more than necessary from current Wukong, so more about enhancing what's already there. That means I'm hesitant to do things like add more CC, hard CC especially, given changes to compensate would have to be pretty meaningful. Also trying not to move Wukong to be more like most other bruisers, hence the lighter CC kit still with a damage focus and some more trickery/slipperiness. Secondary goal as well of trying to increase skill ceiling a bit without making him less accessible to newer players.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2019-05-21T16:07:17.624+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if you're making him less like other bruisers in that he lacks their CC, should he not also have higher damage or higher tankiness to compensate?\n\nBecause it seems almost like you're pushing him in the direction of being a teamfight bruiser, except I wouldn't really consider his new kit to be  much better than Jax in a teamfight, if at all, at the expense of being objectively worse in a dueling situation. And I'm fairly certain Irelia is going to be better at both situations, thanks almost entirely to her stun.\n\nNow, I'm not complaining about him being a teamfight bruiser if that's the goal. I like teamfights. But where's the incentive to play him over other bruisers?\n\nPerhaps you could turn the offensive portion of his passive around? Give Wukong stacks of \"reckless fighter\" or something that increases his damage by 4% per stack, rather than stacking it as a debuff on enemy targets, with damage being done to champions refreshing the stacks and having them fall off all at once. Then you cap the number of stacks he can get _per champion_ at 5 stacks, as it currently is. In that situation, he could get up to 25 stacks in a 5v5 with good ult timing, giving him double his usual damage, which makes him an absolute threat in a teamfight situation _if he's allowed to get a good ult off_ at the cost of being weaker one on one.\n\nGranted, that's probably not a good idea, it probably can't be balanced against an assassin Wukong setup, but currently I just don't see the reason to play Wukong over Jax, for example, who can build tankier without losing dueling potential, has defensive steroids on-demand from his ult, and has a gap closer that can double as an escape, all while having a seriously threatening approach on an enemy backline.\n\nWell, aside from the fact that I love Wukong and I hate Jax.

That means doing a fast combo would require patience until the Q animation reached a certain point to then E --> AA with Q passive. The fact you need to wait feels bit klunky when you want to do a fast combo. Changing this would enable better fast trades early game against though laners (which we know Wukong got a lot of) but also require timing to do. You can also stack the passive faster that way or go for other Builds/Runes, like Press the Attack. Variety is fun. And if feels flashy. \n\n{{summoner:4}} \n\n**W:** We want this to be tricky, fun and useful right? And maybe even compensate some of the dmg nerfs to his E/Q.\n\n**1. Idea:** When pressing S immediatly after the activation of your clone, the clone should not attack or move, untill you do an attack-move command again.  At the current state he only cancels one auto attack but continues attacking afterwards. Having the possibility of the clone not attacking at all by command could be another option of fooling your opponent. And sometimes you just dont want him to attack to not give it away.\n\n**2. Idea: **The clone could get the Q passive everytime you cast a spell while he's active.

It would also make the clone actually more of a Clone/Copy. :-)\n\n\n**E: **Not much to say here, other than what i mentioned in Q. Striking one enemy with all three clones because he is isolated could give a tiny slow without making him too strong I think.\n\n\n**R:** Please, please give us the opportunity to use Tiamat during Cyclone. Garen can do it during his spin to win move (which was added long after the new Tiamat came out), and it's just a tiny dmg buff. And Wukong can use about every other item in the game during his Ult.\n\n**Bug Report: **\n \n* W has a maximum range like Tibbers or Daisy and travels with you when you exceed it. \n* Stone skin seems to count Towers or structures as enemy.

At the moment, this just futher pushes away AD wukong mains.\n\nTo clarify: His healing would be better suited to scale with less AD and add a small health scaling. So when you want to play Bruiser/Tankier builds, the heal is stronger. But, if you want to play AD builds, his Q would deal damage similar to how it is currently on live, at the cost of a little healing.\n\nIf you're taking away damage to put in healing, then building damage instead of health should reward you with more damage, and less healing.\n\n-\n\nA minior change to his E that would be great is if his E can't find more than 1 target, it would strike the same target multiple times (like yi's does now) with multiple hits dealing reduced damage.

His kit needs character, some complexity to allow outplay potential and some identity. With the current changes on PBE (I’ve tried them out), I think the money has not gained much, but a bunch of of misc features that do not give him any particular style.\n\nPassive: pairing the extra range after an ability with the increased resistances based on close enemies is far from being something uniquely interesting. Extra range does not synergize with both is E or R, and not even with his overall playstyle, as he’s a close range melee that needs to be close from his enemies to have success. The resistances are useful if we think of him as a teamfight engager, and thus i suggest something like this: different stacking bonuses based on how many opponents are on screen: 1 opponent = some lethality (allowing his assassin style); 2 opponents = previous lethality + slight tenacity; 3 or more = previous buffs plus increased resistances.\n\nQ: I would love to see an increased range skillshot Wuju Strike, with small AOE radius, that slighly heals, shreds armor and grants vision of enemies from some seconds (allowing an E dash following it, which would be great for passing walls / jungling in general)\n\nW: pretty much as is, but the close should still explode in the end, stunning close enemies for 0,5 secs (this will make enemies to think twice before chasing Wukong/clone, increasing the mind game potencial.\n\nE: fine as is,\n\nR: fine as is.\n\nMy two cents","replies":[]},{"poster":"TF Xeno","date":"2019-05-24T10:36:55.472+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler, \n\nAn idea for the W: We should have the W act as if it is a Shaco clone to play with the tricky side of wukong. The benefit to this would allow for the clone to be more versatile and mobile vs. standing in one place (although with this method, it could be just that). Have the clone go point and click and not auto attack unless you click on an opponent after the clone is out (similar to other summons like tibbers or Shaco's Clone). This way, the Wukong clone we have now wouldn't randomly auto attack enemies that are nearby unpredictibly (or not even at all for some reason). The duration of the clone wouldn't change, but that would be one hell of a change that would definitely make me play Wukong more. \n\nMuch appreciated,\n\nTF Xeno","replies":[]},{"poster":"BurnerTroll","date":"2019-05-22T15:39:04.127+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, I want to appreciate the effort behind this updates.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nTL;DR: Wukong has reduced damage so he definitely needs the W updates at least.\n\nThere are 3 balancing points of Wukong:\n\n+Damage\n+Defense\n+Mechanics (for jukes, for easy ganking etc.)\n\n{{item:3078}} \n\nLet's talk about new Wukong damage level. It is not broken and also lowered. He still has to wait until mid &amp; late game to gain his power burst.\n\nAnd the defenses, raw ones which come from his W and passive. Passive is not effective until 3 enemies around. Which makes him more susceptible at 1v1 and ganks (2v1). \n\nHere is the main Wukong ID tool, juke potential mechanics. Currently he has an ability to place a clone with 1.5 seconds duration while he is invisible. Almost no damage, easy to distinguish if it is clone or not, and reveals the direction where you went. I personally wouldn't count this as a satisfying juke tool. Look at Shaco, Neeko or LeBlanc. They have more juke potential than this monkey.\n\nI think the new W mechanics (including cursor following, passing through thin walls) are ABSOLUTELY needed if there will be no damage buffs for him. Keep it that way please.\n\nTo those who reproach about recent updates, saying he is broken now, he is not. He does almost no damage at early game so you can beat him.\n\nWith the wall update, we can use our valuable 1.5 secs of invisibility more efficiently. Remember, while ganking you had to press W and had to walk over some corners invisible. Sometimes the invisibility is out after you just reach to the corner.\n\nI strongly advise to keep these changes so the Monkey King can go back to the jungle effectively.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n{{champion:62}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:62}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cheesus Almighty","date":"2019-05-22T13:07:31.271+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll have to try the new changes out for myself, but from trying the last pass of Wukong on the PBE, I feel defensively Wukong is in a great spot.
