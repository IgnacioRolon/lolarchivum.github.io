The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n\r\n\r\n**Jungle Follow up**\r\n \r\nWe've been looking at the state of the jungle after 8.10 and have some follow up changes going into 8.11. Details of what and our thinking below, we’ll also look at things again once the 8.11 changes are out. \r\n \r\nScuttle\r\n \r\n* One of our goals was to make Scuttle more of a focus for attention by giving it around the same amount of gold/XP as a regular camp (starts a bit lower, scales harder, same ballpark though). We think that the value per Scuttle is now in an appropriate place, but that the combination of that increased value with the current respawn timer results in Scuttle control influencing a bit too much of a jungler’s time. \r\n* We’re reducing Scuttle respawn rate as a result (2:30, instead of 2:15), then increasing Scuttle shrine duration to keep similar total shrine availability time (90s, was 75s)\r\n \r\nOther camps\r\n \r\n* Then putting a small amount of XP scaling into non buff camps (Wolves, Krugs, Gromp, Raptors) to account for lower Scuttle Xp availability\r\n \r\nRunic Echoes\r\n \r\n* Our changes to Runic Echoes are part of our work to allow a wider variety of champions in a range of positions. Runic changes were intended to be around power neutral for existing AP junglers as a result, while making the jungle somewhat more doable for many AP champs who've struggled to jungle historically.\r\n* Changes ended up being somewhat power down however. Addressing that in a couple of ways with the most likely being build path (potentially Fiendish Codex instead of Lost Chapter to allow an earlier component spike) and raw combat power (70 AP instead of 60 AP)\r\n* We’re still discussing whether or not Runic Echoes should get Movement Speed back or not as a separate issue. We stripped it off because of how it’s most effective on a subset of AP champs (assassins and those who clear really fast), which fights against our goal of getting a wider range of AP champs into the jungle. Getting it back is very frequently requested by the users of the previous version of Runic Echoes though. \r\n \r\nBalance on champs who mainly jungle (in response to both 8.10 changes and just general balance)\r\n \r\n* Xin Zhao - lowering scaling damage (AD/level) and gank reliability (E slow %). Looking to keep early damage and dueling power intact.\r\n* Graves - less early AA damage, potentially another change.\r\n* Lee Sin - Got hit by the yellow trinket CD/duration change. Making it so his ability reactivations interact as you'd expect with CDR and giving him a bit more energy from his passive late game.\r\n* Kha'Zix - Changing R adaption back to granting additional duration and cast rather than invis on touching brush.\r\n* Elise - Increased base MS and human W damage.\r\n* Possibly a few more champs (e.g. might be small buffs to Kindred, Yi, Nocturne, Diana). \r\n \r\nStill Investigating\r\n \r\n* At time of writing we're also looking at how jungler gold and XP over time in 8.10 compares to 8.9, with potentially some further additions to the coming patch in response.\r\n* Jungler XP early is down, which was intended, given one of our primary goals was to reduce jungler influence on lanes early game. Depending on the champ it's taking between 8 and 14 minutes to catch up to prior XP levels. XP later in the game is then up, with on average around +250xp at 20 mins and +525xp at 35 mins. Talking about whether it's taking too long to get back to parity and whether increased late game XP is or isn't the best place to have power added.\r\n* Jungler gold is down over the course of the game, with on average -100g by 20 mins and -200g by 35 mins. That decrease is gold is consistent with the other positions however, who’ve seen very similar drops. That’s due to the changes to the bounty system. \r\n \r\nGraph of those changes below. Forgive the somewhat hard to follow nature of these, this is just a screenshot grabbed from our internal tools rather than something that’s been tidied up for wider consumption like some of the other graphs we show. \r\n \r\nhttps://imgur.com/P5vl6yp\r\nGiven that’s a bit of a mess of lines, here’s another pic with just a few champs (Amumu, Graves, Kha’Zix) on it:\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/KPgqBBf\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n**New Cursor**\r\n\r\nHas been testing pretty well. We’ll get it onto PBE in a couple of weeks or so to start gathering wider feedback. Since it’ll still be a work in progress some things may be rough or experimental still (e.g. we’ll probably still be trying different approaches for how the cursor reacts when you mouse over an enemy target).","replies":[{"poster":"Kowalczyk","date":"2018-05-23T16:05:00.044+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":6,"body":"Thank you guys so much for doing these!

Upon enrage, plant health is reset to 36 hp that decays by 12 hp per second for two seconds\n\nThis is really the best compromise because it guarantees Zyra a functional baseline for plant damage while still leaving very high counterplay against dps beyond that baseline.\n\nTo further clarify, if a melee auto-attacks a vinelasher immediately after the plant spawns, the plant loses 8 hp and then automatically dies to decay after 2 seconds. If the plant spawns next to a fed Trynd or Yi, the plant will still probably die within one second. But in a 1v1 situation, immediate 1-shots will almost never happen. \n\nProblem solved!

I feel cheesed by Windwall and untargetability wasting my cooldowns, so I don't want other players to feel that way against Zyra. \n\nWhen it comes to Zyra, she is frustrating to lane against long before she's actually overpowered. Fixing plants in a way that adds frustration is going to backfire and further increase the gap between her objective power level and enemy perception. \n\nI wish they would just give this a try and see how it plays out.

We know that smite mid does work, even when it is slightly weaker right now. With +20 AP this could change.\n\nI also think that the AP junglers that have problems also have some problems even before they get to runic echos. Even the good early game elise doesn't have such a good early game anymore. Buffing the item will give them a ~12 minute power boost, but they will still have the problems before.\n\nYou are trying to do the same thing as you had with the %MS. Too much power in the jungle item, not enough in the champs.

Wanted to share some insights with you in case they are useful:\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n**AP junglers:**\n\n* The problem with AP jungler viability isn't runic echoes. You can fix that by having talisman give mana regen on the jungle based off the damage a champion deals to monster +base manage regen per second fixes (and mana regen passive fix one item is completed)\n\n* The reason AP junglers aren't viable is that their base stats make them have weak clears and be susceptible to jungle invades. For example I tried jg liss and couldn't clear 3 camps with her.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**Scuttle:**\n\n* Spawn timers is a step in the right direction. However a better improvement would be to only have the second scuttle spawn be randomized and after that alternate between bot and top.\n\n* There might be a better solution to what I suggets, but the takeaway from my point is that having total random spawn timers feels bad because junglers want to be startegic and optimal gank/clear pathing can't be changed by checking where the scuttle will spawn. Rather, you either get benefited or screwed without being able to change your strategy (think of when you introduced bounty indicators but removed them because optimal target selection didn't change because of it)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solari Fortune","date":"2018-05-23T15:56:53.839+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright I missed last weeks so I came here ASAP\n\nThoughts on Zeke's for it does seem to be getting picked A LOT.

Right now AD junglers have 2 options ({{item:1400}} {{item:1412}} Warrior and {{item:1416}} {{item:1419}} Bloodrazor) but the true AP junglers (excluding tanks) only have 1{{item:1402}} {{item:1414}}. I propose keeping Runic Echoes as is and bring back Rune Glaive (upgraded from sheen) and pop the MS onto that instead. Both {{champion:60}} and {{champion:28}} even the Jungle {{champion:245}}s and {{champion:131}}s can benefit from this upgrade while {{champion:9}} and the ones you are trying to introduce into the jungle like {{champion:143}} {{champion:25}} can still make use of the new iteration of Runic Echoes.\n\nBut if you ever do bring it back please make it unfavorable for laners or it will get abused mid lane again by the likes of {{champion:81}} and such\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nThanks for reading","replies":[]},{"poster":"atomicwit","date":"2018-05-23T20:28:33.126+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remove the rng PLEASE!!!\n\nIt feels so bad and 1 minute is not enough to path properly\n\nIf you want people to contest it then make it a reasonable timer... so sick of enemy jg scuttler rng....
