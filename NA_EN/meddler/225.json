The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Sightstone Changes**\n\nAs we mentioned earlier in the week we&#039;ve got changes coming where the support items will give the Sightstone active as a reward. Goal there&#039;s to open up support item choice and flexibility, versus the current degree to which that&#039;s locked behind an early sightstone purchase. We&#039;ve seen a number of concerns expressed about that approach, and while we&#039;ve talked about that in some threads already visibility&#039;s been low and/or our plans have got a bit more concrete since. Some related points below as a result:\n\n\n\n* Overall power level of supports after this change isn&#039;t intended to change. If this ends up being a noticeable buff or nerf to the position as a whole we&#039;ll adjust things.\n\n* Goal is that Sightstones should still become available around the same time in lane. Amount of gold needed to complete the quest has been reduced as a result to keep that timing. \n\n* We&#039;ll be moving the Frost Queen&#039;s and Talisman actives onto new items, with a goal of finding costs and build paths so that they&#039;re accessible to both supports and non supports.\n\n* We&#039;ll be considering something like Face of the Mountain&#039;s active for a new item, though aren&#039;t as certain about that one. Certainly possible there&#039;s a need for a single target (ish) protective item like that that Knight&#039;s Vow, Mikael&#039;s, Locket don&#039;t meet. Purchase rate of FotM has also historically been quite low (versus Eye of Targon), and use of the active lower again. We&#039;re less sure that it makes sense to port the active over just like Frost Queen&#039;s/Talisman as a result.\n\n* Active item CDR on an item might come back at some point. It&#039;s a decent concept for an item certainly, in terms of what sort of play it enables and the item choices it creates. Would almost certainly need to be paired with a cap on active item CDR though. The lack of an active item CDR cap&#039;s an oversight, given until 7.22 there weren&#039;t any other sources, and it&#039;s leading to issues balancing items. \n\n* The support items won&#039;t give the Sightstone active on Twisted Treeline. For now at least they&#039;ll continue to have their old rewards on TT instead.\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Vision Score on the Scoreboard**\n\nOn a somewhat related topic we&#039;re planning to add vision score to the tab screen as a field that&#039;s shown all the time, not just something visible on trinket mouseover. Goal there is to better reflect how important vision is, and how much individual players are contributing to their team via vision/vision removal. Should be in 8.2 or 8.3. That will be much more awareness of vision score than there&#039;s been in the past, so possible this also reveals oddities in how it&#039;s calculated (e.g. is it overvaluing deep wards versus their actual contribution, or undervaluing killing wards with red trinkets?). Feedback on that sort of stuff much appreciated, whether off vision score as it is on live or after it goes out on the scoreboard as well.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Adaptive Damage Defaults**\n\nWe&#039;ll be taking a look at each champion in terms of whether they get AP or AD by default from adaptive runes if they don&#039;t have any of either stat yet. For most champs that&#039;s not a problem, because their starting item either lets them define what they&#039;re after or there&#039;s one stat that&#039;s consistently better for them that they&#039;re getting already. For some champs though, particularly tankier ones who may never build any AP or AD, or junglers who&#039;d really like a particular stat for their early clears, the current defaults may be problematic. \n\nOur plan is to look at the list of defaults and, if there are any that aren&#039;t the appropriate choice at present, change them. We haven&#039;t made a list of champs to be changed yet though and I figured this was a really good question to open up widely. If anyone&#039;s got thoughts on champs with the wrong adaptive default would love to hear them in the comments here.\n\n\n\nhttps://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Thams Me Abrin","date":"2018-01-12T15:52:19.831+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"So we'll see Twin Shadows and Shurelya's Reverie make a return?
