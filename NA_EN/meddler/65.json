{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-12-08T16:40:23.812+0000","title":"Quick Gameplay Thoughts: December 8","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi all,\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Usual Disclaimers**\r\n\r\nThese posts will often contain talk about future work we&#039;re doing, or planning to do, that isn&#039;t yet guaranteed to ship. The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**Forbidden Idol**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re testing a nerf to Forbidden Idol, and items that build from it, where they give less Heal/Shield power. That&#039;s driven by the belief that too much of Enchanter power especially is coming from that stat, which was previously balanced at those numbers when Enchanters had less gold income and therefore weren&#039;t stacking the effect as much. \r\n\r\nWe feel pretty good about that nerf long term. A complicating factor though is that Enchanters aren&#039;t generally looking out of line at present. We&#039;re confident it&#039;s a good change overall, but not necessarily in the short term however. We&#039;re still discussing whether it&#039;s something we should ship now, and then adjust around it in following patches. Or whether we should hold it until we have other changes to go with it. Or until enchanter  strength is high. Or at the least we until won&#039;t have as large a gap between patches as the upcoming holiday period, so if follow up is needed it&#039;s not as delayed. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**Grasp of the Undying**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re also been testing out a possible change to Grasp of the Undying, where instead of giving bonus health permanently on hit it gives temporary, stacking, adaptive AP/AD. Primary goal of that testing has been to see whether we can better serve various fighters as well in the Resolve tree, without overly penalizing existing Grasp users. We&#039;ve also got a secondary goal of seeing whether the permanent health gain on Grasp is ultimately a problematic mechanic, given how variable it can be game to game (e.g. amount you stack in a melee versus melee fight, versus amount you don&#039;t get to stack laning against a ranged opponent as melee).\r\n\r\nIf that revised version of Grasp doesn&#039;t work out we&#039;ll then most likely go back to existing Grasp and try testing a gradual stacking Adaptive AP/AD Resolve keystone at some point. Some of the interest there is that a ramping power/outlast your opponent approach potentially makes more sense being time based and in the tree about living longer (Resolve), compared to the previous infinite stacking of Press the Attack in the precision tree.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**Resolve Style Bonus**\r\nAnd for our third thing in testing discussion - the resolve tree style bonus. We&#039;re going to be testing that as a mixture of HP and the stat from your other tree, rather than all HP. For people going resolve primary that should give a bit more early offensive power and, sometimes crucially, last hitting ability. For people going resolve secondary that should help deliver a bit more baseline defense, which is generally what we&#039;re seeing be wanted from Resolve as a secondary pick. We&#039;re hoping that proves to be particularly helpful for fighters feeling they can&#039;t at present get the right split of offense and defense. \r\n\r\nThis is still a pretty experimental change, that&#039;s barely been into any tests and may not hit the PBE for a while (or ever, if it fails initial testing hard enough). Really interested to hear people&#039;s thoughts about the concept though. At least for now other trees stat bonuses won&#039;t be getting split, this is just a change being tested for Resolve at present.  \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2017-12-08T17:31:35.410+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"If Sorcery is getting nerfed to target some of the marksmen using comet, then why it's AP getting nerfed too?","replies":[{"poster":"TomiMan7","date":"2017-12-08T18:05:42.749+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah curios about this too...IF AD abuse it nerf the AD part no need to nerf the AP any more.","replies":[{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2017-12-08T18:44:16.228+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or they could lower the AD scaling on Arcane Comet itself.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-12-08T23:12:18.138+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not sure at this point if we'll necessarily hit Comet.

Presently it feels like there's a bit of a \"whack-a-mole\" approach to balancing support items - Locket gets nerfed, then Redemption becomes strong. Redemption gets nerfed, then Ardent becomes strong. Ardent gets nerfed... And now heal/shield power in general looks to contribute too much to enchanter power, so it's planned to be nerfed, but with no proposed changes to make up that power elsewhere when enchanters aren't really overperforming at the moment.\n\nIs there an overall plan for what support builds should look like, and how their power should be distributed? Having to change up my build once every few patches because my strongest items get nerfed one at a time is getting very frustrating to me as a support main, and I'm not even sure what I should be building any more - I shouldn't be rushing Locket, because that needs HP to back it up, but I shouldn't rush Redemption, because that needs heal/shield power, but I shouldn't rush Ardent, because that requires levels for the attack speed to really come online. It'd be nice to see some ideas for what Riot think builds should look like before another nerf hits without any immediate compensation, because at least then I'd know there was a plan for support itemisation in the near future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kynin","date":"2017-12-08T19:48:39.683+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is the balance team's view of support items? \nIt feels like every Enchanter item is being pushed to a late game option.

Having said that he's too strong, but not radically so, so don't want to hammer him too hard.\n\nEzreal does look a bit strong still. We've been talking about whether or not to nerf him in 7.24b or wait and see where he's at for 8.1. Last I heard the team had yet to come to a conclusion on that, in part since waiting for 8.1 lets us put that time into another champ instead and gives us a better understanding of what to hit/how hard.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Reign of Squid","date":"2017-12-11T01:19:35.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you think about a Sona VGU ? \nI know her auras are iconic, but actually, her gameplay is pretty sad.\nShe needs to spam to be usefull, and exept the ult (with big cd) she dont have any cc.\nShe seems to be hard to balance (less than ryze, i confess).\nAnd her theme needs some fresh for old skins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velasan","date":"2017-12-10T03:15:57.372+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"On Grasp could it possibly be changed to work on large minions and monsters while still giving the HP, but at a reduced number?

So, nerfing all the healing and shielding items wouldn't hurt, but I doubt they will get out of line as they did in the last season.","replies":[]}]}
