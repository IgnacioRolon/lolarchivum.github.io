The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**More 7.11 Balance Changes**\r\n\r\nContext on some balance changes in testing:\r\n\r\n* Rumble\r\n\r\nLooking at game health and roughly power neutral changes. Moving some power into Overheat AAs out of Q, reducing W duration slightly to reward specific timing more versus cycling for Heat. Testing out some improvements to auto attack feel as well (potentially animation improvements and/or a bit of extra range/movement speed while Overheating). \r\n\r\n* Malzahar\r\n\r\nChanges in testing last patch cycle are back, both changes to Voidlings and putting some damage into the beam, not just pool, on the R. These felt close to there last patch, we ended up delaying them because of how late the beam change went in though and how little testing it consequently got.\r\n\r\n* Kindred\r\n\r\nDetailed write up of changes by Wav3Break can be found here: \r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/nJbMhriw-upcoming-kindred-changes-looking-for-feedback\r\n\r\nTLDR is we&#039;re looking to shift power to late game, improve overall satisfaction. Marks now grant bonus effects on abilities rather than damage on auto attacks (Q gives AS, W gets current health % damage from Wolf hits, E increases missing health damage). Every 4 marks Kindred also get increased AA range (currently 50 the first time, then 25 each set of four thereafter). \r\n\r\n* Caitlyn \r\n\r\nHeadshot no longer stacks multiple times per attack with Hurricane. Caitlyn&#039;s lacking in clear enough weaknesses and one she should have is lower single target DPS late game than most marksmen with similar builds. Hurricane&#039;s currently making it so her teamfight single target damage is higher than we suspect it should be however, at the same time also constricting her build paths. Testing a change as a result.\r\n\r\n* Ninja Tabi\r\n\r\nTrying a test where we reduce the % reduction on auto attacks (down to probably 10% from 12%), but also make that reduction apply to on hit effects as well. One of the things making BotRK particularly effective at present is that its proc damage isn&#039;t affected by the Tabi reduction. \r\n\r\n* Ahri\r\n\r\nAlmost certainly needs a nerf. Direction not certain yet, two main ones being considered being higher Q mana cost (hit waveclear/pressure early) or shifting damage from W/R into E. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Zac VO Threshold**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re adjusting Zac&#039;s voice so it doesn&#039;t start getting higher as he loses health until he&#039;s below 30% health (rather than the current 60%). Its an effect we think should happen less frequently than it currently does (a &#039;Zac is pretty low&#039; thing, not a &#039;Zac&#039;s somewhat hurt&#039; thing). That just missed the 7.10 patch cutoff, should be in for 7.11 though. If you&#039;re on the PBE and playing around with it feedback much appreciated.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Unusual Playstyles Video**\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMAAfm095tg\r\n\r\nFor anyone that hasn&#039;t seen it we put out a video yesterday talking about our thoughts on unusual playstyles in LoL and how we should be supporting or adjusting them etc. Short version is we love seeing new things get discovered and played, believe whether not not someone&#039;s trying to win is what matters and have sometimes had to adjust some builds/champs because while they were inventive they were really unhealthy for the game (lack of counterplay as with AP Trynd etc). \r\n\r\nThoughts on such playstyles and how we should approach them much appreciated. Feedback on my delivery in the video would also be really welcomed. Video&#039;s not a format I&#039;ve dealt with much yet, so thoughts on what could be better, what works, what doesn&#039;t etc would be great if you&#039;re so inclined. It&#039;s not something I take to as naturally as some Rioters but it&#039;s certainly something I&#039;d like to improve at (really useful skill to grow).","replies":[{"poster":"Àhrí","date":"2017-05-16T20:01:40.136+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":3,"body":"@Meddler Regarding Ahri, and I play a lot of Ahri across 3 accounts. I think changing her numbers over to her E is a reasonable change. Hurting the mana on Q is so crucial to her laning phase when she actual has a bad matchup, I feel it will be too much after her previously gutted passive. It's almost like all of her kit is going to get changed to justify the movespeed added to her Q in the first place. There's times even now when Q is just not enough to push a lane back against some opponents and W is essentially a useless landing tool because of its mana and early damage. People who play Ahri consistently will actually take 5% attack speed in order to help last hit and control the minion wave better. Her charm mana is already crazy, where fishing for charms will net you OOM rather quickly. I think shifting the power to a more skill shot oriented focus is an excellent change and will really curb that skill gap between the great ahris and the flavor of the month ones. Her W and R are also always what people complain about because she \"missed\" her abilities and I still died. Even when DFG was around W and R was the deciding instagib factor. In my opinion the mana change is the wrong direction and adding a bit of skill to the kit is the right one when foundationally she's been viewed as balanced for a long period of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Meggy is Yours","date":"2017-05-17T10:36:46.806+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahri has been balanced over time because she is an old champ\nand nobody thought she needed a nerf for months\nHer mana cost increase sounds ridiculous since her skills cost alot of mana already in low levels","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrFlapjack","date":"2017-05-16T16:57:21.651+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":11,"body":"I don't understand why tank Ekko was unhealthy, but tank Fizz is ok.","replies":[{"poster":"Impish Yordle","date":"2017-05-16T17:06:03.685+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Both are unhealthy.

Both mid and bot have ok counterplay, strengths/weaknesses.
