Zed then teleports to an enemy champions shadow. This one just sounds super cool.\n* Vi could had three different ultimates depending on what button she hit during her dash. I believe this was cut cause the window was pretty small for not a lot of gameplay. \n* Elise could toggle to leave a trail of web particles behind her (like singed poison) Then she could solidify it into a solid wall on second cast.

The initial idea can be any of the above - someone's got an image they'd like to draw, a story they'd like to tell or an ability they'd like to play with. Working from that starting point we then explore what the rest of the champion might look like and what opportunities there are to offer something new. Braum for example started off as a female Piltover engineer, with a giant mechanical shield. We tested a kit for that initial idea in game and hit on some abilities we really liked (similar to Braum's current passive and E), the art and personality weren't coming together however. We consequently took another look at who such a kit could fit on and, after a fair bit of exploration of different possible personalities and origin factions hit on Braum.","replies":[{"poster":"Patrick Mahomes","date":"2014-07-14T19:36:41.563+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":1,"body":"Woah...

Anyway, any thoughts on if that's still too big of an obstacle or if there are potential workarounds.
