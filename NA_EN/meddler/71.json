The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Rengar**\r\n\r\nTouching on Rengar since he gets some questions and we mentioned him much for a bit. We don&#039;t have any immediate balance plans for Rengar, we&#039;re not happy with his state long term though, which will assumedly mean some larger work at some point (might be one of the projects taken on after LB and Azir, might not, still assessing options there). As with LB he&#039;s been a challenging champion historically, offering some really high moments but never being in a great spot counterplay/balanceability wise. \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Upcoming Rune Reveals**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve seen some feedback recently that our rune reveals each week have felt really heavy on damage options for keystones, leaving people wanting to see more non damage stuff and/or concerned there won&#039;t be enough non damage options in the system. Seemed like really legit concerns. Next week we&#039;ll have a couple of regular runes that are non damage options from the Inspiration tree. Week after that we should have a couple of non damage keystones (probably one from Resolve and one from Inspiration). Let us know if there&#039;s other stuff you particularly want to see some of after that. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Rune Simulator**\r\n\r\nSpeaking of new Runes also wanted to talk about something else that&#039;s been asked for. We will be doing an online Rune simulator, sometime around the time Runes hit PBE most likely, that will allow you to go to a webpage and browse through runes/make a rune page using a very similar interface to the in game one. Mentioning in part since it&#039;s a question that&#039;s cropped up a number of times in the past that we haven&#039;t previously been sure we&#039;d be doing or not.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Non Runes pre-season stuff**\r\n\r\nAs we get closer to pre-season we&#039;re also starting to look at what smaller non runes projects we might also include. Should be able to expect some more talk about that in a month or so, with tweaks to some systems like starting items, possibly income systems etc possible. Details not yet certain, we&#039;re still figuring out how much work we should be trying to take on in addition to Runes, which things are most in need and which sorts of change it&#039;s most appropriate, or inappropriate, to do at the same time Runes go out.","replies":[{"poster":"Wukong Airlines","date":"2017-08-04T18:19:17.168+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":16,"body":"@Meddler, Recently Ghostcrawler discussed what makes a champion/rework a success, as a {{champion:91}} main, I'm not satisfied with the outcome of his rework, he fits the theme yet he lost a lot post the rework, I would like to know your opinion about him and if he'll receive any changes/QoL adjustments in the near future.\n\nand when can we expect the reveal of the new Vanguard champion?

Also wanted to pick your brain regarding the rework:\n\n1: E will sometimes go no distance if used at the edge of a wall or on a small wall (or it'll go in the completely opposite direction of the cursor). This is a huge deal, and I'd like to see this fixed ASAP.\n\n2: If you use R, then Q onto a target from stealth and use ignite on them before your Q ends, the blades end up converging to you rather than your target. If this is hard to fix, maybe make ignite also converge blades onto the target.\n\n3: Autoattacks after Q have felt kinda wonky since the change to autoattack queueing. I think most Talon players I've talked to would like a revert to this change (since the only spell he can cast after Q is W anyway, and you almost never want to Q>W).\n\nAs for the questions,\n\n1: The only thing most Talon players miss is the blink. Talon's new engage (especially in lane) is extremely one dimensional, since you HAVE to Q to your target to do any damage to them. Before, you could use your blink just for positioning and dodging skillshots, and the removal of it has made his gameplay a lot more one dimensional mechanically. Any chance of us gaining some kind of in-combat mobility?\n\n2: Part of the reason for his update was to remove his ability to instantly one shot, but it still exists (google Talon flower combo). Is the flower combo existing intended, or is it an oversight that might get removed? I feel like Talon would become extremely weak if this combo was ever removed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ImaginesTigers","date":"2017-08-04T16:25:16.423+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a bigger question: what do you guys want to do about Ryze?\n\nHe was a problem before his rework, and generally always have been, but why decide to give him an ultimate that's disproportionately powerful in pro play, and really limit what you can do with him for solo queue?

Every website is tracking him at 44-47% win rates.

This results in him being helpless and stuck in minion waves\n* his self-healing has been drastically nerfed\n* his W regularly consumes the wrong target if multiple legal targets are under the cursor (priority should be 3-stack enemy champs, then allies, then minions/monsters)\n* because of the switch to depending on stacks for his passive damage, he now has a much harder time killing minions and monsters\n* his W spit regularly just spits out gold but no projectile if he consumed a low-health minion/monster\n\nSome suggestions have been to give him back his \"ranged melee\" auto attack, to allow him to stack his passive on everything for damage purposes or to just make minions/monsters always take full-stack damage. It has also been suggested quite frequently to allow him to stack his passive on blue/red buffs so he can consume/stun them like champions at 3 stacks.","replies":[{"poster":"THE RlVER KlNG","date":"2017-08-07T21:39:14.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would really want 200 aa range back, as well as an E value that eventually scales up to 100% as opposed to, say, 90%. There is a legitimate reason to max E in certain poke lanes due to W's generous base, however, it was largely the E change back in 6.13 that hurt Tahm in the top lane, where he preferred to regenerate health than shield, as the changes incentivized more frequent, smaller value shields, which is low-impact and really takes away his original identity of armoured ADC carrier. I would rather prefer a Tahm that can have more sparse, high moments of shielding than smaller more frequent instances. \n\nHis W's interaction with minions and monsters has also been bugged for the better part of a year and I'm flabbergasted Riot hasn't picked up on this yet considering all the other tiny bugs that get fixed. It will routinely fail to spit out minions and monsters if they are dead or near dead, which cripples his ability to waveclear and poke. This is a major issue and has caused me to lose trades.\n\nIf anything, his fucking Devour needs to fucking prioritize champions. I can't count the number of times I'e eaten a fucking minion and lost the trade, which is even worse because Tahm is the one top laner/support that literally cannot interact with you in a minion wave. Considering his hefty frame and slow size, this makes minion block a nightmare for Tahm's both new and experienced.\n\nAny change to shift Tahm into the jungle would be neat. I'd be hesitant at first but shifting him perhaps a little away from top lane and into the jungle would be interesting, such as allowing him to stack his passive on buffs and applying the full damage on minions and monsters the way it was on old Tahm.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solari Fortune","date":"2017-08-04T16:30:04.886+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will Spellthiefs line be looked at sometime soon?

On behalf of the {{champion:35}} mains discord, we want to know what your current thought on the state of him. Personally, I think he is only doing \"ok\" in the current meta is because of how the lethality items are a bit strong. When those get nerfed, we feel like this is going to hit Shaco way too hard.  There is 3 main things we want to address. \n\nThe first being the new E changes. Personally, I started out playing Shaco full ap when i first purchased him. I think The E changes hit AP shaco top and support players a bit hard, but not because of the physical damage proc. It is because of the newer damage output as a percent damage, rather than a flat output. This makes it a finisher rather than a poke tool and this also ties into point 3. \n\nThe second item on the list is other champions having mechanics in their kit that was deemed too much for shaco to have, namely added damage in his q, free crits and  stacking of our boxes. I feel that boxes need to have less of that \"bounce\" when you place them on another. We understand what it is like to walk into a bush full of Jack in the box's when Shaco is building full ap. Simply put, the fear of the JitB can push you away from the rest of them or into them if Shaco has great placements, however unlike Maokai's saplings which deal bonus damage in a bush, are stackable and have arguably more damage, Shaco cannot stack his boxes together.  Shaco being able to oneshot is another key thing in this list. Old Shaco could oneshot and walk out of the fight. Understandably, this had to be nerfed. However, without any damage on his q he simply doesn't have enough damage, skirmishing ability, or mobility to get the job done. All of these problems sum up to one big problem.\n\nProblem 3: Bruiser Shaco. Right now the Triforce shaco build has been nerfed, but when the lethality nerfs come (We all know they are coming.) A bruiser-esque Shaco build will become dominate again. We understand it was Riot's intention to make assassins burst windows longer and it worked phenomenally with some champs, but they all had one key thing in their kit that allowed it to work well. They all have a skirmishing/escape ability. Khazix's ult allows you to kite and re-proc your isolation damage, Kayn's E allows you to regen health and re- proc magic damage if you are shadow assassin and his ult allows you to escape. There are many others with some form of a skirmishing ability. Shaco's q isn't nearly as powerful at helping him stick to a target in order to delay his burst window and it doesn't help him to stay on target. Either Shaco needs to be allowed to weave in and out of the fight or one shot and be forced to run or die.  Right now, people still build defensive and bruiser items on Shaco while taking fervor and going a dps a route of play because he simply needs to be tanky enough to get off his damage or you won't do anything unless you are fed. \n\n(TL;DR) All in all, we feel that Shaco needs to have better tools in his kit to help him delay his burst but still feel like the trickster we all love. I personally would consider adding movement speed to his q  or something to help him stay onto a target when they use their escapes.\n\n\nThanks! ~ /r/Shacomains Discord.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zippyHD","date":"2017-08-04T19:35:56.410+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Meddler\n\nPlease take a look at the linked thread below.

The ferocity system will compensate if you give Q a higher cooldown. \nor 2)-Keep new Q, take away E's casting time and enhance the viability of his ult \"hunting\" aspect by reverting it to what it was. Exampli gratia either a full ult revert by allowing him to see everyone again all the while being stealthed and not camouflaged and keeping the crit but still applying it to the closest enemy. Also ult notification radius.. reduce. Full ult revert.\n\nIf Riot doesn't like the reduction of the ult notification they can still go through with it by reducing the radius in which rengar can see his enemies.Promoting team oriented and coordinated game play. Cuz you know having allies that provide vision while he is close serves exactly the point im trying to convey.\n\nProposal 2 \nWe all know that the outcry that led to rengars rework was based upon the \"non-existent counterplay\" his ult provided coupled with his easily offloadable and immense dmg he had from the previous ferocity system and scalings. Jumping from invisibility _bla bla_ instagibbing _bla bla_. So what i propose is basically this:\n\n-Revert Q and  remove the atk speed from empowered Q and the bonus ad. Give same base ad values as pre rework Q  --0 / 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 (+ 0 / 5 / 10 / 15 / 20% AD) but retain the same base cooldown as the current one. Maybe compensate by giving empowered Q  bigger base values. Don't touch scalings cuz Rengar is gonna be spreading strokes once more.\n- Keep W as it is. As i believe if it gets touched upon it might become lackluster or be over the top depending on either number nerfs or buffs coupled with the rest of the changes. Of course datas could point otherwise. Nevertheless i am reserving judgement.\n- Either keep E as it is or reduce the casting time. Either way its cool.\n\nAnd now i'll delve into the most important part of my post and as i believe the biggest issue **_to date_** about Rengar. Not his Q or his E(bola)..._but_ his Ult and Passive. Everyone will ask \"But why not his Q? It does TONS of damage, its aoe, it has crazy scalings, its an auto reset and his cooldown is asinine\" and i would wholeheartedly agree but thats why im proposing a revert with significant nerfs in exchange for the  fluidity and fun his kit once had\nYou see, it wasn't really the Q or the E, but Rengar's amazing snowball potential(if played right) and ult's utility over the years(invisibility-camouflage, bonus ms, vision,crit/amplified dmg), that made him oppressive AF coupled with his ferocity stacking system( which thankfully for his enemies, got tackled successfully by Riot ). Really people's concerns were that a scary knifecat could just press one button, becoming invisible and if fed would never give a rat's a** again, if it cut you down to pieces in a matter of !milli!seconds, you being tanky or not. It honestly wasn't about his Q oneshotting you nor his E (that essentially) rooted you till the end of time. But really about the honest concern of \"what are we gonna do, if we can't anticipate him?\" .  And so it's time i give my asinine 2 cents about these 2 problematic aspects of Rengars kit. First things first:\n\n-**Ultimate**(Renamed from Thrill of the Zone back to Thrill of the Hunt) EFFECT RADIUS: 2000 / 3000 / 4000  ---> 1500/ 2500 / 3500 | COOLDOWN: 130 / 100 / 70 (cooldown remains the same)\nUltimate will still largely remain unchanged until Rengar amasses all his trophies. Right down until his last and most important one. \n**ACTIVE: Rengar channels his predatory instincts, becoming camouflaged and gaining 40% bonus movement speed for the duration. Attacking or casting most spells ends Thrill of the Hunt**.      \nThough instead of having true vision of the closest enemy, he will have true vision of every enemy (per pre rework) but his true sight radius(the range in which he sees enemy champions) will be subject to significant nerf to compensate for the quality of vision it will provide. Promoting team coordinated play by using his team's vision. Now the pre rework true sight radius numbers elude my memory but the percentage nerf could very well vary from 10 to 20% less radius. Adding on that, the radius in which Rengar can be seen by his enemies should be respectively increased by the same amount(mind you not the ult notification radius, thats a different thing). Essentially shifting the weight of see/being seen, more favorably towards his enemies, by forcing the rengar player to use his braincells and calculate the distance, he deems appropriate, to start ulting from. Making it, effectively, an expression of skill, intelligence and game based knowledge.\nIncreasing the movspeed the ult gives by a bit is probably a valid idea\nAlso crit **removed** \n\n**_Note: This all may seem hectic for the rengar player but the 5th trophy from the Bonetooth Neclace will affect the ult greatly and give it a more of a rewarding kind of evolution much like in khazix's case_**\n\n\n-**Passive**\nPassive receives quality overhaul and the Bonetooth Necklace rewards get reverted to release state to provide dynamic and meaningful changes that also impact Ult's utility notably.\n\n**FEROCITY**: Remains the same\n**BONETOOTH NECKLACE**: Rengar gains a trophy whenever a champion he damaged within 1.5 seconds dies. Rengar can only gain one trophy per enemy champion, up to 5, with an additional trophy made available through the event The Hunt is On!.\n*Stacking nature remains the same. Will still require 5 unique enemy champion kills, to avoid old and die-hard bad habits i.e killing the weakest enemy link over and over again. **But Rengar can now lose 1 Trophy/death again***\n\n_1st Trophy_: Extra leap range( riot would need to readjust base leap ranges again), \n_2nd Trophy_: Extra move speed, \n_3rd Trophy_: Either a 10% cooldown reward or a 10% ad scaling, \n_4th Trophy_: Extra time on thrill of the hunt\n_5th Trophy_: Rengar sheds his _Camouflage _ and now during his Ult, instead becomes Invisible instantly ( the 2 seconds of delay before he is allowed to  leap are removed). While Invisible(and until the ult duration is over), Rengar continuously lets out a battleroar (while at a certain range) that reduces the movespeed of all the enemies he sees. While Thrill of the Hunt is active, entering a brush will refund half of his basic abilities cooldowns.\nHead of Kha'zix: Rengar keeps all of his Trophies after death.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IraWretched","date":"2017-08-05T06:58:52.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is the honor system working the way you guys intended?
