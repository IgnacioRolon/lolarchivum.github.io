The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**TFT**\r\n\r\nAt time of writing TFT's been out on the PBE for nearly 24 hours. It's been exciting and a little tense watching to see what you folks will think and how the PBE server will cope with so much more demand to play than it normally gets. Very grateful for all your feedback so far, whether you've had a chance to play yourself or have checked it out on a stream. Wanted to run through a bunch of things we're planning and things we're considering doing so notes on those below. We'll also have a dev blog going out tomorrow that covers some of our thinking around design principles for TFT and some longer term plans.\r\n\r\n\r\nThings that will be in upcoming patches (some first patch post launch, some a bit later):\r\n\r\n* DPS meters. \r\n* More detailed unit stats when you Right Click a unit to inspect them.\r\n* More bug fixing, though we're hoping to hit all the big stuff at least before it leaves PBE.\r\n* A ranked queue.\r\n* Improved clarity around unit positioning on the board. Likely involves further work on the ground textures to make movement easier to track, could well include an toggle option to show a subtle hexgrid overlay all the time.  \r\n* Refinements to PVE rounds including difficulty tuning.\r\n* Ways to get more information about what items will build into without having to commit them to units first. \r\n* Additional balance and bug fixing (these should be in every patch for a while).\r\n\r\n\r\nSome things we're discussing based off feedback so far:\r\n\r\n* It's a common point of feedback that players feel like the board is too small. We're happy with it as it is currently and want to give it a bit more time to see how positional play does or does not develop with the currently available space. We're open to revisiting though if the feeling persists with players, especially if it reduces depth in the game.\r\n* Similarly we think a maximum unit cap of 9 is the right place to be, especially given things like Force of Nature that let you exceed that cap and other items that let you add additional synergies. Again, open to revisiting though once things have had a bit of time to play out.\r\n* What our options are to make two and three star units more distinct and more satisfying. We'll likely refine the existing silver and gold visual effects further regardless, especially given we think they're looking really good on some champs and not others at present. Discussing other angles as well.\r\n* What additional information to next work on conveying through the scoreboard on the right hand side of the screen. It currently just shows player name/health, should we make adding things like loss/win streaks to it for example a priority ahead of other TFT work?\r\n* Whether we’ve got the tuning right on how much damage a player who loses a round takes. For the first day of PBE that calculation was bugged and often higher than intended. Watching to see whether the intended values are appropriate or whether we should also make some adjustments so that games don’t resolve too suddenly or drag on forever.\r\n* Whether item drop rates are too high or too low and how much we should or shouldn’t be controlling variation in items earned from PVE rounds for different players.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**Little Legends**\r\n\r\nIn addition to their role in TFT we're also looking to bring Little Legends to other game modes. We want to make sure we're not damaging combat clarity by doing so though and a lot of extra units running around in the middle of a fight can make things quite a bit harder to follow. We've got some behavior in place for them as a result where they'll show up in ARAM games but hang back from the action. They'll be visible, but not in prime combat areas and will run towards the Nexus when an enemy champion gets too close. Play-testing so far's suggested that's a promising approach for making them still appreciable but avoiding them feeling underfoot and in the way. Plan is to see how that goes in regular games, refine the approach further, then see whether there are appropriate ways to get them into SR games as well, using both lessons from ARAM and potentially other techniques again.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**Sona**\r\n\r\nSona’s been a really interesting champ to track the playrate and performance of recently, with the emergence of Sona plus a tanky support (usually Taric) bot lanes showing a lot of strength. Some thoughts on her as a result:\r\n\r\n* Our starting point is that it’s good to see new picks getting used in different positions provided they’re not crowding other options out.\r\n* From a power perspective Sona’s stats in various skill ranges are on the border of what we’d generally consider overpowered. Digging into the numbers more however it looks like Sona + support is stronger than those averages suggest. There’s still a lot of support Sona data mixed in in solo queue, with Sona + Taric for example being dramatically stronger than Sona as a support statistically. In pro some teams have a very high pick or ban rate with Sona + X and we believe that that would be the case for most other teams as well if she remains in her current state for an extended period.\r\n* We’re confident Sona’s too strong as a result and will be taking some power out of her. We’re targeting her AP scaling on Q and E, rather than her bases, looking to bring down Sona’s power with higher income/more aggressive (AP) builds than with more utility item and/or lower income builds.\r\n* Goal here isn’t to push Sona out of the ADC position necessarily, but to address overall power. It’s possible that does end up with her no longer seeing ‘ADC’ play if that’s something that only happens when her numbers are out of line. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Hadriel","date":"2019-06-20T14:59:40.145+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":19,"body":"To be honest, I'm disappointed with the decision you made on Sona.

Because a lot of the interesting bot laners we've seen in the past (Ziggs, Sona, etc.) tend to get knocked down to the point where they're no longer really useful. My suspicion is that this has more to do with the current meta and the design of traditional bot laners (who are largely reliable, and so difficult to justify replacing unless something is overtuned in comparison, not to mention that Marksman struggle places other than bottom lane currently), but it is a little frustrating to see repeated statements that off-picks are cool but balance decisions that -- although often justified -- make it seem like nothing that really shakes up the meta is allowed to breathe.\n\nNow, I understand the potential for damage/frustration here, especially if people don't try to break the mold in response and find counters to that sort of lane (Would hard dive on both champions break it? We don't see enough experiments to check...and would a shift of that magnitude result in no healthy place for Marksman players? Maybe.), but I think there's some community interest in seeing precisely where/why the line gets drawn, and what longer-term plans Riot may have to look into greater bottom lane diversity (and Marksman position diversity) in a *healthy and sustainable* manner.\n\nSorry for the more in-depth question, since I know it's easier to address more compartmentalized topics on these threads!","replies":[{"poster":"Jane Darby","date":"2019-06-20T23:14:31.855+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually as someone that mains marksmen on my og account, I've found more success recently on my other account (this one) playing Ziggs, Brand, Swain etc in the adc position as an apc. Marksmen are so weak early and have 0 wave clear or CC tools that any combination of duo mages bot (Swain/Lux is pretty sick, Ziggs/Veigar, Any mage/Fiddlesticks) can pretty much destroy marksmen centric bot lanes by hard shoving and keeping pressure, because of said cc tools no jungler is going to dare go down there and try to risk getting locked down and blown up, but if you play a marksman if any other champion in the game sneezes on you, you'll fucking die. In solo q no one builds defense, most of the time the jungle and top are ad so you don't even really have to worry about having too much magic damage because magic damage is so overpowered. Let's not forget that last year Riot hard nerfed the shit out of marksmen decreasing their base defense and damage and scaling across the board. People are just so used to having a marksmen on the team, but they don't realize that marksmen are now just glorified dps tank killers, but god forbid you shoot at a tank with your BorK cause the team will get mad at you for not diving their back line or running past the tank (like he'll let you do that lmao). Mages have all the tools needed to dominate and control lane, there's a reason only like 3 marksmen can be viable in other positions but nearly every other class of champion can fill multiple lanes/roles on a team with nearly all the champions in that role because of the tools in their kits.\n\nLet's also think about the people balancing and play testing; These are calm, cool, and collected people with a uniform intelligence and understanding of how to actually play the game, not you're average toxic-flame spitting-rage quitting solo q player that thinks they are the next faker if they weren't stuck in bronze. So, because you have smarter people balancing the game than actually playing it, it can make the game probably seem more unbalanced than it actually is. There's a reason the smarter players only play whatever's busted at the time, because the game isn't balanced and they know they can take advantage of that against players who just really love playing Teemo support, but outside of pro play, players are just not smart, don't keep track of cooldowns or anything. How many times have you seen a blitz miss a hook, and your team still runs away from him like he can still do something? Counter picks don't exist in solo q so that aspect of balance just gets tossed out the window in champ select, I don't know how many times I've seen someone have the opportunity to counter pick then pick something that's shit, and say, \"He counters me I need lots of ganks.\" Or when my support picks pyke into a lux or morg or nami support and just hang out behind me and the minion wave cause he can't do shit into them. But marksmen are just there. Everything counters them. They don't really counter anything except themselves. I really feel that sometimes I'm fucking my team by picking a marksman in certain situations, but kind of feel forced to because of the history of the role and the fact that they are my FAVORITE class.\n\nBut yeah that's my little rant >_&lt;;;;;;;","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2019-06-21T01:28:44.848+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"So riot intentionally makes a scaling support and then gets upset when people start trying to get that champ to scale as she was designed to.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n\nDo you ever read Mark Rosewater?

Pike is a great example of riot not testing a support in other lanes.  I mean they made an assassin and expected it to stay solely as a support.\n\nThis is something I do fault riot for: not having basic common sense or rational thinking.  If riot designs a champ to do scale with items, at some point in time players are going to try and get that champ fed because riot is implicitly telling you to do such.  Furthermore, even though meddler said the goal isn't to remove Sona from the bot position, I've seen riot nerf an OP champ in the past and when they don't get instant results they then proceed to nerf that champion into the ground and leave it there.  \n\nThus based on past experiences, it seems like there's a chance riot is both going to remove her from bot lane and then overdo it to the point Sona isn't going to be able to operate as the lategame support they want her to be.  At that point she'll be forgotten about and left to linger because the meta will shift and people will focus their outrage on the new 54% winrate champ.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"I Miss Every Ult","date":"2019-06-20T15:18:22.332+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Meddler, why not take an approach of fixing support items instead?

A lot of Sona players also build Seraphs. \n\nThese changes likely won't gut her, but Sona's pretty sensitive to nerfs.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TitanCrit","date":"2019-06-20T22:58:56.545+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can we get a quick game-play thoughts for Twisted Treeline in the future?

The vast majority of players agreed that solo lane Pyke brought a fun and unique playstyle to the laning phase with counterable weaknesses (weak waveclear pre-tiamat, unable to fight bruisers/tanks/juggernauts  1v1, weak late-game). I agree nerfing waveclear is a good idea to hurt solo lane Pyke, which is currently a bit overtuned, but I think the current changes overdo that. \n\nAs a Pyke OTP that mostly plays support, losing the aoe and damage bonus on Q stab makes the gameplay choices more linear (no drawing enemies near each other for aoe stab, no stabbing for extra damage). The W and Q CD buffs are nice, but I don't think they compensate enough to prevent a drop in support Pyke wr (which was in a balanced place). At the very least I think the Q stab should still be aoe vs champions.\n\nIf I were to nerf Pyke I would just hit his damage to minions with Q and E so this weakness is even more pronounced. Making them unable to do damage completely kills the unique diversity that he had in the meta. The whole Pyke community and I are just very dissatisfied with the proposed changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SiG DxD","date":"2019-06-23T22:14:32.400+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"any reason syndra has and will have even more hp than garen ?\n\nmakes not much sense to me\n\ngaren 84 hp lvl \nsyndra 90 ,and soon 95/ lvl","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mctiguy","date":"2019-06-22T15:27:38.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about the incoming nerf on Pyke ?
