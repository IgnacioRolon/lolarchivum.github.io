The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png    \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Top Lane Viktor**\r\n\r\nWanted to share some thoughts about top lane Viktor, given we&#039;ve seen it picking up some popularity and discussion, in particular off usage at Worlds. Our thinking right now:\r\n\r\n* It&#039;s quite strong when picked into the right enemy team and opposing lane (melee that aren&#039;t extremely mobile). It&#039;s not looking like a good choice so far into other team comps however, so seems pretty risky as a blind pick.\r\n* It&#039;s a different enough playstyle and position for experienced Viktor players that we&#039;re expecting it to take a while for strong usage to be common in solo queue. Similarly top laners without much Viktor experience will take a bit to build up the experience needed to play it usefully. Some degree of wait and see as a result.\r\n* Preseason changes will likely impact top Viktor&#039;s effectiveness. Timewarp Tonic and Klepto changes will potentially shift its viability, given both of those are standard picks at present for it. Additionally wider preseason changes, particularly tower plating, will impact all champions to some degree.\r\n* Finally it&#039;s also cool to see a champ getting played in a different way as an evolving reaction to other champs being common/strong.\r\n\r\nBased off all of that we&#039;re not looking to make any changes to Viktor specifically at present. We&#039;ll see where things end up post 8.23, nothing&#039;s currently looking too concerning though.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**Lissandra Passive**\r\n\r\nA little while back I mentioned that the Lissandra passive we&#039;ve been testing (enemy champs killed become frozen statues that slow enemies, then explode) had been running into some issues with reliability. Been testing a range of different ways to address that since and have settled on one that&#039;s been really good in testing over the last couple of weeks. Wanted to share an update with you folks as a result:\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/h4NPCut\r\n\r\n\r\nA few other details to know:\r\n\r\n* Frozen Thralls start off moving really slowly and get somewhat faster over time.\r\n* They&#039;ll prioritize running at enemy champions over enemy minions.\r\n* The exact numbers listed here haven&#039;t gone through rigorous balance tuning yet (that happens at the end), so could still change. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**Current State of Clash**\r\n\r\nA few months back we talked about how we were going to relaunch Clash, with the TLDR being fixing some underlying issues with the platform LoL runs on, then PBE testing, then testing in different regions, then eventually a full launch:\r\n\r\nhttps://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/07/dev-the-future-of-clash/\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re now at the stage where we&#039;ve been running mini Clash events in some regions. Tests in Oceania, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Taiwan have so far gone well, with a few small issues identified we&#039;re working on, but nothing serious. Next up we&#039;ll be testing in other regions and increasing the scope of those tests a bit as well. Should have a few more details on exactly what we&#039;re doing different in an upcoming Ask Riot post too. We&#039;re still a while off a full launch, but have made significant progress and things are looking pretty good so far.","replies":[{"poster":"Nicki Minaj","date":"2018-10-24T15:40:27.666+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":8,"body":"Will each Thrall look the same ?

Is the auto passive bug that happens sometimes where you're able to auto once whenever you're in your passive under VERY specific circumstances ever going to be fixed? Some more details on the bug: it happens more often at higher attack speeds, and I was able to replicate it more when orb walking around a target rather than just standing still and autoing. Here's a video of it happening with dragon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyxXYqrnlXo , this same bug also works on champions, any jungle camp, minions, and pets with the same level of frequency. It also works on towers, plants, and inhibs / nexus but is much rarer and more difficult to execute. I'm able to provide more videos and a more detailed walk through of how to replicate this bug if needed.\n\n2. Kog'Maw's current state in the meta is not the best at all, in fact I would argue it is one of the worst. As an on hit ADC Kog has never really been able to use crit that effectively, so after the release of the new crit item Stormrazor Kog'Maw wasn't really effected directly by it, but because it's emphasizing earlier power spikes he's fallen in tier a decent amount because while he needs a few items to get going stormrazor adcs only need 1 item to really hit their power spike. However the main thing that's been holding back Kog'Maw in my eyes from the meta is the strength of Kai'sa and Varus. Kai'sa and Varus (mainly Kai'sa) are the other two on hit ADC's that exist beside Kog'Maw. However neither of them have been hit by the current meta as hard as Kog'Maw, for a few reasons. I'll start with Varus, he brings CC and reliable poke to the table in the form of his ult and his Q, Kog'Maw does outpoke him with his ult and q, but having a good form of CC makes Varus just that much better than Kog. But when it comes to late game Kog'Maw with his W will outdamage Varus, so it isn't really a problem late game. However with Kai'sa there's no point in the game where Kog outdamages her. She brings everything Kog does and more to the table. Where Kog has his W to deal %health damage Kai'sa has her passive which does the same. Kai'sa also brings waveclear, greater poke, and more self peel than Kog has. In a meta where Kai'sa is this strong there is no reason to pick Kog'Maw when Kai'sa is unbanned since she does everything Kog does but better.\n\n3. The third and final point I would like to talk about is the impact current meta supports have on Kog'Maw. In lanes where common supports are Pyke, Thresh, and Leona, Kog'maw not only does poorly against these supports, but he has poor synergy with these supports as well. I'm not saying this is a problem, hell I think Pyke is super fun to play and I always love seeing thresh in the meta, but I'm just bringing up this last point because it's another contributing factor in my eyes as to why Kog'Maw's current state in the meta is one that needs changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wukong Airlines","date":"2018-10-24T18:10:35.257+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hey Meddler, did you check my last Wukong Passive change suggestion? if not here's the link:\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/57bJhcmF-meddler-what-if-we-made-wukongs-passive-scale\n\nSomething needs to be changed in Wukong's kit in order to shift him towards healthier playstyle [bruiser] which he's intended to be, and by starting with the Passive we can achieve that.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf36083462","date":"2018-10-24T21:16:08.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2018-10-24T22:08:42.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"funny, cause the \"inferior clone\" was considered OP only a few patches ago.

There's no counterplay and when 2 dark harvest champs meet late game it's usually the first to land a basic attack that wins. \n\nWe tried several designs internally before settling on the execute model (DoTs, souls turning into adaptive, damage being lower but AoE etc). The execute version feels fairer, as players have that first 50% of their health bar to react to you, receive some form of shield or to flash away. It's now far more broad, too, with any ability damage or basic stacks about to proc the keystone.\n\nWe also spent time cleaning up some of the less consistent aspects of live dark harvest, such as the fact you can use it on towers, you get as much power from your allies dying as your enemies, the tendency to drive players to PvE more than is necessary and the frustratingly low early buff window. It behaves much more like a regular keystone, but with some fun twists (cooldown reset on takedown, for that Katarina team fight cleanup!).\n\nThe new rune can only be stacked through PvP combat, which is where league really shines.","replies":[{"poster":"shadowcat49","date":"2018-10-24T20:18:19.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP dark harvest Ekko.

I dearly miss Ascension and the old players who come back for it.\n\n---\n\nAdditionally, I will add a post in Gameplay+ on some adjustments for when Ascension does come back unless you're planning to drop the gamemode altogether.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2018-10-24T15:41:31.968+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey Meddler, is Lissandra getting any other changes besides the passive?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-10-24T15:56:41.781+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"AA's a bit smoother (mainly visual, small changes to actual timing too though)\nMana costs lowered a bit\nE might start a bit faster, decelerate ending a bit slower (around the same time to final destination)\nPotentially some damage, CD or other nerfs if needed to pay for the new passive (will depend on final balance testing which hasn't happened yet)","replies":[{"poster":"Rayray McRay","date":"2018-10-25T06:19:40.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, just wanted to ask if you will also take a look at the delay when self-ulting?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-10-25T20:00:03.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rayray McRay,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=z5urEfMu,comment-id=000d00000001,timestamp=2018-10-25T06:19:40.061+0000)\n>\n> Hey, just wanted to ask if you will also take a look at the delay when self-ulting?\n\nDo you have an example of it occurring in video? I've looked into a number of reports of delayed ult, or death through ult, over the years. Haven't yet seen a demonstration of it that wasn't someone accidentally clicking on an nearby enemy champ or just lagging. Would love to see an example though, hard to investigate without but I've seen enough comments about it crop up would like to.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-10-24T16:02:01.499+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Meddler, are you guys going to do anything about shyvana?","replies":[{"poster":"AIQ","date":"2018-10-24T16:51:21.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't think you'll get an answer bro.
