The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Clash Tests**\r\n\r\nIt's been a bit since we talked about Clash, work continues though to get ready for a full release. The next major step are some upcoming tests this coming weekend in BR and LATAM. Those are focused on testing two things primarily:\r\n\r\n1. Tier based phasing. Matches for different skill tiers start at different times of the day to spread out how many players hit the servers all at once basically.\r\n\r\n2. Caps. There's a limit to how many teams can compete each day. The limit's very large, so shouldn't be hit in most servers. We do believe it's better to stop taking new teams into a Clash tournament if a server gets really full than to let a few more players in at the expense of degrading game performance for everyone already there.  \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Ranked Update**\r\n\r\nAs you might have seen already we put out an update on how Ranked's going last week, talking about both what seems to be working well and what isn't:\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/voxV8l2u-ranked-2019-dev-update-3\r\n\r\nThis Friday we should have follow up on the things that aren't working well enough, including details on what we'll be changing as a result.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------        \r\n**Urgot**\r\n\r\nWe've got some meaningful changes to Urgot on the PBE at the moment. Some are just straight power (he's on the weak side now as expected since we hit him with some meaningful nerfs). Wanted to talk through some of the changes that might benefit from more context though:\r\n\r\n* We testing moving his shield from his W to his E. Goal there is to make so that if Urgot wants to trade using his shield he has to put both of his defensive tools (dash as well) on CD. That increased risk to his trading then means we can probably give him power in other regards.\r\n* We're increasing his ult range noticeably. In retrospect we were potentially overly cautious on the range restriction originally, especially given it's easy to block or miss. \r\n* We're making AD builds less sub optimal, with the aim of opening up his itemization a bit more. Goal is still to have him as a juggernaut who tends to want to build fairly tanky. Would like to narrow the gap in effectiveness between AD and tankier builds though.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------        \r\n**We're looking for a few associate designers**\r\n\r\nMore details in this Twitter thread in case it's of interest and you haven't already seen it:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/RiotMeddler/status/1102988737175216128\r\n\r\nTLDR - we've got a few open spots right now for associate game designers. These are roles aimed at people with moderate or no games industry experience. Things like having worked on big mods, making your own game projects, CS degrees and professional experience in other analytical fields (sciences, engineering, law etc) are meaningful pluses if you're thinking about applying!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"HommeGoujon","date":"2019-03-06T19:01:42.709+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"Good afternoon,\n\nAny plans about giving some cs'ing power to {{champion:98}} early?

First, if it is an instant cast shield, you don't get much out of it due to the cast time of the dash and the interruptiblity of the dash. Second, if it isn't an instant cast shield, then it isn't an instant cast shield and that will hurt his survivability (due to long cast time) like it did with ornn. Lastly, I think putting a shield on e is overloading the spell (it should not be his bread and butter spell) because it will have a dash, shield, damage, displacement, and stun. In general I just think it will feel bad to play because it limits playstyle.\n2) if you want to encourage a more ad build, would it be possible to scale his dash range with bonus ad or something like that?\n3) I think that the ult change is pointless and a waste of his power budget because the current range is fine.\n4) I read the tweet from riot repotior and one change I did like was the w on hit changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-03-06T19:31:17.102+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Shield's granted at dash start. So far its 4s duration has given plenty of time to get use out of the shield post dash. If that becomes a problem and we stick with the shield on dash could certainly bump its duration up slightly though.\n\nAgree it does overload the E spell a bit, which will result in some satisfaction loss for the W. Think that's probably a reasonable trade off for clearer strengths and weaknesses, with you it's a price to be paid though.\n\nScaling things like dash ranges with harder to recognize things like AD leads to a lack of clarity and useability for both the dashing player and their opponents. Means its really hard to predict exactly where a move will end up when one of the benefits of a dash you can't cast short is that its distance is clear to both user and others letting all parties play around it. \n\nUlt change is somewhat experimental, so could believe it might prove to be unnecessary. If it's not doing too much but has some benefit we'll probably stick with it. If that's the case though it's not going to be consuming much power budget.","replies":[{"poster":"PB4UAME","date":"2019-03-08T13:21:21.993+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you gutted the base strength of the shield, you fucking gut the HP ratio to a third of what it once was, you take a full 20% off the duration of the skill, you put it on the ability he wants to and need to max last so he gets the level 1 shield value of only 60 for most of the game (which again, is fucking nonexistent, and blocks less than 1 auto in lane since you've nerfed it now three patches in a row) and even if he uses it in a 1vs1 scenario, instead of the full 5 second he used to have, over a quarter of its now abysmally small duration is eaten up by him winding up, dashing, CCing the other person (y'know, actually using the E for everything else it does) so that the effective duration of the shield is less than 3 seconds in a 1 vs 1 like oh, most of top lane is. \n\nIt went from a 5 second long, beefy shield that scaled with his core item purchases and let a ridiculously short ranged, (at least, to classify him as \"ranged\" and block him out of so many items and runes he wants.  Irelia has 200 range, that's longer than any other melee champion, why isn't she classified as \"ranged\" too, so she can't abuse Sterak's?) low mobility, no utility, item/rune restricted character actually survive getting up to and into teamfights without getting poked down from beyond his range (when he's the only juggernaut without any sort of healing/sustain to speak of except for the diver/juggernaut hybrid Shyvana) when he doesn't have the mobility to get in without being chunked.  Now he's the only juggernaut without a heal, lifesteal nor sustain, who also has a pathetically weak defensive tool as his only CC, (except in PBAoE after he executes someone with his ult, which probably hits another champion at most twice a game on average) as his only mobility, and as his only escape.\n\nWhy are you putting literally every fucking thing Urgot has except for damage onto the one ability that should be a one point wonder, that we have to max last because Q is only useful in lane, and you're sacrificing all his defensive power to overload his W so he can abuse the new conqueror (stupid, short sighted plan imho, as when you change conqueror you'll gut Urgot unless you undo these changes then, as you're pigeonholing him into abusing a rune-- which is also terrible for game-play and completely unfun on the receiving end-- until you fix the interaction, or change/remove the rune).  We have to max W now, and we need early points in Q.  \n\n All the way up until level 13 we're sitting on a 60 health shield on a 14 second cooldown, with only a 10% bonus HP ratio, that has only 3-4 seconds of uptime (unless, y'know  all of maybe five minions attack you and pop the damn thing) where as before you started doing all this shit, he'd have a 180 HP shield, with a full 5 second duration and a 30% bonus HP ratio.  Because of the poor shield uptime, it being on his E, and the nerfs to its strength, you'll have to invest in some form of early defense, but now you're getting even less out of whatever HP you are forced to buy just to exist long enough to at least kill someone.\n\nSo let's see up 'till mid game you used to shield for three times the base health, three times the ratio, and a ~66.67% increased effective duration (25% increased total duration) but wait!, it would also be on only a 9 second cooldown, instead of 14.  The total uptime is now 4 out of every 18 seconds, whereas it used to be 5 out of every 14.  In other words, he can be shielded 22.22% of the time with this change, when he used to be able to have over 35% shield uptime.  Esentiallly he gets to be shielded 40% less of the time than before, its a way weaker shield, it doesn't scale off of defensive purchases as he's forced into by not being able to build a single juggernaut item with full efficacy outside of the one core item he has in {{item:3071}} So his early laning is dumpstered, and his mid game is fucking destroyed.  Wonderful. You do recall we are in an earlygame-centric META, yes?\n\nY'know, if Urgot could actually fucking buy the items his class is balanced around, I wouldn't have such an issue with you guys cannibalizing the only defensive part of a fucking juggernaut, a defensive, tanky, and bulky class that is supposed to have healing and shields and damage mitigation to make up for their lack or range, CC, mobility and target access, when those are some of the absolute most important stats and aspects of any champion.  With how much they give up literally every where else, they cannot afford to also give up the one thing they actually have, innate, meaningful defense in a META of 100-0 instaburst, hyper carries coming online far too early, and even outright winning laning phases (Vayne is a great example) and the generally pisspoor state of defensive runes (a fucking joke compared to the damage available in comparable runes, even the armor/mr/hp talents are worth roughly half the gold value of their offensive counterparts) and items. \n\n If Urgot could actually purchase {{item:3053}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3053}} Then maybe gutting his shield repeatedly and throwing it on his E so he never uses it might be slightly okay.  Or if he could itemize {{item:3046}} {{item:3086}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3508}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3031}} then you making him a fat, slow, immobile Riven who's supposed to go full AD glass cannon as they changes seem to want to force him to be, might actually be viable as he could output enough damage and scale his threat to make up for it.  But as is, you're keeping him from crit, you keep him from on-hit, you keep him from AS-- yet you seem to want us to only be building raw AD to make up for the fact that you made every single goddamn ratio into a bonus AD ratio.  The poor guy cannot even fucking use {{item:3230}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3025}} at all, or effectively as a short ranged juggernaut.  He has NO viable offensive items outside of {{item:3071}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3042}} and if you'll notice those are all hybrid items, either providing durability and damage, or utility and damage after scaling up for quite a while, and Urgot is one of the worst tear stackers-- even so, its one of the best offensive items available to him.\n\n\nBasically, as it stands, you're trying to make Urgot into some thing that he isn't, and as an Urgot main, it comes as a slap in the face.  Additionally, it comes off as if you don't even understand your own characters, the limitations they face, and how fucking stupid it is to try to make a defensive character who is restricted from items particularly offensive ones, let alone pure offensive items, and then to force them instead to be a non-durable, high damage class cannon who cannot effectively itemize for the damage and raw AD you want them to have, while they also do not have the tools to perform the role you want them to. do not forget that this meddling and change for the sake of change comes at the cost of you removing the tools he has and needs to function for the role he was designed for.","replies":[{"poster":"Yets4240","date":"2019-03-08T14:23:41.655+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree wholeheartedly with almost everything said here.\n\nUrgot needs to stay a defensive oriented character who outlasts and whittles down his opponents, slowly breaking them over time.  Its his entire entirety, his character, his whole goddamn shtick, and RIOT seems to want to toss it out the window to make him more bursty, more snowbally, much more feast or famine.  Pardon the language, but fuck that shit.  Fuck ***all*** of that shit.  For-goddamn-ever.  \n\nOffensive stats as basically his only scaling, curbstomping the everloving shit out of his only defense, and relegating it to his least used ability, which is also something Urgot wants to save for every other use that it has is just. . . mindbogglingly stupid. Like every other commenter so far has said, his E is already overlaoded.  Its his only mobility as a juggernaut in a hypermobile meta, and its very short ranged [real talk, isn't it the smallest dash in the game that isn't an auto attack lunch like Udyr's E?  and delayed a quarter second too?] so obviously he'll want to save it as long as possible to catch up to a fleeing opponent, or get out of someone engaging on him?  Well, too bad, he needs to land it for his W to target, and now you're balancing him around having 100% W uptime, so clearly he needs to be hitting his E early on to aim.  But his E is also his only CC, so he want to save it to interrupt combos/channels/etc or use it to lock down a target.  But, its now his only defense on a fat slow champion with no sustain and garbage hp/5.  And of course, all of this conflicting uses make using it for any one thing inherently worse at the other things its supposed to be used for.\n\nIf you use it to get in range, you did no damage with it, you didn't CC anyone, now you can't target with W, and you'll have no CC and you have no mobility at all for the next 14 seconds.  But hey, you still got to use the mobility and shield parts once right?  Well, what if you want to use the CC?  Now you're often wasting part or all of the mobility and a quarter of your shield, but you land the damage and CC.  What if you use it as a disengage/escape like it used to be used?  Now you're wasting the damage, the CC and the shield, and have to wait 14 seconds to try to reengage in any way, shape or form outside of ultsniping a low HP target. \n\nLiterally the only time you can use all of it is e + flash from fog of war or over a wall onto a squishy to then instaburst them, and hope to combo the ult fear into setting up another ally to kill someone else. . . where you have to blow your entire kit for it to work out, including a summoner spell on a 5 minute cooldown, and if you miss E or R you're probably going to be inting into the enemy team, and even if you do kill your first target, you'll get blown up due to needing to buy fucktons of AD and having terribly or nonexistent scalings from resistances and HP, and for sending yourself into melee range of the enemy team as a massive target.  Not only is this not tactical, strategic, engaging nor fun game play on behalf of the Urgot player, this type of instant burst, nigh-impossible to react to bullshit is trash that has no business in this or any other PvP game period.  It feels even worse and more braindead for the opponents having to face Urgot.  And then, urgot cannot do this shit for another 5 minutes until flash is up.  Its a terrible game play cycle that should not be supported, let alone you guys forcing a character into this BS.\n\nThe shield cannot go onto Urgot's E.  It's that fucking simple, and the change is a poorly thought out, untested dumpsterfire.  It takes less than 5 PBE games to see this shit, is well, shit.  Unbalance, stupid, unnecessary shit.

No PBE account, sorry, so feedback purely from reading the notes.\n\n* I see no other comment about it, but 0 s CD on W? Does that mean you can re-activate it as soon as it stops? It feels super strong, and more than a compensation for the shield change.\n* When you say more offensive builds, what do you have in mind? Because Urgot is locked out of a lot of offensive items because of not benefitting from AS *and* being melee at the same time. He can't build Wit's End, any Hydra variant, Sterak, Runaan, BotRK, etc. Spear of Shojin might(?) be good but is counter-intuitive. So what do you *want* him to build? Cleaver, Death's Dance, then what? Lethality items?\n* In general, I'm not a fan of defense steroid scaling with AD (namely the shield, here), it's usually a very feast or famine mechanic. Also, 4 s might be a bit short, especially in 1v1 situations. (In team-fights, the 4 other people you do *not* CC will certainly blew through it.)\n\nTo conclude, from a personal level, I don't really like the push to more AD builds, but I'm playing Resolve/Titanic on Fiora, so this is clearly a personal bias. Still, for what it's worth, not a fan, and I believe the rest of my comments still apply.\n\nIn any case, good luck with that work, hope you'll manage.

I am no longer able to tell in which direction a champion is moving (previously I did)\n\n* **Rather than nerfing other parts of her kit, I think cutting down on the execution damage of her ult is the way to go** if nerfs are needed. This way she is still encouraged to build damage and she doesn't get a free pass with her ult now that it works.\n\n* **Conqueror is also helping her quite a bit**, typical case of double buff dipping. Also it isn't popular but spear works wonders for her in prolonged fights\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Regarding the new Game design positions.** do you as a company value consulting work in analytics as an entry path into the business?

Do want to see where Conqueror nerfs leave her though before deciding whether to do something else, given its extremely high pick rate on her.\n\nFor the game design positions, yes, extremely open to analytics/data backgrounds. Foreign sponsorship's possible, it does have some challenges however so is usually something we investigate only for more senior candidates.
