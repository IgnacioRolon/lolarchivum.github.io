{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-09-07T06:38:55.624+0000","title":"Thoughts on the juggernaut reworks: Where we're up to after 4 weeks","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":91,"down_votes":9,"body":"Hey folks,\n\nWanted to provide an update on our thinking about the recently reworked juggernauts. Initial post from a week post launch here:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/GzunkiGw-initial-juggernaut-thoughts\n\nOverall the juggernauts have definitely been too strong (our bad). Making comparatively immobile melee effective is something we&#039;ve had trouble with in the past, which in retrospect&#039;s lead to us putting too much power into this group. We have been seeing some distinctive play generated by each of the reworks though, which hits on one of our primary goals for this work of making different characters have distinctly different effects on the game. Fairly optimistic we&#039;ll see that continue once we&#039;ve got balance into the correct spot, though won&#039;t count those chickens before they hatch of course. What we&#039;re thinking for patch 5.18 below, with a few longer term thoughts mixed in. \n\n* Garen: Garen did turn out to be too strong as initially suspected. The mobility nerfs in 5.17 have helped with that, we still feel he&#039;s a bit strong at present though. Next major change we&#039;ll be doing in 5.18 is making it so that people no longer generate Villainy stacks by killing Garen himself. Biggest impact there is that you won&#039;t get punished for killing Garen in lane, which in some match ups makes it really hard to get a real advantage in lane against him (or even turns what should be a winning action into a losing action).\n\n* Darius: Went from significantly weak to too strong with the hotfix and buff in 5.17. We&#039;re nerfing him in 5.18 as a result, giving Q a scaling mana cost and reducing the amount he heals per target hit by Q (with an increase to the max possible healing). Goal there is to nerf his healing overall, in lane in particular, while allowing some big moments still if he can catch 3 enemy champions with the blade. Longer term we&#039;ve also been talking about whether straight % missing health is the correct model or not for Darius&#039; heal, given how much a tanky Darius can heal for. It&#039;s possible we&#039;ll shift towards a flat + missing% model instead at some point, still discussing/waiting to see how the 5.18 nerfs impact him.\n\n* Skarner: We were pretty happy with how the hotfix hit Skarner, since it dropped his power substantially without going too far and leaving him too weak. He&#039;s still too strong, so we&#039;ll be following up on him as well in 5.18, with a nerf to his E slow, reducing the power of his ganks in particular.\n\n* Morde: Now that the dust&#039;s settled somewhat it&#039;s pretty clear Morde&#039;s significantly overpowered as a farming duo laner, and very weak as a solo laner. We&#039;ll be nerfing Morde&#039;s base Armor, W healing and W damage (no longer deals double damage when overlapping, base damage increased somewhat). For solo Morde W&#039;s going to be self castable for the healing effect (though not the damage). Expectation is that we&#039;ll need to do more to Morde in follow up patches as well, though as usual we&#039;ll see what effect those changes have first.\n\n* Bonus items section: So far Deadman's Plate, Titanic Hydra and Sterak's Gage are looking pretty reasonable. They're doing the right sort of things on the right sort of champions. No current changes planned for them as a result, though we're still keeping a clear eye on them of course as builds continue to get tested and refined. \n\nFinally it&#039;s also worth noting that since 5.18 is the patch World&#039;s will be played on we&#039;ve been putting a lot of focus into how the juggernauts are performing in professional play (since balance tends to be somewhat different between normal games and organized 5s, high skill level 5s especially). The recent LPL games have been played on 5.16 with the hotfix, which has been a useful data point for us in assessing juggernaut power. We&#039;ve seen Darius and Skarner picked there (Skarner much more than Darius), both looking strong, though not overwhelming so. No sign of Garen isn&#039;t surprising (the nature of his kit&#039;s a better match for solo queue). No Morde picks or bans is a harder one to interpret. It&#039;s possible his weaknesses are such that an organized team can just shut him down, or that he&#039;s new enough teams haven&#039;t had enough time to drill into his changes yet, so aren&#039;t interested in picking him for now even if he&#039;s theoretically strong (I&#039;m personally in this camp, though definitely not 100% certain about it).","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-09-07T06:40:39.248+0000","up_votes":130,"down_votes":5,"body":"It did make ban phase easier.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-09-07T07:11:49.582+0000","up_votes":60,"down_votes":5,"body":"Touche.","replies":[{"poster":"Pada1","date":"2015-09-07T13:22:58.286+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":75,"body":"why does Riot feel so much urge to make juggernauts a thing. no one asked for this to be viable, they are so boring to play and play against.  bring back assassin meta at least they are squishy and skillbased.","replies":[{"poster":"Ferus and Ferrum","date":"2015-09-07T13:35:33.250+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":7,"body":"The adc mains will bitch about being oneshot tho,,, Oh wait, they cry about every meta :/","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-09-07T14:23:41.021+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":5,"body":"Tank meta: \"I can't kill him and he deals too much damage!\"\nBruiser meta: \"Nobody peels for me and they kill me too fast!\"\nAssassin meta: \"I can't do *anything* I just get blown up when I walk out of base!\"\nMage meta: \"This is almost as bad as the assassin, since they can CC me to keep me from kiting!\"\nSupport meta: \"My supports are too stupid to peel for me right! the enemy ADC got fed first!\"\nADC meta: \"I can't play my main role because everyone keeps first picking ADC and banning my favorite champs!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Tellua","date":"2015-09-07T15:20:28.910+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":4,"body":"Woah, it's almost like Riot created an entire role that most people don't enjoy playing in most metas.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-09-07T16:11:21.798+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":2,"body":"Support.","replies":[{"poster":"Draazur","date":"2015-09-07T18:23:28.905+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":9,"body":"Support is way more fun imo, lots of impact on the game and flash tibbers is always awesome :D","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-09-07T18:57:56.514+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> and flash tibbers is always awesome :D\n\nPlease report to the institute of war for re-education.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spiritriser","date":"2015-09-07T21:28:08.871+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except Riot didn't create the role, it was developed as the most effective use of your 5 champion slots by pro players.

This is not only an unfair advantage he gets simply by putting one point into his W but also serves as the band-aid holding this rework together for him to succeed down in bot lane.\n\nWhich brings me to my second point; In SOlo lanes his weaknesses are SO glaring that he gets simply destroyed with no ways to play safe and escape ganks/push out lanes by himself. He gets completely obliterated by any range top laner and a gank's usually fatal.\n\nBot lane all his weaknesses get overshadowed with the help of a support, providing him peel, engage, cc, heck, he has NO weaknesses when paired up with a support, and herein lies the problem.\n\nAs I already mentioned in the millions of Mordekaiser threads I put up you should try and balance him as a champion and NOT on this gimmick, because it's not only unhealthy but limits his potential as a champion","replies":[{"poster":"Galeo","date":"2015-09-07T10:21:05.999+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"They already eliminated one of the most toxic aspects of his pre-rework solo lane experience;\nHis constant harass shielding him against any form of retaliation and making him turn ganks in his favor.\nThey reduced his shield gain and his major poke tool (E) was nerfed significantly.\nI see no reason for them NOT to make him fir into top lane since his duo lane's way too unhealthy imo","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-09-07T12:35:36.392+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I still fear getting close to him, especially as an adc with both tons of AS and/or crit. Its not fun. If they're support is good, he will always land his third Q, which can take from 1/3 to almost all my health (early to late). He's the first ADC I've ever seen to have a heal in his kit. And all he really needs is health because his kit doesn't really need any help, all except for the passive which you can continually make stronger and health also negates his cost.

Their dominance against other melee's is ok considering that's what they were supposed to do but when they run that fast no amount of mobility will save  your backline unless they manage to jump over a wall, sometimes not even then. Lower the mobility on deadmans plate and/or nerf the slow and you should be able to actually kite them again. Which is the intended weakness of the juggernauts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GelsominoKiller","date":"2015-09-07T10:26:19.904+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really appreciate those kind of posts by rioters. All hail Meddler, our supreme overlord.\n\nGaren: the change you proposed in this topic is highly needed, since getting an advantage against him often means losing the lane in the end. My feeling with him it's that you NEED to take care of him, but he's so tanky that often this commitement results in a lost teamfight. You can't ignore him, yet focusing him loses you the fight. Plus, if you focus him and fail, it's a disaster, since he will be back for cleaning thanks to his passive. **My opinions is that he drags away a lot of the opponent team's resources in the form of cc and peel, without committing much on his own** (he just pops W and keeps going). This is bad expecially when he's ahead. Maybe his E dmg scales too much, maybe the slow cleanse should be on his w, i don't know.\n\nDarius: i'm no expert here, won't speak.\n\nSkarner: in the eyes of a skarner lover like myself, **this rework was a missed opportunity**. I think right now he's more manageable, and generally heading in the right direction balance-wise, but i really wish that you took more time into making him unique and awesome. Like, as an example, **making his E cast like viktor's laser**, because, well, because it's hella cool. And **i wanted cool, unique interactions with your zones**, like hitting E on the crystal creating a rupture, or Q generating an earthquake... instead of those dull (but effective) steroids. **I also expected zone control minigame to be much more relevant and gameplay impactful**, a bit like altars on the Twisted Treeline. Right now you only take them when you're there, no planning involved. I'd like them more if they could be locked for 1:30/2:00: this would create intresting and unique interaction between the junglers (\"do i risk going in enemy territory to deny skarner his zone?\" \"do i want to take this altar to pressure the enemy jungler?\" \"there will be a dragon/baron soon, do i lock now or later?\").\n\nMordekaiser: again, i'm no expert. **You have a lot of good, thought-out feedback by many morde players like Malicious Metal. My suggestion is to look forward to it.** My opinion of this rework is that he's been forced into a viable (now op) botlane carry by nothing but questionable steroids, invisible power, and overall not-so-creative changes. His matchups are extremely binary: playing the wrong bot against him leaves you deeply unsatisfied and disappointed, just like you could do nothing but lose in this situation. Again, a missed opportunity: Morde is a champ with strong personality, but weak identity. His gameplay is old and trivial (yet it holds a lot of potential), and his looks outdated. **He COULD BE MUCH MORE**. He's the perfect candidate for a Sion-level rework, he needs it! But what we got is this rework, which did not solve any of the problems above, alienated the playerbase and resulted into a huge balance issue. While i **love** the other reworks, i strongly dislike morde's... forgive me for being brutal, but imo it's simply BAD.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Koldheartedjsp","date":"2015-09-07T07:42:47.813+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Oh.

As far as Garen goes, I would cut the numbers on his E, but make it so he gains the added true damage from Villain at max rank, so his power curve is a little less random, and he doesn't just burst the Villain of all things super hard.\n\nDarius... I'll admit, I'm happy to see the guy I mained for years finally fully viable, even if he's near permabanned. I'd still like his heal to be based on missing hp, as it's really his only reason to build more tank than damage. Take that away and he'll go back to old darius, building almost full ad and maybe triforce to burst people as fast as possible. The heal is a bit out of control though. \n\nI never played much of skarner, so im no expert, but a lot of his threat (besides the spires), seems to come from his stun. Combined with his ult, if he gets this off he's taking a player out of the game for a good while, all while claw-smacking him to oblivion. Maybe be a bit harsher on the refresh rate it gets?\n\nas for Morde... *sigh* I can't even talk about him without being sad. He was my only AP top bruiser man... he really was my numero uno...","replies":[]}]}
