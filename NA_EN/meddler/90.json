The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Preseason Timeline**\r\n\r\nCurrent timeline below for the various stages of the preseason rollout. Dates might change a bit if unexpected issues crop up, but this is what we're aiming for.\r\n\r\n1. Around October 10th we'll start by talking through our goals for the preseason\r\n\r\n2. We'll then show some of the key things changing in preseason in the 10th Anniversary Edition of Riot Pls livestream (15th of October, 6pm PST)\r\n\r\n3. Straight after that we'll get a written rundown of all the big preseason changes on the Nexus.  \r\n\r\n4. Preseason changes will start turning up on PBE around the 22nd of October. We'll have the changes on the PBE for a couple of patch cycles (~4 weeks) to give more time than usual to gather feedback, tune numbers, and fix bugs\r\n\r\n5. Preseason goes live on November 19th in patch 9.23\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**TFT PvE drop followup in next week's patch**\r\n\r\nWe've got some polish to the revised TFT PvE drop system coming in patch 9.19. Overall, the changes have performed as hoped, though there are some issues we still want to address:\r\n\r\n* 4 cost units will no longer come from PvE drops before Krugs (potentially too distortionary getting a 4 cost unit before any PvP rounds had even happened, even if in many cases it wasn’t a big deal)\r\n* There'll be a bit less gold dropped (we overswung a little and put a bit too much in, still want a fair bit more than in the old system though)\r\n* Neeko's Help will be a bit more common (rarer than intended, shouldn't be quite such a scarce resource)\r\n* Spatulas will drop less (these by contrast are turning up a bit too much, making Spatula based plays more reliable than intended)\r\n\r\n\r\nAround the time of the patch, we'll also share a few stats about how TFT's playrate looks for anyone interested in that side of things.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"AIQ","date":"2019-09-20T16:31:34.467+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hey Meddler, I’m just curious about QGT.  \n\nWhat are they for? Why do they exist? You seem to take no pleasure in doing them, more of a “I must do this and answer a few questions by tradition not obligation” vs actually interacting with player because you want to.  \n\nI was under the impression that they were here so that players could divulge feedback, ideas, and discuss champion related issues and changes with an actual Rioter in addition to learning about some future potential changes. It was for making the community feel like they could be involved and have a direct impact on the game and see what Riot thinks.  \n\nIf this is not the case, please be blunt about it.  \n\nI understand a lot (and I mean A LOT) of the board's ideas are bad, poorly thought out, or crazy, this board is hyper toxic, Reddit really is not that much better as well. But some post exist even here that are well done, thought out, genuine, positive, and nothing too restrictive or simply bug fixes that have been afflicting champions for a long time expressed in very constructive manners.  \n\nNone of these ever seem to be addressed except a few rare exceptions. For instance, Aug 2 a Sona ammo bar was asked for and it seemed to actually get enough traction with you to be worked on. However, you also said you’d let Shyvana scale with elder in 9.3.  \n\nQGT normally consist of the following... \n\nThe status of changes to the game announced, like TFT updates etc.  \n\nWhat Riot is planning on doing with X champion, disregarding all additional feedback. \n\nFuture plans Riot will do, usually no matter what. Teemo changes are one of those exceptions.  \n\nAnd lastly What do you think of X situation or X champion and its state.  \n\nIf their question doesn’t fall into one of these bland categories, it’s usually ignored. While as I stated exceptions exist, I feel like this is not what players really think about when it comes to QGT as reflected in the comments. This may as well be an announcement page vs a discussion. You are just informing people of the status of things. Perhaps you think I’m wrong but looking at the history of QGT for the past 4 months, that’s mostly what it is.  \n\nWith that said, I just want to ask two more questions.  \n\nIs there somewhere we can go to actually talk balance, should we even do that, or is that just a luck thing? Maybe a Rioter that cares will see it. Or is the communities' feedback in this regard essentially futile?  \n\nWhere can members talk about bugs that are hurting or even destroying certain champions? WW/Syndra/Poppy/Diana etc. \n\nMaybe you are wondering why? Why would you care?  We’ll I’ve seen these boards for a while now, true I’m mostly talking about Shyvana, but some people are pouring out genuine thought’s just to be overshadowed with pure Riot hatred since that gets the upvotes. You’ve seen it already; all you have to do is look at the Hot section to see the hatred. I just thought that over time it was, fixable, should Riot focus on the players that are genuine. I made this massive Shyvana rework post, it’s hyper detailed full of many ideas even an ultimate skin. I was having a blast, but I ice boxed it, because why put 10 more hours into it, when Riot won’t even acknowledge it, when I could be doing other fun stuff? \n\nPersonally, I just feel like Riot doesn’t care about anything a player says anymore, I’d hope that’s still not true. But I don’t see it even here. I mean look at the last week of red post. So I genuinely ask you Meddler, not as the voice for necessarily all of Riot, but at least yourself. What are QGT for?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-09-20T17:13:21.195+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"Fair question. Before I started doing these posts I'd instead wait until someone was asking about a topic we had something to share info on and post there. That did feel more responsive and organic which was great. Had a couple of major downsides though. The largest was that it ended up only reaching a really narrow audience (these get translated to other languages). Also would often run into situations where I figured we had something of interest to share but there wasn't a relevant thread someone had already started to post it in. These days I still read boards, Reddit etc as much but spend time writing these generally more than responding to other threads. There's downside to that, but I've felt it's a reasonable trade off overall.\n\nIn terms of why these are posted here it's because it's an easy to post on official location. The Boards community though is a tiny fraction of even the english speaking part of the playerbase, let alone the global playerbase. Opinions here are also pretty non representative relative to what we see from survey data (things like strong preferences for specific less popular champions, more interest in narrative overall, low engagement with ESports and strong negativity towards it etc).  I try and put some time aside to respond to what I can after putting a post up, but communicating back and forth specifically with Boards posters isn't a primary goal. I do worry somewhat that having an open comments section but then not responding to a lot of it implies a lack of caring, rather than a need to spend time elsewhere. I've considered either shifting to another venue, or just not allowing comments to at least make things clearer, but have felt those are worse than responding some of the time at least. Would welcome people's thoughts on that though.\n\nIn terms of what I cover these have drifted towards what we're working on more over time. I used to spend more words digging into specific projects, including a range of specific balance calls or individual champs. That's got a lot harder given my role has changed since I started these posts though. I don't get to spend much time each week directly with the balance or champion team devs any more for example, so I don't have the context on a lot of the specific decisions. I'll hunt some of it down when I can to respond to particularly common questions (or see if there is a useful answer at least). My role's more focused on long term planning, trade offs between different projects (resoucring), management etc though. Those are both harder to talk about externally and generally not what people are as interested in anyway versus the state of a particular champion or whatever.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-09-20T18:24:22.849+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=Hg0eMco2,comment-id=000f0000,timestamp=2019-09-20T17:13:21.195+0000)I've considered either shifting to another venue, or just not allowing comments to at least make things clearer, but have felt those are worse than responding some of the time at least.

I think it might be beneficial to trend towards avoiding the small-picture questions in favor of the larger scale questions however, because it may lead to players feeling like they have to pester you for information, and that isn't fun for you OR for the posters who aren't getting answers.\n\nI wonder whether including something to that effect in the QGT post itself might help decrease player expectations that you're here to answer specific board-user questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AIQ","date":"2019-09-20T17:39:10.829+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thank you for taking this much time on one post and it happened to be mine.

For me stats triumph here. However, the only thing is some suggestion made here are no opinion based. Like the Sona ammo bar is not something really needed for Japans input, it's more of a \"yeah that sounds good lets see what the team thinks.\" This is more the direction I was speaking of. \n\n>I do worry somewhat that having an open comments section but then not responding to a lot of it implies a lack of caring, rather than a need to spend time elsewhere.

It was great because it was:\n1. Fast-paced\n2. Let's you choose a champion unlike ARAM\n3. Gold acceleration from that map meant you get to late game builds/where your build starts to shine very quickly. This also enables for fun off-meta builds that work because they are not constrained by a long laning phase vs. a set of potential counters that you'd encounter in a normal SR lane. E.g. You can play AP Teemo and instead of fighting Riven/Renekton it's some random Miss Fortune or Ahri. This is very relaxed.\n4. More teamfighting but with the \"skirmish\"/vision fight battles of Summoner's Rift (absent in Howling Abyss)\n5. Each game is refreshing as the battle conditions change throughout each game.

Its music was spectacular and mysterious.. It was giving other sense of taste in league and that's it sth that TFT never had and will never have because every game mode you create its worse than the previous one. Keep it in the game because it is the only characteristic that has left to remember from old league of legends. But no , you decided to remove it as well and replace it with that rediculous TFT ahahah what a joke. Personally i believe that Tft shouldnt even be a game mode in league . It is nothing in front of twisted treeline. I WANT TO SAY TO YOU THAT YOU ALL DO IT FOR MONEY!!! You never listen to other ppl opinions. You guys are not receptive to other ppl feedbacks and judgements.

AP Ezreal has, for the most part, been much more harshly affected by these changes than AD Ezreal/Hybrid Ezreal.\n\nI'm going to be straight here and say that as an AP Ezreal one trick, it's been pretty rough. But complaining isn't what I'm here to do. I want to offer some ideas for balance directions so that AP Ezreal can co-exist with his botlane kleptomaniac counterpart(s).\n\nMake Q deal adaptive damage based on your AP or AD total. This means AD Ezreal no longer is dealing mostly physical damage if he chooses to go for a more hybrid route, while simultaneously making AP Ezreal a little stronger by allowing void staff (a core component of AP Ezreal's build) to work on his Q.\n\nRemove kleptomancy, revert nerfs. kind of a worst case scenario, as there are still other users of the rune, and removing an entire rune is pretty drastic, bit I'm just adding it here for completeness.\n\nRe-add the most recent Q damage AP Ratio nerf onto E's AP Ratio. This gives AP Ezreal's burst a bump up to pre 9.16 levels. Obviously still a slight buff to hybrid Ezreal as well, though generally AD/Hybrid builds want to hold E for escaping and not bursting.\n\nThis one's a little out there, but perhaps using a system similar to Kai'sa's passive, Ezreal can have certain changes to his abilities to make AP Ezreal a little stronger without letting AD Ezreal take advantage of them. For example, in my first suggestion, you might just gate that behind a 400 AP stat wall or something, making it really difficult for AD/Hybrid to opt for without really specializing into tons of AP. My second example is a little more extreme. You could add a similar AP threshold to W that makes it revert to a pre-rework state without any other changes. This allows AP Ezreal to have his AoE nuke back, and makes the spell borderline useless for AD and Hybrid builds (and also removes a muramana proc from their combos).\n\nAdd something to his passive to make it slightly more useful to AP Ezreal than Attack Speed. I'm no designer so my idea here is pretty bland. Rising spell force grants +X% bonus AP per stack. Numbers at your discretion, obviously. Hybrid Ezreal barely benefits here, while this definitely gives a helping hand to AP Ezreal.\n\nThanks for reading.\n- Your local AP Ezreal one trick","replies":[]},{"poster":"TaipaN9","date":"2019-10-07T15:34:05.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi meddler,I just wanna ask how season 9 is worser than season 8 idk This season is the worst one in my 6 years of league experiment\nfor ex:\nhttps://youtu.be/FynAC-iuSeg is this legal ?
