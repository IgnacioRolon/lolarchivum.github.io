The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n**Cursor Update**\n \nWe&#039;ve just started looking at updating LoL&#039;s cursor (it&#039;s certainly showing its age). Plan is to have an updated one in internal testing for a while. Once it&#039;s looking solid, we&#039;ll then get it onto PBE for a second round of feedback (best guess is that&#039;ll be a month or two away). We&#039;re taking a slower, more deliberate pace with that testing because of how impactful changes to interface elements like cursors can be, especially when you&#039;ve spent a lot of time using the previous version and are pretty accustomed to how it behaves. \n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**Is pre-minion spawn phase worth the time it consumes?**\n \nSomething we&#039;ve been talking a bit about lately is whether or not the phase when the spawning platform barrier is down, but minions haven&#039;t yet spawned, is worth the time (about a minute) it consumes. On one hand it can sometimes lead to cool invade, warding or counter jungle play. On the other hand most of the time it just results in people placing a ward or two and then alt-tabbing, spamming /dance etc. \n \nBeen wondering as a result whether we&#039;d be better off removing that phase and getting the game going faster, given it&#039;s so often a break in game flow right now. Would need to make a number of adjustments to compensate of course to things like trinket timings, champions who need set up time at camps, effects that support invading/counterjungling (so that&#039;s still able to happen in some form) etc. If we were to do so it&#039;s not something that would happen until preseason and it&#039;s still in the category of something we&#039;re thinking about, not something we&#039;re committed to doing. Would love to hear your thoughts on the concept.\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n**What on PBE is for 8.10 versus 8.11**\n \nBeen seeing some uncertainty as to which changes currently on PBE are potentially in 8.10 versus which are aiming for 8.11. Quick rundown below as a result for anyone interested:\n \n8.10:\n \n* Champion changes with the exception of marksmen base stat changes \n* Scuttle change, Runic Echo change, Talisman change\n* Bounty change\n* Plus likely some more champion adjustments that will come later in the cycle\n \n8.11:\n\n* AD item changes\n* Marksmen base stat changes\n* Hail of Blades (new Domination keystone)\n* Plus some other stuff that won&#039;t hit PBE until the 8.11 PBE cycle\n \nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"iServeAthena","date":"2018-05-04T15:31:22.276+0000","up_votes":119,"down_votes":4,"body":"Please don't get rid of the time before minions spawn.

This is doable, but would take time (Similar scope to the work we did on Rengar).  Was thinking of doing some exploratory work on her once I wrap up work on my current VGU.

You had 2 goals for Crit ADCs:\n\n- delay their power spike a bit more (done by increasing item costs on zeal items)\n\n- reduce their late game DPS/burst, especially against squishies. But from what I see the math shows that Shiv + RFC + IE does actually more dmg against squishies later in the game (a tick only) and way, way, way more dmg against tanks, but instead they have a very bad game till they get to 2.5 items.\n\nRight now I see the following problem of creating 2 extremes:\n\n- early/mid game ADCs will get a lot of power with 1-2 items while scaling ones lose power. Both together easily leads to one wanting to go passive an farm and at one point it just flips around and turns the table completely. You will get ADCs that try to avoid each other more than they want to fight till one side (early or late) starts to dominate and teams then play around that style and the other style becomes useless or not fun to play. That happens mostly because the extremes are too large (one sucks early the other one sucks late instead of one having a strong but not OP early and still a manageable late game). Making everything the same is bad, but making differences too extreme can be as bad.\n\n- late game ADCs get a larger 3 item power spike for +700g. They have the same power as before, just added +10 AD and a giant slayer + LWs ArPen passive added against tanks. At least the math says that the 20% true dmg conversion can keep up with these 2 passives and you get it extra for just 350g (the other 350g are for the 10 AD)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zippyHD","date":"2018-05-04T15:22:03.490+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hello meddler.\nAzuBK, said that he wanted to release LeBlanc weak/in a OK place(patch 8.8) and then buff her afterwards and fixing some bugs.

We think her gameplay should be healthier as well (more need to hit Q, more effort needed to set up strong ults). Change looks good so far directionally.\n\nIn terms of power, maybe more in a bit? Don't think we've got that much room to move though before we start risking pick/ban status again though so wouldn't want to rush things until we've better seen impacts of this change.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stacona","date":"2018-05-04T21:06:36.138+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you shorten the game start time then if someone disconnects...\n**PAUSE.**\n**THE.**\n**FUCKING.**\n**GAME!**\n\nHave a 60 seconds pause until everyone connects in fully, if the pause time runs out then the game ends like it never existed AND NO ONE GETS A LEAVER OR LOSS PENALTY! No one should get punished for disconnecting, just make it where the game no longer exists, at worse treat the disconnecter like a dodge penalty and leave it at that, you do not need to go further beyond that.\n\nAlso remove the current leaver buster penalties completely and make it like a glorified queue dodge, 5 minutes becomes 50 minutes and 30 minutes becomes 300 minutes (5 hours) and a 3rd tier which is something like a 24 hour timeout (this if the act happens within the same 24 or 48 hours of the previous act). Swift and immediate punishment, gets people to think about their actions with immediate consequence and does not remind them of their sins over any long period of time - the most effective correction is immediate, short term correction.\n\n****\n\nI WILL LET OUT MY SALT!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zed genius","date":"2018-05-04T15:29:45.999+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Removing the pre minion spawn phase feels really random to me. What if it can just end up in people just placing a couple of wards and then doing nothing for 1 minute, it's literally one minute, it's not like 5 or 10, doesn't seem like a big deal to me and it would just prevent some cool stuff like invades from happening","replies":[]}]}
