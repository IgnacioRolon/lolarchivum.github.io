The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n**Early assessment of Elder Dragon and Baron changes from 8.4**\n\nWe took a look last week at how the recent Elder Dragon and Baron changes impacted regular games. At that point at least (this was pre Banner of Command popularity) we were seeing:\n\n* Teams would take Baron a bit more often. There chance of winning the game after taking Baron didn&#039;t change meaningfully however, though when they did win they tended to do so a bit faster than previously.\n* First Elder Dragon was getting taken as often as previously and, when taken, had the same correlation with victory as previously. \n* Second+ Elder Dragon got taken significantly more often (50% more games with a team getting more than one Elder dragon). When that happened their win % did increase significantly (from 69% chance to win after taking Elder 2 in 8.3 to 78% chance in 8.4). \n\nOn the Elder dragon side of things that&#039;s what we were aiming for basically. Securing two Elder dragons is intended to give you a very large edge, even in a game that&#039;s close enough to go 45 minutes plus. The lack of Baron change is a bit surprising by contrast. The faster resolution to games that would have been won anyway&#039;s no bad thing (not drawing out games that are already over). The lack of any meaningfully increased chance to win off a Baron take&#039;s unexpected though, given the buff did get significantly stronger. We&#039;ll need to watch that for a bit longer, see how it affects pro play (where late game stall outs were more of an issue to begin with) and whether Banner of Command use does or doesn&#039;t influence things. Also possible that teams aren&#039;t taking full advantage of the extra power yet, so there could also be a bit of learning curve still to come too. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**Lissandra**\n\nWe&#039;ve got some Lissandra changes in testing with the goals of giving her a more satisfying passive, a bit more power, more reason to play proactively in lane and a bit more to optimize around. Still very much work in progress, and no particular release date yet. Summary of what&#039;s in testing below and feedback on it much appreciated, bear in mind any of the details could still change though:\n\n* Passive - Old passive removed. New passive grants Lissandra bonus damage against targets she has previously impaired the movement of (slow, root, stun etc). Bonus damage scales with AP (0.2 at present), basic attacks get half the bonus damage spells do. \n* W - If it hits 3 or more targets its CD is significantly reduced and Lissandra&#039;s next spell cast costs no mana. Base CD increased somewhat, mana cost reduced. \n* Overall damage reduced somewhat on W, E and R to offset power in new passive (changes are intended to be power positive, but still need to take some damage from unempowered abilities to pay for extra damage on empowered ones).\n* Base mana regen, regen per level, starting mana increased somewhat.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n**Health Bar Positioning**\n\nWe&#039;ve got a change to how health bars get positioned for units near the edge of your screen that we&#039;ve just started testing. We&#039;re looking to make it so that a unit&#039;s health bar does a better job of showing you exactly where their hit box (should be directly below the health bar). At present though parallax error means that&#039;s less accurate the further from the center of the screen a unit is, especially on taller units. It&#039;s a subtle effect, but one that contributes to reported hitbox oddities on various spells. More details on that to come as soon as its PBE ready. In addition to parallax adjustments we&rsquo;ll also be lowering the heights on some health bars too, which also contributes to the problem. \n\nCurrent healthbar positioning:\nhttps://imgur.com/DzsBMd1\n\nMore accurate to hit box positioning:\nhttps://imgur.com/awLOO5Y\n \n","replies":[{"poster":"ImaginesTigers","date":"2018-03-07T16:57:39.853+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thoughts on Syndra right now?

He's already way too ult dependant and forcing him into the ult-bot role even more is just uncalled for, and quite frankly, I'm getting sick of it after 6 years of this being Rumble's main balance philosophy. \n \nPlease focus more on improving his base kit, as currently this is the main problem that Rumble has, W and E feel really underwhelming at early levels, while Q doesn't compensate for that because it's either really easy to avoid, or ignore its damage with how strong hp regen is nowadays. Have you maybe thought of significantly reducing his safety (reducing ability ranges, decreasing the effectiveness of Rumble's passive playstyle) in favour of him actually being able to fight people at melee range? As mentioned before, his base kit isn't encouraging Rumble enough to actually get up-close and personal (which is what he's meant to do), his low base stats prevent him even further from approaching enemies at close ranges while his ranges are long enough to let him poke/farm from range, but again, his effectiveness in fighting champions is very low, therefore Rumble's overall laning phase came down to being as uninteractive as possible, it's not even about not attracting minion aggro or anything like that, it's about fighting your opponent not being worth it anyway, so why bother playing agressive.","replies":[{"poster":"BratwurstZ","date":"2018-03-07T18:44:34.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rumble needs a little buff to his ult.

Thanks in advance if you do so!\n\nAs a Rumble main (over 2000 Rankeds with him, peaked Diamond IV) that fell in love with the little Yordle four years ago, I have to add my self to the choir saying that right now he is disgustingly weak. \n\nIn the last four/five months, I tested him in like 100 games on another account of mine (Siddharta) and I have to say that his lane phase is non existent,  you can be bullied from everyone. Runes reforged completely destroyed him after he was already struck by the nerfs of  patch 7.12\nIf you also add the mobility of the champions, shields, lockets and redemptions available, he is amongst the worst champions in the game at the moment.\n\nLet me be clear, the only way to play him right now is to play passive pre-level six and all you can do is to hope that in the mid-game range, let's say 15-25 minutes, you can actually end the game. And all of these premises, are based on the fact that you can place a GREAT ultimate during that time. \n\nThat's it, and it's really sad.\nI believe in you guys, I love the game, I appreciate your efforts and I would like that the blue yordle can receive some love in terms of buffs so that he could be viable again. \n(And maybe, since Jarvan, Swain and Urgot (rework) got their new skins, we can hope to get one for him too in the future.  Release date was April 2014! ^^)\n\nHis kit right now is carrying the weight of time, he needs to be properly buffed or reworked .(I hope not honestly, would take too much time and we Rumble players would become mad at you :P J/K We love you)\n\nI perfectly understand why you nerfed/changed him in patch 7.12, don't get me wrong, competitive play is really important but, if you nerf his early phase that much, kinda taking his bully nature away, you should then compensate him with either a hard scaling capability or a skill rewarding damage. I think that this third option should be pursued, since you don't have to actually put too much time on it (second choice) nor you are risking that he becomes overtuned (first scenario stated above). \n\n\nSome brainstormed ideas: \nFirst part are quotes  from lol wikia abilities.\nQ- Reduce his cooldown. Like seriously, you can' t anyway anymore bully with it level 1 or 2 because you can't be in the heat zone. At least give it a bit of respectable power pre- level 9. You really changed Rumble by changing his Q, that was a very impactful thing.\nW- This spell appears to be weak but not that much important, nothing to really change there. Acceptable.\nE-Hitting the same target with another harpoon enhances the Slow icon slow (stacks additively) *==> Add also a % dmg after the first harpoon on the same target*( Skill rewarding)\nR- Rumble deploys a barrage of rockets 1000 units down the target path, landing in a line over 1 second and lasting for 5 seconds.\nEnemies within the line of rockets take magic damage every second and are Slow icon slowed by 35%.\n130 / 185 / 240 (+ 30% AP) Magic Damage per Second *==> Make his ult enhanced. Like, seriously. Look at the stats, they are a joke once you pass the 25 minutes mark. Either buff his %AP or make it that it can slow like 55% or simply make it a nuke bomb as it was before (Reverted)\n\nThese, are just some of the ideas that crossed my mind or that I took from the Reddit's Rumble main section. Of course, there is no need to buff all of his abilities OWO.\n\nTL DR; There is no TL DR, read it *W*","replies":[]},{"poster":"FervorRumble","date":"2018-03-07T17:44:44.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally, i would go for extra slow on the ult, should be at least 50-60% at rank 3 like anivias. and us rumble mains would love to see the return of his old Q and heat mechanics.","replies":[{"poster":"FervorRumble","date":"2018-03-07T18:06:49.289+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"quite frankly it's disgusting that nasus can beat rumble at level 2 if he chooses to","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rumble Kid","date":"2018-03-08T16:07:05.436+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, have you guys thought of reverting Q changes you did in 7.12?

Now it's quite common to see people farming while Rumble Danger Zone Q is up after they get their Spectre Cowl, because their Resolve tree + Doran Shield allows them to do so.

Liss world here !\n1. Passive: Its nice that youve granted her more power after impairing an enemy champion and thats a perfect passive now!\n2. Im generally skeptical about her mana use... I know that mana regen has been increased but her old passive helped her a lot with free mana! And you cant always land w on 3 targets AND that costs mana aswell... So i need to spend mana that i dont have in order to get it?\n3. She is weak in lanes so reducing her damage is harsh as she does need to engage in fights and she literally needs to be next to the target(W) in order to snare them....INCREASED HP WOULD BE GREAT\n4. Manaflow band nerfs affect lissandra greatly so nerfing that and removing her passive causes her to have mana problems!

She still has nothing on the PBE and there was nothing mentionned about her since then (even though the bug fixes did not add power to her) apart from Riot Penguin, who said: ''Yeah, Syndra's in a pretty sad spot right now unfortunately. I know she's on the radar of some balance team dudes.''\n\nSyndra has been weak since preseason. Patch 8.4 was another blow to her. Zoe is the only midlaner that is weaker than Syndra, and she's getting buffed. She is also not a good pick in the LCS, so it's not the case of her being strong in competetive and not in solo q.\n\nI'm hopping it's because they're using the opportunity of Syndra being weak to make changes to her ult or her passive Q and put power elsewhere (and that would be why it's taking a long time), but nothing was communicated. Could you please tell us if you know anything?\n\n(Side note, the 8.3 bugfix ''Fixed a bug where Syndra's W - Force of Will failed to make grabbed targets invulnerable to minion attacks'' seems to have partially worked. She doesn't drop the minion from it dying while holding it, but sometimes, when you throw a minion, you get no gold, as if the minion was killed by something else (prob another minion who auto-attacked while she was grabbing it)).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Heavenly Yasha","date":"2018-03-13T00:02:50.765+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Finally some love for Lissandra. \nThis champ has been forgotten and nerfed into the ground cause of his power in pro play, but she really needs something to make her viable again. She is one of the most squishy mages in the game at lv 1 (the second after anivia if i'm not wrong, but anivia has her passive to make her hard to kill) and one with the lower range too. She actually has no passive, and now it seems usefull just because her mana costs are really high. \nShe used to be one of the best mages for waveclearing, but now almost any midlaner has a lot of waveclear and push potential in lane, even more than lissandra, and her waveclear has become almost useless since baron buff gave minions magic damage resistance. \n\nShe has problems trading in lane with most of the midlaners and her roaming potential has been outclassed by other champions reworked or released in the last couple of years. She has a lot of aoe damage, that's true, but 1. she needs to go melee range to deal it, which forces her into building Zhonyas (it used to give 100 ap when lissandra got nerfed, now it gives 70 and doesn't give lissandra enough damage to be a good buy); 2. She is a single target burst mage too basically, and she is having problems bursting people since supports have so much tools to keep their carries alive nowdays.\n\nOfc I know lissandra might me not fun to play against if she is too strong, due to her single target lockdown, but honestly she has been outclassed hard by other champions and I really hope the changes can make her viable again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HackandWhackTime","date":"2018-03-07T19:27:24.308+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for doing these posts Meddler. \n\nHas your team been doing any work on Nautilus? {{champion:111}} \n\nHe has been underwhelming at a time when champions like Maokai have been successful in the Top lane {{summoner:12}}  and Jungle {{summoner:11}} , where Nautilus should shine.

The randomness of balloon spawns (long streaks of waves without balloons, influence of balloons being on melee or caster minions when laning against high pressure opponents...) as well as the requirement for Zoe to last hit them (causing frustration with careless/unaware allies, as well as conflicting with relic shield users) often makes the ability feel more difficult to use than it should be, especially considering some of her Q's power was moved there","replies":[]}]}
