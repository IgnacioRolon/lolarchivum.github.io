Really looking forward to seeing what you folks think, feedback on it&#039;s going to do a lot to help us understand whether to make it a permanent mode or not. Additionally, seeing as how today&#039;s a quiet day in other news I figured it&#039;d be good to take a look at some of the new stuff coming with it.\r\n\r\nThe new base area, now looking much less like a rough prototype:\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/zkjs0L0\r\n\r\nA new mini jungle area between the two lanes that we&#039;re trying out:\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ls0sc3O\r\n\r\nWalking Nexuses from the Sudden Death Event with new models:\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/JQ5UCt9\r\n\r\nA new event where champs are matched up in a series of 2v2s and 1v1s while the rest of the game watches:\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Y5ldHEx\r\n\r\nA new event reward, the Poro King, who&#039;ll help push lanes:\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/4atfYMh\r\n\r\nAnother new reward, the Battle Sled, which is a vehicle you and other allied champs can jump in.

It doesn't seem like you guys are addressing any of her actual problems. The rework is completely one sided and there has yet to be an exact explanation for this.\n\nThe good:\n1) Ally mechanic on Mantra W, but not really impressed with it. I am just happy she has an ally mechanic on Mantra W now.\n\nThe bad:\n1) Still lacks a clear niche and gameplay identity that separates her from other Mages and Enchanters.\n2) There is not enough skill expression in Karma's Mantra abilities to warrant using them in a more skillful way. Karma's Mantra abilities feel like a Heimerdinger upgrade ULT. How Karma's Mantra currently function is basic ability that is Mantra into stronger basic ability.\n3) The new Mantra W mechanic was removed from the game for a specific reason. The new Mantra W mechanic is support Karma oriented. The new Mantra W mechanic is not solving a problem but going to create more problems. Look at similar champions who have received the same treatment Karma is going to get in the 2019 rework: class updates that have almost all been reverted, Sejuani who has a similar mechanic that resolves coordinated play and the use of an ally, Ryze and his state and ULT, Kalista and her state and the requirement of an ally to be useful, and much more.\n4) Manta E exists in the game in several capacities. The function or part of the function of Mantra E exists on champion abilities and item actives.\n5) Buffing the strength of Mantra has not worked the past 5 years because the functionality of the kit doesn't work, Karma lacks an actual unique gameplay identity, and there really isn't much skill expression in Karma's Mantra. All of the buffs to Karma's Mantra abilities have been nerfed and reverted.\n\n\n--------------\n\n\nThe biggest disappointment is how much Karma's Mantra E is already in the game, but you and NueroCat think it is the most iconic and original concept on Karma.
