The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n**Some things we&#039;re looking at for 8.12**\r\n\r\nA lot of our time during the 8.12 cycle is going to go to monitoring the impact of the 8.11 midseason changes and making adjustments as needed. We&#039;re also planning on doing some other work as well though, some of that below.\r\n\r\nGifted Shields\r\n\r\n* Over the next few patches we&#039;ll be looking at Heals/Shields champions put on others. First thing we&#039;ll be testing, for possible inclusion in 8.12, is lowering the duration on some shields so that waiting them out&#039;s more feasible and timing for the user matters more.\r\n\r\nOrnn\r\n \r\n* We&#039;re potentially doing some work on Ornn. Goal there, rather than increasing or decreasing overall power, is to make him less of a safe pick when you don&#039;t yet know who he&#039;ll be facing in lane. That likely means giving him a clearer weakness enemy picks can capitalize on and giving him strength elsewhere.\r\n \r\nSejuani\r\n \r\n* Sej buffs didn&#039;t make it into 8.11 since 8.10 analysis and followup ended up taking more time than expected. They should be in 8.12 instead as a result.\r\n \r\nNew AD items\r\n \r\n* As I&#039;d imagine most of you have already seen we&#039;re working on a couple of new items that should appeal to fighters in particular. Balance and polish is still underway, expectation is we&#039;ll ship both Spear of Shojin and Atma&#039;s Reckoning in 8.12 though. \r\n \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Pulling the Ryze and Azir investigations**\r\n \r\nA little while back we mentioned that we were going to put less time into trying to close the regular play versus organized play divide on Ryze, Azir and Kalista so that we could put more time into other champs. Before that came into effect we wanted to try some changes we&#039;d been discussing for Ryze and Azir for a while. Those showed some promise, but also looked like they&#039;d require a fair bit more work to ship, with likelihood of some additional followup being needed too. We&#039;re iceboxing those changes as a result and won&#039;t be working on anything for those three champs that isn&#039;t just a regular balance adjustment for a fair while. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**Bounty Changes and Average Position Income**\r\n \r\nIn addition to concentrating gold on specific champions (more solo carry/individual snowball, but less team snowball) the 8.10 bounty changes also resulted in a slight decrease in average gold income in every position since that change decreased overall bounty gold in the system. Breakdown of that below for anyone interested.  As you&#039;d expect higher income loss happens in positions that tend to have less kill focused champs in them since they were hit hardest by the loss of team-wide bounties (enchanters/tanks in support, tanks/split pushers in top). \r\n \r\nAverage change in 8.10 versus 8.9 at 35 minutes:\r\n\r\nTop -325\r\nMid -260\r\nJungle -250 (though with very high variance from that average depending on the champion in question)\r\nBot -250\r\nSupport -420\r\n\r\n \r\nThat gold loss is low enough we don&#039;t have immediate plans to counteract it, especially given we&#039;ve increased income a bit over time in other ways, so pulling a bit out&rsquo;s reasonable. Will be watching it though, in particular to see if it pushes power spikes for particular positions or champs back too far in some cases.\r\n \r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2018-05-25T16:09:05.481+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"* On top of addressing shields will there be any hope of seeing ways for supports to empower other classes outside of marksmen more like her was done to nunu a while back\n\n* For ornn I personally feel that his brittle mechanic is simply a personal knock up tool rather than an anti tenacity tool for others.

She got 3 nerfs this season, namely Runes Reforged, her plants and new Liandries.\n\nShe used to go full magicpen runes, which is not possible anymore. If you look at the runes there is nothing where someone would say „yea thats a Zyrarune“, except maybe scorch, but more and more players are going Domination-Resolve on her. She lost damage on every ability, as compensation she got +40dmg on her E.\n\nThe plant Hp were a nerf at any stages. The compensation she got was resets on her plants and a buff to her passive. The result is, that shes obnoxious to lane against, but once thats over she still has her problems of not dealing enough damage. And the resets are no benefit, if she cant kill someone on her own in the first place.\n\nThird, Liandries is nerfed for Zyra. Generally, Liandries is not a good item currently (i only see it on swain? Else the opinion, especially from Master/Challenger players, is that its a very weak item). Zyra always had mediocre itemscaling and removing her most important item puts her in the spot she is, without reliable damage on both front and backline.\n\nHer damage output was balanced around her runes and Liandries. Even the Rylaisbugfix and later nerf did not affect Zyra too much, because her main power came from the mask. Now her lack of scaling in items make her get outscaled way too fast as well. And thats even worse for Midlane, which you wanted to help out in preseason.\n\nAnd there is another misconception, that i have seen in your Gameplay thoughts thread from weeks ago. You said it should be worth to focus Zyraplants, but that shouldnt be the case. It should not be worth to charge into a zone and killing the threats on her way easy. Even if its semi-easy it leads to frustration for the Zyraplayer. Thats not well designed gameplay. Thats why i think you should take away the quantity of her plants in favor for quality. Having half of her power in AI, does not lead to successful gameplay without her being toxic in low elo and useless in higher elo. The Zyraplayer wants to feel the power in her own hands, not wether the enemies are good enough to kill her plants. \n\nYou wanted to fix her counterplay in lower MMR, but reducing plant HP was a way bigger nerf to higher MMR. Players in Bronze->Plat barely notice any difference, while Diamond-Challengers feel her loss of power massively.\n\nTldr: If Zyra is weak, she doesnt deal enough damage. More lockdown doesnt help her too much.

I asked if you've considered _decaying _ shields as a solution in a previous thread. A bit too late to get a response. Bringing up the idea again.\n\nMy previous comment was in the May 9th quick thoughts thread. Here it is in it's entirety:\n\n\n\n> Have you considered having shields decay over their duration? Shields have to land preemptively but, lowering duration may not be as healthy in laggy solo que vs stable latency pro-play. Having the shield decay in strength over time encourages the same behavior of landing shields closer to when damage is inflicted.\n\n> Example: Let's assume Janna is shielding at the moment for 300. Her shield duration is currently 5 seconds.\n\n> Approach 1: Shield can decay to 0% over 5 seconds. Shield loses 60 every second. Janna shield will decay to 120 @ 3 seconds after cast.\n> Approach 2: Shield can decay to 50% over 5 seconds. Shield loses 30 every second. Janna shield will decay to 210 @ 3 seconds after cast.\n> Approach 3: Shield only starts to decay at 2 seconds but goes to 0%. Shield loses 100 every second after 2 seconds elapse. Janna shield will decay to 200 @ 3 seconds after cast.\n> Approach 4: Shield decay is delayed by damage taken/Damage taken applies to prospective decay first. Decay to 0% over 5 seconds is 60 shield every second. Taking 100 damage immediately means no decay will occur in first second and second second will see only 20 shield lost to decay. Janna shield power will be at 120 @ 3 seconds so long as damage taken to shield before that point is equal or less then 180.\n> Approach 5: Shield can decay to 0% over 3 seconds, however decay will only trigger when no damage is taken for 1 second. Shield losses 100 every decay tick. Janna shield will decay to 0 @ 3 seconds after cast if no damage has been taken.\n\n> Basically there's several ways that a decay can be set up. Depending on the counterplay you want from opposing champions and if you want total duration to be variable based on damage taken.\n\n> Janna's shield specifically also grants AD while it's up and 5 seconds of +40 (+10% ap) AD on a 10 second base cooldown is a lot of power when pushing towers or taking objectives. Approach 5 on her shield specifically would allow you to lower the free AD against towers and objectives without hitting it's in fight case too hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-05-25T16:26:22.593+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Decaying shields are one of the tools we've been considering.

In my opinion, the item feels very horrible to play against as a magic-damage champion.\n\nThe item currently is almost crippling against melee-AP (and quite a few AP-ranged) champions as the enemy becomes very difficult to burst down and you can't 'manage' the damage like you can Sterak's to avoid the shield. It's a flat percentage, once you get them low enough it WILL trigger. Once it triggers, you're rewarded with the enemy gaining not only the shield to survive- but a burst of AD, spellvamp, and lifesteal to make fighting you easy as they gain healing and damage to destroy you. So not only does it negate burst, but it makes it difficult to beat them with DPS since they're getting healing to help win on that front as well.\n\nEven if they don't fight you off- they've gifted with the sustain that lasts *while in combat* so they can very easily walk around in the creep wave and heal up. I've seen all-ins against Maw champions end with the Maw champion having more HP than the battle starts, with not a single healing item beyond Maw. Since it's not a static timer, they can almost chain the Maw procs to minimize the downtime and give you even less of a window to make your move- certainly a smaller window then the cooldown of most other 'defensive' items.\n\nThe item is currently a powerful defensive and offensive tool at the same time- but unlike other items in that bracket: Zhonya, Banshee, Edge of Night, Archangel's, there's no risk with using it because it will only ever be triggered when you need it. You also don't need to stack it up like Seeker's Armguard, Jaurim's Fist, or Tear of the Goddess so it's immediately effective even when buying Hexdrinker and all of the components are pretty cheap in comparison to other items as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2018-05-25T16:34:36.022+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Ornn\n\n>     We're potentially doing some work on Ornn.

When I lane against him it feels like he can just keep rotating through his spells during a fight.
