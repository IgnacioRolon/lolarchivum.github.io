The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n  \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Loading Screen**\r\n\r\nAs some of you will have seen by now we've got the first update to the loading screen live in NA at this point. We’re working on a couple of issues that have cropped up, expectation is we’ll be able to turn it on elsewhere as well fairly soon once everything is functioning as intended. We're still aiming to add some additional features to it as well, like a team chat window, in upcoming patches. Those patches will also be a great time to make any other needed changes, so feedback on what's there already much appreciated.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Rek'Sai**\r\n\r\nWe've got a pass on Rek'Sai underway at the moment, hoping to ship some changes in 9.4. Focus is overall on feel more than power, aiming to improve how it feels to play her primarily. The other piece of work we'd like to do on Rek'Sai is some power shifting so she's not a bit weak in average MMR while strong in high. While it's possible some clarity/QoL changes might help out a bit in that regard expectation is that will probably need to be separate work still at some point too.\r\n\r\nBiggest changes are:\r\n\r\n* R only being dodgeable if someone teleports a larger distance away (1000 units +, so similar behavior to other targeted dashes).\r\n* Burrowed Q grants 25 Fury like other spells do\r\n\r\nThose are then paired with some smaller adjustments to things like Fury bar color when full, clearer Tremor Sense VFX for champions, auto burrow on respawn. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Conqueror**\r\n\r\nWe've got some Conqueror changes likely for 9.4. Those are part of our ongoing work on hitting problematic damage cases or lack of effective enough defensive options, alongside things like the Ignite/Smite upgrade changes, revised crit items, nerfs to out of line damage heavy champs like Brand/Zyra etc. They're also targeted at addressing some more Conqueror specific problems:\r\n\r\n* Lack of windows playing against Conqueror (it's almost always up)\r\n* Conqueror negates intended weaknesses on some champion's kits too strongly (bad against tanks primarily)\r\n* For a rune intended to be chosen for its sustained damage Conqueror's output's often quite bursty.\r\n\r\nDirection we're trying as a result:\r\n\r\n* Gives Adaptive stacks on damaging champions with spells or abilities, making damage output backloaded and not something you can prepare with minion combat.\r\n* Now requires max stacks (5 at present) to trigger true damage conversion and converts 10% instead of 20%, substantially reducing Conqueror's ability to negate defenses by itself while still hopefully serving as a useful safety valve on defense stacking.\r\n* At max stacks also heals for same amount converted to true damage, moving some of its power to keeping users healthy enough to stay in sustained fights longer, rather than in dealing enough damage to make those fights shorter.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**9.3 follow up**\r\nThoughts on a few champs post 9.3 now it’s been out a few days\r\n\r\n* Akali - As expected is in a very weak spot. Our plan is still to put power back in once we’ve got a good on the most appropriate ways to do so (don’t want to just reintroduce her as a major problem). Looking into that already, timeline’s uncertain (9.5 more likely than 9.4)\r\n* Kai’Sa - Seems to be struggling a bit post item changes. Not confident yet how much of that to attribute to items just leaving her in a weak state versus builds having not yet shifted to whatever her new optimal is. She tends to get affected harder than most by changes to items given the breakpoints she needs to hit for her abilities. Open to buffing her if needs be, but don’t want to do so before we’ve seen a bit more play and adaptation to the changed state of things. \r\n* Yasuo - Looks too strong post crit item changes, also not unexpected. We talked about whether we should bundle nerfs in with 9.3 but concluded we were better off seeing where he landed to understand how much power to take out. Nerfs expected in 9.4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Tylosus","date":"2019-02-08T16:51:40.206+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":28,"body":"Hey Meddler\n\nHow are Akali mains expected to play a 38% winrate champ without changes for over a month?

I seriously don't understand why he can't be changed to fit the bruiser archetype that was intended instead of this pseudo-assassin lethality monster that he became due to pro influence. That is his only issue, let him have better base stats, better base damages, lower his AD scaling to make him less reliant on full AD to be able to do any kind of damage. The E change sort of accomplishes this in a heavy handed way by saying that he'll no longer be able to easily burst carries. So why then haven't his stats been changed to reflect his new role? His base stats are on the level of an assassin, and his lane sustain has been removed. In the past balance members said that champs with lane sustain should have very low base stats to compensate. Well, he has no more sustain from minions, but you didn't think to buff his base stats besides the regen compensation? I'm not sure how many geniuses are at Riot, but really any person with reasonable knowledge about this game should be able to see that this champion is essentially on Ryze or Azir level currently. Same with Akali, and I read your Akali reply below that essentially says you are ok letting the dedicated mains get fucked over for a few patches because you can't sit down and work up a solution. The amount of pro play influence that is forced upon the regular players is unreal and makes for an extremely unhealthy environment. Why is my favorite champion, who has such a low winrate, still being nerfed? Oh right, pro play, because he's 98% pick/ban there. Is it really too much work to just, halt other projects that are less important and sit down and commit to fixing these champions within one patch? Leaving them dead and broken for 2-3 patches brings no esteem to your company.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"haaaaaaalp","date":"2019-02-08T16:50:04.550+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":5,"body":"Shouldn't ranged attacks not give full stack for the new conqueror?

I really appreciate being able to understand what is going on behind the scenes and what is coming. As someone who plays a lot of Rek'sai and loves her thematic, I'm really happy that you guys are looking at doing some QOL buffs. If you are looking for a few more areas to touch up, I have three places she really feels bad, although these would be bigger buffs than the ones on the PBE right now.\n\n1. Rek'sai's passive is really terrible, and while it feels barely necessary for early clears, late game it's completely useless since it doesn't scale on a champ that usually stacks health items. Maybe implementing a health or ad scaling would help with this?\n\n2. It kind of sucks as Rek'sai to have to unburrow and then reburrow to be able to use any healing from your fury bar. I think this will be especially apparent with the new changes causing Q to give fury while burrowed.\n\n3. I know this is the most contentious one, so I saved it for last, but Rek'sai's tremor sense is really unreliable, and this issue is only made more apparent with high latency. As someone who very recently struggled with maintaining a consistent connection, her Tremor sense became less of a tracking tool and more of a hidden notification that someone was near me that could also bait me into dying. At one point I dove into three people because they stood on top of each other at the exact moment my tremor sense went off and it didn't update again to show me them once they split up immediately.\n\nIf any of these changes could be implemented, I really think that Rek'sai will feel a lot better to play.

Since his rework a lot of bugs has been reported by WW mains (check reddit or youtube). As a former Warwick main I won't say that he had bugs but I would say that playing this champ doesn't feel enjoyable anymore with the indirect nerfs,he's now clunky as hell ! In my opinion his 2 big issues right now are the ways his W and R work. \nThe W is filled with bugs specially because it's supposed to work out of combat : It happened that Warwick suddenly stopped running just because there were minions in the surroundings without even an ennemy champion, or a W passive that doesn't even trigger even if I could see a low HP (less than 50%) target on the map forcing me to use the long CD active.Also, His R needs in my opinion a more generous hitbox. This ultimate alone used to put me in a lot of bad situations (range suddenly changing when casting ult etc) finding myself jumping through my target and in the middle of ennemy team.\nAside from these gameplay changes/fixes that would make playing this champ more enjoyable I could also suggest some small buffs that could help him without making him overpowered :\n1 - Small base MS increase (The 5ms you took from Irelia ,just give them to warwick) \n2 - Small base attack speed buff : his first clear even if it's somewhat healthy thank to his Q and passive it's still very slow. \n3 - HP growth buff : This is meant to fix the issue of Warwick players forcing to build cinderhulk/titanic then tank items on a champion that has a kit built on dealing damage (specially on hit damage) making bloodrazor (or even Warrior) based builds (that synergyze better with his kit) less viable options.\n4 - Reduce Q's mana cost.\nOf course, he doesn't need all these changes but one or 2 of these should make him feel better (after bugfixses and QOL changes of course). \nI hope this won't get downvoted by people saying \"Oh Warwick is a noob champ with a good winrate\"...(In my opinion, the fact that he's not played that much and have a bad winrate in a competitive region like Korea is enough proof that he's not that strong even with his \"decent\" 52% winrate on champion.gg).\nThank you for reading that long comment :)\nCordially,\nHedi Sama.\nEDIT : Nerfs to Yasuo are welcome (focus more on nerfing his defenses than his damage).
