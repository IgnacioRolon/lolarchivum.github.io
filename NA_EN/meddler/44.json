As far as mid-season itself goes we should be in a position to talk a lot of details in a few weeks at a guess. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**MR/level**\r\n\r\nOne of the issues we&#039;ve been looking at for our mid-season defensive item work is whether we should be adjusting MR/level to account for the removal of Aegis aura in the pre-season last year. That aura, even at only 10 or 15 MR, composed a meaningful proportion of some champions total MR in many games, which has left those champs significantly more vulnerable to magic damage. We&#039;re testing giving a small amount of MR per level (0.5 at present) to champs who don&#039;t currently have any as a result. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Karthus**\r\n\r\nTouching on Karthus since he&#039;s been asked about a fair bit recently and he&#039;s one of those champs we haven&#039;t talked about in a while. We don&#039;t have any current plans for Karthus, we are keeping a closer eye on him than usual right now though because of the Exhaust nerf that just went through (want to see how much that does/doesn&#039;t impact him).\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Some 7.7 Balance Changes**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve just started our work on 7.7. We&#039;re still planning out what exactly we&#039;ll be focusing on, some likely candidates though include buffs to Lissandra (since we didn&#039;t find something we were happy with in 7.6) and Bard plus a nerf to Graves. Less certain are possible Lux and Kassadin buffs plus another look at Udyr and consideration of some other junglers. Aatrox followup&#039;s very possible, though what depends on how he performs over the next week or so of course.

Would you consider making it purple like Blood Price instead? Then you could change his energy bar to be purple when Undying is off cooldown as well. This would reduce the amount of colors he has, making him ... more complete? I don't know how to describe this. He wouldn't be all over the place. It would also be easier to recognize than the difference between red and light red. \n\n-The closest thing to Hellbent that we currently have is Darius' Noxian Might which just immediately tells you what bonuses you get instead of creating a sub-paragraph and a sub-title for the effect. Would you consider looking at how that's written and then adjusting ~~Undying~~ Hellbent to be similar? League isn't very consistent in its description writing so every time something new comes out or something is changed it would be nice if you could strive to make it as similar as possible to what already exists. Also, using \"Hellbent\" so often in one description is just weird. Colored Keywords should be used as seldom as possible. And having three paragraphs with each their own titles is also a bit much. \n\n-Volibear's passive also restores 30% Health and doesn't do this, but a lot of new abilities just show the actual value in the correct text color and then the mathematical value in parenthesis (just the opposite of what Aatrox does). Could you adjust that and Volibear's passive, please? (Volibear's passive doesn't even show you how much it heals).\n\n-The current standard for revive effects with a cooldown is to write a sentence that says \"This ability has a X second cooldown\" instead of putting the cooldown in parenthesis or writing it on the right side. It also shows the number in normal text color instead of white despite scaling with level. Could you either adjust Aatrox's Undying to fit Anivia and Zac or Anivia and Zac to fit Aatrox's Undying?","replies":[]},{"poster":"EmperorPengu","date":"2017-03-16T17:14:01.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just buff turtle stance.

A player who gets good at Ivern can climb to a point if they play him a lot where their MMR is appropriate for their Ivern play, but too high for their play on other junglers that test different skillsets. That leads to a cycle of 'win games on Ivern, climb MMR, play other stuff you can't play at that level, lose MMR thereby putting you at a rating that'll give you easier Ivern games again so you climb back up'. It's a pattern we see on some other champs with odder playstyles too (Singed being a classic example). \n\nHaving said all that Ivern also looks like he's potentially just too strong in general. Need to be careful using winrate as too much of an argument for that though given it doesn't reflect objective power but instead muddles success with a lot of player preference, playstyle and meta stuff. Win rate does tend to be better for measuring changes to a champion's power by contrast for a patch by patch comparison, though even then you need to filter out things like the need to relearn how to play as/against a champ if it's more than just a simple numbers change.","replies":[{"poster":"Dessem","date":"2017-03-16T22:16:01.817+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Understandable, it's why I pointed out his shield can feel rather frustrating to play against. Because he levels it first and reaches level 9 before other shielding champions (typically only Janna maxes shield first, and she reaches level 9 later), he'll have a stronger shield than Janna with a lower cooldown at that stage in the game. It's augmented by his item builds (which complement his shielding aspects), leading into a low cooldown shield that is rapidly re-applied, and not necessarily weaker than a dedicated duo lane support until later on in the game.\n\nI fielded the winrate as an explanation that it not only feels frustrating to play against, but there's also something about Ivern that makes him wildly successful in games. I think it's because his invades are very good (can steal buff at level 1, which requires laners to dedicate time to stopping Ivern over laning; either lose early lane advantage or lose buff), as well as that unlike other junglers, he doesn't have to surrender gold and experience to provide his laners with a buff.\n\nHaving an Ivern on the red side of the map means the top laner can easily pick up a red buff numerous times, whereas a non-Ivern top laner usually doesn't see red buff unless he pries it from the enemy jungler's dead hands.\n\nI think that's probably one of his strongest assets he brings to teams: the guaranteed buff for his laners unless he's counter-jungled. It's possible that just means Ivern needs to be counter-jungled more, but I'm not a jungler so I can't shed light on whether that's feasible enough. I do think it's part of Ivern's package that makes him generally strong, though, since he can surrender buffs to his allies at no cost to himself, whereas traditional junglers do have to pay a cost to give blue to Mid (and virtually never give buffs to Bot/Top during laning phase).\n\nTo recap: Ivern has a bunch of things that can feel frustrating to play against, or that provide his allies buffs without necessarily working for them, and his winrate prompted the question whether he's on your radar or if you're happy with him.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Risk of Fate","date":"2017-03-16T17:18:40.681+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Luxanna Magica","date":"2017-03-16T17:29:02.234+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fate Fire,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=Zuddmxm1,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2017-03-16T17:18:40.681+0000)\n>\n> LUX DOES NOT NEED BUFFS!
