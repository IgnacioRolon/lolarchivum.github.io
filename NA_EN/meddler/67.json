We’re happy to announce it’s coming to PBE today. We need your help testing it out and your feedback to make it better.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/RerWGcx.jpg[]\n\nThe loading screen is one of the oldest parts of League, and it’s one of the only places you get to show off to your team and your opponents, so we took great care in reworking it. We had a few goals in mind with these changes:\n\n* Make it easier to strategize and plan with your team.\n* Make it easier to size up your opponents and teammates.\n* Clean up the visuals so it’s a little easier on the eyes.\n\nHere are a few highlights of the improvements you can expect to see:\n\n* **Team Chat** - Now you'll be able to chat with your team while everyone's loading. Use this to talk about lane matchups, plan an early invade, and get coordinated with your team! No talking to your opponents though, as you can't use All Chat.\n* **Voice Controls** - While loading, you could ALT+Tab to control voice before, but who wants to do that? Voice controls will now be just a click away, right next to chat.\n* **Spell and Rune Tooltips** - No need to memorize every rune icon anymore. Now you can hover your opponents’ spells and runes to see more details about their builds right there. We also hope this is a particularly big plus for players just learning the game.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/qVffLdY.png[]\n\n* **Click a champion** to see more info - We’re introducing the “back” of the player card as a place to see more details about players and their champions. Click any player to see their honor, ranked armor or level border, and champion mastery. You’ll only be able to see your teammates’ border and icon, not your opponent’s, but you will be able to see your opponent’s champion mastery and honor.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/voExwwG.png[]\n\n**Lots of little improvements:**\n\n* Your summoner name will always be shown in gold and your team will always be at the top so you’re a bit easier to find.\n* We also have a new indicator for which side of the map you’re on in the game header, since we used to communicate this with team position.\n* A new carousel will show gameplay tips, details about events, and lore tidbits with space to show images as well. If you have thoughts about what other content could go in here, let us know!\n* No more hunting around for loading info with a consolidated loading bar in the game header.\n\nWe also heard you loud and clear that you really valued the personalization and prestige of summoner icons, so we’ve tossed the skin tier gem you may have seen in the Ranked 2019 video and put summoner icon on the front instead.\n\nThank you so much for your feedback so far, and we hope you’ll give us more! We do reworks like this because we really do want to make the game better for everybody, and we listen to you to determine how those changes are working out. We’ll be looking out for your thoughts on the new loading screen and for any issues we see as it soaks on PBE. As a heads up, since this is brand new tech for loading, the possibility of crashes will be a little higher than normal, and we’ll be hunting aggressively for those to make sure the full launch is as stable as possible. Even after launch, this won’t necessarily be done. We’ll be looking for opportunities to make more improvements, and your feedback will be essential to making sure the end result is great for all players. Try it out, let us know what you think!","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-11-19T17:44:23.799+0000","up_votes":130,"down_votes":3,"body":"\\>people will be able to tell when i'm first time yasuo in loading screen\n\nuh oh","replies":[{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2018-11-19T19:32:53.749+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Moody P,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=p6NAL9mx,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-11-19T17:44:23.799+0000)\n>\n> \\>people will be able to tell when i'm first time yasuo in loading screen\n> \n> uh oh\n\nPeople see I'm almost 1.1 million on Vayne.\n\nEnemy Jungler will sit me.\n\nI can't wait.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Avenger Ghost","date":"2018-11-19T18:02:28.019+0000","up_votes":124,"down_votes":5,"body":"Dear Developer who reads this,\n\nI am a student at the university of Vienna. I am in my last year and currently writing my bachelor thesis. I am writing about Transculturality in gaming on the example of League of Legends. I am a huge fan of your game, I love playing and I am very impressed with the work you do. League of Legends is my favorite game and that is why I am so keen on writing about it. \n\nMy main focus would be the characters and the universe and I would like to discuss where to ideas for the characters came from. Some have obvious links to Egyptian or Japanese mythology, with some I really don’t know. To be able to fully go in depth with this I would like to request a short (skype) interview with one of you. \n\nI know it’s preseason, I know it’s always busy, but I would love to talk to someone about this and get some insight from someone who actually works on the champs where you take your ideas from and what corners of the world the ideas for the champions are taken from. I would love to hear from you, I am really hoping for a reply. \n\nKind regards,\nAvengerGhost","replies":[{"poster":"WillingSoul","date":"2018-11-19T21:21:19.978+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"logged in just to upvote, that sounds like a really cool thesis, good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Avenger Ghost","date":"2018-11-19T21:37:14.793+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much, much appreciated!

Have you tried sending a support ticket for your project btw, that might help? Oh yeah maybe for references with the Runeterra world like you said earlier, Shurima definitely links to Egypt like Nasus to Anubis, Renekton to Sobek, and Azir to Ra. Ionia also represents feudal Japan. Others that I can think of but not hard confirm are Piltover/Zaun to the industrial age in Europe (and to an extent America), Frejlord to the barbaric ice age with some Native American theme as well as nomads. Noxus possibly Russia in terms of thematics and goals but don't take my word for it? Bilgewater is Caribbean/pirate themed. Mount Targon seems to be based off of Mount Olympus with some monk aesthetics. Even some vastayan tribes like Rengar's resemble (but maybe stereotypical) Native American tribes too. I'm not too sure about Demacia but it seems to be highly medieval aged with the exception of them despising magic.","replies":[{"poster":"Avenger Ghost","date":"2018-11-21T20:37:59.550+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Already did, unfortunately they could only point me to the forums. So I tried this :) who knows\nyep! I I would have said Demacia represents the US (freedom and justice theme), but the medieval stuff I ll look into, Noxus representing Russia or the British empire, as they are/were rivaling factions. \nIonia for me is not only Japan but China too, if I think of Lee Sin and Wukong, I believe they are based on Chinese myths. Freljord the north, yeah. \nLooking at Olaf you find the connection to Norse mythology already in the name of his r, Ragnarok (which is the end of the world as described in the Edda, the Norse mythology \"book\"). \nMount Targon for me represented the world of the gods and the Shadow Isles the world of the dead. \nWith Piltover/Zaun I wasn't sure, I think that is a bit of a mix. I thought maybe Korea, since one side is so highly developed and the other so little. \nI really hope I get to someone, so I can pin it down for sure, else ill just have to go with the evidence and ideas I find. \nThanks for the help tho!

Oh, I just remembered that Ornn, Volibear, and Anivia are all demigods who are also siblings of each others and Ornn does reference the dwarfs who forged mjolnir, gungnir, draupnir, etc. It never came to my mind that Demacia represents US but that is good to know. To add on to what I was thinking, maybe the blessed isles (shadow isles before the {{item:3153}} king turned it into shadow isles), was like Europe during the Renaissance especially since there were universities and libraries but with some magic themes in it though I could be wrong.\n\nEDIT: Btw, have you also looked at Runeterra's updated map for references?

That is always considered as a Dark Age. After the Renaissance there isn't really such a downfall. \n\nYes. I love the new map. I will definitely have a better look into that still.

Although my English is not good enough like local players. However, this article is my painstaking effort, i earnestly request designer and balance team can see and think about this. I spent a lot of time to write this. This article was sent to many website in China, it had many comments and agreements in different websites in China such as bilibili, Baidu post Bar, NGA, Weibo, Zhihu and so on. Clearly, it can represent many ideas of Chinese players. The topic is \"Full analysis and advice about the rework of Akail\" This is the text:\n\nI am a challenger player on Akali in S6 and S7. I think new Akali is not a successful rework.\n\nSince the new version of Akali came out, it can be said that it was frequently boarded on the LOL Pro League (LPL, LCK and so on) , and general players have followed this. This champion can always appear in \"TOP 10 operation show\" matches in Pro league. However, in ordinary games, the win rate of Akali haven't higher than 50%, especially in mid line (always in about 45%, and lower than 40% in 9.3).The balanced team nerfed her constantly since she was reworked. Actually, her performance is not actually very showy in Pro league. However, what is the reason that she always can appear in Pro league.\n\n1, Stability advantage on top line, in LPL, most professional player afraid solo killed in the match, once they was solo killed by other professional players, there are many news in each forum and board talking about their performance. Obviously, Akali can suppress most champions on top line, when she get a litter advantage, she can kill other champions continuously. We know Pro leagure is not same as ordinary games, the other line usually do not have the condition like our teammates get 0/5, 0/6. Therefore, this champion can make stable advantage and get continuous pressure in her line before 9.3. This is the first reason why she can appear in Pro league but has low win rate in rank.\n\n2, is the distance between the player in rank and Pro league, this is like the conditon of Azir and Ryze. These two champions is not easy to balance. When you buff them slightly, they will dominate Pro league, however, in ordinary games and ranks, their win rates is really too low. Akali is similar to them. Why? Because the teammates in the pro league is different to ordinary games. I know there is a word \"troll\" in English. This behavior is much more common in Chinese server. The reworked Akali can not solo carry a game. In the Pro league match, the teammates never troll in any game. Therefore, her advantages can be brought to whole team and “operating”(in Chinese) in a game.\n\nI usually follow the forum of American server, the most views about Akali is \"Frustration\" on her W. It means the enemy always feel bad because of her W. She can repeat QA QA in her W, and the enemy can not counterattack， even those champions who have directive skills. This makes the experience of enemy become very bad. When they killed Akali, they also feel being played by Akali. This is \"Frustration\"\n\nHowever, is this experience to the enemy gives Akali players a good experience?\n\nMy answer is \"No\" \"Never\"\n\nThe reason is so easy, because Akali players can not win the game. Many American players only know about frustration, but they didn't think about the problem that Akali can not win a game.\n\nIt is true that her solo kill ability and making \"frustration\" ability are good. However, she can not win the game even though she killed enemies many times. Why?\n\n1, The first reason is Akali does not have a \"snowball\" ability which an assassin should have. This snowball is not saying about solo kill on the line, it's the ability that helping team and teammates, then go to win. I know the designer emphasize nerfing Akali's snowball ability when she was reworked. However, new Akali's snowball ability is even weaker than Leblanc, Zed. Well-known, in general rank games, Leblanc and Zed is easy to solo kill on their line, but after they killed their enemies for some times, they still can not win this game. This problem on Akali is more serious, compared with them, her skill R has one of the longest 120 cooldown in league of legend, as an assassin. She don't have a continuous fight ability in the game. After she used her R, she is too foolish to the enemy who know her skill combination. In addition, Her fighting ability is rely on her W. If she does not have W, she always can only \"ob\" her teammates and enemies fights. I think is not a good mechanism. In her W and QA QA, I don't think this is a good design. It decreases the explosive speed of an assassin and making \"frustration\" on her enemy.\n\n2, The limited clearing minions ability. The energy cost of Akali's Q is too high, only using two times \"Q\", her energy will be very low. Except in the advantage condition, Akali's Q even can not kill a long-distance minion. After she cleaning the minions, she does not have any fighting ability because of no energy. Therefore, her solo \"cleaning minions\" ability is too weak. When she cleaning some minions, she does not have any energy to strike back if other enemy champions come.\n\n3, is the killing speed of an assassin. She always can kill many enemies before 20 min in this game. However, it is useless, in the later game, akali always die in “unknown AOE” because she can not make killing faster. The passive skill of her has high damage, but is relative too slow in later game. This is similar to Leblanc in S7. Her passive is too slow in later game, too. To that Leblanc, i think the designer can reduce the passive time (1.5s) in later time. Maybe 1.5s in lv1, 1s in lv 9, 0.5s in lv 15. Then decrease her damage growth. I think this will be a good adjustment. However, that Leblanc is not exist. I will not talk more suggestions about her. Nevertheless, this ways is not suitable to Akali, because her passive value is not easy to change like reduce circles in later game and move speed. Overall, killing speed is really too important to an assassin in later game. It has a positive correlation to the ability of making chance.\n\nOk, these three points is the reason why she can not win the game, even though she get lots of kills. (Maybe my expression in English is not very accurate, if you want to know more accurate about this, you can ask professional interpreter to translate my Chinese version, if this article is really useful) So, this is the most failure place i think about the rework of Akali.\n\nNew Akali's skill mechanism is really not good. The biggest balance problem is her W, however, not like S6 and S7 Akali, her W decide her whole ability of fights. She only can fight with the enemies when W is not in the cooldown. In addition, why old Akali's W does not have any \"Frustration\", because when old Akali need to attack enemy, she always appear longer time to attack enemy. In this time, other emenies can use any methods to counter her.\n\nAbout your buffs on 9.4 or 9.5. I think about this for a long time, it is really not easy to buffs her. such as: reduce her Q energy cost, reduce cool down of R and adding AP suck blood. These changes might change a little bit win rate of her. But her problem is W, if W is too weak, akali will stay on the ground. If W is too strong, she will dominate Pro league and bring \"Frustration\".\n\nI still think old Akali is better, the biggest reason is she can win the game. Her line and solo kill ability in early game is not really good. But she can get advantage in the group fight in early game. It is true that \"smurf\" can bring negative experience to lower division rank players, however, this is the problem of \"smurfs\", not old Akali's players' problems. You should try to reduce the amount of \"smurfs\". In Master and Chanllager even diamond rank , old Akali is really a balanced champion. Her total win rate is always near to 50%(49%-50%) The players who really have higher skills on her can use distinctive operation to win a game. I don't want you delete this distinctive champion. Her ability is unique and interesting (at least no Frustration on enemy players) She has clear weakness and merits. Please think about adjust back to old Akali. To tell the truth, after the rework of Akali, my gaming time on LOL is decreasing about 70%. I just feel boring when i use new Akali that i can not carry this game due to the reason of \"troller\". I only can report them after the game and feel annoyed. However, these troll players still always exist in the rank game when i play the game. This is true \"Frustration\" to me. When i play old Akali, i always have feeling that i can win this game. But now, i only can win the game when my teammates have a good performance (at least not \"troll\"). I feel really so sad, and now, i can not achieve challenger in the first server in China.\n\n\"Maybe one day she will come back along that way, but this will be decided by herself.\" This is your background story about Akali. When i see this, i feel lacrimal. I am waiting for the day which she can come back... that girl. Akali\n\nThis article was translated by myself and the author of Chinese version is me too. Maybe my English translation is not actually good enough, if you think it make sense. Please think about this and let Chinese staffs go to that Chinese website to have a look. I really hope designer and balance team can think about the opinion of players, not only in LOL Pro league matches.\n\nThanks for your reading!\n14/02/2019\n\nXxxyyy MasterYyy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Amor Omnia ","date":"2018-12-03T21:26:15.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we have soundscape or background music in the loading screen?
