It contains small to moderate buffs to Swain, Vlad and Cass and a small to moderate nerf to Malz. Our expectation is that we&#039;ll do additional work on each of those champions in the next patch too (these changes won&#039;t address all their issues). This hotfix isn&#039;t intended to be a massive change, more to take the edge off major balance outliers while we assess the reworked kit&#039;s learning curves, the state of the meta and work on additional changes. We&#039;re also looking at whether the Ocean Drake buff is too strong with one stack and might also make adjustments to that before 6.10, not sure yet.\r\n\r\nTentative change lists:\r\n\r\nCassiopeia: More useability and general power on Twin Fangs. Future changes (non hotfix) likely to focus on other skills)\r\n\r\n* E Cooldown to 0.75 from 0.9\r\n* E Mana cost to 40-80 from 60-80\r\n* E Range back to the previous range model (700 range center to center instead of 550 range edge to edge). On average slightly longer against small targets (like most other mid laners and minions), slightly shorter against large targets (like most tanks)\r\n\r\n\r\nMalzahar: Higher mana costs to constrain pushing and jungling, less safe jungling, slightly weaker ult\r\n\r\n* Q mana cost to 80 from 60\r\n* W mana cost to 80 from 60\r\n* Neutral monster damage reduction to 50% from 75%\r\n* R damage to 5/7/9% from 6/8/10%\r\n\r\n\r\nSwain: Increased damage on Q to account for its lower consistency, bug fix\r\n\r\n* Q damage to 30-110 from 25-85\r\n* R cast time on toggle on removed (unintended, shouldn&#039;t have shipped)\r\n\r\n\r\nVlad: Adding power, mid game especially, and increasing healing from empowered Q, in part to offset E cost\r\n\r\n* Q empowered missing health ratio increased to 4% AP from 2.5%\r\n* E base damage increased to 30-90/60-180 from 30-70/60-140","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-05-06T00:19:14.357+0000","up_votes":65,"down_votes":7,"body":"Oh, also just for clarity's sake it's worth mentioning there are a lot of other champions we're looking at as possible buff or nerf candidates in 6.10.

If you really want to keep the outside warning at least let E heal based on targets hit.\n\n          Also I just really don't like vlad's ulti, doesn't feel fun to use, does average damage when it ends, barely heals for being super delayed the damage amp is a joke, for such an ultimate it could have been reworked into something new and fresh. I'm not even sure if the ulti heals if the target dies before hand and if the target doesn't die before hand there really wasn't any point in the ulti.\nI honestly thought it would have been reworked ever since I heard vlad would be in the mage patch.... But ignoring his ulti which works fine the rest of his kit needs clunkiness fixing\n \n           Love everything else about vlad though but vlad mainly needed QoL changes.\n\nAs for malz:\n     Make voidlings magic damage scale per level instead of rank that would tune down jng malz and even lane malz.\n   After that just need to make Q EXTEND the E duration by 0.5/1/1.5/2/2.5 seconds instead of fully reset it (It feels too satisfying to fully reset an E that's about to die so this just nerfs it's max damage.but makes it more consistent)\n    Also would love if voidlings changed to \"Cap of 4 vs non-champions\", to compensate the FIRST voidling takes 50/55/60/65/70% reduced damage from turrets and voidlings spawn another when attacking turrets, so AD malz's entire niche of turret taking can come back. Stop changing malz in the wrong way.\n\nVeigar: Feels amazing however make veigar's passive have a CD before you gain stacks from hitting a unique champion(MAKE SURE IT'S UNIQUE PER CHAMPION) reason it needs to be unique is due to veigar hitting multiple champions but hitting multiple champions with multiple spells gets a bit too much hence this suggestion.\nOn a side note you still havn't buffed ghost to distortion's CD or speed amount  I don't regret losing boot enchantments but that really was important thing lost which wasn't even bad for the game.\n\nGhost: Please scale it into distortion's amount and CD later on really took a hit with enchantment removal which I agree with but needs compensating.\n\nTL;DR You're not doing what you need to for vlad and malz that's the main point of my concern. His Q's empower duration needs increase and CD revert, his W shouldn't be interrupted by E and E itself has an extra warning for no reason and if it keep it at least let E heal if it hits enemies.\n\nPlease fix vlad and malz the right way the first time.

You give him the E reset combo, you can poke and push like before (harder, but ok), but if you buff his R you will take him back to mid, if you nerf him one and other time he will just hide in jungle, cause he is getting out of his \"meta\" pick, cause he cant trade or make others out of the lane (Mains Yasuo will be extremely happy with his changes/nerfs, now yas can just wreck malz cause he relies on burst, and malz on dps, and his R will be just completely eaten by his passive)\n\n\n(Maokai is a tank, and with his W he deals 9 / 10 / 11 / 12 / 13% (+ 3% per 100 AP) of target's maximum health , rooting them also, with a low cd...)\n\nIf you nerf his mana cost, you will push him more into jungle, cause being jungle you dont really need that 20 mana that you REALLY need in lane, having blue and jungle item passive... And the 25% nerf to neutral monsters will hit him twice, cause his only \"good\" pick now will be nerfed, and he will suffer in jungle and in lane.\n\n\n\nRemember that doing an early drake or baron solo =/= OP jungler. He struggles in ganks, he excels at taking objectives, he excels ganking at 6 with R. Hes just some kind of AP Warwick, with a better learning curve. Many champs can solo baron with just 2 items ({{champion:19}}  {{champion:266}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:24}} , etc) and any champ with enough sustain or as or damage solo dragon at lvl 2-3, you cant punish malzahar for doing that, will be just unfair.\n\nTake [this post](http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/es/c/campeones-y-jugabilidad-es/Au4wkhyM-parche-69-rework-magos-malzahar-cambios-theorycrafting-y-guias) as as proof that I like to analyze in depth this champion, I love his kit, his lore, his style, and ill play him being op, nerfed or normal, but please, i beg you, reconsider the changes to a better way, dont just nerfhammer him til he transforms in Skarner 2.0, dont take out his utility, dont make him un-fun to play.\n\n\n\nAnd sorry for my bad english, if i made some mistakes. I really, really hope you can answer this comment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2016-05-06T00:33:00.970+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Please buff the Karthus wall.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Muted Summoner","date":"2016-05-06T03:17:49.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xjvV0YeJ,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-05-06T00:17:05.143+0000)\n>\n> Hey all,\n> \n> We&amp;#039;ve got a balance hotfix that, all going according to plan, should be going out sometime late this week or early next week. It contains small to moderate buffs to Swain, Vlad and Cass and a small to moderate nerf to Malz. Our expectation is that we&amp;#039;ll do additional work on each of those champions in the next patch too (these changes won&amp;#039;t address all their issues). This hotfix isn&amp;#039;t intended to be a massive change, more to take the edge off major balance outliers while we assess the reworked kit&amp;#039;s learning curves, the state of the meta and work on additional changes. We&amp;#039;re also looking at whether the Ocean Drake buff is too strong with one stack and might also make adjustments to that before 6.10, not sure yet.\n> \n> Tentative change lists:\n> \n> Cassiopeia: More useability and general power on Twin Fangs.

I have gone against far more Zeds than I can count. Ranging from Bronze and deserved it to Gold and deserved higher.\n\nIMHO. Once you get the hang of his kit and know where and when to direct your spells you just faceroll the keyboard much like sona. I get it though, this is what this champion does and is what makes him unique (and a pain in the ass to play against)\n\nMy issue is his Energy regen. If his shadow's thrown abilities hit you he gets back energy of a fairly substantial amount. At rank 1 it's a 25% refund and rank 5 it's a 90% refund. Someone with that much damage should not be near resource-less late game. Not to mention his Ulty never has a cost which is stupid IMO. \n\nI might be a little biased here but I personally don't think he should have an energy regen with the dmg that he throws out at a safe range. I would be willing to settle with cutting it in half to not entirely screw him over though.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Br4ndon","date":"2016-05-06T01:50:00.324+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":10,"body":"You forgot to list the Vel'Koz rework being reverted.
