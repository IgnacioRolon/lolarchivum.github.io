The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Snowball**\r\n\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re testing some changes for 8.13 at the moment aimed at reducing snowball, in particular in the early game:\r\n\r\n* Lower death timers at early levels, so that early deaths don&#039;t decide lanes excessively and to allow a bit more risk taking. Particularly significant since even slight differences can allow you get a chunk of a wave as it crashed into your tower (6s instead of 10s at level 1, back to current death timers around level 8).\r\n* Lower global gold on turrets (50 instead of 100 at present)\r\n* Bounties for 2 kills again. When we swapped back to solo bounty gold instead of team we also took out the 2 kill bounty on the belief that it tended to result in lanes swinging back too hard (leads being too easily undercut). In retrospect looks like that&#039;s probably a needed catch up mechanic. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**Fizz**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re testing some Fizz changes right now, looking in particular at his W and ways to replace the delayed mark with something better feeling that still backloads some damage. Options there could be things like a stronger DoT, a W with multiple casts of the AA reset or something else again. No concrete timeframe on when changes are likely to ship yet, probably on PBE in the moderate future though, potentially for a longer period to gather more feedback as with LB/Rengar.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"IIIlIllIlIllIlII","date":"2018-06-15T15:47:57.734+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":16,"body":"Hey Meddler just wondering what are your thoughts on {{champion:92}}  in her current state?","replies":[{"poster":"Clementine","date":"2018-06-15T16:13:06.971+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":7,"body":"don't understand why Riven players are begging for buffs","replies":[{"poster":"Dat Irelia Booty","date":"2018-06-15T16:20:16.870+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":23,"body":"Honestly she need some help at the moment.She is weak since new runes.Check her winrate.","replies":[{"poster":"Salvor Hardın","date":"2018-06-15T16:22:12.748+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":7,"body":"49.17%\n\nI don't think it's too low, considering other champions with similar or worse Wr","replies":[{"poster":"Dat Irelia Booty","date":"2018-06-15T16:28:31.603+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":7,"body":"Where did you see that winrate.The pages that i check show that she has 46,50% or something.I maik Riven 3 years and never feel her do week.Her lanning fase is bad right now","replies":[{"poster":"Salvor Hardın","date":"2018-06-15T16:35:42.630+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":5,"body":"49,17% in Champion.gg\n46,83% in op.gg\n48,42% in lolalytics.com\n\nLike many popular champions with \"mechanics\", their winrate varies depending on who is using it, and tends to go down through inexperienced hands.\nI think that with the rune conqueror it is very well in her.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/UryMm4a.png?nodirect","replies":[{"poster":"Zaghyr","date":"2018-06-15T16:43:23.370+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's really not.

I believe this happens because her cast times used to be 0.5s instead of 0.25s now. If you rightclick during their cast times to input buffer she just stands around awkwardly and eventually autos after a while. To get around this you currently have to spamclick on the target so that you input the auto after the cast time is over. \n\nAnother thing that bothers me is that when Dawnbringer Riven was released the way her fast combo works got changed. You officially integrated it in her kit instead of it being a bug. The combo is basically inputing a movement command during Broken Wings and then autoing a target with correct timing after. This would shave of a bit of the Q animation to essentially increase the DPS of your AA Q AA Q AA Q AA combo. With that change it is now easier to perform on higher ping but also around 15% slower for everyone else. I wanted to know if increasing the cancel speed could be a way to buff her since it rewards players that took the time to master the combo. When her Q animation cancel got slowed down it also slowed down trading patterns since Rivens used to Q -> move W to get in range for a quick stun and equally imortant you cannot Q3 -> move R2 anymore to guarantee your ultimate hits during the knock up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Frontline Fury","date":"2018-06-18T05:29:59.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IIIlIllIlIllIlII,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=4h3pzjm2,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-06-15T15:47:57.734+0000)\n>\n> Hey Meddler just wondering what are your thoughts on {{champion:92}}  in her current state?\n\nShe's being released with next patch, obviously. {{champion:266}} \n\nhttp://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/925/494/218.png_large","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"J Eevo","date":"2018-06-15T16:34:03.071+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Any chance for buffs to turrets?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vier","date":"2018-06-15T15:47:46.371+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":6,"body":"Are there no plans to buff Caitlyn along with the other marksmen?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-06-15T16:05:11.680+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":5,"body":"Not yet at least.

Brand comes to mind, velkoz, xerath, heimer, lux, etc. They can all sit back safe and sound just zoning nearly every champion out of the lane to the point where you can't even play anymore. The problem now is that with marksman so weak, every other champion in the game that was strong and safe in a solo lane is now even more so since there are two of them. Sometimes I can't even play the game cause one aoe magic dmg spell takes half my health unless I'm a super tank like Illoai or chogath. How is this fair and fun? I know you guys love the fiesta that is the LCS, but 99% of your player base is low elo where team play isnt a thing so coordinated attacks and team comps are non existent and over half of them have no clue what a strategy is if it bit them on the ass. So it has become who can lock in the most cancerous champion first because there's no one to stop them, without dps from marksmen some tanks can be even harder to kill because your rotation of spells may not be as damaging as theirs and your autos just tickle them, even if you win the lane you may still not be able to deal with other champions on the map. Seriously what did you think was going to happen? You've also alienated a lot of players who like marksmen because they are marksmen. There are only three marksmen viable elsewhere on the map, one is a top laner and two are junglers. To me marksmen weren't strong on their own. It was the supports and junglers that dictated the game bot lane, and still do to an effect. I'm trying hard not to complain but bot lane is a mess right now and it's only \"fun\" because sometimes you get lucky and it feels good.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mikkeru","date":"2018-06-15T16:09:42.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any infomation you can tell us about {{item:3124}} , that u guys will be worked on?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-06-15T16:24:15.821+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Likely reducing the % values on the stacks at least, one of the biggest problems we feel exists with it at present is how much it's both a spike item and a late game multiplier.

She was hit way too hard hard in this patch and please do not touch her shields. She need a lot of work Meddler and bandaid fixes are not going to cut it this time. Karma ideas you guys can talk about:\n\n1) A massive kit adjustment that finally puts Karma in a place where she can have an identity in this game. Something the game does not have right now, Meddler, is a battlemage support hybrid. Karma has thee different kits on one champion. She needs to go back to her roots like the good old days. All of her abilities had an interaction with allies but still allowed Karma to stand on her own. Let's take this a step further and force Karma to choose between having to protect allies or put herself in the front-lines, like a battlemage is supposed to do. If Karma wants to do damage with her Mantra E she can cast it on herself to make it shield bomb. If Karma wants to protect her allies and help them escape from danger, she can cast the current Mantra E on an ally. You can make her current kit have more skill expression while forcing her to choose between protecting an ally or being a damage dealer.\n\n2) There is a lot of skill expression that can be done with Karma's basic and Mantra abilities that really separates her from other champions. I really liked her old Mantra system, but the Mantra abilities had to be a specific way to compensate for that. I always wondered what Karma would be like if she had the ability to combo different Mantra together to create new effects. Using Mantra E on an ally and then using Mantra Q to hit them explodes the shield around the ally to hit enemies. Using Mantra E on an ally with Mantra W mitigates a portion of the damage to Karma and heals the ally. Using Mantra Q on top of an enemy in Mantra W increases the damage of Mantra Q. I mean the possibilities and creativity is limitless. Let's face it, Karma's current Mantra system is just a watered down version of Heim's.\n\n-----------\n\nI really wish she would receive a Aatrox, Fiora, Shen or GP level rework because I think she can benefit more from that than an actual kit adjustment. Her splash arts are already done and fully conceptualized. Karma just suffers from a lot of missed opportunities and poorly executed kit and art assets. She can be this amazing champion that offers something unique and great to the game, if she is just given the time she was supposed to receive 5 years ago. I have high hopes you guys will deliver something amazing on her, but there is always that nagging feeling in the back of my head that thinks it is just not going to be enough. Simply bringing back shield bomb, which is what I think is going to be the only thing worked on for her, is not going to fix the massive amount of problems wrong with this champion. She is in no way shape or form modernized in today's standards and she was almost used as a lab rat for future updates and VGU. It's a shame that one champion has to suffer for so many years without anything being done on her, but this is just how you guys do things.","replies":[{"poster":"GR Titan","date":"2018-06-15T19:30:04.550+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Honestly I don't get what the problem is with a champ that can fulfill multiple roles (and she is pretty good at that imo).

The issue wasn't their late game. It was getting there. The meta is still fluid. It's too early to make significant buffs.  \n\nAlthough, I really don't appreciate Corki being left in a weak state for months on end (even before the ADC changes and with so much feedback that the base AD nerfs are too much for a Sheen ADC who has nothing but damage). That's not OK and it's why people even get paranoid when their favorite champions get buffed. They expect that at some point it will lead to a nerf and then they'll be forgotten for months (often leaving them in a worse state than they were initially). This happens so often that it has become a meme.\n\nThe other thing is that shut down gold being available earlier will encourage a more safe playstyle where people are afraid to make a mistake and are less proactive. I think you should look at turrets instead. They are not the big objectives they should be. The game no longer has a late and large parts of the roster are unviable because of it. The gap between S tier and the rest is enormous for basically every role and part of that is that you only get to play 1/3 or 2/3 of League game (if you get lucky to have an actually close mid game).\n\nIt's not so much that the champions are weak, as it is that this meta isn't good. Games feel very coin flip because you rarely have a chance for a full game. Climbing is more about game selecting and comps than ever before. I think match making is really poor quality atm. Adding more randomness and removing important information for junglers (knowing exact scuttler spawn location) only worsens the strategic element of the game and makes players less willing to take your game seriously even if they continue to play it a lot. It's alienating a lot of players who were attracted to League because they viewed it as a complex strategic game. Instead, they are being given gimmicks and RNG elements which add nothing positive. Even if you want the scuttler's spawn to be randomized, why not make the location known ahead of time so it can more actively influence decision making and not feel like a \"oh I just got lucky to be on the right side\" type of thing? It's entirely different from camps because you don't need spawn timers on camps to know what will respawn and where.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeedos","date":"2018-06-16T08:45:18.273+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thoughts on Ashe/Sivir/Xayah due to the ER and Crit changes?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BitterBlossom","date":"2018-06-15T16:16:00.618+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im glad Fizz is getting looked at.\n\nWhat about Ziggs?

I used to think that he was more of a scaling mid-late game champion and that's what I wanted him to be but his performance doesn't seem to line up with this.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/vGqrRT1f-ekko-has-among-the-worst-late-game-assassin-win-rates-ideas\n\nFinally, I think his JG is still on the weak side and the only reason the win rate is ~50% is that it has a 0.6% play rate (probably reflective of mains or being situationally picked). After all, Ekko is frequently one-tricked because he's so fun to play and tends to be viable in most comps. He gets dueled by everyone and games often end before you get the important mid game items. Have you considered increasing his base armor or AS a tiny bit? I think even 2 armor would be a nice quality of life change for JG.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PopCorn Chick3n","date":"2018-06-15T22:02:30.896+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you do something about Zyra's plants and her weird Q shape?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raxistaicho","date":"2018-06-15T16:43:26.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there any plan for salvaging top Irelia at this point?

She feels like she is in a really bad state again. Like how she felt pre mid year mage update except worse. See Syndra has been entirely reverted back to what she was before but with a nerf to her ult cooldown. I feel like nothing was accomplished on Syndra during the mid year mage update other then to nerf her when she was weak at that stage. Now she is back to that same feeling but is worse. Id like to see her ult cooldown reduced back to what it was 100/90/80 or whatever so she has more opportunities to use her ultimate now that its FAAAAR more difficult to get off max sphere ultimates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir Nope","date":"2018-06-15T15:52:24.617+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Meddler,\n\nIs Ezreal’s Q being able to proc on-hit healthy for League of Legends?","replies":[]}]}
