The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**Crit Item Work**\n\nWe&#039;re currently aiming to ship changes to crit items, plus potentially some other associated work, in 9.3. Our goals for that look like:\n\n* Crit marksmen players have an appealing crit build path\n* Marksmen (crit especially, but others to some degree) have improved ability to get some defensive effects when needed early/mid game\n* Satisfaction of play for crit marksmen games increases\n* Changes range from power neutral to power positive depending on the marksmen in question (e.g. Tristana has room to be stronger, Sivir probably doesn&#039;t)\n\nHow we&#039;re looking to accomplish those goals:\n\n* Pulling some power from crit builds late game to put it earlier. Stronger 2 item spike especially, with crit synergies kicking in quicker. While we don&rsquo;t think crit builds should be as powerful on 2 items as other builds are, given their late game&rsquo;s noticeably stronger, we think we made the difference too large with our changes last year. \n* Reducing anti synergies between some items and frustrations like builds overcapping on crit\n* Changing some items so that it&#039;s not such a large damage loss to get some defenses into builds for crit users\n* Miscellaneous other changes\n\nSome specifics of what&#039;s currently in and looking pretty solid:\n\n* IE goes back to increasing critical strike damage though not as much as it used to (225%). AD also gets increased to give it a larger early impact\n* Essence Reaver goes back to a AD, Crit, CDR, mana return item. Mana return&#039;s on every AA and CDR is a flat 20%.\n* The current ER effect (AAs lower CDs after ult cast) gets moved to a new item with an AD, health, CDR statline (using the name and icon of Spear of Shojin, the original design of which we concluded was too overlapped with other items, Sterak&rsquo;s especially). Goal is to have it be useable by both some marksmen and some other classes as per current ER. \n* PD gets a Lifeline passive that grants a shield when you fall below 30% health, also grants MS and ghost on basic attacking a champion. Loses the damage reduction from the enemy you last hit, though. Shift overall towards much more a burst mitigation item than a duelist one. Current PD has very few core users, with the two most noticeable, Trynd and Yasuo, champs who pivot between Shiv and PD depending on the tuning of each. Goal is to ensure Shiv&rsquo;s a good option for them as a result, with a Shiv buff likely both to help them and other users. \n* All upgraded crit items go to 25% crit (IE, ER, PD, RFC, Shiv, Hurricane)\n* Stormrazor remains an AD/AS item, though now with a unique passive that amps your Energized effects (Fleet Footwork, Shiv, RFC) when they trigger.\n\nStill being worked on, details less certain:\n\n* Tuning on Spear of Shojin. Might cut the basic ability CD reduction to 10% per hit for example from 20%. Stat line on it compared to ER is more generally appealing and want to avoid it being extremely dominant.\n* Looking at other defensive effects, including things like whether defensive base stats should be adjusted, whether it should be more feasible for marksmen to build defensive boots when needed etc.\n* Item costs, exact numbers on many items. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**Akali, Aatrox and Irelia**\n\nWanted to share some thoughts as well on where we&#039;re up to with these three champions, given they&#039;ve been challenging to balance and have been the subject of a lot of discussion recently. The core focus is on giving them more meaningful weaknesses, so opponents have clear windows/ways to play against them, rather than on power. A secondary focus is reducing the sheer number of mechanics on their kits. \n\n\n> Aatrox\n\nWe had nerfs to Aatrox in 9.2 (Q ratio, E CD), with the primary goal being just trimming some power from him, since we felt he was overpowered in most contexts. We&#039;ve got some follow up work in 9.3 as well aimed at giving opponents better ways to play against him. Power impact of those changes to be determined after we&rsquo;ve assessed 9.2. \n\nWe&#039;re testing two main directions at present. The first is giving his enemies more periods of time where his E isn&#039;t available. That likely means removing the charge system from it so he can&#039;t use one and still rely on having another whenever he wants it. Still debating whether the right version of that is a shorter CD single cast or a longer CD double cast where he can still dash twice but has to use the second close to the first (like Renekton E). Second change is we&#039;re probably removing E&#039;s spell vamp against minions, with some increased HP5 to compensate, so that he&#039;s not as able to shrug off harass as easily whenever he&#039;s able to push waves. \n\n\n> Akali\n\nGetting the immediate question out of the way first, yep, we&#039;ll be removing Akali&#039;s shroud making her untargetable under towers. We don&#039;t think that alone will solve everything with Akali, but agree it&#039;s a good change, especially given even many Akali mains would prefer that the effect be removed and power spent elsewhere. The original intent with the shroud working under towers was to give Akali similar dive capabilities to other assassins, despite her longer kill times, while also adding some additional uniqueness. While it accomplished that it did so at a high counterplay/frustration cost, though for quite a while we were very split internally on whether the cost was too high or not. \n\nIn terms of other changes we&#039;re also looking at Akali&#039;s sustain and whether, like Aatrox, she&#039;s potentially shrugging off harass too effectively via her Q heal. We generally want champions able to create and win all ins with some reliability to be more vulnerable to harass. Debating at present whether, if we do remove the Q heal at max energy, we should replace it with another mechanic or not. For those of you who play her regularly is that something you enjoy optimizing around or not?\n\n\n> Irelia\n\nLike Aatrox, Irelia just got nerfed in 9.2 and we&#039;ll need to see how those changes landed. Again like Aatrox we&#039;re also looking at some follow up work to add more counterplay to her, reduce how much agency&rsquo;s in the hands of the Irelia player versus her opponents. That work&#039;s a bit earlier on than work on Aatrox/Akali. Likely approaches include making W more (or only) effective against physical damage so she&#039;s a less universal pick, improving visual effect clarity on E so it&#039;s clearer when you will/won&#039;t get hit, changes to improve her top lane performance. \n\nAt some point long term we&#039;d also like to make it so Irelia&#039;s got a more distinct niche, make sure she&#039;s bringing something distinct to a team so that when she&#039;s a good pick isn&#039;t purely dependent on her general strength. The extra damage to shields on her passive and disarm on R were attempts to do that during her VGUs original development. Our conclusion was though that they weren&#039;t pulling their weight in that regard, so it was better to strip them off given problems they created, given Irelia&rsquo;s been an ongoing issue, then find better ways to get needed distinctiveness at a later date.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n**Damage Adjustments**\n\nAs mentioned last week we&#039;ve been working on some targeted changes to damage output. Likely have details to talk about next week. Target is to ship changes in 9.4, in part so we can see how 9.2 and 9.3 affect things.\n\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-01-25T16:26:35.959+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":7,"body":"Can you please un-buff Volibear?

The thing we liked the most about Akali before the rework was her burst, stickiness to targets, one shot potential (if fed) and the simple design of the kit. None of that remains after the rework due to her kit being totally based around the shroud and passive mechanic. It doesn't even feel right to call Akali an assassin because it takes ages to kill someone while you dance around your passive circle for ages.\n\nWith the proposed shroud changes, atleast shift power elsewhere to her kit to compensate and push her towards being an actual assassin. Either make the passive circle smaller or get rid of it. Literally every other assassin - talon, zed, katarina, fizz etc. has the ability to dive under tower with their burst without taking much damage. The only way Akali could match that would have been the shroud which is now being taken away. We need a compensation for that in terms of quicker burst damage so that it doesn't take years to do the same job other assassins do in seconds. Please make her an assassin again, I don't want her to be just another bruiser pretending to be an assassin.\n\nFinally the healing needs to remain. Her ult is 120 seconds CD, shroud shows outline and half channelled abilities go through, e is already a skill shot. She has already suffered enough due to pointless nerfs within the past few months. If RIOT is adamant about this change, then I'd propose channelling her sustain into her auto attacks in synergy with her passive. Like the old Akali's sustain which allowed her to heal off of auto attacks.\n\nI'm sorry for being very blunt, but this is infuriating. Should have just removed it from the start instead of nerfing her to the ground and now wanting to take away the last few redeeming qualities of the champion. I'd even take the pre-rework kit over this one any day of the week.\n\nEdit: Riot Captain's new tweet confirmed that they will be removing the Q heal. It's really sad and disappointing to see that Riot ignored all of our comments after asking us for our opinion on the matter and then proceeded to remove the heal anyway when everyone requested to keep it in the kit.","replies":[{"poster":"im rusoX","date":"2019-01-25T18:11:35.708+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"At this point you should just bring the old Akali back while keeping her new fancy W and E if you are going to remove her invisibility under turrets. Im pretty sure majority of people would have been fine if you were to make her old Q a skill shot while making it more powerful along with a partial or full revert just like the very old Ryze treatment on his Q. If not, atleast mix her old Q with the new passive in some way just because of how satisfying it was the sound of burning Q2.\n\nIf you wanted to make the old Akali more complex and fair just do what I said above. Make her old Q a skillshot and maybe in some way relate her new passive to proc'ing Q2 or mix the new passive into the old Q in order to proc it. \nGive her the old R stacks without the new fancy executions and stuns while keeping it as a skillshot.\n\nJust some ideas since you seem to be stuck and just went into the old method of nerfing the champion instead of fixing it. She didnt need a full rework and even if she did you completely messed it up. I don't know about the rest but I personally dont even like her new look, let alone her stupid bag. \n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Count Kass","date":"2019-01-25T20:34:35.078+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"I agree with every single one of your points.

Over the past year, our teams have been working on updating champions whose visuals or gameplay don't fit with the current state of the game. Our goal is to level up any outdated visuals or gameplay to make them feel fresh **while still retaining what makes them unique as a champion**.\"\n\nAatrox was an unique auto-attack based champion, using proper aa management to either heal or do bonus damage. This provided a unique balance between deciding whether to do significantly more damage or heal yourself which separated a good Aatrox from a weak one. The rework did not retain any of this concept, turning him into a caster with completely different abilities. I understand the need to change his gameplay as a drain-tank is not healthy, but completely removing this mechanic and playstyle contradicts what Riot has published as their intent of a Champion Update, which is what players requested.\n\n\nOf course a big VGU involves changing/removing/adding abilities, similar to how Irelia got her W and E, Nunu got his big snowball, Urgot got his R.\nAatrox players expected a Warwick+ level update, where a champion had all of his abilities modernized. \nWarwick was similar to Aatrox, an unhealthy drain tank who built one or two AS/On-Hit items, into full tank. The rework provided a significant change to his abilities, modernizing his gameplay to meet higher standards, but maintained his personality and playstyle as well as the concept of his old abilities.\n\nWith the rework, Aatrox lost his abilities, playstyle, gameplay, lore, and voice-lines. The similarities between the original and rework include: using a similar in-game model (for the skins), sharing a name, having an ult that makes him big and do more damage, having a revive, and having passive healing.\nWith these changes taken into account, it's evident that Aatrox's uniqueness was not retained which then means that the Champion Update did not live up to Riot's own standards.\n\nOn the nexus post https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/10/ask-riot-assassins-and-chromas/ , Reav3 says:\n\"Retiring a champion is not something we have ever considered, and likely we never would consider this. We would much rather go back and update our older problematic champions with either small reworks or through big VGUs. Retiring a champion would set a weird precedence where **players would always be worried that the things they invested in would be taken away from them at some point**, which isn’t something we want our players to worry about.\" -Reav3\n\nAatrox lost everything about him that defined him. His abilities and gameplay were removed, his lore was removed, and his voice-lines were removed.\nIf that's not \"retiring\" a champion then this nexus post has no purpose other than to make Riot look good in the eyes of the majority. \n\nWhat about the hundreds to thousands of hours that players invested in Aatrox? What about the skins they bought to play as THAT champion? What about the time people took to learn how to use his kit and all the lane matchups? What about the artists who creating amazing pieces of art because they loved the champion?\n\nReav3 says that Riot doesn't want players to worry that their champion and investments (not just money) would be taken away but that is exactly what happened here. I understand that Riot wants the best for their game, and that sometimes they make mistakes. Riot really just needs to acknowledge that the Aatrox rework did not deliver a successful Champion Update, yet delivered a successful New Champion.\n\nI think it would be beneficial for Riot to start fixing this mistake, rather than pretend it never happened or that it was the right thing to do.\nThis could set a new standard for Riot as an engaging company which will work to improve League of Legends, who isn't afraid to admit they made mistakes and correct them.\n\n**TLDR:** Aatrox was retired from League of Legends, which Riot said they wouldn't do, and Riot could solve this problem to benefit both players and themselves.\n\nThanks for the long read, just remember that Aatrox mains won't die out.\n**Pain is temporary, Victory is forever!**\n\nValanáro","replies":[{"poster":"Divewing","date":"2019-01-25T23:24:33.226+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":9,"body":"That AA playstyle was toxic.

These \"stat check\" thing is just a poor excuse from Riot because they have no spine to admit the fact that they have failed this time. How can you call a Rework succes when it's full of animation bugs? It's true that they have fixed Blood Moon Aatrox's walk animation, but the rest of the skins are still buggy and the classic skin's banner wings are invisible even if you unfurl them with CTRL + 5. Other funny fact is that Aatrox have no joke anymore only his old joke animation without a single Voiceline, and his taunt sounds more like a joke. Instead of nerfing him to death, they should finally focus on cleaning up RiotJag's unfinished mess and get him fully fixed up so people don't have to play with a non-finished champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2019-01-26T01:14:45.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":">  many other champs whos are just as stat cheeky as old Aatrox was and Riot isn't really planning anything about these\n\nYou're missing a big part of why Aatrox was weak in the first place, and only confirming why they reworked him away from what he previously was. There are so many other people who do what he did, but better, so if he wants to be viable, he has to be the best of the best otherwise he's drowned out. Yi, Irelia and the others still brought enough to why you should bring them and can still compete within the same power. \n\nHe was reworked, because he didn't do anything that others did better, so he'd always be weak unless he was shoving out all the competition, not solely because he was a stat-stick.","replies":[{"poster":"TriniXjin","date":"2019-01-26T02:52:21.105+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Smh, that is an opinion, Aatrox covered areas they couldnt and can out do those champions in multiple ways.

Ok you want to see legitimate reasons on how Aatrox outperformed those other champions.\n 1.  Aatrox could successfully 1v2/3 far more consitantly than the other champions wish they could.\n2.  Team fighting, only Aatrox and jax could do big things in a team fight compared to other AA champions but Aatrox does it better, He can tank more damage when built right, he can knock up a maximum of 5 people and nuke them with his E, Ultimate and ravenous hydra combo.\n3.  Polish, Aatrox was released in the year 2013 and yet he looks and moves better than most champions today (imo)\n4.  Melee to ranged attacks thanks to his ultimate.  This zones hard in skirmishes as the enemy cant move as freely due to you having more reach.\n\nSorry if this was too long but you have to understand, Aatrox was well designed, he took skill to play and was highly rewarding, heck he shutdowned match ups other AA stars like irelia couldnt.

Why ask for feedback if you're going to ignore the overwhelming majority of people who expressed displeasure in seeing PD used as a placeholder for Lifeline?\n\nPD has limited users because you created a system that rewards you for combining Shiv and RFC — energized. You created a system that has one option be the mathematical optimal choice, then move to change an item with a great concept and great satisfaction because it's \"not built enough\". Never mind that there's no reason why Lifeline can't inhabit a new item, since there is no actual motivation to change PD.\n\nMelee ADCs have PD in their core. Duelist/short range ADCs do as well. And instead of fostering an item system that doesn't make decisions for you before you even hit the game, such as the Energized mechanic that predetermines your builds and has had negative repercussions on the balance of every part involved in this system—Shiv, RFC, **Fleet Footwork**—you repurpose an item for your convenience against our wishes. \n\nI just don't understand.\n\nI hate that argument. Why don't we talk about the fact that Runaan's Hurricane has an even lower buy rate than PD? https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/items How is the argument for changing PD that it lacks core users without asking ourselves why that is so? Both Zeal alternatives are less commonly bought by marksmen *because you made a system that makes it so*. Not just that, but you're planing to double-down on it by adding yet another Energized synergy item to the system. The rest of the Zeals can't compete in an ADC's inventory because the synergy is simply **objectively superior** if you want to deal damage. You need to have an extremely compelling reason to buy another type of item in its stead, like Jinx's overlapping AoE instances that both make for the mathematically superior damage choice and just as good a waveclear tool than Shiv.\n\nThe current changelist is just *flawed*. The rationale is *flawed*. It's incredibly frustrating to have a pantomime of a communication channel only to get stonewalled when we cast reasonable doubts on the decisions you're making.

I'm not opposed to having a \"defensive\" zeal item, but this guts Trynd and hurts Yas a lot. I can only conclude that Riot simply doesn't care about those champions or the people that play them enough to go through the arduous task of coming up with a name, creating an image, and adding an item that accomplishes their goal of making a defensive zeal item.\nThis will probably spell the end of my playing trynd until a new item is added or phantom dancer gets reverted.\nFirst, shiv was rendered useless on trynd in 8.6. That's okay. Tiamat was still an option for a waveclear item and even though it became the ONLY option, we were still content. Then his core item was simply made crap on trynd in 8.11. That was essence reaver. Then, he got a compensation buff. AP tryn got too strong and rather than nerfing his AP ratio on his e and making his mid game weaker, they just reverted the e buff. The build got more expensive and didn't synergize as well with Trynd's kit but you know what? Didn't complain. Trynd still had a build that was okay.\nNow tiamat got nerfed too. STILL DIDN'T COMPLAIN. But now the only good rush item is getting completely gutted too. PD is the only zeal item Trynd can build and feel good. This change guts it completely. It loses 15% AS, dueling stats, and its passive will do just about nothing other than baiting us into ulting too early or not ulting at all. Very few ranged ADCs build PD but it IS CORE on trynd and yas. Is it really that hard to create a new item? I'm not flaming I really am curious what the reasoning is here. I expect the response I'll get is: Just build Shiv. You already \" pivot between Shiv and PD\" so just go back to shiv. Shiv has always been a worse item IMO. the attack speed is less, the dueling stats are inferior, and tiamat is a better waveclear item.

At this point I can't be useful without rushing cdr runes, cdr stats, and rushing cdr items as fast as possible. He cannot hit Q at ALL without E, removing the 2 charges will completely ruin his combo especially with how his W is in the current state. Like really, I find it insane how you plan to nerf his E even more. The reason? So he can't even do dmg it seems, because he needs that mobility to do any damage at all and even be able to not instantly die because this \"Juggernaut\" has to build full ad.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-01-25T16:33:52.889+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you considered making Aatrox more in-line with traditional juggernaut strengths? E.G taking a bit longer to kill you but being incentivized to bulkier builds, perhaps exchanging his spell-vamp for % healing when he lands sweet spots/procs passive? I think a push towards a more \"familiar\" Aatrox that favors longer fights rather than bursting you out or failing hard would be a good change.\n\nI still think you've gone the opposite direction with Irelia that you should have. IMO sharpening her identity would be the right call, as well as giving her some nerfs to push her away from this pseudo-assassin design she sometimes emulates, especially when fed, and closer to her OG playstyle of being a DPS threat. Something I'd have done would be like.. Making Q do reduced damage to champions if they've been hit by Q recently (nerfing her reset burst), raising disarm's duration to, like, 2/3/4 seconds but nerfing - or even removing - the overall slow (makes her very effective into AA based opponents but greatly inhibits her overall power; niche strength up general power down)\n\nIs Akali's tower invisibility really that frustrating?

I don't think the healing itself is the issue I think the issue is that its on Q. If you want to remove it off Q you should move it to her passive and have her healing tied back to her AAs so that when she walks up to heal in lane she can be punished rather than healing at a distance. It'd also make it so that when she heals she takes some damage from the enemy on the backend reducing the total net healing. \n\nWhile you're at it please get rid of her passive circle, or at least make it smaller and give her Q a legitimate sweet spot. Especially if you want her to be able to dive like other assassins. Her passive design is literally the only thing keeping her from doing so. The passive circle, the way it currently is, is not a fun delay mechanic to her damage especially on an assassin and makes her damage pattern feel more like a bruiser than an assassin. Her shroud could be balanced a lot easier and be weaker (which makes it less frustrating to play against while not gutting her) w/o her current circle passive because her shroud wouldn't be required to protect her as well it currently does since she has to run out the circle and then run back to her target to deal damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BulletBlast","date":"2019-01-25T17:06:39.318+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":6,"body":"At this point just delete Aatrox ffs can you please adleast keep his identity........ ffs like the healing in combat is his thing come on!

The Irelia mains reddit has been bombarded with talk of how you're removing things on her that are more useful within top lane (disarm/shield piercing) and things like the ult slow/damage compensation make more sense for her midlane. Also, her W being only physical damage also means she's useless against things like Viktor top. Why not 20% magic reduction and however much physical reduction?

Similarly, this has also happened with Ornn lately with removing the unstoppable and then the shield on his W. Also with Azir with his knock up and many other parts of his kit. These things all change the way a champion feels at the core level. When you release champions, it is as though you are showcasing to the community those champions and their identity.  When you alter a champion's identity to such a degree, it feels REALLY bad to those that main that champion and to the game as a whole. \n\nI understand the need to change a champion as a last resort for the sake of balance and the health of the game. My question is, why are they being released with such overloaded kits and in such an unbalanced, unhealthy place? Does the blame fall on the designers before ship for overloading the kits and releasing mechanics that are unhealthy for gameplay? An example that comes to mind is Sylas and his E, which has a dash, a shield, a knock up, etc. What an extremely strong skill. Or Akali with her shroud that goes make her untargetable under turrets. \n\nDoes the blame fall on the balance team for not finding appropriate ways to balance the characters and items before removing core identifies of champions? It feels like the  always tends to go in a direction that favors \"uniqueness\" at a cost to balance, and that's what brings us in this mess. I don't think the game should be a testing ground to show who can come up with unique mechanics and how many things someone can overload in an ability, but at the core, what is fun and healthy for the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DesuGamer","date":"2019-01-25T16:31:16.874+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Anything about Karma's possible changes/rework?
