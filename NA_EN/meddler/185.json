The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**9.5 a simpler patch**\r\n\r\n9.5 is likely to be a fairly straightforward, and probably comparatively small patch. It'll have a range of champion balance changes in it, current expectation is it won't have any larger changes to game systems though (things like the crit item changes recently for example). We've got work on bounty system improvements underway, those will likely be in 9.6 though.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Some early observations on 9.4**\r\n\r\nNote, these are being written just hours after the patch went out, so possible a few things have become clearer in the day or so since.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Azir and Rek'Sai - both have comparatively small play rates, so it's harder to get a quick read on how they're doing post changes. Looking like both got noteworthy power increases, too early to say much beyond that though.\r\n* Kai'Sa - Is performing noticeably better post patch even though the only change for her was an update to her recommended items. Good reminder for us when we're assessing balance that a character's potential performance and how they're on average being played can be pretty different. Important to account for what effective playstyles/builds can yield and/or help players intuitively identify such builds as a result.\r\n* Urgot - Lost a meaningful amount of power as expected. We're still planning on letting him settle for a patch. Likely result after that is we put some power back into him in 9.6 in different places than where it was taken out. Depends on how he performs between now and then though of course.\r\n* Conqueror - Again, hard to assess off just part of a day of play on the new patch. Some of its users are almost certainly performing quite a bit better with it than before (e.g. Riven, Olaf and Irelia). Early indications suggest others are potentially neutral or a bit worse (e.g. Trynd, Darius and Yi).  We're expecting we'll have a much clearer read on its power later today and should then be able to make calls on what sort of follow up is or isn't needed. Most likely target if it's too strong is reducing the amount of Adaptive Force each stack gives, though it would of course depend on in what ways its users were out of line. Not clear yet if any AP champs are effective, or even overpowered, users of it, given not enough people have tried it out yet on champs who weren't good users of the old version. Similarly not yet clear whether there are marksmen for whom it's a great choice, though expect we'll get a clear read on that too soon. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Libido","date":"2019-02-22T17:27:29.169+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"Shen Buffs?

If this is the case, this is giving her a far stronger early game as she's getting an extra 60+ on it during the early game and an extra 120 or so on it at level 18.\nIf the Wiki and I are incorrect that's okay, but in case we're not I feel like it's a good place to start as bug fixing that would bring her down a decent amount on top of any conqueror nerfs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pako Reí","date":"2019-02-23T11:09:24.388+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Meddler, \n\nThis is one of the major issues with the balance team most people have. Why nerf Riven because you guys made a Rune that allows her to be a good champion. Instead of listening to the people below plat, that are just not able to play against her let alone PLAY her, you shuld listen to the ones which are higher up the ladder. \n\nfrom what i see now, is that you will nerf Conquerer (already happened in a hotfix) and then nerf Riven because people dont stop crying about it. Most people, like Hashinshin have NEVER ever played her and yet say that she is low risk high reward champion that requires no skill at all. If you pick 100 players from high plat and below and tell them to play Riven for 10 games, they will do nothing but int their games.\n\nThis is a major flaw in the current balance team which lead to multiple champions just disappearing from the game such as Jayce for a long time, Talon, Ekko, Viktor (with fleetwork).\n\nYou guys should rather do something to conquerer instead of the Champion that was hidden from soloQ for over 3 years and now appearing just because of a Rune. She was decent all these years and now that you changed the Rune she used the most, you want to nerf her to please the crying kids in Iron etc because she seems too OP to handle her but are not even willing to get into customs with friends to practise the matchup. These people are also not willing to even try her out to see that she actually requires some brain to be played to a decent point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alkaîd","date":"2019-02-22T18:54:40.455+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":7,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Pïco de Galio","date":"2019-02-22T20:39:05.201+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"The last time Riven was nerfed: Patch 5.21\n\nSince this patch, Riven has been buffed in 5.24, 6.1, 6.17, 7.24, and 8.13. \n\nBut yes, Riven has obviously been nothing but nerfed in these past years, not biased at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Alkaîd","date":"2019-02-22T20:50:01.812+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pïco de Galio,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=Vpg853UW,comment-id=0002000100040002,timestamp=2019-02-22T20:39:05.201+0000)\n>\n> The last time Riven was nerfed: Patch 5.21\n> \n> Since this patch, Riven has been buffed in 5.24, 6.1, 6.17, 7.24, and 8.13. \n> \n> But yes, Riven has obviously been nothing but nerfed in these past years, not biased at all.\n\n5.24 - health regen \"buff\" by 2hp/5. When she previously had lower health regen than soraka who had one of the lowest in the game. Still not really a buff because it doesn't affect anything\n\n6.1 - 5% more AD on her passive, which hmm seems like a blanket buff at lower levels that doesn't actually change anything since you have no AD to affect it yet.\n\n6.17 - 20-40 more base damage and 60-120 more top end damage on ult. Wish I had more time to pull up the posts about this and how insignificant this change was. We begged for the missile speed to be reverted over getting more damage on it because our ult damage isn't nearly as important as how fast it travels.\n\n7.10 Big nerf to DPS and effectiveness of her Qs, which is a fair marginal amount of her damage, because they \"normalized it\" basically making all previous \"buffs\" (psst, adjustments because of how minor) meaningless. Losing 30-50 dps on Q combo at level 6 with just a long sword, translates into a lot of lost dps when you actually have items.\n\n7.22-7.24 - already went over this somewhere else. This wasn't a buff, this was when runes reforged and the new keystones came out. A lot of champs were hit with these adjustments to their damage and Cooldowns because of CDR per level runes going away, and flat AD runes going away (as we didn't have minor runes for adaptive force yet in the initial runes reforged)\n\n8.13 Again... health regen is insanely inconsequential when she barely made it into rank 70 on the Hp/5 rankings against all champs. And 10 and 5 seconds off ult CDR on a champ who already builds CDR... that's funny.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Painbringerbabe","date":"2019-02-22T20:41:07.834+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Maybe you are also one of the guys thinking riven has counters , when even garen , considered a major counter of hers for years , has 42.87 % wr against her post platinum tier xD","replies":[{"poster":"Alkaîd","date":"2019-02-22T20:53:39.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Painbringerbabe,realm=EUNE,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=Vpg853UW,comment-id=0002000100040003,timestamp=2019-02-22T20:41:07.834+0000)\n>\n> Maybe you are also one of the guys thinking riven has counters , when even garen , considered a major counter of hers for years , has 42.87 % wr against her post platinum tier xD\n\nUhhh I don't think anyone thinks Garen is a counter to her unless the riven player is terrible.

Early levels in his q is still insufficient to farm under tower, the idea of his empowered Q autos is a neat mechanic the problem with it is having to constantly reposition it to make use of it which leads to being at risk of being out of position, you can be punished by the enemy top laner as well as getting caught by the enemy jungler trying to reposition your sword.\n\nWith his high Q cooldown early game you have to either use it to trade with an enemy laner when they go in for harass or use it to kill minions to farm effectively due to Shen's low base damage.

Leaving Shen to scrap up what he can and wait until 6 to make a play elsewhere on the map. The problem with this, due to the current meta of tower plating, the enemy top laner will just take free plates resulting in Shen being even further behind. His W, is very powerful when going for an Ult play to save an ally, and comes in handy to mitigate damage in a team fight, again in Solo queue the lack of coordination can cause this ability to not be used to its greatest potential but has a ridiculously long cooldown as well.\n\nHis E has always been extremely satisfying to use, landing a taunt on multiple people can change the fight entirely, but also has a long cooldown.

Pre-rework Shen was ultimately more satisfying to use. his in lane sustain with vorpal blades, the on hit heal, as well as his old passive ki strike which made shen a decent duelist as he built more health. The most important thing that made pre-rework Shen enjoying to play was his build diversity, ranging from Tank, bruiser, on-hit, as well as Ap off-tank. As opposed to current Shen's cookie cutter build Tiamat/Sunfire, and the non-AD ratios make building any sort of AD useless on Shen.\n\nShen is supposed to be Zed's counterpart; a kickass ninja fighting in the name of balance, his current abilities doesn't fit that thematic. It's to the point where playing Shen is a constant frustration, he's just not fun to play in his current state. Shen is considered a tank but with one of the lowest base tank stats in the game, even below some mages and marksman.\n\nShen is a champion that relies on two items because his wave clear is one of the worst, if not the worst clears in the game. Tiamat and sunfire. His Q damage to minion is so low that he has to pre hit minions under tower. The Shen community has been struggling playing this champion with a dropping winrate. We'd love to have a small sejuani/ezreal rework treatment done to his kit, or at the very least number changes like CD reductions or swapping out those useless AP ratios that shen never builds AP for, into AD or HP scaling.\n\nI'm stuck playing Shen as support because he has better utility there.

The most important thing that made pre-rework Shen enjoying to play was his build diversity, ranging from Tank, bruiser, on-hit, as well as Ap off-tank. As opposed to current Shen's cookie cutter build Tiamat/Sunfire, and the non-AD ratios make building any sort of AD useless on Shen.\n\nShen is supposed to be Zed's counterpart; a kickass ninja fighting in the name of balance, his current abilities doesn't fit that thematic. It's to the point where playing Shen is a constant frustration, he's just not fun to play in his current state. Shen is considered a tank but with one of the lowest base tank stats in the game, even below some mages and marksman.\n\nShen is a champion that relies on two items because his wave clear is one of the worst, if not the worst clears in the game. Tiamat and sunfire. His Q damage to minion is so low that he has to pre hit minions under tower. The Shen community has been struggling playing this champion with a dropping winrate. We'd love to have a small sejuani/ezreal rework treatment done to his kit, or at the very least number changes like CD reductions or swapping out those useless AP ratios that shen never builds AP for, into AD or HP scaling.\n\nI'm stuck playing Shen as support because he has better utility there. No worrying about farming or having 2x-3x longer ability cooldowns than most top laners.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blood Teller","date":"2019-02-22T17:34:56.065+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thoughts on Taliyah {{champion:163}} ?
