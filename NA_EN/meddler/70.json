The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**More Icon Updates**\r\n\r\nFollowing on from last week&#039;s post we&#039;ll likely be updating at least another couple of champs moderately soon in addition to Ahri/Amumu. Nunu&#039;s likely, as is Mundo. Additionally if there are other champs you think particularly need an icon update do let us know, would love to get wider feedback on that.\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ll also be looking to update some older non champ icons as well, with Red/Blue/Baron buff likely starting points. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Some 7.11 Balance Context**\r\n\r\n* Zyra - we&#039;ll be pulling the Zyra changes out of 7.11 now that they&#039;ve had enough testing for us to get a good understanding about them. We think those changes (lower plant health early game, but more seeds) have the potential to make laning against Zyra feel fairer for her opponents. At the same time though lack of laning fairness isn&#039;t currently an issue we&#039;re trying to solve for Zyra and there&#039;s risk this has unintended power impacts. We might revisit the changelist at some point, won&#039;t be doing anything with it or Zyra right now however.\r\n\r\n* Syndra and Ahri - Both have nerfs being tested for 7.11. It&#039;s possible those don&#039;t make it in for 7.11 however. Expect them to be in 7.12 instead if so.\r\n\r\n* Zac - We hotfixed Zac yesteday, taking some damage out of his Q after our changes in 7.10 overbuffed him. We&#039;ll be looking at him in 7.11 as well. One change we&#039;re testing right now is having his E warning indicator appear slightly earlier (E+R combo reliability&#039;s looking too high now with the increased knockup duration on E when charged). Possible other changes get included as well, need to see where the hotfix puts him and how he does over the next few days. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Scoreboard CS tracking cleanup**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ll be making it so small player summoned minions killed aren&#039;t counted in the scoreboard (tab screen). Goal there is to make comparison of different champions&#039;s farm more accurate, whereas at present laning against someone who&#039;s throwing out a lot of small minions can make that a misleading statistic. Minions that will be affected:\r\n\r\n* Regular Heimer turrets\r\n* Shaco boxes\r\n* Illaoi tentacles\r\n* Zyra plants\r\n* Yorick Ghouls and W\r\n* Malz voidlings\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Runes and Masteries**\r\n\r\nWe mentioned a couple of times that we were looking to do some work on both Runes and Masteries this year and that we&#039;d be talking about that well in advance. That&#039;s still the plan and we should be getting some conversation going on that pretty soon, starting with our thoughts on what good pre-game systems like those for LoL should look like. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Riven and Renekton animation changes**\r\n\r\nIn the last couple of patches we&#039;ve had some behind the scenes changes to Riven and Renekton that were intended to address some bugs with them and make them queue spells consistently. Both sets of changes had some unintended impacts however that we&#039;ll be addressing as follows:\r\n\r\n* Renekton - Reverting all changes\r\n* Riven - Keeping changes that gave Q cancel consistent timing (as opposed to random within a small range) and allow E to be properly queued after Q/W (no timing changes). Fixing a bug where Q3 knockup got slightly longer (around 0.1s).","replies":[{"poster":"Glory to God","date":"2017-05-23T17:15:40.437+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Additionally if there are other champs you think particularly need an icon update do let us know, would love to get wider feedback on that.\n\nJAX!\nAhem...

W being cancelled by R is known to be coming back as it was available before 7.8 but what about Tiamat? Tiamat used to cancel W back in early season 6 and before but this feature was removed in the undocumented W changes for Renekton sometime around 6.11. Anyways we were told it would becoming back but as you specifically state you're reverting changes to the 7.8 state will that still mean we will not get it? One of the Rioters we have talked to in our Renekton mains community Discord said it would be coming back and that Tiamat is \"the animation cancelling item\" he quoted meaning it is pretty much intended to do things like this for champions such as Renekton and Riven. So if this is the case will it cancel W and not just double cast it? with it being a \"animation cancel\" it must also remove the lock timer during the cast, I felt like I need to mention this because one of the Rioters who informed us that it was in patch 7.10 was quite incorrect as it is just a double cast which you're still locked in the W cast time. Also thank you for reverting those horrid changes but maybe you could some how give us the E QoL changes back some time in the close future?\n\nTLDR: Will W Tiamat be added back in as we were told it was coming back and with it being a \"cancel\" will it remove the stun lock timer too? Also will you consider adding back the E QoL changes?

This also punishes the ambient stack play style somewhat, though those familiar with 6 second spheres Syndra will not be perturbed by it. May solve two birds with one stone, but I can see art direction problems with figuring out which sphere is a 6 second, or an 8 second, and what W's refresh throw does. Accessibility in this regard is going to be an issue, I think, so figuring out that discussion will help. This'll in turn probably feed into the effectiveness of the ult as a stand alone threat.\n\nI'd generally vote in trying to refrain from affecting the ramp of the ultimate outside of what she used to be Pre-6.9, though. If accessibility becomes more constrained than how it was then (e.g, 4 second sphere life timers, but on hit makes them 8), it'll make her performance swingy and very uncomfortable.

We&#x27;ll likely be going with 0.543 base AS and 15% bonus AS at level 1, rather than the 0.521 and 10% previously in testing.\n\nI don't really understand why her base attack speed needs to be so damn low in the first place. Can't they just revert it back to say 0.625 and only +1% per level (like how Jinx scales with attack speed).\n\nWith 13.5 from runes, 4 from masteries, Caitlyn's attack speed would be:\n\n* Level 1 0.73 \n* Level 9 (with boots): 1.000\n* Level 13 (with Statikk + boots): 1.265\n* Level 18 (with Statikk RFC + boots): 1.484\n* Level 18 BASE 0.846\n(if you want to calculate Runaans or PD or both, just add +5-15% of 0.625 on top of 1.484)\n\nPlus, even though Caitlyn rightly needs nerfing, her lategame damage isn't the issue. It's her earlygame dominance and ability to waveclear reliably, which is what the Runaans nerf was all about.\n\n(Some history about Caitlyn's base attack speed for those who don't know):\n\n* Release - Patch 3.X 0.668 + 3% per level \n* 3.X until S6 Preseason 0.625 + 4% per level \n* 6.1 - 7.11 0.568 + 4% per level\n\nThe overriding philosophy of all these changes has been to continually nerf Caitlyn's ability to exploit attack speed buffs from items and allies (originally the nerf was to stop Caitlyn hitting 2.0 attack speed with PD and Nunu's blood boil before the nerf to his W), I don't object to that, but where does this logic end. Doing the calculations with 0.521 (and the +15, +4 from masteries and +13.5 from runes) Caitlyn will be hitting 0.69 attack speed level one.\n\n* Level 1: 0.69\n* Level 9 (with boots only): 1.06\n* Level 18 BASE (+4% a level): 1.06\n* Level 18 (with boots, RFC and Statikk): 1.587\n* Level 18 (with boots, PD and Runaans): 1.659\n\nOverall, not a terrible nerf, however, I'm more concerned about that attack animation delay remaining which would be a much bigger nerf than anything Riot have suggested to her attack speed. \n\nMy nerf alternative nerf would remove (if Caitlyn will get +15% passively in 7.11) 69% attack speed per level (5.75 daggers costing 1.725k in Caitlyn's base stats), however, she would break even to the proposed 0.521 base attack speed and only begin to touch current live levels of attack speed if she truly does have a team built around her, and we're talking Ardent Censor as a MUST (she'd hit 1.70 with ardent).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lightbreaker","date":"2017-05-23T19:40:05.931+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=s67eflUY,comment-id=00050001,timestamp=2017-05-23T17:37:57.632+0000)\n>\n> Conclusion was that the Hurricane change alone wouldn&#x27;t be enough to bring Caitlyn in line, in particular her late game sustained damage being too high for a champion with that much safety and utility. \n> \n> Numbers on the PBE are more extreme than what we&#x27;re likely to ship however.

What's the reasoning to nerf her beyond that right now, without testing that alone first?
