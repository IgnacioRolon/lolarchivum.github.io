{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-10-11T15:59:00.212+0000","title":"Quick Gameplay Thoughts: October 11","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi all,\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Usual Disclaimers**\r\n\r\nThese posts will often contain talk about future work we&#039;re doing, or planning to do, that isn&#039;t yet guaranteed to ship. The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Base Stat Adjustments and Runes**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re still working on base stat and ability changes that will accompany the other pre-season changes at the moment and more of those should be back on PBE this week. One thing I figured it would be good to talk more about there though is what our goals are with those changes. In particular, we&#039;re not trying to offer every champion the same gold value of extra base stats. What we are trying to do is give each champ what they&#039;ll need to be successful post runes changes. Based off how other changes impact them champs may need more or less base stats added than others to put them around the same spot they were before. Magic damage dealers for example benefiting from MR removal from old runes effectively gain extra power that way, even if they&#039;re not directly getting extra stats. Some champs may need much more specialized adjustments, whereas others may be fine with just a bunch of armor. Some champs will also benefit more from the new runes system than others.\r\n\r\nThe adjustments that go in 7.22 will also just be round one. They&#039;re our best estimate of what&#039;s needed to begin with, the real polish and tuning will come afterwards though once we&#039;ve seen where champion balance actually lands, rather than having to just work off predictions. As with every pre-season patch there&#039;ll be some champs that have a rough time for a little bit, or do really well, and we&#039;ll likely need to further adjust base stats on a number of them at that point to get things where they should be. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Ardent Censer**\r\n\r\nLooking back we definitely misread how impactful Censer would become and should have nerfed it quicker. We&#039;re talking about it a lot at present, including discussion on whether after the 7.19 changes it&#039;s still too strong. The version in 7.18 we&#039;re seeing in Worlds is definitely out of line, somewhat harder to get a good read on the 7.19 one given how much Worlds impacts what gets played in regular games/what gets talked about, even though they&#039;re different patches. At a minimum we&#039;ll be both assessing it in 7.21 and looking at it again after pre-season goes out.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Non LoL: the concept of &#039;piggybacking&#039; in design**\r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t LoL specific, but mentioning it since I know some folks also have an interest in game design in general. There&#039;s a lot of good writing around that talks about various game design principles. One example of that I really like is Mark Rosewater&#039;s talk about what he calls &#039;piggybacking&#039; in the blog post linked below. Piggybacking is a way of communicating a lot of complex stuff to the player quickly and easily by using their existing understanding of things. Well worth a read if that sounds interesting even if you&#039;re not familiar with Magic the Gathering which is the game Rosewater generally talks about. \r\n\r\nhttps://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/piggybacking-2012-08-16\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Few more ping changes coming**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re getting a few more item specific pings in, hopefully for 7.21. Stuff like letting you ping stack numbers of Tear or whether Duskblade is currently detecting something or not (as per the icon on the buffbar already). If you&#039;ve got thoughts on item specific info it&#039;d be valuable to be able to share with your team would love to hear them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Ashen Rider","date":"2017-10-11T16:26:29.371+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed an Ekko change on the PBE that made his passive deal double damage to monsters.

During this base stat adjustment, she was given the same treatment as other mid-laners as opposed to other enchanters.\n\nSo what's up? Are you guys trying to support her as a mid laner or as a support right now?\n\nPlease note: I am not saying I'd rather see her support lane, well, supported, I'm just curious what is happening with her, because it kind of seems like a mess.
