The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Working on CS Bounties**\r\n\r\nWe've got some work underway on CS bounties at the moment. Thoughts going into that:\r\n\r\n* CS bounties have been quite helpful in offering comeback chances, which has put early and midgame snowball into a significantly more appropriate state than before their introduction.\r\n* The prior bounty system that only accounted for kills unduly penalized takedowns and rewarded farming.  \r\n* CS bounties aren't always functioning as they're meant to at present. While we fixed some bugs recently others are still happening resulting in CS bounties on champions who aren't clearly and meaningfully ahead of the enemy team.\r\n* The way the CS bounty system functions isn't clear enough. That makes it hard to identify bugs from intended behavior and hard to understand how to play around the bounty system in general. Kill bounties by contrast benefit from being a more straight forward system.\r\n* CS bounties are meant to reduce if the enemy team catches up on farm. Looks like that's functioning as intended at least some of the time though.\r\n\r\nBased off the above we'll be looking to fix bugs, make the system as a whole clearer and where needed change how the system functions so it’s never putting bounties on champs when they don’t have a significant advantage (e.g. when CSing well from behind, which happens at present sometimes but isn’t intended).\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Ranked Post Next Week**\r\n\r\nThe revisions to the Ranked system have been out for around a month now and we've been working our way through a lot of player sentiment and other data. We’ll have a significant update on where things are at and our plans coming next week.\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Shentakill","date":"2019-02-20T18:43:13.214+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":2,"body":"Currently, Shen is in the worst state that he's been post-rework since launch. The idea is to keep him balanced around pro play. His post rework kit is centered around teamwork and coordination with nerfs to his solo laning. Creating a very lackluster experience when playing him top. Early levels in his q is still insufficient to farm under tower, the idea of his empowered Q autos is a neat mechanic the problem with it is having to constantly reposition it to make use of it which leads to being at risk of being out of position, you can be punished by the enemy top laner as well as getting caught by the enemy jungler trying to reposition your sword. \n\nWith his high Q cooldown early game you have to either use it to trade with an enemy laner when they go in for harass or use it to kill minions to farm effectively due to Shen's low base damage. This ability currently suffers from very low reward for what it's supposed to do. Shen in the top lane, suffers from many bad match ups usually resulting in him getting shoved under tower. Leaving Shen to scrap up what he can and wait until 6 to make a play elsewhere on the map. The problem with this, due to the current meta of tower plating, the enemy top laner will just take free plates resulting in Shen being even further behind. His W, is very powerful when going for an Ult play to save an ally, and comes in handy to mitigate damage in a team fight, again in Solo queue the lack of coordination can cause this ability to not be used to its greatest potential but has a ridiculously long cooldown as well. \n\nHis E has always been extremely satisfying to use, landing a taunt on multiple people can change the fight entirely, but also has a long cooldown. His ult has been standard, nerfed at times, but a lower cooldown teleport at 3 minutes and 20 seconds at level 6, and 2 minutes and 40 seconds at level 16. Pre-rework Shen was ultimately more satisfying to use. his in lane sustain with vorpal blades, the on hit heal, as well as his old passive ki strike which made shen a decent duelist as he built more health. The most important thing that made pre-rework Shen enjoying to play was his build diversity, ranging from Tank, bruiser, on-hit, as well as Ap off-tank. As opposed to current Shen's cookie cutter build Tiamat/Sunfire, and the non-AD ratios make building any sort of AD useless on Shen. \n\nShen is supposed to be Zed's counterpart; a kickass ninja fighting in the name of balance, his current abilities doesn't fit that thematic. It's to the point where playing Shen is a constant frustration, he's just not fun to play in his current state. Shen is considered a tank but with one of the lowest base tank stats in the game, even below some mages and marksman.
