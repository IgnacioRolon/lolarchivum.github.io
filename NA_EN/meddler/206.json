{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-12-05T16:40:30.489+0000","title":"Quick Gameplay Thoughts: December 5","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi folks,\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Usual Disclaimers**\n\nThese posts will often contain talk about future work we&#039;re doing, or planning to do, that isn&#039;t yet guaranteed to ship. The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**Snowdown pass and Nexus Blitz**\n\nBoth the Snowdown pass and Nexus Blitz will be going live tomorrow morning (6th of December). First, some pass details:\n\n* The Snowdown pass is an updated version of the Worlds pass. You now get tokens from winning games, with half as many for a loss. Champion mastery grades no longer have any effect on tokens earned. You can also get some tokens from first win of the day, from missions and from orbs. \n* Prestige Akali&#039;s available this time.\n* There will also be some unique rewards that only work on Nexus Blitz/ARAM during this event (special recall VFX/audio, finisher vfx/audio, a fire poro pet). You can unlock those via a second type of token that can only be earned on Nexus Blitz. Can also get them with RP if preferred.\n* Pass runs until the 7th of January. More details, numbers especially can be found on Riot Mort&#039;s Twitter https://twitter.com/Mortdog/status/1069710221780480005\n\nPlus a quick refresh on what&#039;s up with Nexus Blitz:\n\n* We&#039;ve done a lot of work on Nexus Blitz since its first run, with significantly better map art, improved events and rewards, some changes to the map geo, bans in champion select and more. If you never checked it out previously, or gave it a shot but found it a bit too unpolished, highly recommend giving it a try!\n* If Nexus Blitz proves to be really popular throughout its run we&#039;ll be looking into making it a permanent mode that&#039;s always on. If it gets a decent amount of play, but not enough to break the needed threshold for permanence we&#039;ll look at bringing it back as an RGM regularly instead.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \n**Tower stats and rewards post preseason**\n\nSo far tower stats and rewards are performing as we&#039;d hoped. One of our key goals was to address cases where towers fell too quickly, cutting lane phase off too early. We didn&#039;t want to increase the length of longest laning phases by contrast, feeling those were already long enough. Looking at some stats:. \n\n10th percentile (towers fall before this time only 10% of the time)\n\n* 8.22 = 9 minutes, 11 seconds\n* 8.23 = 11 minutes, 8 seconds\n\n50th percentile (towers fall before this time 50% of the time)\n\n* 8.22 = 12 minutes, 17 seconds\n* 8.23 = 14 minutes, 1 second\n\n90th percentile (towers fall before this time 90% of the time)\n\n* 8.22 = 15 minutes, 35 seconds\n* 8.23 = 15 minutes, 56 seconds\n\nThese are stats from all MMR ranges combined. When looking at high MMR only all of the above values are about 1 minute faster, both in 8.22 and 8.23.\n\nOther goals were to make diving a bit more risky, via increased tower damage. We&#039;re still seeing a decent amount of diving going on, but with somewhat increased odds of a turnaround being possible, so that&#039;s also looking good so far. Still looking into data on the rewards side of things, will have that to share soonish. Also looks pretty appropriate though, with income up a bit but not dramatically, leading to champs more often leaving laning phase with their first big item completed as desired. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \n**Lane Swaps**\n\nLane Swaps are on our minds a bit given the changes to towers and game pacing. We don&#039;t want to see the game end up back in a state where early lanes are uncontested and champions just don&#039;t interact in organized play. We are open to  early rotations or 1v2s as an occasional thing, though have some caution about how balance-able lane swapping as a more niche but viable option is, given it&#039;s been extremely frequent or missing entirely historically. Not concerned at present, given there are a lot of factors that should stop lane swaps being excessively powerful, or could be tuned to do so if needed. Plating gives more time to respond to towers going down. Plating rewards make it more costly to not defend your own towers. First tower gold, though smaller now, still exists as does tower fortification (50% reduced damage on top and mid outer towers in the first 5 minutes). \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \n**Katarina changes on the PBE** \n\nWe&#039;ve got a couple of changes to Kat&#039;s E hitting PBE I wanted to mention since they hard to spot or datamine and feedback on them would be useful:\n\n* Spell Buffering - Gunblade Active can now be buffered with all of Kat&#039;s spells. Should be particularly noticeable for higher ping players.\n* E - Cast time is now split into 0.075s before the blink and 0.075s after it, instead of 0.15s all up front. Should make E feel better when dodging incoming spells or picking up daggers. \n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ereldra","date":"2018-12-05T16:51:40.366+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":15,"body":"Hello Meddler,\n\nthere has been for some time alot of complains (forum, reddit etc.) about the general damage in the game beeing too high.

The League balance team, along with Meddler specifically, has mentioned on numerous times that they believe the games overall damage is too high and have been taking steps to address it. Some more or less successfully (i.e. Dark Harvest rework, Infinity Edge rework, Celerity rework, talks of Absolute Focus being too strong, etc) but regardless of success the team is taking steps to try and reduce the game’s overall damage output. In that same vein though, if you’re all inning a Zed as Syndra, it’s absoluteg going to be a who bursts who faster. In reality it’s going to be like versus any assassin or _burst_ mage.\n\nOn a personal note, Meddler doesn’t have to respond to you. He started doing these posts as a courtesy, not an obligation. Don’t expect him to go out of his way like you are entitled to his time.\n\nTL;DR:\nMeddler isn’t your personal buddy in Riot Games, nor is he obligated to respond or even acknowledge you. The questions you’re asking are already being addressed or in discussion, but systematic changes like “the whole game’s damage is too high” is a lot more difficult to address than nerfing Irelia. Rather than whining about how Meddler doesn’t respond to your posts, instead research what change the Riot team is already doing to address your concerns and offer your _constructive feedback_ to improving them knowing that Meddler will probably read but not respond to your posts.\n\nHaving such amazing designers, like Meddler, who share their internal workings with the community is a privilege, not a right.\n\nRiot Meddler’s Quick Gameplay Thoughts concerning damage:\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/2RzBfAcE-quick-gameplay-thoughts-july-27\n\nRiot Axes’ Marksman update post:\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/2ykqAkNa-marksman-changes-coming-to-pbe-in-the-next-couple-days\n\nLeague’s Official patch notes regarding Dark Harvest changes:\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-823-notes","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dethflash","date":"2018-12-05T17:04:28.712+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":6,"body":"Howdy Meddler,\nbeen a  lot of discussion, and complaints about damage being to high, and i would agree.

Since you said the problem is it's not distinct enough currently.\n\nRight now a big reason bruisers get a bad rap is their build path - unless they're playing pure assassin, they get two damage items into tank. At the three item mark, the adc suddenly faces a 200-250 AD Vi who ALSO has a Randuins. Spear is super important because light fighters need a full buildpath of hybrid items - not only does it help them scale throughout the entire game, but more importantly, it also keeps them relatively squishy unless they opt into pure defensive items. Making bruisers a healthy, balanceable class requires making them useful and vulnerable at all stages of the game. \n\nThanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"garen is great","date":"2018-12-05T17:11:01.944+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler,\n\nTalked to Riot Maple on Twitter and it seems like some changes are being looked at for Gnar? {{champion:150}} \n\nAny chance you could go over those?

This can help guide peoples' efforts to grow the mode and recommend it to others, build communities, etc. It can give us an idea of what we need to do.\n\nThere's a lot on the line here as the difference between a permanent mode and a Rotating Game Mode is constant availability versus 1-2 weeks per year if we are lucky. With the rate at which we're seeing RGM's lately though the frequency could be even less.\n\nThere's too much invested in this mode to relegate it to the RGM schedule. We need this to be permanent. Please ask those whom it may concern to keep us in the loop and not let the permanent mode threshold be a mystery.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aurelion Swol","date":"2018-12-05T19:33:48.746+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any chance you are going to buff aurelion sol?
