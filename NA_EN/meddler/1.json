The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Balance team is silver, lol**\r\n\r\nBeen seeing this statement, or something similar to it, crop up quite a bit recently. It&#039;s been a common enough joke at times in the past of course, feels like there are quite a few people treating it as fact right now however. Figured the easiest way to talk about it as a result was just to link a bunch of accounts from people on the Live Gameplay team who are fairly highly rated this season. \r\n\r\nNote that I&#039;ve used op.gg below simply because it&#039;s a site I personally use, not because Riot endorses it any more or less than any other similar site. Divisions listed are where people are in solo/duo, some people have higher ratings in Flex, others don&#039;t play flex at all. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Sotere Diamond 3 - Designer - http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=RiotSotere\r\n* Repertoir - Diamond 4 - Designer - http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Repertoir\r\n* Trading Stance - Diamond 4 - Designer - http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=TradingStance\r\n* Wav3break - Diamond 5 - Designer - http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=wav3break\r\n* Wittrock - Diamond 4 - QA - http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=riotwittrock\r\n* Azubk - Diamond 2 - Designer - http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=azubk\r\n\r\n\r\nA few other notes:\r\n\r\n* While the Live Gameplay team is the team that does most of the patch to patch balance changes they also do a lot of other stuff too (e.g. item changes, smaller champion updates, runes work etc). They&#039;re also not the only team that does balance work (the new champion team for example is responsible for the release balance of a champion, with Live Gameplay taking over after that).  \r\n* This isn&#039;t the full Live Gameplay team. There are some lower ranked folks on the team too, and some other Diamond+ players as well. We&#039;ve generally found being good at LoL makes it more likely someone will be good at designing on LoL, but also frequently had people who don&#039;t do so well in game perform really strongly as designers. \r\n* We&#039;ve also got a separate team called Playtest with a higher average ranking again (generally high diamond to masters) who are focused on assessing upcoming changes and how they&#039;ll impact the game.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Health Bar Improvements**\r\n\r\nMost people have probably seen this already, for anyone that hasn&#039;t, we&#039;ve got a bunch of health bar changes coming soonish (not in 7.22, but soon after):\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/2x0eKJkU-preseason-healthbar-update\r\n\r\nIn addition to general feedback on those changes thoughts on other ways we could improve health bars further would be really useful too. We&#039;re planning a second round of work for early next year, looking at things like conveying HoTs and DoTs well for example. Since we&#039;re working on health bars already that makes that the ideal time to add any other features to them that would also be really valuable before the people looking at them move on to other work. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Bandit on the support items**\r\n\r\nFor now at least we&#039;re putting the old Bandit mastery on the support items to avoid hitting support income in pre-season. Longer term we may look at better ways to deliver that income, at least at present we&#039;ll be delivering it there though. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2017-10-27T16:45:44.477+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":14,"body":"Don't let these awful claims drag you down, you guys are doing your job pretty well apart from a few outliners here and there, but then again, we're all human.\n\nSpeaking of Outliners, how does Galio fare now after the hotfix?\nAlso, why wasn't there more emphasis put on his passive, colossal smash being some of his main damage?\ni think thematically it'd fit since he likes punching things and an AP bruiser wanting to maximize that cdr refund while brawling seems more intuitive than the Q poke spell.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-10-27T17:03:12.787+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"Thanks.\n\nWe'll look at Galio again today, not sure yet.\n\nOne of the reasons for putting power into the Q in particular was to try and get back a bit of the old Galio playstyle, create a larger distinction between tank and AP builds.

If you think about it, she wouldn't need the janky new charm mechanic that's weak because she has stealth, not having a big gap-closer wouldn't have been an issue or she could have had a slightly better engage tool, and you wouldn't have to compromise the stealth because she wouldn't have had CC in her kit.  \n\n>With Eve we were also worried that the AD path would lead to a bruiser/fighter builds\n\nI feel like that was an unnecessary fear because that probably would never have happened without an ult to give her extra tankiness.  If you look at the assassins that were able to become bruisers, it's because they had a lot of cheese in the kit that enabled the playstyle while still putting up damage numbers.  Old evelynn didn't have the burst in her kit to put up big numbers, she was more DPS unless you wanted to really expose yourself with a sheen build, and the only thing she really had going for her was the shield on her ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2017-10-30T18:21:11.500+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We did talk about her being a skirmisher early in development but felt that we would have to sacrifice to much of her thematic  for her to be a skirmisher.

Skirmishers generally need to look a bit tougher as they are generally tankier.

Thank you for exploring all options.\n\nI see where you are coming from on this.  I mean you could have pushed it with her because technically fiora, yi and yasuo are skirmishers too and they don't look that tanky.  If you kept the old, polarizing bondage outfit it would have worked.\n\nThat said I agree with the idea in general that a champ should pass the eyeball test.  \n\nMy only problem with thematic cohesion in the specific case of the new evelynn is that her stealth aspect and her charm aspects are tugging too hard at one another in general, and when I look at the kit, it feels like it's a jimmy-rigged nightmare waiting to bust apart because of that decision.  It's like they are water and oil.\n\nI honestly feel like she should have been turned 2 different champs, one for each aspect.","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2017-10-30T20:48:50.333+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Yasuo does look a bit more tanky (With the whole metal armguard) and Fiora is literally wearing armor.\n\nYi was made in a time before we were really  striving for thematic cohesion and Yasuo was made in a time before skirmishers were even a thing. The fact that some of our Old champions are not thematically cohesive isn't a great reason to ignore it for future champions.\n\nAs for her stealth/charm we feel like that is part of what makes her unique and sells her \"Shadow Stalker\" fantasy. Much like in her lore she stalks her victim and entrances them overtime until they fall for her and then she goes in for the kill. The way we reflected it in the gameplay is that she is stalking her victim from stealth and then chooses her target (puts the W on them) and then they slowly succumb to her until they cant resist anymore and that's when Eve goes in for the kill. It does lead to more cat and mouse cerebral gameplay, but we feel that is also what makes her different from other Assassins, that just see  there target and immediately go in for the kill.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2017-10-30T18:51:06.124+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is only half of the situation.\n\nEvelynn has the lowest level of target selection for any assassin in the game. It's almost debatable if she's an assassin at all, given her seemingly poor target selection. Though of course, I wouldn't know that for a fact because Riot has still not done a Dev Corner on what target selection actually means.\n\nWe asked Meddler in one of these recent Quick Gameplay Updates what he thought the important differences were between divers and assassins and he gave us barely anything (divers in general have more CC, though obviously that's not the case when you have champs like Evelynn and Shaco), assassins have more burst (again that is very hard to see on our end, especially with a champion like Evelynn being billed as the latest assassin) and divers are tankier.\n\nThe overall move away from immediate, 0.5 second burst patterns of assassins seems to lend them to being built for sustain tank situations, like Ekko, Fizz and Akali have all done in the past and like Diana and Elise always will do. In what way is blurring the lines between assassins and divers, and then canceling the diver class update, a good thing? We as consumers do not understand these decisions at all because it looks like you hate tank assassins, then you make an assassin who only functions as a tank {{champion:245}} , then you make all assassins into really delayed burst diver types like Ekko, then you say \"oh, well, assassins are all about target selection, and they somehow have more target selection than divers but we won't explain how\", and then you follow that up with Evelynn. \n\nPlease answer me here, Reav3.

Almost all of them have point-and-click cc and dashes, and lots of them are literally immune to peel.\n\nThe only common theme of the Assassin list is that they have some sort of exit strategy (except Nocturne). So it sort of begs the question of why the new Evelynn qualifies as an assassin when \"divers\" Lee, Elise, and Wukong all have higher burst and more reliable disengage.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2017-10-30T17:46:02.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't that lead to a danger of unhealthy gameplay emerging like tank ekko and fizz or whatever","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2017-10-30T18:08:21.873+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends.

This is the best design they can come up for  a game that brings in billions of dollars.","replies":[{"poster":"kargish","date":"2017-10-28T20:49:03.077+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I mean I'd argue with you about this and all, but since you happen to be talking shit about the design teams rank, while you yourself are gold IV and gold last season, I am just going to rest my case and ignore your points.","replies":[{"poster":"chumchumm","date":"2017-10-29T05:07:19.682+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol what a shock a rito fan boy who cant make any valid points. even if my rank was gold 4 it has nothing to do with my points. I was critizing the design team complete lack of experience in the game they are balancing. literally 3 of those accounts meddler listed as shiny examples have not played a single game in 2months. I never said i should be balancing the game or could balance better i said that they balance team should include skill individuals who idk actually play the game on a regular basis so \"but ur gold 4 comment makes no sense\". second of my main was jinxgaming and was d3 adc main before i took 2month break in the summer which is a higher raiting than literally 5 out of the 6 members on their balance team so lulz. I took a break because i gave up on rito completely and utter scorn for competitive integrity. watching tobias fate literally int feed for 12hour straight on stream that had rioters in the stream yet no ban proved to me that rito couldnt care less about competitive integrity or promoting a healthy competitive environment so i have completely given up on being competitive in this game and have gone to being competitive in games and i only play around on league any more to mess around in ranked like 90% of the league community who treat ranked as a casual game mode and rito who will suspend you if u dare say a curse word to a guy who is first timing a champion released that day and goes 0-18-3.","replies":[{"poster":"kargish","date":"2017-10-29T10:13:19.493+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://i.gyazo.com/f815bec504be7edae95098feac891c63.png","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Off Meta Zilean","date":"2017-10-27T19:28:04.739+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Meddler!  Been asking you this ~6-8 times or so over the past month, not sure if you're ignoring me because the way I'm asking isn't polite enough(?) or if you've just been too busy to respond to me!\n\nUnlike Karma, Zyra, etc. Zilean got only armor buffs on the PBE in place of his seals.  Previously you mentioned that such mid/support flexing mages were being switched over to HP, so that they were equally effective in Midlane, but Zilean seems to have been forgotten.  \n\nAre y'all deliberately removing him from midlane since his support is more popular? :L Or was this just an oversight?\n\nHope to hear back soon, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-10-27T21:58:46.754+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll be giving Zilean an Armor/HP split to address that (doing the same thing on Zyra too).
