The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Patch 8.13 will be a 3 week patch**\r\n\r\nIn order to get our patch timing to sync up with various events later in the year we need to do one three week patch, which will be 8.13 (the patch that&#039;s on live now). That means most things for 8.14 will just spend some extra time on the PBE and then the patch will go out as normal, just a week later. To reduce the time between balance adjustments though we&#039;ll be doing a mini patch via micropatching halfway through the 8.14 development cycle. An 8.13b basically, like we did 7.24b last year before the holidays. Details of what will go in that next week once we&#039;ve got them figured out, will primarily be needed balance changes that shouldn&#039;t have to wait another week and a half until 8.14. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**ARAM dev blog**\r\n\r\nFor anyone that missed it we&#039;ve got a Dev blog on the ARAM changes that were tried recently and why some are and aren&#039;t sticking around permanently.\r\n\r\nhttps://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/06/dev-aram-changes-roundup/\r\n\r\nTLDR\r\nWe&#039;re keeping:\r\n\r\n* The bench where rerolled picks go\r\n* Early surrender time\r\n* Delay until you can leave base\r\n* Faster early XP . \r\n* Dark Harvest ARAM specific nerfs\r\n* AOE health relics\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re Removing:\r\n\r\n* The three new items (mixed results and experiences with/against, might explore some of them again at some point)\r\n* Butcher&#039;s Bridge (back at some point, gone for now, talking when/how to do so again)\r\n* Warmog&#039;s. Poke without it&#039;s too strong. Will replace it at some point with an anti poke item designed for ARAM that gives needed poke resistance without all the issues Warmogs also brings.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**Fizz W**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re going to take another stab at Fizz W changes on the PBE this cycle, aiming to incorporate elements of the new and old Ws. TLDR:\r\n \r\nPassive - AAs apply a DoT\r\nActive - Next attack deals magic damage. If it kills, it resets. If it doesn&#039;t, Fizz gets magic damage on hit for 6s.\r\n\r\nAs with the previous changes we were testing feedback much appreciated, especially if you get the chance to play with them directly on the PBE. Numbers won&#039;t necessarily be correct initially, so looking particularly for how it feels to use and what such a skill does to Fizz&#039;s gameplay pattern, rather than exact balance tuning.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Tooltips**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve got some work going on on updating LoL&#039;s tooltip style at the moment as you might have seen with some partial changes on Aatrox&#039;s tooltips. That will be a gradual process and, like the cursor update, will involve a lot of showing stuff, getting feedback, and iterating on it. More details from the team working on that shortly, including what our goals are, what features we&#039;ll be adding that our current tooltips don&#039;t deliver, what sort of timeline to expect etc.\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"give me resets","date":"2018-06-29T16:17:43.304+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":16,"body":"Hi Meddler,\n\nAre there any changes planned for Katarina in the near future?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-06-29T16:48:57.922+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hi series of posts from Reddit Katarina Mains.

Every kat main agrees that she lost her feel of being a fast assassin who could strike quickly and blink all over the place in a few seconds. The clunkiness of her kit wasn't that noticeable before the shunpo nerfs, but now we're feeling it and it makes her feel like a mage not an assassin for a lot of us. \n\n In that regard, we think that two options could give her back her identity of a fast teamfighting assassin :\n\n1. First, we think that removing the cast time of her shunpo would remove a lot of awkward situations she faces and could make her feel faster. For example when she shunpos at the last moment when a morg's q or nami's q are about to hit, she manages to shunpo but she gets ccd and basically dies because of this. \n\n2. Finally, we think that decreasing her dagger delays would really give her some speed back and remove the major issues of clunkiness of her kit. That being said, we would definitely trade some damage for more speed. \n\nSo do you think there's any room for one of these options to be taken into consideration ? \n\nHaving fun with the champion we love playing is more important than everything.

Local Sona {{champion:37}} main here. <3\n\nHer weaker early game (at least compared to champions like Nami with her heals or Brand with his damage) is compensation for her incredible late game scaling as well as her teamfight power. There have been times where her early game was more comparable to Nami (or other champions who tend to do well earlier on) while she still maintained her incredible late game. This was incredibly frustrating to play against and hasn't been allowed to persist for very long spans of time due to this.\n\nI love her kit and I can't imagine that there would be many reasons to massively change one of the easier to pick up kits in the game, at least not right now (though obviously I don't speak for Riot). There are still ways for Sona to outplay by using her kit to the max, albeit it may not be as mechanically challenging as LeBlanc or Katarina or Kalista or something anyhow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Headmans Pride","date":"2018-06-29T17:03:30.019+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sona is best lategame support","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chawoora","date":"2018-06-29T18:48:02.101+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"He Meddler, any thoughts on the state of tank junglers?\n\nI started off the season with good success on a few tank junglers (Sejuani and Nautilus mostly for me).

Thoughts on that and a bunch more to come from the folks working on the tooltips update.\n\nAs someone who **_always _**looks at the detailed tooltips on new Aatrox, but understands that if you put 100 things in 1 place it's difficult to find anything, I loved the way tooltips were done with Zoe, where you have the most important stuff in the main text, and then the most important details in darker, smaller font at the end of the tooltip: https://i.imgur.com/yHXpG0S.png\n\nI think this approach is perfect. It hides the details a bit so - at least for me - although the tooltip is longer, it doesn't feel that way. It doesn't distract from the main tooltip.\n\nI prefer this sooo much over the newer appraoch with Aatrox, where if you want to look at the other tooltip (no matter which one you've looked at first) it's kinda confusing because you have to search for the changes.\nAnd of course pressing/holding Shift is cumbersome, and although I could live with a toggle I feel like a tooltip all in 1 font gives less overview than one with the main part in big+white and details at the end in grey+small. It has the same problem again where it's just a long tooltip - a Zoe-style tooltip of the same length would feel so much better to me.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ov3rcome","date":"2018-06-29T22:44:15.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Meddler, not a question but I just wanted to say I haven't had as much fun with League as I had during these last 2 patches.
