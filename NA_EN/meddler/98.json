The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n**Back to regular posting schedule**\n \nI&#039;ve been back in the office this week catching up on everything after a couple of weeks in Japan (somewhere I&rsquo;ve wanted to visit for years, was  a fantastic time). Should be back to the standard two posts a week thing now. Apologies if I end up repeating anything that&#039;s already been talked about a lot in my absence, I think I&#039;ve got a pretty good handle on what has/hasn&#039;t already been discussed, but might have missed something.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**Input Buffering**\n \nSomething we&#039;ve been doing on some individual abilities for a while is making it so that, if their button is pressed just before it would be useable (e.g. while in the middle of another spell or just before it comes off CD), the command is saved and then executed shortly after. A particularly clear example of that is on Lee Sin W back in 7.11.Buffering like that makes executing combos and other cases of precise timing  smoother on connections that aren&#039;t extremely low ping. \n \nWhile working on Irelia we developed some new tech that makes input buffering like that much easier to apply to other abilities. It&#039;s been working well on Irelia so we&#039;re looking to roll it out to almost all abilities in the game shortly. That change is currently in testing on the PBE and we&rsquo;re hoping to have it be part of 8.9.\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n**Target Champions Only as a Toggle option**\n \nAt present it&#039;s possible to make it so you can&rsquo;t click on non champions with spells/attacks by holding down a specific key while casting/attacking (default: ~). That works well in some cases and for some players, but can be pretty cumbersome for others. We&#039;re currently working on an optional setting (would be found in the Gameplay Options part of the menu) that would let you change that from a Press and Hold approach to something you can toggle on and off with a key press instead.\n \nThat&#039;s just getting some initial internal testing now, so probably won&#039;t be on the PBE for a little bit at least. It&#039;s also possible, though I&#039;d imagine unlikely, that we find something that makes it a bad idea to add that functionality to the game. Letting you folks know ahead of time though since I know this is a feature a number of people have asked for over the years. Wanted to provide visibility into how we&#039;re looking at it as a result, regardless of what the timing and outcome of that might be. \n---------------------------------------------------------  \n**Shifting approach somewhat on some midseason stuff**\n \nAs previously mentioned we want to open up positions to more classes. That would allow players who wished to to play champs in ways they currently can&#039;t and enable new team comps. At the same time we&#039;d also want to ensure what currently works is still effective - broaden options, not force anyone onto something different. Based on that goal we set ourselves a target of getting mages into bot lane in midseason. After a lot of experimentation though we&#039;re shifting our approach somewhat there. We tested some large changes, which were very effective in letting mages be powerful bot lane choices. They resulted however in a lot of game balance costs though, some breakdown in interesting/healthy bot lane play and a lot of disruption when done all at once. \n \nAs a result what we&#039;re aiming to do instead is a range of changes that both improve some other issues and lay some groundwork for getting more classes into each position. That includes, but isn&#039;t limited to, mages in botlane. These changes won&#039;t radically redefine how the game plays. Instead they&#039;ll be part of a gradual process (multiple patches, not just 8.9) to open things up more, avoid balance costs and other unforeseen consequences of changing too much at once. Might see a few champs being played in new ways after them certainly, but not a massive meta overhaul. LoL.com publishing will also be quieter this year as a result too. We&#039;ll have one or two patch-specific articles for later changes that are more complex than 8.9&#039;s stat/cost tunings, but no website this time.\n \nExamples of what upcoming changes will be trying to do below (more details about exactly how to come pretty soon). While these changes are things we think should help open up the game somewhat they&#039;re also changes we believe will lead to good improvement on other grounds as well.\n \n* Changing mid/late game marksmen damage so they&#039;re less able to burst squishies but still able to grind through defense stacking targets. That gives other squishy champs longer windows to act later game while still letting marksmen kill tanky enemies effectively enough over time.\n* Adjusting mage mana access so they can contest lane against a wider range of champions at early levels but also can&#039;t just cast on CD as much mid game onwards (results in excessive waveclear power in particular)\n* Increasing the damage AP champs deal to towers,so that, regardless of position, they can contribute more to tower/base taking, reducing dependency on bot lane for that function. Might need to be paired with some increase in tower tankiness so they&#039;re not falling faster than at present.\n* Making it easier for champions from a range of positions/classes to carry, so teams aren&#039;t as dependent on their marksman&#039;s damage output every game to be successful. A fed mid, top or jungle champ should more often be a good choice for a team to rally around and support. \n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Very Cash Money","date":"2018-04-20T14:57:41.660+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yo meddler what is your thoughts on kindred?

On his list of suggestions, he suggested stuff like (straight from the proposal he sent me):\n\n* Generally making marks a bit easier to acquire, but a bit less powerful per mark.\n * Marks being able to spawn in either jungle, rather than only the opponents'.\n * Reducing mark warm-up time on enemy champions to try and get a cleaner balance between champion and jungle marks.\n* Removing W -> Q interaction and just having Q's cooldown reduced when it hits a champion or monster.\n* Increasing W radius to let Wolf feel more useful instead of it being primarily a mobility enabler.\n * Or some other effect to accomplish the same goal of making Wolf feel more useful.\n* Possibly just base 550 range instead of the increasing range with marks.\n* If the above are a too powerful, probably some base stat or damage nerfs here and there.\n\nI'm mostly open to stuff like this being tested, though there's a lot going on here, so it could take some time to validate. If we felt more confident there was a specific kind of work that would be exciting to Kindred players as well as a pretty clear path forward, that would increase the likelihood we would take on the work. We get a lot of requests to do these champ readjustments, so frequently it's a matter of when there's resources to do it more-so than a desire to test something out. I (and others on the design teams) do tend to love these types of explorations, however, so when we do have that clearer goal to go chase, it's usually possible to get someone on board with going for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Little Celestial","date":"2018-04-20T19:44:07.582+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"How about having this Rakan effect, where if Kindred attack in melee range, Wolf does the autoattack?

Please hear me out despite this being a lengthy post.\n\nI am a Talon main ever since I started league of legends. I want to discuss Talon, and I am going to separate them into two parts in this comment. The first part is on a discussion made by Cloud Walker on bug fixes and other changes on Talon, and the second part is on my discussion on an adequate update to Talon's kit. In the post I made, I am very passionate about this change I am proposing, and would really like some feedback. The link is below. in Part 1 of this post.\n\n\n\n**1. **\nI made an in depth post on a Talon update/rework recently called \"In depth Talon update/mini rework, For RiotRepertoir and Meddler\", that would be similar to the extent of the changes of Xin Zhaos last big update. I put a lot of time and effort into contemplating this change in addition to constructing it into a discussion. Sadly it has gotten very little feedback. Link to my post is this - [https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/9AxTIRhc-in-depth-talon-updatemini-rework-for-riotrepertoir-and-meddler](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/9AxTIRhc-in-depth-talon-updatemini-rework-for-riotrepertoir-and-meddler)\n\nI cannot express how much I would appreciate it if the two of you, RiotRepertoir and Meddler, would take a look at my post and give feedback, even if you just look at the ability changes, and don't read the lengthy part that follows which elaborates on the changes some more. If everything I suggested would not come to light(would be awesome if it did),I would be really happy if even one of the new mechanics to the changes I proposed would be implemented in Talons gameplay, with the one I would like the most being his secondary W which I called \"Keen Blade\" and would act as two alternate abilities similar to how Jayce has 2 abilities for his q, w, and e with Talon it would just be his W; If even that was brought into the game I would be extremely grateful, and just mentioning here, I made him weaker in other parts of his kit to allow for this change and he actually has a weaker quick burst and is less likely to one shot someone in the laning phase and early game.\n\nIf it is not something that will be implemented in game at all, even though I would be disappointed, I'll accept that; however please give me some feedback given the extent in which I went into the discussion. I know it is long but please at least just read the specifics on the abilities and if your interested then you can read on with how I elaborate on the specifics and what the changes would mean for Talon in game.\n\n___________\n\n**2. ** \nConcerning Cloud Walkers post titled \"@RiotRepertoir, can we do something about TALON?\", RiotRepertoir had replied and in his response he implied that he will fix Talons Q bug/increase his Q range. In that post he also expressed concerns of his e being buggy and will backflip rather than go in the intended direction of the player depending on certain terrain/approach to certain terrain. There is more to his post that I think should be given thought as well, but these two are particularly what I wanted to bring to your attention. On a side note to this, Talon's movement speed is 335, and before the assassin update it was 350. I felt this movement speed nerf was not deserved even with the new wall hop, and would be willing to sacrifice slightly how fast his movement speed is when using his e to bring it back to 350, ideal would be 355 like yi and pantheon. Regardless of mobility in assassins kit in general I think every assassin should have 350 ms simply because of the fact that they are assassins. About when do you think the bug fixes would be made, and potentially the increase to his movement speed to 350 or 355?\n\n___________\n\n\nSorry for making this post so long despite your limited time. I tried to make this post concise but it ended up being longer than I intended, it is difficult when I have a lot to explain. Please at least one of you give me some feedback on my post for an update to Talon's kit, even if the changes won't be implemented it will still mean a lot if either of you at least took the time to see if it would help add to the games diversity in champions and make Talon a more unique champion that compared to the current Talon has a greater potential to have less impact over a game and is much more difficult to get kills early, but also a greater potential to have more of an impact over a game, especially mid and late game and in teamfights and skirmishes. I really hope you both like the overall direction of his changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-04-20T19:01:38.981+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tagging this for response later.","replies":[{"poster":"Ramaero","date":"2018-04-20T19:09:29.838+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks so much! looking forward to hearing your feedback when you have time later.

I really wish I did a better job of compressing everything. \n\nAs for this reply this is as concise as I can be...I edited this out two times for the sake of condensing the length. I know you can only spare so much time for this as you have other things working on, but I really hope reading this will make you more interested in reading my thread. Please at least read the part just giving the specifics on the changes in his abilities which is less than half the length of my thread, aside from that the rest is elaboration and clarification. \n\nThat being said I want to point out Talons gameplay is still my favorite among assassins and he has been my main champion since I started for almost 3 years now, over 600,000 pts in him, and I climbed from silver 3 or 4(forget exactly where I placed) to gold 4 with him this season so far with over 300 games on him in ranked this season. I also have a different playstyle to him than most and prefer taking ghost over ignite, and phase rush over electrocute, with the same thing last season(stormraiders surge over thunderlords).\n\nNow onto the concerns you asked me to discuss:\n\n______________\n\nTalons gameplay frequently feels very straightforward and simple when he tries to kill a squishy which is usually pretty easy and takes generally 1-2 seconds(sometimes too easy and less than 1 second if I am very ahead), afterwards trying to re-engage to do anything more in a fight is generally very risky and not worth it without his ult, and many times having just one successful kill isn't enough to win the fight or be worth it, so your stuck between trying to get an objective or cs and hope your team doesn't die without you, or reengage as a sacrificial suicide bomber(with no ult) because the team still needs you, which will really suck if after all of that the enemy team still ended up winning the fight despite the Talons efforts.\n\nThus my solution is to sacrifice Talon's ability to do burst damage so that it is considerably less and gives the enemy more time to react an offer some type of counterplay to Talon and in general not die quite as fast; however In return for lowering his intitial burst damage, give Talon more mobility like the dash I discuss in my thread, and an additional skill shot ability as a part of his W as part of his damage. In addition to that upon getting a takedown, which will be more difficult to achieve because of his lowered burst damage, he then gets a spike in his ability to deal damage as well as a spike in his mobility similar to how Katerina, Master yi, and Darius get benefits during takedowns/kills in a fight. \n\nThis doesn't mean Talon would not be able to quickly one shot someone, just that the amount of gold and level difference he would need to do so will be higher and he will be less capable of that early game, as well as he would need an extra reliance on landing skill shots to kill.\n\nThis change to Talon will for me, and I believe for many others who like Talon, will make him a more rewarding and enjoyable champion to play. He will have an increased skill ceiling with more room for error, but a potential to do even greater things if someone does really well with him in certain situations, particularly in teamfights; he will be less about killing someone quickly, but in return will have more mobility, intricacy, and variety in how he approaches fights and gets kills. \n\nMy original thread dives into this in which I have a detailed idea for his rework, including damage specifics, cooldowns, etc. I know the length is daunting but please only read the part of the thread that has the ability specifications with what the abilities actually do in addition to the damage and the cooldowns; that part is less than half of the entire thread's length. Don't bother reading beyond that unless you are curious of the additional details and my perspective on the changes.\n\nThanks again for helping me with this.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stashu","date":"2018-04-25T02:41:45.722+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ramero! Talon update designer here.\n\nThanks for taking the time to condense your thoughts. I appreciate that you focused on the higher level gameplay concerns and direction; it makes it easier to understand your thinking and find where we agree or have different takes.\n\nThat said, now that I clearly understand your reasoning, I think I have some bad news for you -- many of the problems you've identified here are intended strengths/weaknesses of Talon :(.  I'll give some background:\n\nDamage-dealing champions broadly fall into 1 of 2 camps - burst damage, or sustained damage. Burst damage champions give their opponents very little time to react and can quickly execute them in the right situation, but have very long cooldowns and have to be careful about choosing the perfect time. Sustained damage champions are ready to fight at all times thanks to their shorter cooldowns, but in compensation need to spend more time with their opponents to take them down. It's important to have both of these profiles in the game to appeal to players with varied tastes and to give some texture/variety to the way champions deal their damage. Since it has to happen in such a short window, burst damage tends to be more straight-forward than sustained damage in the moment, with much of the nuance and gameplay contained in the moments that led up to the burst (ie; did the burst champion make good use of their abilities to find a clever path and bypass the victim's allies?). \n\nYou might see where this is going : Talon was designed for players who prefer the burst damage experience. When tackling the update, we made it a point to preserve this since it was something that many Talon players cared deeply about; to those that we spoke to, burst was a core part of what made Talon Talon. So, we intentionally preserved that part of Talon while trying to add some distinction to the kit through his unparalleled map mobility. That's not to say that a Talon kit with less burst and more repeatable damage would be bad design or less fun by any means, just that it would appeal to a different audience (more of the Yasuo/Yi camp, less the Zed/Talon camp).\n\nAt the end of the day, a single champion cannot deliver on every gameplay experience, and by keeping each champion's gameplay and thematic identity clear and focused, they all get to be unique and powerful in their own ways. Talon's way is a very bursty one, so I hope it makes sense when I say I don't think we'd consider any changes to Talon that shift him significantly away from being a burst assassin. I'm really glad you've enjoyed Talon so much up until now and really appreciate all the thought and time you put into this. \n\nHope that helps shed some insight on our thought process, and sorry if that was disappointing to hear!\n\nBest, \n-Stashu","replies":[{"poster":"Pokemonred200","date":"2018-04-25T04:05:40.202+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I for one liked old Talon because he had AOE burst that was only matched by Katarina.

I've been a Quinn player since before her rework. Personally, I dislike new Quinn. There are many in the Quinn Mains community that share the same opinion. If I could have my way, I'd want a full VGU for her tomorrow with melee form Valor back.\n\nThe reason that Quinn hasn't had a full-scale VGU put into production, along with Mordekaiser, Skarner and others like Fiddlesticks and Rammus is because the idea isn't there right now. Riot's list of reworks isn't in a concrete order. They likely throw around ideas for _all_ the champions on their \"needs a VGU\" list at the same time. I don't remember which Rioter specifically stated it, but there were something like 3 completely different Urgot reworks scrapped over the last few years. They get their ideas, then they put them into preliminary testing.\n\nI'll use Quinn as an example again. Here are the questions I'd ask of myself and (if I was the lead designer of Quinn's eventual VGU) what I would ask my team working on her:\n\n* Does it expand on Quinn's theme while preserving her core feel and character?\n\n* Does it offer unique qualities from other champions in the game?\n\n* Does it provide a long-term solution to the issues currently present in Quinn's kit?\n\nIf the answer to most of those questions is \"no\" or \"not really\", they may scrap the entire thing and recycle some of the ideas on future releases/reworks. An example would be the Urgot reworks that were scrapped. In the case of Quinn, Riot's even stated that she is in the higher part of the list for a VGU. Quinn has a lot of character potential, but right now, they're working on other projects and don't have a solid foundation for a Quinn VGU in place. As a result, they can look to make changes to the current version of the champion aimed at a more short-term time frame, and in Quinn's case, her recent batch of QoL buffs came as a result of this. RiotXenogenic approached the community with some proposed changes, and did an excellent job of weighing our feedback. It's not the Quinn VGU I *eventually* want to see, but I've accepted that will come with time.\n\nThe answer to those questions has to be a \"yes.\" If after testing one part isn't working out, they may go back to the drawing board and try to figure that specific part out. We saw this in the behind the scenes video of Irelia's development - the kit was mostly done, but the W was still taking shape. They re-tuned and refined the W until they felt it served a proper place in both her kit and her concept.\n\nWith the reworks released in the past year or so (Urgot, Evelynn, Swain, and Irelia) it's likely those names were being tossed around at the same time as newer reworks/updates that are now well into production or have just started rolling. Who knows, there could even be an in-progress Nunu update that's been in the works since 2015, but they could never get it right until now, and finally gave it the green light.\n\nI would find it extremely difficult to believe that Riot hasn't explored and potentially even tested a few Mordekaiser reworks behind the scenes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"limebuster","date":"2018-04-20T14:54:17.468+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey!

Topp Lulu against melee in the past for example, versus duo lane Lulu who's a much healthier experience.\n\n2. Some kits have a lot of power that's dependent on having an ally to work with. If they're able to effectively solo lane without getting benefit from that power they'll likely be pretty out of line in a duo lane where they are contributing that power. Soraka's probably the strongest example of this.\n\nThat's not to say it might not be both possible and worthwhile to get some supports into other spots.
