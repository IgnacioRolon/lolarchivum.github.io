I&rsquo;ve been at Riot Games for about four years now, prior to that though I was working in a pretty different field, helping design future transport networks back in New Zealand. To my surprise I ended up at Riot (and in LA) after I happened to spot a job posting on the LoL forums and decided to throw in an application for the hell of it. So far it&rsquo;s been a fantastic experience :).\n\n\nOutside of work I&rsquo;m a pretty big gamer, both video games and board games, with particular favourites including the Civilization series, Warcraft 3, FTL, Race for the Galaxy, Agricola, Star Control 2, Diablo 2 and Dark Souls. Also pretty partial to a bit of hiking, karaoke and travel. \n\n\n**WHAT AM I DOING AT RIOT? WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT NEXT YEAR?**\n\nI started at Riot as a designer on the Champion team, working on Ziggs, Varus, Syndra, some of Elise, Lissandra and some of Gnar. After that I did a spell as the Lead Designer on Champion, working with the designers and other developers on the team to help create new champions from 2013 to 2015. Over the course of 2015, I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of my time on wider gameplay topics as well, such as the recent preseason changes. \n\nFrom the start of next year I&rsquo;ll be shifting to a broader role, working with the four teams who focus on game health/balance, new champions, champion updates and game systems. My role these days tends to be more about helping teams build long term visions/plans, and offering a second opinion on work in progress, than on working directly on game changes myself. \n\n\n**WHAT AM I GOING TO TALK ABOUT?**\n\nFor these DevCorner posts I&rsquo;ll generally be talking about the state of gameplay in League of Legends overall, in terms of where we currently are, where we&rsquo;re hoping to go and what the philosophies behind our changes are. I&rsquo;ll also jump into some more specific conversations too where possible (&lsquo;What&rsquo;s up with X mastery or champion&rsquo; etc), though that&rsquo;ll generally be pretty reactive rather than planned. \n\n**WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR FROM ME?**\n\nI&rsquo;d also love to get a better understanding of what you folks would like to talk about/hear more about. Types of topics in particular would be great (more about why we&rsquo;re changing the game in the ways we are? more insight into our upcoming plans? more context on why we try and balance the way we do? etc). Riot&rsquo;s direct communication with players was one of the things that made me want to apply here in the first place, so getting to contribute to keeping that going is something I&rsquo;m really keen to do.\n\nEdit: I'll be in and out of this thread over the course of the afternoon, got a mixture of meetings and some time put aside for forum posting.

You made something that Supports needed (efficient/affordable stats) and are now having to punish them to keep it out of the hands of midlaners. Why not make items intended for use by AP mids more attractive than the support item? I feel like the draw to FCQ represents a weakness in items intended for AP mids, not evidence of an OP support item. FCQ has been awesome as a support and has made me feel like a more relevant part of my team. I feel punished and not because the item was too good for me (it was just right) but because it is better than lackluster AP mid items. I really think there is a more creative way to solve this problem. Items crowding out other items might indicate an OP status, but an item dedicated for supports crowding out all other items an AP mage might prefer represents a problem within their options.","replies":[{"poster":"thezerothcat","date":"2015-12-20T10:09:01.147+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this. I main support, with mid as my secondary role, and favor squishy mages like {{champion:90}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:26}}. As a less experience player who just barely scraped gold last season, I realize my outlook isn't going to be the same as some of the better players, but here's my two cents.\n\n\nWhen I'm playing a midlaner or damage support (so in other words, not Soraka where I want the mobility from Talisman, I'm probably going to be building a subset of these:\n{{item:3116}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3151}}{{item:3285}} {{item:3135}}   {{item:3092}}\n\nFor supports, I might also take one of these for the utility: \n{{item:3060}} {{item:3504}}{{item:3050}}\n\n\nWith the recent changes to the meta, games often seem to be decided pretty early, so I don't tend to build {{item:3003}} {{item:3027}} because I feel the need to reach a damage powerspike ASAP. Even with no mana potions, I'm more likely to just grab a second {{item:1056}} or ask for blue buff, and then rush damage so I can try to carry my team in between running back to base for mana refills. \n\n\nI also don't build {{item:3001}}  very often, because I prefer my long range, and if I've lost lane badly enough to need the MR, I'd probably rather look for a roam and try to help someone else get ahead.  I avoid {{item:3174}} for similar reasons - there's a pretty big AP sacrifice for a fairly high gold price and no added utility, and the MR won't save me like Zhonya's will if the enemy team decides to dive.\n\n\nI admit, I haven't really tried FQC as a midlaner yet, but I use it on support quite often, for the same reason I use Zhonya's - in a meta full of adcs and assassins who can kill me in about 3 seconds, I need a way to not die (or as a support, to help others not die) long enough to cast a spell or two, especially if someone flashed around that one skillshot I was counting on. \n\nI actually build Zhonya's more often for support than mid, however, probably because I'm more likely to have someone there to save me while I'm in stasis.\n\n\nI could certainly see a midlaner taking Frost Queen's Claim so they could have a way to get back to the team alive while roaming the map solo, even if it's still not enough to save them from champions like {{champion:2}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:4}}. If {{item:3069}} had a decent amount of AP instead of the gold item passives, I'd take it on a midlaner in some cases, for repositioning in fights or escaping from a splitpush, although it probably wouldn't be the first item I'd complete.\n\n\nAnything that can help my immobile squishy mages kite (or chase) better is appreciated, and while {{item:3285}} is great, mobile champions or those with slows will probably cancel it out pretty easily, as will {{item:3046}}. \n\n\nSpeaking of slows, there's still not really a late-game mage option for {{item:3140}}. While my {{champion:90}} certainly appreciates it, it also makes one less item to choose from on my mages unless I'm really taking a lot of cc.\n\n\nEdit: On further reflection, I think {{item:3092}} may also fill a gap in mana regen items - it's cheaper than {{item:3165}}, and sacrifices a bit of AP and CDR for a bit more mana regen and an active which is much more useful than the Grievous Wounds passive. If my team needs GW, they can get it from {{item:3123}} on the adc (who's better at killing tanks anyway) instead of waiting until the enemy is halfway dead. \n\n\nCheap, cost-effective mana fixers that don't take too long to scale up like {{item:3070}} are appreciated, especially now that I don't have mana potions to fall back on, and none the damage mage items {{item:3089}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3135}}  do anything at all for mana.\n\n\nAs a support, I take {{item:3092}} because I want the gold and the passive, while also liking the mana regen (which I could also get from {{item:3069}}), the extra bit of damage, and the CDR, probably in that order. As a midlaner, I might take it for the passive and the mana regen (which can only be replaced by {{item:1056}} {{item:3165}} or other items I just don't care for), with the AP and CDR being important but still secondary to those. It basically has a little of everything a poke champion would want in an item, regardless of which lane they go to.\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ducking fizz","date":"2015-12-16T22:05:37.078+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you please do that you can see the range of FQC when hovering over it? c:","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cenobite Azaziel","date":"2015-12-17T06:18:45.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=ujXlbawa,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-12-15T21:29:58.057+0000)\n>\n> Our current thought is that it's fine if FQC is an option for mid laners, provided it isn't crowding out other item options.

Because right now MF packs a *ton* of damage into three seconds.  Kog deals lots of damage, too, but from a closer range to one person for up to six seconds.  And when those six seconds are up, he's dead weight.\n\nSee, getting good results out of MF is much easier than Kog.  Comparatively speaking, chaining two Ults together is something that's pretty easy to pull off in Solo.  Koggy, by contrast, needs protection for six seconds while being exactly as immobile as a channeling MF if he wants to do any significant damage.  That's quite a bit harder for a team of randomly assembled players to accomplish.\n\nAnd that isn't even considering how much stronger MF is at the early stages of the game.\n\nSo yes, her way of filling the centerpiece ADC niche is different.  However, her different way of doing it is safer, easier, and without a crippling early game holding it down.\n\nThat's why I asked the follow-up question that wasn't addressed.  How do you make a mechanically (both for Kog's player and his team) more difficult centerpiece ADC desirable when contrasted with one that's more reliable *and* less teamwork reliant?\n\nIf he just gets his damage pumped until he's as attractive in Solo as, say, Jinx, then Koggy will rip the competitive scene a new one.  If he's balanced around the competitive scene, then he'll be relegated into the dumpster in Solo.  I bring this up because I have the sinking suspicion that you guys might be approaching the problem of balancing Koggy from a direction that really won't leave anyone satisfied.\n\nIf you will, at least consider an alternative approach if you decide that Kog still needs his power level boosted up.  Make him a little more self-sufficient rather than just amping his damage.  And I don't mean give him mobility or hard CC or a knockback on his E against melee opponents or anything like that.  I mean a new Innate that lets him heal somehow.  That would make him a *little* more resilient against dives and in duels without making his raw damage output too silly.  \n\nThematically it makes quite a bit of sense.  His Lore is all about eating stuff, right?  And stealing health is one of the most consistent ways that concept is conveyed in League.  Right now Koggy's Innate punishes enemies for playing against Kog correctly.  It's hilarious, sure, but it just doesn't fit with his kit.  Given his condition , now would be the perfect time to cook up an interesting new Innate for Koggy, maybe even something that makes his gameplay a little more interesting to make up for the loss of his old W-Trinity-R kiting play style.\n\nRegardless, I hope you consider what I wrote up.  As I'm sure you can tell I'm pretty passionate about the Voidpuppy and I would hate to see him left by the wayside after his rework while basically *all* the other ADCs enjoy their time in the limelight.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2015-12-15T21:11:16.531+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you currently see as the biggest problems to the current state of the game?

Not saying that category of champs is necessarily perfect, but that the more traditional damage focused mages need the work more.\n\nWe'll need to do some work on Azir to get him to a spot where he can be at least somewhat effective for the average player, without being excessively strong in top tier play. Unsure what methods we'll use for that yet, that'll be a project we deep dive early next year.\n\nIf looking at a spell combining character (Invoker/Magicka style) I'd want to start by defining the purpose of having lots of spells. If there's something that offers, besides novelty for its own sake/a barrier to entry, then it could be worth comparing that value to that we could offer by creating other champions.
