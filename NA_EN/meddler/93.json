The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**9.14**\r\n\r\nAs you've likely seen 9.14 has been pretty buggy, especially because we've had a couple of underlying issues that have caused issues with a range of champs, runes etc. We've got a lot of those dealt with at this point and are prioritizing hitting the rest. Apologies for how messy patch day especially was.\r\n\r\nBugs aside, we also knew this patch would be more volatile on the balance front given how many changes we made. We released a balance micropatch last night, details should be in the updated patch notes. \r\n\r\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-914-notes\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**Ryze**\r\n\r\nRyze's changes have been out for a bit now, have had some exposure to pro play and have had some follow up balance. Some thoughts below on how we're feeling about him as a result:\r\n\r\n* Statistically we're cautiously optimistic this version of Ryze will be easier to keep in an ok spot for both pro and regular play at once. He's performing better in solo queue than previously without being overly dominant so far at least in pro.\r\n* We're taking a cautious approach to buffs to him, given how challenging he's been in the past to balance. Might still have some room for a bit more power, really don't want to swing to hard though.\r\n* We're seeing some frustration from people who liked Ryze's mechanical optimizations pre 9.12 at the degree they've been diminished. We do think this version of the kit should be one we can more consistently keep balanced, so so far think that removing some of those optimizations was an appropriate trade off to make. Do want to acknowledge that it came at a cost though and that that's tough for players who preferred his previous state.\r\n* We discussed changes to Ryze's ult pre 9.12, given it heavily rewards coordination between team members in a way that's usually more accessible in pro/organized play. Our conclusion was that while it added some cost to balancing for different contexts it wasn't the primary cause of problems there. It also generates many of his high moments and adds a lot of distinctiveness relative to other champions. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**Looking at Prestige Points**\r\n\r\nWe’ve been seeing a lot more feedback about some of the details of how Prestige Points and Prestige Skins work recently. We’re digging through that feedback and looking at possible plans to address it right now. We should have an update to share by the end of next week on what we’ll be doing.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2019-07-19T15:36:32.480+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":2,"body":"A totally unrelated question, but this Quick Thoughts are the best way to reach you, so...\n\nQoL update for Sona: Give her an \"ammo\" bar similar to Annie/Irelia to see when her passive is up and what chord is ready, pretty please?","replies":[{"poster":"Jantya","date":"2019-07-19T20:27:40.668+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's already an indicator.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2019-07-20T14:41:07.929+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bad one, hard to read.

Here we see a larger gap between the wall opposite the wolf camp, and the wolf camp itself. This makes champions like elise and gragas unable to use their gap-closers as effectively on red team as on the blue team. Gragas' E hits the wolfs on blue team, but not red and elise can rapel on blue team, but can't on red team.\n2. Here, the red teams blue buff wall has a larger portion, this could mean the difference between an invader or invadee escaping or catching their target.\n3. We see a similar but far less significant wall portion around the blue teams wolf camp, in which the apex (pointy ends) of the walls have less thick space than the red teams, but only slightly. More skeptical here as it may be more down to subtle angle changes.\n4. A difference in bush placement that's power neutral, as they can be abused by both teams. The top side circle bush is more centred to the river, making it better for ambush/approaching baron as it's further from tower (more room to chase) and closer to baron pit.\n5. This one hits me where it hurts most as a Nunu player. This portion of baron pit wall, on the red team base's side has a point at which it suddenly juts out a few mm. This is demonstrated here https://imgur.com/a/7gKxyjS . These points cause nunu to break his snowball and players, who would otherwise walk in a straight arc to potentially shuffle into an oncoming spell. We then see this issue repeated with the tri bushes near river as depicted in these images https://imgur.com/a/ALyHT2g\n6. And finally, the blue buff exit into river for both teams. The blue team's exit is larger than red teams. This provides a tight choke point if red team contests a dragon, and a wide choke point if blue team contests a baron. This favors blue team in both cases. The rest of the jungle exits into river are equal to both teams.\n\nHoping these lil issue scan be resolved","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jabalor","date":"2019-07-19T15:45:18.091+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"What are your thoughts on the shield breaking champions?

Irelia has very reliable strong damage, a active damage reduction, decent mobility, an AoE stun, and an AoE slow. Both of those CC effects are skillshot based and therefore aren't out of line, but she's on the edge of being overloaded with mechanics, and adding a shield-shred back would likely be pushing her over that edge. Before they removed both the disarm and the shield-shred, she was just doing everything and not being bad at anything.\n\nI'd argue that removing some of her CC to trade for shield-shred would be taking away TOO much from her. While her Q lets her dance in and around battle, she needs her stun, and her ult, to catch people proper. Removing her mobility kills her \"blade dancer\" feel, and her damage reduction is just a tool to help her survive engagements she was otherwise overwhelmed in... when used correctly.\n\ntl;dr: She's strong, but not out of line. Adding more to her kit would overload her, swapping anything for shield-shred would leave her too weak.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ćount Kledula","date":"2019-07-19T16:33:07.120+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey\nOpinion on Swain changes?","replies":[{"poster":"Zemasu","date":"2019-07-19T17:28:21.273+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"As an old main swain, my feel is:\n\nPassive: really cool, the mana gain from souls helps an aggressive gameplay, but the health gain maybe is still too low, i would turn it in 6-7 per stack\n\nQ: i hated the old reworked Q, but this, with a wide area and aoe clear is really cool to use.\n\nR: i see no difference in healing, the heal from minions is low, i would appreciate more less base bonus hp on cast but more heal, you still get oneshotted before you can heal","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Galehaut ","date":"2019-07-19T15:37:41.387+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"Shaco bugs:\n    \n\nNot spawning at cursor after ult\n    Clone not attacking after spawn, even when commanding him to do so\n    Clone standing still after shacos death, even when enemies are in close range\n    Boxes not prioritizing champions\n    Being visible for a short while after q cast when having a dot on you (people will still get 1 auto attack off and see you for around 0.5s)\n    Invis canceling when having cursor close to enemy when casting\n    Clone not procing certain onhits like statikks/guinsoos\n    E canceling its cast sometimes\n    Certain runes/keystones not working with clone (PTA/Conq)\n    Boxes not attacking inhibs/nexus sometimes\n    Clone can only attack nexus/inhib when pressing alt+mb2 and not r\n    Clone not attacking anything in general\n    Backstabs being inconsistent on jungle monsters\n    Not able to dodge damage/abilities (not invulnerable during r cast)\n    Clone no backstab indicator anymore (intended?)\n    Clone having stealth movement animation when ulting during q\n    Tower always targeting shaco after utling when only he and clone are under tower, not whats closest (intended?)\n    Attack move sometimes makes enemy follow you so they know which way you q'ed\n    Since clone copies stats and items, things like hextech revolver are already on cd when clone spawns, so he cant proc it anymore\n    Clone walking back to shaco for no reason short time after play input\n    Clone dmg not counting towards total dmg at end of game screen\n    Shaco box getting hit by skillshots while in stleath\n    Box fear causes jungle camps to stay in a resetting state if they are used as the first initiation of combat (causes hp of camp to reset)\n    Randomly spawning way too far away after ult, not even in direction of cursor\n   \n WITH THE RECENT ADDITION OF 9.14:\n\n    Shaco throws shiv with crit animation (visual bug) (/u/AsnenOfficial thanks)\n    Shaco no longer has animation cancels ( deceive into recall, tp, e, tiamat no longer works and reveals you instantly)\n    Backstab doesn't scale with CDR anymore, always stays at 3s no matter how much CDR (states that its always 3 sec, no matter how much cd) (thanks Darmausgang)\n    Backstab angels are weird now and harder to hit","replies":[]},{"poster":"FafliX","date":"2019-07-19T18:20:51.533+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, will you finally allow players to earn Prestige Points without spending money, and make it so buying them with lots of money isn't possible anymore?\nBecause at it sits now, the whole system looks like a cheap \"mobile game tier\" moneygrab.\n\"Make the grind so hard and long that players either give up mid way and buy the rest, or fall just short and due to the sunken cost fallacy buy the rest.\"\n\nYes, it's just cosmetics, so it's not as bad as something like Battlefront 2, but it's still really scummy.\nAnd the worst part is that you can't even buy the passes with BE, meaning you are forced to spend money if you want any Prestige Skins.

I've been playing since season 5 and currently own 111 champions. Of the remaining 34, most are on the more expensive side of things, amounting to 179100 BE. According to Riot Mortdog, we get on average 910 BE / Capsule and 2120 BE / Milestone Capsule. that's 10310 BE / 10 Levels. After some research, I found that on average a player can expect about 180 XP / 30 min game. I'm currently lvl 132, requiring 2880 XP / lvl. That's 16 30 minute games per level, amounting to 8 hours play. Scaling this up we need 80 hours of play to get 10 lvls or 10310 BE. So to acquire all champions ingame I would still need to play at least 1390 hours (58 whole days), not counting higher XP needed for higher levels. Is it only my opinion or is this a bit exorbitant, considering I've been at it for about 4 years, playing on average 1-1,5 hrs/day? I mean as there are new champions getting released about every 1,5  months it gets harder and harder for new players to even own a reasonable amount of champions (not only for playing yourself but for swapping in champ select etc.).

But at the same time, don't buff Katarina. ~~\n- Ravenous hunter is a good example of a \"One size fits all\" rune, as it provides huge sustain late game. A little too reliable. \n**Sorcery Tree:**\n-Actually every rune on this tree seems completely fine. \n**Precision Tree:**\n- Conqueror lasts too long on melee champions.  Fiora, Olaf, and Darius can 'conqueror' opponents by only pressing Q every 8 seconds! Considering reducing duration down to 7 or even 6 seconds for the stacks to wear off so us top laners can really get our hands dirty.\n- Lethal Tempo's upper limit is too high. While hail of blade's gives the same 110% attack speed at level 1, lethal tempo gives 6 seconds on uncapped destruction. ADCs like Xayah, Kog'maw and Twitch deal unparalleled amounts of damage during these 6 seconds. \n- Triumph is too reliable. Not only does it mitigate the effects of ignite, but also encourages reckless tower diving from {{champion:23}} .  Consider changing the healing 15% of missing health to over 5 seconds instead of 12% after about a second. \n**Resolve Tree: **\n- Font of Life is just bad. It's understandable that it's hard to balance a rune that heals allies but isn't the keystone.

This is just taking a look at applying Riot's balancing framework on Viktor and Jhin.\n\nTL;DR: Using Riot's Balance Framework, both Viktor and Jhin are not eligible for buffs and yet Jhin is getting buffs while Viktor isn't when (arguably) Viktor needs them more? In the case of champions feeling bad, how does Riot determine which champions to buff if they dont fall under their criteria?\nLink to Balance Framework: https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2019/05/dev-champion-balance-framework\n\nRiot did say that they created the Balance Framework to hold them accountable, so I thought I'd give it a go at it.\n\nBefore I start, I am going to say that I am a Viktor main so of course there will be a bit of bias, but I still find these results kind of interesting anyway.\n\nAnyway, I was wondering that since Viktor felt kind of weak, I would use Riot's Balance Framework to see if he is eligible for buffs or not. So I went to u.gg (forgot where I heard this, but I think a rioter said its the site that matches their internal data the most) and globally checked the win rate of Viktor in each elo. This was done on 7/16/2019. I also included Viktor Top since a significant enough number of players played him top, so I did some math to include the total winrate of Viktor top and mid. After that I will have one exclusively done on mid lane Viktor since I do heavily favor Viktor mid personally. I still did one though combining Top lane Viktor simply because he was played enough to have a significant impact on the overall winrate and they also go for the same builds as mid Viktor. Anyway here are the results for mid and top combined by elo:\n\nIron: 53.39% winrate with 118 matches\nBronze: 51.19% winrate with 7224 matches\nSilver: 49.78% winrate with 31758 matches\nGold: 49.97% winrate with 42608 matches\nPlatinum: 48.61% winrate with 20890 matches\nDiamond: 47.45% winrate with 7205 matches (2.6% presence)\nMaster: 46.08% winrate with 217 matches (2.8% presence)\nGrandmaster: 50.30% winrate with 330 matches (2.6% presence)\nChallenger: 47.2% winrate** with 125 matches (2.3% presence)\nPro play: Do not know exact number, but I'm almost certain that it is below 5%, considering how uncommon he is seen in pro play.\n\nAnd here is Viktor mid exclusively:\n\nIron: 57.14% winrate with 119 matches\nBronze: 51.13% winrate with 7944 matches\nSilver: 50.4% winrate with 35203 matches\nGold: 49.75% winrate with 46883 matches\nPlatinum: 49% winrate with 22435 matches\nDiamond: 47.35% winrate with 7527 matches (2% presence)\nMaster: 46.91% winrate with 194 matches (1.9% presence)\nGrandmaster: 50.38% winrate with 266 matches (1.6% presence)\nChallenger: 46.51% winrate with 86 matches (1.2% presence)\n\nSo some things that interested me is that Viktor's winrate would decline the higher elo you are. I was somewhat surprised by this, considering Viktor is a moderately hard champion. However, I would disregard Iron, simply because of its absurdly low sample size. One theory I have on why Viktor has a good winrate in low elo is because people in that elo rarely ever see a Viktor and do not know how to deal with one. Especially since most people that play Viktor are probably mains due to his low pick rate (around 2-3% overall). But the higher elo you go, the more game knowledge players have, and know how to exploit Viktor's weaknesses harshly.\n\nDespite these numbers saying that Viktor does not need a buff, I would beg to differ based on another champion Riot is buffing the very next patch that does not need a buff according to their own framework: Jhin.\n\nSo here are Jhin's winrates by every elo:\n\nIron: 51.43% winrate with 1919 matches\nBronze: 50.21% winrate with 112866 matches\nSilver: 50.25% winrate with 327930 matches\nGold: 50.42% winrate with 291052 matches\nPlatinum: 50.32% winrate with 103155 matches\nDiamond: 49.61% winrate with 24423 matches (9.2% presence)\nMaster: 49.48% winrate with 382 matches (5% presence)\nGrandmaster: 44.23% winrate with 529 matches (4.1% presence)\nChallenger: 47.89% winrate with 142 matches (2.7% presence)\nPro Play: Don't know, but probably super low.\n\nSo according to Riot's own Balance Framework, Jhin does not need a buff either. So, why are they buffing Jhin? Probably because he does not feel so good to play at higher elos. Although it is less severe than Viktor's, Jhin's winrate does lower a bit the higher the elo you go as well. The patch notes even says \"Adding some power into the part of Jhin's kit that rewards timing and coordination\". In other words, they are rewarding skilled Jhin players who are able to more consistently hit their W root.\n\nSo why not buff Viktor for high elo, considering that his winrate is far worse than Jhin's the higher the elo you go? Because the way his kit is designed, it benefits more in coordinated play. Due to 2015-2016 and Tank Viktor Top, Riot has been immensely cautious in buffing Viktor as they think that he could immediately become p/b in pro play. But the factors that made Viktor so strong in 2015-2016 are gone now (less mobility champs at the time, Rylais, etc.) and Tank Viktor Top will not come back unless they buff his Q (which they won't do). So they should be able to give Viktor mains buffs that help people who are experienced with Viktor without causing him to be OP in pro play. Now what should they do; I dont know for sure. But I am leaning on the idea of either buffing his early game a bit or some QoL buffs on his ult to make it not so impossible to get at least one tick on the enemy champion.\n\nThat's just my idea, but the thing is is that both Viktor and Jhin don't feel the best to play atm in higher elos but neither of them fit Riot's balance framework requirements for a buff. And yet they decide to buff Jhin and not Viktor.\n\nCurrently I feel like Viktor is 'meh' but DOES have room for some small buffs that will help experienced Viktor players. And if Riot decided to buff Jhin to help out more experienced Jhin players, then why not buff Viktor for experienced Viktor players especially considering that Viktor's winrate deteriorates far more harshly than Jhin's the higher the elo you go? Especially if its a small and yet useful buff?","replies":[]}]}
