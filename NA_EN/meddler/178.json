The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**Icons collection page**\n\nIt got a little bit overshadowed by other stuff going on at the time, so for anyone who missed it, there&#039;s now an icons collection page in the client. It includes information about how you unlocked an icon, what proportion of icons for each category you have (e.g. Harrowing or Game modes) and rarity values for icons (e.g. Ultimate for things like the Dominion 100+ games icon or top 500 in LoL Beta). \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n**8.13 anti snowball changes**\n\nWe&#039;ve been digging into the effects of the 8.13 anti snowball changes and have seen a pretty decent reduction in early game snowball following them. Still a bit elevated, so not quite down to what&#039;s been standard historically standard yet, quite a bit better though thankfully. Likely we&#039;ll have some further smaller tweaks to reduce early game snowball at some point, any solutions that are really disruptive would wait until preseason though.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \n**8.13b mini patch**\n\nAt time of writing 8.13b (mini patch around halfway through the 8.13 three week cycle) is being finalized and should get patched out shortly. You&#039;ve probably seen patch notes for it already, TLDR if not though is buffs to Stormrazor, Brawler&#039;s Gloves, Varus, Trist and Caitlyn, plus nerfs to Nocturne and Taliyah. We&#039;re using this mini patch to address things that we&#039;ve changelists ready for that are clear enough issues they shouldn&#039;t have to wait until 8.14 itself. Goal with the marksmen side of things is to help the marksmen in the worst states, still with a goal of getting them all back to reasonable spots without pushing non marksmen entirely out of bot lane. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \n**Fizz**\n\nLatest W changes for Fizz have been testing pretty well in terms of how the pattern plays and how the ability feels. Still working on final numbers, so those might or might not change. Likely, given 8.13-8.14 is a three week period, that we&#039;ll be able to get them into 8.14 as a result. We&#039;d originally expected it to take a bit longer, but fairly optimistic at this point they&#039;ll be ready soon.\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Gankr","date":"2018-07-04T19:15:58.251+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry about the wall of text, I have a lot to say on this issue and would really appreciate a response.\n\nGankr here, former Master tier Zac top/jungle main before the rework. Myself, along with many other former Zac mains have been extremely disappointed with the rework and the lack of communication about it. Back when the rework was taking place, we had Riot Shrieve talking to us on the subreddit ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thesecretweapon ) about the changes, but since then we have had nothing. Zac used to have much more versatility as a top laner as well as a jungler with different build paths depending on your play-style.\n\nHis Ult: One of the biggest complaints in the Zac mains community is that his new ultimate feels terrible to use, especially compared to the old one. It does no damage and is completely one dimensional. It either picks people up or it doesn't. The old ult actually required skill the maneuver yourself around in a teamfight to knock people in the direction that benefited the team. When his rework was announced, his ult was called a \"chaotic wukong ultimate\" which makes 0 sense to me. It is only chaotic if you use it like a Wukong ultimate. It is like saying  Oriana R is a chaotic Diana E. If you use the Oriana R like an idiot, then that may be true, but if you actually know what you are doing it is more skilled version of a Diana E. It is the same thing with Old Zac R and Wukong R. His E also had it's knock up duration changed to scale with charge time because of this, which is a pretty large nerf, which I will get into later. Not only is this ult less reliable, and less satisfying, but the ability Zac was known for got nerfed to make room for it.\n\nTop Lane: Top lane Zac was a decently popular pick, even though it wasn't the strongest. It had a lot of counter play, but also had a lot of outplay potential. In this lane, you used to max Q in order to poke through minions and clear waves. The low cooldown and the surprisingly high damage made it core to this champion. Without this ability, it basically single-handedly destroyed Zac top. Another thing that killed Zac top is the E changes. His E used to be a 1 second knockup at all times which allowed for usage point blank. Without that his ability to duel or escape is much worse. The final problem with Toplane Zac is that his ult is pretty much useless in this lane. It does about 1/4 as much damage as his old ult, assuming your opponent is bad enough to get picked up in it, and it also doesn't give you a movespeed boost to be used as an escape from a gank or bad trade. \n\nHis Damage: One final issue I'd like to bring up is that his base damage on every single ability got destroyed. This further weakens his ability to fight other champs, which is especially terrible in a meta revolving around duelist junglers. Zac cannot be expected to exist in a meta where he needs to either fight off champions, or clear well, because right now he doesn't do either better than meta junglers.\n\nIf you want an even more in-depth version of this, here is a post I made a year ago that goes into each ability: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6f27eh/im_gankr_15m_mastery_points_zac_main_master_tier/?st=jj7jd9ey&sh=ad3eb579","replies":[{"poster":"th3ch0s3n0n3s","date":"2018-07-05T04:21:10.874+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gankr,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=EOVcvy54,comment-id=0059,timestamp=2018-07-04T19:15:58.251+0000)\n>\n> Sorry about the wall of text, I have a lot to say on this issue and would really appreciate a response.\n> \n> Gankr here, former Master tier Zac top/jungle main before the rework.

I used to play Zac in every role except the bot lane role. Zac's versatility with his pre-rework kit not only made him a really fun champion to play, but it also made sense with the lore. Zac is a purpose-built weapon, made of goo that can change form depending on the scenario! You could play Zac as a true tank, an AP bruiser, or if you were feeling really spicy... full AP. He could be played AP brusier or full AP mid, AP bruiser or full tank top, tank support, and all three roles in the jungler position.\n\nI feel like this rework has failed to accomplish its goals, it has failed to satisfy the people who play him most, and it has left Zac in a state where he is unable to be balanced between Solo q and LCS - whereas pre-rework Zac was perfectly balanced in this regard. I hope you folks at Riot see reason and revert Zac.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Pizza Bag","date":"2018-07-05T21:33:02.269+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zac main here, completely agree, hoping for at least some kind of communication but really REALLY miss the old ult, was very satisfying and allowed you to maneuver around a team fight to pick up blobs and actually be able to survive, allowing for more engaging gameplay\n\nNow it feels like Zac is simply meant to just be a means of engage and that's it - even with tenacity and CDR, I can't get back to the old, rewarding feeling of surviving a team fight due to my own personal good play","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2018-07-04T23:29:24.918+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% agreed.\nI miss his old kit, his entire kit flowed together so well but now it's anticlimactic as hell when you stop to Q or R. \nLet's bounce was easily my favorite ult in the game and let's face it, {{item:3157}} is the best item ever for it :D\n\nIdk why the picked zac.... he was perfectly fine, seems like {{champion:161}} it was change for the sake of change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KOGMIDONLY","date":"2018-07-06T07:30:13.771+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"My thoughts exactly, a full revert or a part revert would be much appreciated on behalf of the zac community, 95% voted towards a revert on our straw posts, 5% who hadn’t played the old Zac before voted against the revert.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"quizotic","date":"2018-07-04T15:54:46.611+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":9,"body":"Given how low his winrate (44%) has tanked and all the complaints are you guys looking into tweaking Aatrox?

His teamfight is trash and it should be adjusted.\n\nMake him a better in late and worse in early. It doesn't fit to archetype he has. He should be late game monster. Not someone insta loses to any adc because they can easily kit. \n\nHis late game damage is also not impressive. He deals nice to squishies yes but compare to any other juggernaut or diver, he struggles a lot to kill tanky enemies. He doesn't seem like a strong duelist IMO.\n\nI imagine what most would want from Aatrox is \"final boss, big boss, dark souls boss\" gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"R0T0N","date":"2018-07-04T17:47:29.222+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ This.\n\nHis early damage in laning phase is ridiculous, but he does not scale whatsoever, which really doesn't fit his fantasy. The rework was designed to allow him to thrive in teamfights, but he doesn't because he simply doesn't have the damage (even if you land all your sweetspots) or tankiness (due to the lack of damage and it being tied to it) to work in them. \nContrary to this however, his early laning phase is likely the strongest out of every top laner in the game. He beats Quinn, Darius and Karma  in lane as a melee Juggernaut, which should really tell you enough. \n\nIn addition, almost all of his damage (except for passive) is raw physical, making him terrible at fighting tanks as the game goes on, despite the fact he is supposed to be this huge final boss frontline fighter, he can mostly be ignored in teamfights.\n\nI've found that no matter how far ahead you are, once you reach ~30 + minutes your ability to kill anything plummets to nonexistant, and while you can still serve an adequate cc / tank threat, the damage is entirely gone. \n\nIMHO he needs substantial early game Q and passive base damage nerfs, far larger scalings on his Q (to synergise with his % AD from ult and AD from e) or alternatively increased % AD from his ult with levels, and either a passive CD that reduces with levels, or increasing the amount that ability casts / sweetspots reduce it (so that early game with low CDR passive cooldown stays roughly the same as you aren't casting abilities as much, but come late game you have far more frequent passive procs) to allow him to duel tanks with its % health damage.\n\nOverall I absolutely adore this rework, he is so satisfying and fun to play, his kit design is fantastic and during those rare games where teamfights occur during your early game spike he 100% feels like that godly raidboss he should (and this is coming from someone who loved old Aatrox and played him a ton even before his mini-rework way back) but that happens far too rarely, and it's plain to see that his early game is overpowered (he can 1v2 most ganks at level 3 with ease).\n\nPlease, fix his power curve and this will easily be my favourite rework you have ever done.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-07-04T18:25:12.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question: Why do you use specifically *Ziggs* for these posts?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-07-04T19:43:39.378+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still miss the days when we had forum avatars and wanted to get a little bit of that feel back, even if it's a slightly awkward way of doing so.

The problem is that his villain system is just... really unfun for everyone I think. Garen hates that he has no control over who it marks, and since his target selection is so abysmal sometimes the system will mark a champion he has absolutely no chance of being able to fight. It gets flipped on his head if a split pusher on the enemy team gets marked; now, through no fault of his / her own,  has a massive uphill battle to fight Garen and either has to swap to the other side lane and try to dodge the Garen or risk dying / getting dove.\n\nIf you guys have a chance to revisit Garen sometimes if you changed the villain system from a damage tool to a mobility / utility tool that'd probably be much better. If he gets movement speed + ignores unit collision whenever he's within X range of a villain he'd probably feel better, since you could buff his damage against everyone and he doesn't have to worry about \"did the system say I could 1v1 this guy or not\" as much. Garen vs. a villain is OP, Garen vs. a non-villain is pretty weak, so if you guys could kind of flatten that experience a bit so that he's not so caught up in a system he has no control over he'd feel better. Just my two cents for any potential work you guys might do on him in the next couple years.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2018-07-08T01:43:42.182+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=EOVcvy54,comment-id=00410000,timestamp=2018-07-04T19:36:14.211+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve got any room to buff Garen right now.

Swapping to Slow immunity, instead of cleansing slows on cast, likely makes timing of Q press more forgiving while also adding noticeable power.\n\nhow about adding bonus spins to judgement for building attack speed?\n\nits not directly a buff to his overall strength, but intended to make other item builds (mainly critical strike builds) relative as effective as already existing builds.\n\nthe idea is that currently items like {{item:3086}} are less than 100% cost effective on garen since he doesnt make use of the attack speed stat during his spin. an attack speed scaling on his spin could bring these items on par with other big ad items like {{item:3077}} in cost effectiveness, which is currently a very viable and effective item on him.\n\ngaren had historically a very large viable item pool, and proper itemization to the situation is one of the most important and fun factors of skill expression on garen.\n\nthe idea to be able to build basically anything between a standart tanky juggernaut build, to more offensive builds with {{item:3078}} {{item:3142}} or even weaving critical strike items into a bruiser build is what i always liked about the champion.\n\nsince the infinity edge changes, rework of ghostblade froma  crit item into an assassin item, removal of atmas impaler etc. garens effective crit builds have basically died out over time. there is simply not a viable crit option without attack speed anymore.\n\nit would be nice if the crit build would be brought back a bit and as viable as his other current builds. especially since the ability to itemize into crit is one of the things that separate him from other juggernauts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"riste","date":"2018-07-07T20:55:35.133+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Meddler. I'm a long time Garen player, holding 3.6 Million Champion Mastery Points, and have near 200lp Masters. I'd really like to propose some quality of life changes instead of buffs. I really agree that Garen shouldn't be buffed further, but there is a lot of QoL stuff that could be made to make playing Garen much more enjoyable.\n\nBecause of the frequency in Garen's spin being five spins at rank 1, increasing to six at level 4, I really believe Garen's spin should get a rework and changed to 10 spins automatically at rank 1, nerfing the overall damage of course early and having it scale up to the same amount at level 16. The issue with Garen's spin when noticed by veteran Garen players is that it's really unreliable to cs with. I've lost so many 1 hp minions/cannons because I'm waiting for the next spin to occur, but that cs gets taken by my very own minions. It's to the point where I encourage others not to spin over cannon minions waves for fear of missing too much CS.\n\nMany people have brought up to give Garen the normal auto attack animation for Q when last hitting minions. I think that would be fantastic as well for cs'ing under tower, given that you agree with that, transparency wise.\n\nIf you DO rework the Villain mechanic in the future Meddler, please, please do not deny Garen the ability to convert his ultimate into True Damage vs select targets. If you were ever to remove that, exhaust would hard counter Garen once again in teamfights.\n\nI care about a healthy future for Garen in regards to the entire playerbase, and am always available on my stream for any feedback or playtesting any future Garen changes. Just ask LeaoC to point you in the right direction. :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2018-07-04T16:00:34.161+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"With work slowing down until preseason.\n\nCan we please get some work done on Twisted Treeline? \n\nThere are a lot of glaring problems, the gold funneling strat being even more relevant there to be precise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mârty","date":"2018-07-04T19:36:09.019+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Meddler,\n\nI've been asking for years and haven't seen any real answers.\n\nWe've had a ton of nerfs to enchanters recently.
