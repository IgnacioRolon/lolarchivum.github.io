The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**PBE Sign Ups**\r\n\r\nFirst off, for anyone that missed it, PBE sign ups are open again: \r\n\r\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904\r\n\r\nSecond, for anyone testing on PBE, feedback on the PBE Boards is particularly appreciated. \r\n\r\nhttps://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback\r\n\r\nFeedback anywhere&#039;s good of course, the PBE Boards themselves get a lot of attention from developers working on stuff currently on PBE though, so visibility there tends to be quite high, especially given it&#039;s not too busy a forum. It&#039;s also a place where we can be sure whoever&#039;s offering feedback at least has a PBE account, so it&#039;s much more likely feedback being offered is from in game experience, not just reading about changes.\r\n\r\nIn terms of type of feedback how things feel/useability is particularly helpful from PBE play, as are bug reports. Balance feedback doesn&#039;t tend to be very useful, given so many games have people not trying or large skill discrepancies in them there. Feel feedback on the other hand can be really good even in those circumstances (e.g. how smooth spells are to use, whether a Rune tooltip is intuitive, how easy or difficult a missile is to see etc). \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Evelynn**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re still watching Evelynn. She&#039;s performing better as people get more experience on her, and we believe she&#039;ll be stronger on Runes Reforged than current runes/masteries. She&#039;s still underperforming a bit relative to how we&#039;d expect her to be doing at this point though. We&#039;ll likely be going with some light buffs in 7.21 as a result, aimed at things that we&#039;re confident are good changes regardless of her current power level (good feels impacts that aren&#039;t things we&#039;d nerf if she later ended up too strong).\r\n\r\nThat currently looks like:\r\n\r\n* Passive not put on CD when hit by minions\r\n* Q CD down, refund on jungle monsters down significantly, damage up slightly (bit of extra performance in lane, bit less frantic button mashing needed in general)\r\n* E gets a minimum amount of damage on % health damage (ensures E kills mini Krugs in particular)\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve also been testing some flat damage buffs to E, still considering pulling those though, since as above we&#039;re not looking to buff too much and those are just power, rather than a feel improvement as well.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Ornn**\r\n\r\nWe had some more buffs for Ornn in 7.20, given he&#039;s struggled more than we&#039;ve expected despite repeated buffs. We think we&#039;ve got him to about the right point finally so don&#039;t have plans for any further balance changes beyond whatever, like other champs, he will or won&#039;t need post pre-season. We&#039;ve been worried about overbuffing him for a while, but haven&#039;t yet at least seen indications that that&#039;s happened. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Locket**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re also looking at some nerfs to Locket, though uncertain whether those will ship in 7.21 yet or not. Big concern is about how much Locket shuts down burst champs that have to commit to a fight (assassins and divers mainly). By itself Locket&#039;s not so much of a problem, when stacked with other ally defending effects however it can make otherwise vulnerable targets excessively hard to kill. One of the directions we&#039;re looking at as a result is pushing it so it&#039;s still a strong option on tanks but isn&#039;t nearly as effective on enchanters. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Naalith","date":"2017-10-18T16:59:34.538+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"A lot of people (myself included) are super hyped for the Irelia rework and what it will bring to the champion, but we're kind of wondering why Irelia is being chosen over champions like Mordekaiser or Nunu? Irelia is still a functional champion and while she is super stat checky, lots of characters still are. It seemed kind of out of left field that she got chosen next, and even Swain to some extent I would have expected to come around after Morde and Nunu for sure.\n\nAre the teams finding difficulty getting a direction for those two champs in particular? Morde basically serves as the resident bug man and has been super polarizing since his rework, usually bordering on a useless but cool pick simply for his ult, whereas Nunu's entire gameplay revolves around 4 polygons wandering onto your screen to steal your camps or dragons, permaslowing, and giving his allies free stats and overall making the other jungler want to snap his keyboard.

Ryze has his mana scaling, Malph, Rammus, Ornn and other tanks have abilities that scale off of defensive stats. Old galio was a terror into all AP teams bc of this, but since MR was tied to his dmg, he became less optimal the more AD was on their team. Being able to stack AP/MR was kind of his deal. I don't know if feeding into a full AP Galio is the way to find that specialization, I think playing up the anti-AP parts of his kit and toning down some of his more general damage reduction might solidify his niche.\n\nWell, that's my two cents anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2017-10-18T18:57:10.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats not true at all.

I would suggest making her passive form give a boost of mobility. Frankly the question that needs answering why has these points not been answered exactly why riot is ignoring them (E range, stealth radius, movement speed)?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Çyn","date":"2017-10-18T16:30:00.160+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Eve feels honestly fine, I've played a tonne of games of her across live and pbe on multiple accounts\nall she needs is a small range buff on the E and She'll be gucci.
