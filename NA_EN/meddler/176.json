The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png    \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \n**Removal of the jungle funneling penalty**\n\nAs mentioned when it was introduced one of our goals for preseason is to remove the jungle funneling penalty (Monster Hunter). That penalty was added to discourage funneling both jungle and lane farm onto one champion without interacting much in either position with the enemy. \n\nOur current belief is that two of the preseason changes should reduce the appeal of funneling enough we can remove Monster Hunter without an explicit replacement:\n\n* Bounty scaling - Bounties will now be scaling somewhat off minions/monsters killed, not only off champions killed. That means that focusing farm so heavily on one champ becomes a bigger risk, with greater payout for the enemy if they can shut them down, given better options against funnel strats.\n* Barricade (temp name) gold - Being able to gain rewards from pushing on a tower even if you can't take it down entirely makes leaving a lane uncontested a higher price to pay. That also reduces the appeal of funneling play in most circumstances.\n\nWe're still testing whether the combination of those two things should be enough. Looks hopeful so far though.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n**How popular are the different queues?**\n\n\nSomething I thought it would be good to share was a look at how popular the different queue types in LoL are, both from an overall perspective and looking at how they vary region to region. Chart below showing a % breakdown (hours played in each mode) in early September for a few regions with different habits. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/7ClMRFs\n\nLooking at the regions shown:\n\n* Overall - None of the regions, whether those shown here or the others not listed, is highly representative of the overall average. Every region has at least one queue in which they're noticeably divergent from average play rates. \n* Korea - Korean players like solo queue a lot more than those from other regions, with low play in normals as a result. They play average amounts of ARAM, but have low interest in other modes compared to players elsewhere (e.g. Nexus Blitz or most RGMs we've run in the past).\n* NA - NA Players play less Flex than almost every other region. They're bigger fans of non SR modes, with the most Nexus Blitz play of any region and nearly the most TT play (EUW has slightly more TT games).\n* Brazil - Brazil's a newer region and so players there follow a couple of trends we see on newer servers, with more normal play and Co-op versus AI than average and less ARAM.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n**Some small item/rune changes in 8.21**\n\nWe’ve got some small adjustments to a few items in 8.21, bit of context:\n\n* Essence Reaver - Cutting 200g off the cost as short term help. Might have something larger for it later in the year, want to make it a better regardless now though.\n* Edge of Night - Cost reduction by 200g as well. No current plans for changing its functionality, think we’ve definitely got it overpriced though.\n* Time Warp Tonic - We’re looking at different possible ways to nerf TWT, given the amount of health/mana restoration it’s offering is excessive. Current version in testing is a change where instead of offering increased duration and MS during the duration it instead gives some restoration up front, doesn’t change duration at all and still gives the movement speed.","replies":[{"poster":"Zkaiser","date":"2018-10-10T16:09:33.549+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":22,"body":"So when are you deleting TT?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-10-10T16:16:57.977+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":4,"body":"We had a chat recently about our different queues.

When it was initially reworked, there was about a year or so when there was a lot of follow-up and love for it in balance patches and changes. Now, there are times I see that a change that went live on SR several patches ago was only just added to TT, as if nobody remembered to update it until somebody pointed it out. It would be great to see it get a little more love again; nowhere near as much as it got when it was reworked (I doubt the returns on player interest would be anywhere near the investment Riot would be putting into the mode), but just enough to keep it feeling like it's an actual alternative map/mode to play.\n\nWhen Nexus Blitz was around, it received balance changed every 3 days or so; nothing major, but small tweaks to bring champions a little more in line. The changes came out so quickly that I have to assume they were done almost solely off of win/pick rate stats, and much less off of critical thought and analysis that SR changes get. I think that level of balancing, pure stat balancing, would be perfect for TT. You could have a small team of people, just a handful, take a look every week or two at TT stats, and knock out a few number tweaks. Once a year, during preseason or some other arbitrary time, you could roll out a bigger patch, tweaking items, jungle and tower balancing, buff or altar effects, more of the critical analysis type balancing. Just once a year on big changes, and tiny number tweaks throughout the year, and I think TT would feel MUCH more fun to play, a much less like a forgotten stepchild.\n\nThat said, I doubt you'd get more than double its current players at any point, AT BEST, so maybe even that much investment isn't worth the effort. But, personally, just having the mode feel like it's cared about, and being able to see a variety of champions on it instead of the same archetypes over and over (looking at you, juggernauts/assassins) would make it feel like a lot better.\n\nAlso, love your updates Meddler, thanks for sharing and caring with us.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2018-10-10T22:56:19.726+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you build it, they will come. \n\nYou don't treat TT seriously, and that obviously filters out into the player base. That pisses me off because TT is great at testing a very different skillset than SR, and it does so in a way that is fun and impactful. The horrendous balance on the map used to make it a lot less fun than SR, but it's not much different from SR these days.\n\nHonestly, TT is a fun mode with a good design that has always deserved better treatment than Riot has given it. Despite its flaws, the core is solid and delivers something unique from SR. What would be the point in deleting it just to create something new if you're going to ignore the new mode as well?\n\nAlso, Shadow Isles don't get enough attention.

Pre Unsealed spell book in solo queue wasnt ever THAT dominant-strong if you could exploit it in full true but not in solo queue,however in pro scene was spammed cause  in coordianted teams you can get INSANE value. Stopwatch-omg like we couldnt figure that easily accesible 1 time death saving conssummable wouldnt be broken but we put it regardless but when the pro scene became boring cause no kill were happening due to stopwatch Riot became \"OMG its too safe of a tool,lets nerf it\" <- this was a good decision dont missunderstand me. The boots- you dont have boots for 10 min-30 secs for each kill/assist and you cant buy it early and you save just 300 g, gave a WHOOPY 50 gold discount form tier 2 boots ( WOW thats game breaking,so op) and give 10 MS more but yeah thank god there is diminishing vallue in MS and u cant reach 440 MS so easily- this was a good TRADE cause if you overextend and died and didnt have tp you would waste so much time walking back in lane so the enemy would get so much of a big lead, now they are even less users that take it( urgot maybe yi). Kleptomancy was Main issue was with Ezreal Q which cost 28 mana and low cd at lv 1 and it was long range and easy to hit as result Ez go so much gold and consummables that helped him so much that he reached his late game build way earlier that all the champs. The other main users of kleptomancy were GP and illaoi- GP q cost alot of mana and if you used it on enemy you were losing silver kraken to upgrade his ult and illaoi w is telegraphed ability that you just need to back off and she wouldnt get anything+ illaoi in early is she spams her W she would have mana issues. Well I believe that Riot should remove the interaction between klepto and  Ezreal Q and Gp Q and it would ok. But now even GP and Illaoi have changed to grasp of the undying and use it sparringly. Now Glasial is now the new Klepto, which ahri spams it and it slowly becomes a possible issue.\n\nNow from the other hand the cookies, the hexflash, the other one that allows you to go negative in order to buy, and the rune for 45% cdr builds, and minion dematerilizer and time warp tonic are the successfull ones than i believe its for the most part balanced.  But overall the inspiration tree is at best a secondary tree for most champions sooooo thats why i asked them if the devs believe it was a failure cause it almost no- existance ( Other runes have the same problem like Phase Rush who see some uses from Asol,Cass, maybr ryze and i have seen some darius and garen with fun runes-items in very rare cases). I repeat i believe that Riot is completly killing slowly the inspiration tree and i like it from the 1st week it got out and i find it sad to nerf it to the ground.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-10-10T19:17:07.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr\n\nYou don't need to describe what every single Rune do, mate, I know it myself.

Currently she is the worst champion in the game after 15 minutes. A former LCS analyst agrees with me on that point. She has the same pitfalls as Rengar before his initial rework, being that she is a squishy champion that has to dive into a team and will either trade a kill or simply die. Rek' sai is even worse than old Rengar because she cant simply instakill a squishy target, due to the fact that she has to first knock the squishy up, Q-AA-AA in order to get full rage and then E for the true damage. Most of the time this isn't even enough to kill a squishy, whereas old Rengar could simply triple Q and instakill. Furthermore, Rek' sai's ultimate is one of the worst abilities in the game. This is due to the fact that it is so telegraphed; everyone can see the animation begin, and the animation is quite long. Additionally, her ultimate can be dodged by every single champion in the game because essentially everyone takes flash. Champions with a dash such as Lucian or Graves can also avoid her ultimate simply by dashing away. Her ultimate does a good amount of damage, but it's simply not enough to make up for how bad the rest of it is. Also, if a champion survives your ultimate, it is very difficult to continue chasing them down with autos because of the animation of the leap. This is one of my biggest problems with this champion. She feels clunky to play in that regard. Rek' sai is also very immune to CC, which isn't a problem only she faces, but when built damage oriented, she gets blown up before she can do anything. Another glaring problem with Rek' sai is her W. Her W is very bad currently, much worse than it was before her rework. The knock-up only affecting one target is pretty bad, considering most champions can simply just kite away from her. Another obvious problem with her W is that it does not prioritize champions. This leads to situations where an enemy can simply run into a minion wave to avoid being knocked-up, which makes Rek' sai's ganks useless. This would be solved by reverting her so that the W can knock-up multiple champions, with the knock-up duration dependent on how close Rek' sai is to the enemy champion. Additionally, her passive healing is pretty much negligible; when clearing with her you still get relatively low. Reverting her to her previous form would fix all of these issues. When built as tank, she could dive into a fight and knock up multiple champions. She still has no escape, but she is meant to soak up damage so this is not an issue. As tank, she can also face-check without dying instantly. If reverted, she could also get multiple knock-ups off in a single team-fight, due to the fact that she would be tankier and her per-target knock-up CD would be lower. As a said before, current Rek' sai is completely useless in team-fights because enemy champions can simply walk away from her to avoid the knock-up. Tarzaned recently released a tier list video and he placed her in the lowest or next to lowest tier. Valkrin also expressed that Rek' sai is an awful champion. It would make sense for her to receive the Rengar/ Leblanc treatment.\n\nTL:DR\nRek' sai is a bruiser with assassin scaling. Her passive, W, and ultimate are very bad abilities with glaring problems that have yet to be addressed. Even after her recent buffs in patch 8.14, she is still one of the worst junglers in the game at all levels of play. Rek' sai needs to recieve the Rengar/ Leblanc treatment. Her old kit was much better than her current one. Tank Rek' sai is much more useful and reliable than damage oriented Rek' sai.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2018-10-10T16:28:49.187+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler, there's been a recent reveal about a new Fiora walking animation (the version with her arm behind her back looks incredibly good). Are there plans to touch-up other champions whose art and gameplay are otherwise up-to-par with modern League standards, or to add entirely new suites of animations since some champions lack some of the newer sets that new champions have such as a slowed/sped-up/hitting tower animation?\n\nOn that same note, will the animators ever finish Aatrox' wings? They just appear into existence rather than fold/unfold on his back.

With her ult becoming less of a taxi mode and more of a murderbird?\n\nLike this following idea:\n\n> - Champion renamed to \"Quinn and Valor\"\n> - Ultimate renamed Tag Team, retains all current functions and gains the following additions:\n>  - When casting her ultimate, Quinn is replaced by Valor (no more taxibird, murderburd is back)\n>  - Valor has 125 attack range, but maybe gains a bit of (base) AD or on-hit damage or higher base AS\n>  - Valor casts Q as a PBAoE, his first auto after the cast applies and consumes Harrier\n>  - Using E as Valor dashes him to attack range of target enemy\n>  - Quinn and Valor share cooldowns\n>  - In Valor form, Harrier's visuals lack the swoop down of the eagle. Instead, the mark is indicated by a single crossbow bolt.\n>\n> *Mostly for nostalgic reasons. By not giving Valor (a melee champion) benefits beyond the changed Q targeting paradigm, Quinn's power level should not change too drastically, especially since Quinn and Valor share cooldowns (and an E as a gapcloser cannot be used as a gapopener until the regular cooldown has passed).*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2018-10-10T15:59:30.539+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I knew TT had a small community but THAT small.\nKind of a shame.\n\nAlso on top my my constant outcries over the galio rework I had posted on the Gameplay+ Forum:\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-plus/bzzOsuXW-why-there-should-be-a-partial-revert-to-galios-w\n\nIt's not getting much traction, prob due to galio not being super popular...still, but I was wondering how many rioters look at those posts?\n\nI had a much larger post on reddit covering the same ideaology to have a partial revert to Galios W to give him a similar feel and why it would work better in lore and gameplay. \n\nIs it possible that Galio can get one of his old mechanics back one day?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2018-10-10T15:57:25.812+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"also do you have the full changelist for Kai'Sa","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-10-10T16:10:01.066+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"We're still working on nailing down details there.
