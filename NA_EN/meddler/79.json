The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Runes on PBE inc!**\n\nShort post today since, all going according to plan, we should have Runes and at least some other pre-season content hitting PBE shortly and we&#039;re working on both making sure that goes smooth/talking about all of those details. It&#039;s worth mentioning again that what hits PBE is still work in progress. Numbers especially are likely to change, particularly those on Runes themselves, but also potentially things like style bonuses, which additional base stats champs get, some early item stats etc. We&#039;ll have Runes on PBE for 3 cycles, rather than the usual 1, so a far longer period for things to change over as well. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Probably tweaking Jaurim&#039;s Fist along with Sterak&#039;s**\n\nMost likely adjustment is to pull some of its stats forward a bit, make them there from purchase, rather than as dependent on building up stacks so that it&#039;s gold efficient relative to component items (Long Sword/Ruby Crystal) quicker.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**More pre-season stuff coming to PBE over the next few weeks**\n\nRunes is the biggest piece of gameplay content for pre-season by a huge margin. There are some other smaller bits and pieces also coming though that aren&#039;t all ready yet. Expect to see some of them show up over the next few weeks as they get to a ready enough state. \n\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"PandaNator43","date":"2017-09-26T15:19:01.392+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"What are your thoughts on Players/Champions being Elusive in League of Legends?\n\nThe feeling I’m going for is “Spiderman contorting through a cloud of bullets,” or the fighting style of Aang the last airbender.\n\nThis is likely something that should fit under the Domination Path.\n\nMy initial take is that the Ruin would add a new active effect on the players boots (just like Hunt of the Blood Moon Ruin) with any of combination of these effects:\n1) Can be used multiple times a battle. I think multiple uses in a fight with small payouts (damage reduction), would feel better than one big payout (like Fizz’s E).\n2) Short range dash, along the lines of the dash on Akali’s W.\n3) % decreased damage taken from single target effects for .5 seconds. (Its easier to dodge a sword than an explosion. Also, this fits the Assassin archetype of combating high damage threats.)\n4) Some other 4th thing :)\n\nI’d love to see something in League of legends fulfill the space for the “Elusive Assassin” fantasy.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-09-26T15:24:28.979+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the fantasy's a cool one that we could do in ways we haven't already in LoL. I'd be much more inclined to do mechanics like that on individual champion kits though rather than on a Rune available to everyone. That's due to some fantasy mismatch with being able to pair such an effect with anyone, difficulty making it feel as good as it should without being able to make character specific animations and some game health/counterplay concerns with giving anyone access to things like significant single target damage reduction and/or a short range dash, especially on a low CD.","replies":[{"poster":"PandaNator43","date":"2017-09-26T15:31:04.564+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome!

It's the fact that Aerie travels at ~200 ms at all points of the game.\n\nTowards the end of the gameplay you could see Aerie lagging behind for 10-30 seconds as Nami ran away from or advanced towards enemies. It makes sense for it to be slow early game so that you there is a reward for taking an aggressive stance and being closer to enemies, but late game most of the supports that would want it are too busy trying to stay away from the enemies that can burst them down to wait 5 seconds for Aerie to wander back. \n\nMaybe having it have a certain distance it has to be within after X number of seconds so it is guaranteed to reach you after 20 seconds(for comparison, Meteor has a cooldown of 20-8 seconds, and Electrocute having 55-25 seconds, both being much more impactful)? Imagine being a Janna, especially after her rework and all of the new % ms boosts she can now get with the runes, and having to wait 40-80 seconds because you hit someone with your w near their base, and they decided to chase you back to yours(and that is if you wait in base, if you had to go bot, then recall to respond to top it could be longer). Or Soraka in the botlane, and the first champ(as dictated by the single-target-effect-if-an-aoe-hits-multiple-people picking routine) happens to be the top laner, on the other side of the map. It would be nice of your keystone to show up to see you again for the next two minutes, wouldn't it?\n\nHaving one of the most applicable runes punish you because you are faster than an unmounted kled, especially on a class of champs that all have ms boosts({{champion:16}}'s q on hit, {{champion:37}}'s w, {{champion:40}}'s passive/w, {{champion:267}}'s passive, {{champion:43}}'s e, {{champion:497}}'s w/e/r) and tend to go for {{item:3117}}, does not seem to be in line with the other keystones. I know every keystone has an opportunity cost, but having the rune punish you for smart playing on a squishy and defensive class, or for building a near mandatory stat? Late game, if you are moving around like you should be, it has the potentially highest cooldown(which can infinite, if you are actively trying to avoid it for some reason) if you are not in a position to hunt it down.\n\nTL:DR Aerie return is too slow and cannot keep up with champs without boots, let alone champs with them(though the slowness in pre minute 10-15 is understandable). And there are cross map abilities that would screw you out of a keystone for way too long if you have Aerie with you, and the champ affected is far away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Dolan","date":"2017-09-26T17:33:02.026+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you believe that sorcery may be too strong as a side path due to minor runes that in general seem to out value those in other trees such as gathering storm and ultimate hat? \n\nIsn't dominance hindered by the fact that the first line of minor runes are mainly support based?
