{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-05-14T15:52:29.611+0000","title":"Prototype Wukong Changes on PBE Context","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey folks,\r\n\r\nWhole bunch of details here on some Wukong changes we’re going to be testing on the PBE for a while. First off, some context around them:\r\n\r\n* These changes won't be shipping for at least awhile . We're using art that’s borrowed from other champs/items because we haven’t committed to these specific changes yet. So even if the gameplay were to test really well, there’d still be some delay before we shipped them since we'd need to get the art revised.\r\n* There are some known bugs present in the modified abilities. Nothing that should have a meaningful effect on testing, but stuff that will feel a bit buggier than normal. Smaller stuff like this we don’t put time into fixing until a set of changes have been committed to either.\r\n* These changes haven’t been through a rigorous balance pass, so numbers won’t necessarily be representative of what they’d need to be for ship. The mechanics themselves are intended to be representative (e.g. Wukong’s Q heals him), so the specific numbers on the heal by contrast might be about right or might be meaningfully too high or too low. We’ve done enough testing to have confidence they’re not ludicrously off, but haven’t put them through a full balance assessment.\r\n* In addition to PBE testing, we’re also going to be running this changelist past some players onsite at some of our offices. That will give a more controlled environment than PBE can offer (more even and competitive games for example) and generates different feedback as a result.\r\n* Finally, this is a gameplay focused update. Things like changing VO, model, full animation update, etc. aren’t on the table at this time. We think that sort of work’s really important, but our docket’s currently full with other champions for it. Some art/audio adjustments are likely, but just those needed to accommodate the gameplay changes. \r\n\r\nOk, that’s a lot of context that isn’t all that interesting to most readers. Apologies, still important to share it though! Next up, goals of this work:\r\n\r\n* Add a few points of extra mastery to Wukong for those who want to take advantage of it\r\n* Make a bit more use of the trickster elements of Wukong’s theme\r\n* Improve ability satisfaction a bit\r\n* Avoid fundamental changes to things like ability targeting types (as to avoid a significantly more difficult skill floor for new players or large relearning period for existing players)\r\n* Improve Wukong’s counterplay, both laning pattern, and reliance on bursting targets\r\n* Focus on Wukong players, past and present, more than potential Wukong players\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, getting past the context setting which I’m sure a lot of you skimmed past anyway and into the changelist. Again, numbers haven’t necessarily been balanced, so this is much more about the direction of how the abilities work than what a particular number is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPassive - Strength of Stone (was Stone Skin)\r\n\r\n**Part 1 Crushing Blows - New**\r\n\r\nWhenever Wukong or one of his clones damages an enemy champion, they apply a stack of Crushing Blows to that target. Targets take 4% increased damage from Wukong and his clones for each stack of Crushing blows (max 5).\r\n\r\nVFX start small at one stack and get larger with each additional stack applied.\r\n\r\n**Part 2 Stone Skin - Redesigned**\r\n\r\nWhen 3+ enemy champions are visible within 1400 units, Wukong gains Armor and MR equal to 20 + 2 per level + 0.2*his bonus Armor/MR respectively. Bonuses last for 6s and renews if enemies remain near. Currently uses the Gargoyle's Stoneplate activation VFX when up. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhy these changes?\r\n\r\nWukong’s live passive is functional (gives him power, influences his itemization), but real low on  satisfaction. Would like to keep the teamfight survivability aspect though. Trying a double passive, where both parts hopefully have better appreciability and neither needs to be as relevant in all contexts for the passive as a whole to feel better. For the defensive bit, giving him Armor/MR ratios to make mixing in more defensive itemization, if desired, a more sensible choice. For the offensive part, looking to shift some power on the kit away from a team amp to a personal amp and allow magic damage output, whether from Wukong’s kit or elsewhere, to also feel better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Q - Golden Magical Staff (was Crushing Blow)**\r\n\r\nNow has a passive where Wukong gets 125 range on his next AA after he casts any spell (not just Q).\r\n\r\nNow deals 20-100 bonus magic damage instead of 10-130 (+0.4 AD) bonus physical damage. Now heals for 20-60 (+0.25 AD) health (halved on minions) instead of shredding the target's Armor.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy these changes?\r\n\r\nTrying to give him more frequent access to increased range as a way to allow a combat pattern that's both a bit more varied (especially in lane) and doesn't necessarily have to be as bursty. Laning pattern also hopefully helped a bit by some sustain on the kit. Expectation is that basic effectiveness will be pretty easy to access, but extra range will allow a lot of optimizations, especially when combined with other parts of the kit.\r\n\r\n\r\n**W - Warrior Trickster (was Decoy)**\r\n\r\nClone created now attacks nearby enemies dealing 50% of Wukong's damage instead of exploding for magic damage at the end of its life.\r\n\r\nClone lifespan increased to 2.5-5.0s (invisibility duration for Wukong himself unchanged).\r\n\r\nWukong creating a clone and Wukong pushing 'S' to stop moving will now look identical to enemy players (can bait them into believing you've cast W when all you've done is stopped moving).\r\n\r\nWukong's dash range when casting W increased to 200 units (was 100). \r\n\r\nCD reduced to 16-8s from 18-10s.\r\n\r\nCD now starts on clone death, not on clone creation (clone uptime, especially with CDR, becomes too high otherwise, CD reduced so that non-CDR builds aren’t too punished).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy these changes?\r\n\r\nGetting a bit more trickery in and exploring a combative clone as a fantasy win. Increased dash range pairs well with increased AA range passive from Q. Clone damage output being more relevant and increased potential for trickery hopefully gives some interesting optimizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**E - Nimbus Strike**\r\n\r\nOther images of Wukong are now interactable clones that look just like Wukong and can be interacted with like any other unit. That means enemies won't be certain which exact target Wukong himself is going to until he gets there. Clones can also block skillshots. \r\n\r\nAD ratio to 0.5 (was 0.8)\r\n\r\nNow checks for secondary targets in a much larger area around the primary target.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy these changes?\r\n\r\nPrimarily, we want to enable more trickery and again, add some mastery points for  those who wish to to optimize around. Reducing AD ratio both to decouple Wukong a bit from such AD-bound builds and as a result of adding power elsewhere. AD builds should still be decent, but not to the extent most other builds aren’t worth considering.\r\n\r\n\r\n**R - Cyclone**\r\n\r\nOther spells are no longer locked out while you're using R. If you cast another spell, it will immediately cancel the ult in progress. Makes it easier to chain spells together basically if you want to end the ult early.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy these changes?\r\n\r\nWukong's ult is pretty well liked and short of making really major changes, wasn’t finding any better and strong directions here. Just a small useability adjustment as a result. Considered increasing the damage tick rate, given that’s a common player request. Concluded it wasn’t the right call though, given that both binds him more to Black Cleaver and pushes him back towards burstier damage with his new passive. The knockup by contrast already checks for targets much more often than the damage is dealt, so there aren’t responsiveness gains to be had there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThings feedback would be particularly appreciated on\r\n\r\nIf you’re playing as Wukong:\r\n\r\n* How much Wukong have you previously played?\r\n* Do you feel these changes result in you playing in somewhat different ways? \r\n* If so, do you enjoy that?\r\n* What builds would you be inclined to use with this kit?\r\n\r\nIf you’re playing against Wukong:\r\n\r\n* Is it clear what’s happening in game and how you should play against this version of the kit?\r\n* How frustrating do you find trickery from this kit relative to trickery from other champions in LoL?","replies":[{"poster":" E X Ø D ł A ","date":"2019-05-14T16:54:24.766+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really wanna thank you Meddler for hearing people out and as a wu main hope these changes (which already sound awesome) bring our fantasy of wu back to life!\nCant wait to try them out on pbe and give u guys feedback as soon as possible! &lt;3\nMy only question is why q now deals magic damage and doesnt scale ?\ni mean 20-100 flat is kinda ok but i think the q part needs some other work on it plus depends on the cd its gonna be , would love love to hear ur thought on it :)  @Meddler  {{champion:62}}","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-05-14T19:39:10.743+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might shift some power around to get some scaling on the Q damage, or if he proves weak just add power there. Wanted to try a version without as a test for a much lower AD scaling kit though, especially given the Q passive adds a significant amount of power at some points in the game even if it's not direct damage.\n\nMagic damage is an exploration into the kit being less focused on getting Armor Pen (whether Lethality or Black Cleaver) while also giving a tiny bit more power against Armor stacking enemies than would otherwise be the case.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wukong Airlines","date":"2019-05-14T16:17:44.231+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hey Meddler, thank you for the update and the hardwork.\n\nI'm a wuk main with over 2mil points on all accounts.\n\nMy intake on the information presented in front of me [first we need to test it to see how it goes]:\n1) the kit looks good, yet utility is still almost the same.\n2) although heals have been added, the heal looks like will heal on Q AA only, which is part of why we needed the Q mechanic to change to begin with [ i still have no idea how the Q works if it's still AA reset or something else], but either way I was expecting a skillshot with added range + skill expression and slight CC.\n3) Wukong still has no reliable form of CC compared to his class and other bruisers , he has no slows and still will not be able to provide for the team, rather, now he's a skirmishing bruisers from what I see.\n4) instead of giving him additional resistances, we could give him % damage reduction on his passive or \"R\" when he engages the first second for example, that would give him more survivability, that's what Wukong mains want, to be able to last longer with the R and not be bursted down.\n5) he looks like he has more potential to outplay the enemy with the \"W,E\" changes, but why not make the \"W\" stackable\"? I dont see him being a better trickster with 1 clone only and it has the same invisibility as well.\n6) Again, from my point of view, changing the Q to a skillshot with slight CC would give him a way better spot for laning phase and extra CC in his kit, the knockup on the R is not enough for a bruiser that doesnt have any form of \"movement speed boost or slowing the enemies\".\n7) No form of shields [which again can be added to his stone skin theme rather than resistances].\nI will test it as soon as it goes on PBE and will provide more info later on.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                _**Edit [ 3 Games played ]**_\n\nI can only give feedback on how Wukong works in the jungle so far [im not a toplaner and I will let other top mains give their feedback]:\n\n1) Jung wukong is really strong, specialy if combined with both Tiamat {{item:3077}} and sheen/tf {{item:3057}} /{{item:3078}} \n2) Wukong now has 2 AA resets which makes him good in trading whether laning/ganks/counter jungling\n3) There is no point in going Bruiser Wukong [for me I find the old assassin build playstyle is still viable though I recommend putting {{item:3078}} and {{item:3077}} as mandatory items for Wu since they will maximize his damage output with his Clone's damage and AOE at the same time]\n4) Wukong lost 10% of armor shred but now the % armor shred can maximize his damage due to lasting longer for longer trades + his R can activate it on each tick]\n5) I dont feel the heal or at least I find it a pointless extra addition\n6) Wukong cant trade much with healers/shield bruisers [riven/darius etc] unless he bursts them down quickly\n7) The armor/magic resistance part of the passive feels weak and irrelevant early/mid game and somewhat useful lategame [survivability problem still not solved]\n8) I enjoy the Q passive that adds range, and if we want to make the Q healing better we should apply heal on each reset or can add both magic dmg and the heal as well for \n9) Having no form of CC makes it hard to reach certain champs specially now that I try to save the W for trades rather than be sneaky [huge part of Wu's damage is in his W].\n10) Wu's damage mostly relies on the Q passive [AA resets/added range + W damage].\n11) sometimes the clone takes longer time to AA\n\n\n_**Edit 2:**_\n\nThis rework doesn't work:\n\n1) Survivability problem is still there. and it's still dependent on 3+ enemies, which makes him less of a bruiser in lane, even in teamfight, stats doesn't make a bruiser anymore, rather, shields/heals/AOE sustain [look {{champion:92}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:420}} etc] + the fact that Penetration exists makes the passive even weaker\n\n2) Heal is terrible, my opinion [we dont need heal, we want something that can block % of damage for lane trading]\n\n3) I don't consider Wu a trickster:\n1. 1 Clone is not enough, and the \"S\" stop command doesnt give you much potential to outplay anyone specially if they can AOE mash their keyboards to deny the outplay [{{champion:266}} {{champion:92}} ..]\n2. Tricksters are assasins, with  huge outplay potential and mobility [check {{champion:7}} can dash 2 times, and go back to same spot 2 times {{champion:35}}  stealth that works as gap closer/dodge skillshots, W can trap/trick enemies, R can outplay any incoming damage]\n\n4) Wu lost a lot of damage, and doens't have any source of reliable [hybrid damage/true damage/ % damage] that would allow him to sacrifice building damage and go for defensive items, even with the 20% armor shred on his Passive, its still bad, since he lost 10% comparing to the previous Q.\n\n5) Now you save W in hopes you deal damage in case someone tried to duel, cant work as an assassin or you will lose high damage output, cant be sneaky anymore [part of why he's not a trickster atm]\n\n6) No CC at all, you cant contest with bruisers who can {{champion:92}} stun-knockyou up, {{champion:266}} many knockups and zoning spell, {{champion:24}} deny AA damage which W is heavily reliable on right now, and stun you, etc,  All what wu got now is 1 second knockup on lvl 6.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-05-14T16:42:30.638+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q is still an AA reset yes. Let me know how you're feeling about ability to access the heal once you've had a chance to try it in game?\n\nMy thinking around not adding additional CC was that there was an opportunity here to keep Wukong more distinct from other melee damage dealers while still making him more effective in some circumstances. If this direction doesn't work out we'd be open to considering more standard CC approaches, worry that makes him more generic though and undercuts our ability to offer other tools.\n\nRevised Stoneskin on the passive is intended to give him better burst resistance in teamfights. Going with Armor and MR for now rather than DR because that gives better hooks into the item system for both Wukong and other players. He can itemize to strengthen the passive, with Stoneplate especially looking really strong in some circumstances, players really struggling against him can prioritize % shred. DR by contrast's a flatter mechanic that removes some depth from the game. It's got its place certainly, but think there's value in avoiding it where possible unless extreme consistency is really important (e.g. Braum E).\n\nBeen seeing some meaningful trickster increase with a single clone.

It would be extremeley difficult to utilise the E clones to block skillshots. The increased range for clones is nice but Id definitely prefer a non change on this ability of it means i dont have to sacrifice core damage.\n\n\nQuestions and points to note;\n\nIs the attack speed buff element to his E staying? \n\n\nWith lower cooldowns I expect one current issue to come up moreso than it already does... mana gating. Is there any changes to mana numbers as a lot of players already struggle with this and they wont be able to take advantage of lower cooldowns if they are still held back by mana numbers.\n\nWhilst the W change seems nice, how will the targeting be prioritised? It would be a shame if theres nothing inplace for this and my clone targets minions when theres enemy champions in range.\n\nIs there something that I'm missing in terms of his jungle clearing. If anything it seems like early jungle clearing would be slightly worse off with these changes and Wu already has quite a bad clear.\n\n\nSuggestions;\n\nIf the passive element of Q changed to auto-attacks acter using an ability slow enemies and tge active part had a slight range increase... there would be an appreciable CC element to his base kit that can help with taking scuttle too.\n\nSome compensation to his mana numbers.\n\nE damage revert.\n\nSomething small to assist with his early jungle clear.\n\n\nOther than this the listed changes so far seem very promising and a step in the right direction that we mains have been hoping for for a while!!

I'm not certain it's necessary yet, but suspect it is given other power being added and this seems to be one of the best places to cut damage as a result.\n\nE still grants AS.\n\nW prioritizes enemies within its range Wukong has just hit, otherwise it'll attack the nearest enemy at present. Pretty open to tweaking its AI, hasn't been a major focus yet. It also benefits from the extended range from his Q passive post spellcast.\n\nWe haven't done exhaustive jungle testing yet. Some clears on a previous version of this kit looked pretty reasonable, that might have changed though. Wouldn't want to penalize his jungling relative to his laning, my current inclination is he's a champ who should be supported in either position. \n\nAppreciate the other feedback, apologies don't have time to respond to everything.

But it is not meaningless. Why? Because it is scaled non-linearly and is immense aid in early game cs'ing.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-05-14T16:26:55.894+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"For \"meaningless power\" in general, yeah, all power's taken into consideration when balancing a champ. Our goal's not always to make every source of power as optimizable as possible though, that can lead to kits that have too punishing a learning curve, demand the player focus on too many things at once, lack concentrated enough success/failure cases etc. Would argue sometimes power into something like base stats or damage on a simple ability is the appropriate call depending on what the rest of the kit looks like.\n\nIn terms of this Q specifically the Q bonus damage isn't really a decision point in all in situations certainly. When it comes to lane trading it's got some relevance by contrast, providing a small but worth tracking window for opponents to play around and Wukong to consider. Trying Magic Damage here as a way to open up his build paths a bit more, so he's not so strongly bound to Lethality and/or BC depending on exact tuning of those items.","replies":[{"poster":"Wukong Mid","date":"2019-05-14T16:40:25.902+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"My main stance is that the difference in \"old champs\" and \"new champs\" is that newer designs tend to have skillsets with more optimized ways of spending their power budget.\n\nIf the rework results in a skillset with the same amount of meaningless power --just shuffled around-- then I believe it will not do much in aiding changing the community's perception of the champion.\n\nI believe it is possible to manipulate a champion's power budget (in this case Wukong) such that you push it in a direction away from the build path you want to avoid, all the while not adding meaningless power.\n\nFor a quick example, if you want to go harder on the \"many clones\" theme of Wukong, I would rather see a Q that doesn't do that magic damage, heals less (half), but:\n- creates a clone\n- clone also Qs and you heal from it","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ryúga","date":"2019-05-14T16:16:53.112+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't have much experience on wu kong, but those changes seem to make him shift towards bruisery kind of playstyle and build, which is my favorite gameplay, so I might pick him up if those changes get through.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Diablo v2","date":"2019-05-14T16:16:21.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":18,"body":"have u planned anything for asol he  loses all 1v1 midlane is there any chance u could nerf his e and buff his early game damage towards champions","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-05-14T16:19:17.851+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to be sticking to Wukong specific responses in this thread.

This whole kit looks like it could help fighting melee enemys who stick with you or fighting in the jungle with the new W. \nMy concern is how greatly it will affect assassin / back line diver Wukong. So far it looks like you've taken away his burst in all of his abilities. I understand that assassin playstyle might be a problem in general, but Wukong has a lot difficulties bursting people down as of now. I can't imagine it being even slightly possible with less dmg on E and Q. \nI greatly enjoy Wukong as a AD heavy champion who kinda fills a niche between teamfight heavy and assasin-like champion. I think this new kit will lack this kind of playstyle and you will be forced to build at least tanky enough to make your Q passive worth and to be able to not die without impact. \n\nGiving dmg to his W also means losing dmg against ranged / kiting champions who will just run out of range of the clone instantly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheShroud","date":"2019-05-14T16:52:12.558+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can you make the clones also Q when you Q for half effect? \n\nDo they do on hit effects?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-05-14T19:52:44.489+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Intention is W clone does apply on hit effects yes.
