Quick context on some of them:\r\n\r\n* Ashe - too strong in organized play in particular. We&#039;re testing a nerf to her E, given that&#039;s much more powerful in organized play than regular.\r\n* Doran&#039;s Shield - Experimental changes testing a version with a Spectre&#039;s Cowl like passive designed to give sustain when being harassed that doesn&#039;t have to be balanced around bot lane (isn&#039;t significantly more effect against two harassers than one).\r\n* Exhaust - Too strong. Currently testing a CD nerf, might try something else at some point.\r\n* Rengar, Jayce, Le Blanc - Unsure if changes will be on PBE today or not at time of writing, previous set of nerfs weren&#039;t sufficient on them though, so likely hitting them again in 7.5.\r\n* Kindred - Testing improvements to which camps marks spawn on (reduce random chance of getting screwed). Longer term (which patch uncertain) we want to look at making crit more appealing for them, open up crit itemization as a pathway in part to support a later game power curve.\r\n* Talon - Nerfs to passive damage levels 1-11 and Q. Looking to reduce his power against other melee lanes especially where those effects are disproportionately powerful (much easier to access)\r\n* Aatrox - has changes on the PBE today, note though numbers haven&#039;t gone through final tuning yet\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Early Unanimous Surrender**\r\n\r\nShould be getting some testing this patch cycle in a lucky region! Details to follow shortly (later today I think?) TLDR for anyone unfamiliar with previous discussions: Testing a surrender at 15 minutes option if the entire team agrees, only on a single server initially to assess its impacts on surrender rates, player behavior, player satisfaction/frustration etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2017-02-22T18:08:24.436+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just wanted to say I love these posts, please keep doing them! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-02-22T18:53:54.098+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thank you!

Weeks ago you said the problem is not the itemization or champions but the fact that the level difference is the problem. I hate to break it to you but the itemization and champions are a bigger problem than the level difference. Champions in the support role have been dealing with inconsistent levels for years. In fact, years ago you did exactly this . . . . and increased the EXP and gold gained for supports. What has this done for the support role? The role is in the same spot it was years ago.\n\nYou have created  the support role to be unattractive, not very interactive, and quite frankly . . . . . . boring. Nothing you have done up to this point for the support role has worked. Nothing you have talked about doing is anything  different than you already have done. The problem is not just the role but the itemization and champions. While other roles have unique items, masteries and champions . . . . specific support oriented champions build the same thing . .  . . . game after game . . . and have a kit that revolves around building the same thing . . . . game after game . . . . . and quite frankly all play and feel the same. I feel like there is enough distinction between tanky supports versus a enchanter support. Heck, with the new tank rework coming out it is probably going to give that class of support champions more options and fun to play. Can we really sit here and be honest Meddler? You have taken almost every single enchanter support and ruined their ability to function properly in a solo-lane when they were before, ruined their theme and continue to ignore what their thematic should be offering to their gameplay, and more. You did all of this becauase their utility was too great to be allowed in a solo lane. Instead of taking some utility away and creating a kit for these champions that revolved around their theme or a unique gameplay, you gave them more utility and created a entire itemization to play on that utility even more. Here we are and you still haven't improved the support role or the enchanter role in particular because you feel that exp and gold is the problem. More utility, building specific support items too boost abilities that all feel the same on every single enchanter and doesn't offer anything different to the game or the role . . . is the problem.\n\nEnchanters:\n\nKarma - My favorite champion and probably the most balanced number wise. Unfortunately she suffers from the mindset that a generic shield bot champion is better than having a champion who uses her shields in a unique way and makes it look specifically designed for her and her thematic. The ability exists on an item active and is not original. It has no flair. It suffers from the generic idea that every enchanter should have a speed up move and heal/shield. If you want to make Karma the go to shield bot champion, do her R+E in a way that it is different than the active on Iron Locket of Solari. Heck, why don't you just remove the item indefinitely and keep the ability on Karma? There are so many better ways to do her entire kit and play on her theme more, but it seems the mindset you guys are settled on is taking more away and adding more utility . . . when you have openly admitted that Karma was played more in mid and top lane . . . . so why would you purposely take abilities, themes and everything else away from her when the community liked it so much? I cannot fathom why you want a champion to sit in the back and build shield/heal enhancing items to be relevant in a game . . . she has one damage move that is probably way too strong early game and falls off bad mid to late game compared to other battlemages. Shield bomb should never have been removed. What should have been removed was the mass shielding to begin with. You coudn't even be botherd to do her mass shields in a way that it was unique to Karma. It's bland.\n\nJanna - She has a good winrate but is she really meeting the thematic she is supposed to? She has a lot of boring playstyle and her new story is really amazing. I read the story and think .  . this doesn't fit her gameplay or kit at all. There is so much you could be doing for her and really make her this amazing champion that is completely different from other enchanters, but you don't seem to care. If she can turn into a bird, why isn't this in her gameplay? If she is a character that helps people when they ask for her help and really need it, why is this not reflected in her gameplay? It just seems like you are missing a lot of interesting things on her and don't really care about anything but her sitting in the back and pressing E with shield/heal enchancing items.\n\nLulu - I enjoyed playing Lulu in lanes. She was way too oppressive and it was because of her utility. If the problem was her utility than why did you decide to completely gutter lane Lulu and add more utility to her . . . and then say she is great right now. It's another instance with Karma, if players like playing in her lane . . . do not remove her from being played in a lane and not actually address the problems with her kit. Instead you guttered her and I personally do not feel like she is meeting the mark of a go to Fae Sorceresss. If she is supposed to be a fae sorceress shouldn't she be able to interact more with her fae partner? Don't you think there are better ways to make her kit more thematic and allow her to be played in a solo lane, while still being an option as a support. You don't seem to care. Wouldn't it be amazing if she no longer had the W and could place Pix on the ground in a targetable location and augment him with more attack speed? This is just one of thousands of ideas that is taking some utility away from her and playing on her thematic . . . . and not being gamebreaking.\n\nSona - Another one of my favorite champions that I feel like is in a terrible spot right now. People can sit here and say she is better off where she is right now. With her mini-rework she was too strong. You practically made her useless and you wanted to add more utility to her by nerfing her damage . .  . . another example of how you think more utility and bland gameplay is better than anything else you could have done on her. Maybe if you removed her auras and say . . . allow her to transfer the buffs she gives herself to other players, that would be something more interesting to the game. Auras and passive buffs that are really not done well, isn't very good for the game.\n\nThere are ways to make enchanters more appealing. The problem seems to be this mindset that more utility is better than exciting and unique gameplay. You furthered this by making support items that added more utility and passive buffs. The support items in Black Market Brawlers were fun and unique. Why haven't some of these items been added? Why are you not looking at finding ways to make the support role more interactive outside of a shield/heal buff passive that gives more passives? I just think you don't care about the role to begin with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exiles SoIace","date":"2017-02-23T05:06:16.604+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why nerf Talon and Lethality at the same time?
