The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Some context on 9.7 balance changes**\r\n\r\nThinking on where we're up to on various things:\r\n\r\n* Kayle - Looking to both bring down her overall power (she's just plain too strong in general) and increase her need to get items to be successful (she's too resilient to early/mid game failure right now)\r\n* Lissandra - We're hitting her Q CD, early game in particular, though a bit even when maxed. That's aimed at both her ability to shove lanes and to some degree her sustained damage later on. \r\n* Morgana - We held off on nerfs in 9.6 since it wasn't clear enough they were needed at the time. Pretty convinced they are necessary at this point though. Looking to bring her strength down more in mid than support, though both will be affected.\r\n* Sylas - Is just looking strong, with recent nerf not doing enough to bring him in line, particularly as player experience playing him continues to increase. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Things we looked at but aren't changing in 9.7** \r\n\r\n* Aftershock - We'd like to make some changes to Aftershock and did explore some for 9.7. We've pulled those but plan to come back to it soon. Conclusion was we need a bit more testing time to nail down what approach is best. Something that became clear pretty quickly when assessing different options was that we didn't have a clearly enough defined and agreed on audience target (who uses it really well, who uses it moderately well, who shouldn't consider it as an option). That'll be one of our next steps as a result. \r\n* Vayne - At time of writing we're still debating whether or not we should hit Vayne in 9.7 though probably won't. Power wise our take is she's on the border of needing a nerf, but not clearly over it. Direction we'd look at first if nerfing would be bringing down her ult power somewhat.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**A few tips for applying for game dev jobs**\r\n\r\nWe recently advertised some design roles on LoL which were mentioned both here and on Twitter. Thanks to everyone who applied, we got a lot of people we're really excited to talk to from that process. One piece of follow up I wanted to touch on was a few suggestions for anyone looking apply for such jobs, whether at Riot or elsewhere in the industry. \r\n\r\n1. Have a cover letter. A good resume's helpful but won't necessarily help someone clearly identify what makes you stand out from other applicants. That's particularly important for entry level design roles that tend to get a lot of people applying (we got hundreds this time for example).\r\n\r\n2. Make sure your resume is concise and easy to read. Think in particular about whether everything on it really justifies the space it takes up or whether you'd rather trim out some secondary points so the reader focuses on the key things.\r\n\r\n3. Tailor your cover letter and resume to both the job you're applying for and the industry. If you're looking to get into games for example giving context on games hobby projects or clubs you've been involved in makes sense. A resume with a stated goal of 'become a successful biochemist' by contrast gives the impression you weren't interested enough in this particular role to adjust your documents for it. Biochemistry's a role we'd be open to but we're much less likely to talk to a candidate when it looks like they just recycled an old application for a different job.\r\n\r\n4. Show people game stuff you've worked on. Links to places people can examples of small games you've made, mods you've contributed to, your college's LoL club etc can make a real difference. Talking about those things in a cover letter helps, demonstrations of them are stronger again though.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Rouge","date":"2019-03-27T16:01:42.990+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hello Meddler!\n\nI would really like to get your input as to the W mechanic removal Syndra received a couple patches ago. You can see a video of the mechanic in the Syndra mains reddit.\n\nThe mechanic had been there for more than a year and was an important part of her combos. It was a pretty big hit on Syndra mains.\n\nI made a detailed post on your Gameplay Thoughts of March 13th. \n\nTl dr, the proposed suggestion to somewhat offset the mechanic removal would be to increase her W1 range (W **grab**) on **spheres only**, while keeping her W2 range (W **throw**) the same.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-03-27T16:07:58.553+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, my apologies, I've been meaning to find the time to look into this but haven't had a chance yet.

It basically increased her W grab range and her W throw speed (throwing from the location of the sphere instead of coming back to Syndra) when W'ing a sphere during a QE combo. Note that, when done properly, the damage of the Q and the E from the combo still went through, as well as the stun, before the W damage coming in (procs electro).\n\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f8eiOfKGtk)\n\nIt became a very important part of her combo pattern for Syndra mains, and it felt really bad for it to be randomely taken out without warning (to be fair, it was a bug, but an interesting one).\n\nThe W1 range increase on spheres would still make the combo slower than with that bug, but it would be a nice implementation of part of the mechanic.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-03-27T23:47:42.564+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, put a little time into this, assumptions:\n\n1. Desire here is to be able grab a sphere from further away as was previously possible before the recent bug fix.\n2. That enables safer trading, in particular the ability to trigger electrocute when there aren't units around to throw or other Spheres than the one that just got knocked away?\n\nIncreasing grab range for Spheres only does indeed allow that, though it has to be pushed pretty meaningfully to feel really smooth (~300-400 units based off a quick bit of testing I think). Can see the feel improvements that offers, pretty hesitant to make such a change though. Giving Syndra safer harass in ways that are likely better optimized at low ping and in high MMR, even if the total power in question is slight, is the opposite of how we'd want to nudge her. She's not Ryze level of challenging to balance for average players and pros, but she does have some degree of balance issues in terms of meeting needs of both audiences and wouldn't want to exacerbate any further.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tobykachu","date":"2019-03-27T16:04:15.920+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":12,"body":"Not nerfing aftershock but nerfing Sylas and Lissandra seems completely ludacris to me.

Maybe I'm missing something because I'm definitely no pro at game design or anything like that, but it seems kind of backwards to work on the individual champions first when you already acknowledge that aftershock is part of the problem, you just don't know for sure in which champions. It is even making more work for yourself too; instead of messing with aftershock and then just adjusting champions accordingly, you are not adjusting champions, then messing with aftershock, then adjusting champions again.\n\nIn my opinion, it seems you're being a little too careful. It has been a long long time since League has had a big bomb drop in the meta. I think it would be cool to see a major thing like aftershock tweaked, then the rest of the game balanced accordingly. Although, maybe big bombs create a lot of work too.

In my opinion the champion requires a nerf. Especially because it seems to easy to stack conq on her and I guess everyone is going to say that Riven isn't so easy to play but since the conq change and the new item(spear of sojin), they are making her kind of very consistent in every perspective. I am a Diamond player and since I reached diamond every single game I am matched to her. I am not crying just to say \"oh, always this Riven\" but I think the champion has a strong kit and it synergises to well. I don't know much about balacing, but I see her more problematic, as soon as she hits lvl 6 and she easily just one shots you.

The point of his comment comes from the belief that, in his experience, it feels a lot easier to dominate a game as Jinx than it does as Vayne, being someone who plays both champions and frequently plays against both.\n\nThat's a sentiment that I personally share. Winning as Jinx just feels cheap to me right now (her AS steroids are insane; having more AS innately with only an {{item:3031}} just feels flat out unfair on both ends now that it gives 80 AD, and to my knowledge, the only champion that can match her AS with a raw IE rush is {{champion:18}}, who doesn't keep it up permanently).\n\nWinning as Vayne also feels pretty cheap (Botrk Rageblade PD makes me feel legitimately unkillable, especially since I like to build Death's Dance), but it doesn't feel like it kicks in until later on in the game.\n\nIf it were up to me, I'd revert the Q CD changes Vayne got in prior patches, or tone them down (no more Q refund during ult, or make the Q refund scale based on ult rank, as well Q CD going back to 6 seconds rank 1 instead of 4 seconds), revert Silver Bolt's damage back to 4-12% (from 4-14%), and give her AS scaling back (4% per level instead of 3.3%). (Not all of these at once, but pick your poison for what you think is the best idea)\n\n I would also slightly tone down Jinx's level 1 HP slightly in exchange for HP/level (she has the same level 1 HP as Dr. Mundo and Darius) so that her early game is slightly more punishable, while allowing her to keep her mid/late game strength.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"D4M2X0","date":"2019-03-27T18:12:41.506+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"thoughts on tank items being unviable to the point bruisers build full damage (while bruiser items continue to get buffed) while tanks are rarely picked, have a weak laning phase, have shitty items and fall off latgame?\n\nthoughts on {{champion:236}} {{champion:67}} being pick/ban for months and occasionally ruining toplane?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sad Robot Amumu","date":"2019-03-27T16:19:46.791+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good morning Meddler!\n\nI'd like to hear your thoughts on support subclasses.

She's is HORRIBLE to play. It's not fucking fun at all to require your jungler to babysit or risk losing first blood, first turret, and at least 3 kills before she hits level 11.\n\nLike, I totally understand her late game is heinously strong. But you really suffer hard to get to it, and it's completely frustrating as a player. Your own champion shouldn't be frustrating to play against _when you're playing the game with them._ You have overdone it WAYY too much with the weak early/god mode late and while it theoretically works for Kai'Sa and Vayne (I say theoretically, but their early/mids are nowhere near as fetal as Kayle's), the bot laners have supports who can protect them and fill in their gaps early on to make sure they make it to late game. A solo laner DOES NOT HAVE THIS LUXURY and it's a style of gameplay that absolutely is malfunctional in Kayle's home lane of Top. \nFurthermore, other hypercarries come online when they get specific items built, and the timing of this can be manipulated by doing well or doing worse. Kayle AGAIN does not have this luxury, since her godmode hypercarry status is locked to her levels, which cannot be manipulated. \n\nHer kit needs to be completely rebalanced. Her late needs some of it's power stripped so that her early game isn't so frustrating for the person playing Kayle. Need I remind you that she is _one of the beginner champions?_ Her difficulty curve as a 450 BE champion shouldn't be remotely close to this kind of absurdity. She needs a smoother transition to her hypercarry mode, and she needs to be able to functionally defend herself and her lane without praying that the enemy has an aneurysm while they're shoved under her turret.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velasan","date":"2019-03-27T18:14:23.209+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any update on if there will be any upcoming Swain changes?

Comparing tanks to relatively fragile characters, the latter will get a much more efficient use out of aftershock because they can normally be focussed down whereas tanks don't. \n\nI would argue it's worth to change how aftershock grants survivability (like removing part of the flat resistances for %bonus resist scaling, or a partial shield similar to but less powerful than CotC, so that it makes shield bash a better rune for less shield-heavy tanks), as well as moving some of it's defensive power into it's offensive power (this makes trades feel less useless into aftershock for sustain-heavier matchups). \n\nSomething like: \nResistances from 70-120 to 20-50 resist + 50% bonus resistance for defense\nDamage from 10-120 + 3% max hp + 15% bAD + 10% AP -> 40-120 + 7.5% bonus HP\n\nPossibly interesting to increase the cooldown to say 60 seconds and make it akin to Arcane comet where every time you apply CC, the cooldown goes down, so that heavy CC tanks (like nautilus) are better with it than single CC divers (like pantheon). \n\n---\n\nAlso, smaller note as a Renekton main: The bugfixes and returning cancels were nice a thanks for that. As a follow-up, will the seemingly mandatory-ness of Spear of Shojin (in terms of carry-potential) be adressed in favor of maybe some early game power. It feels weird that Renekton suddenly became more of a lategame threat than an early game bully. In fact, there's very few lanes that we can actively bully these days, especially with ranged champions abusing kleptomancy, dealing damage while also becoming extremely tanky and safe.

(As a fourth option in the Resolve tree) I think some tanks really would benefit from it, looking at the fact that there is so much true dmg in the game to which pure resistance stats are not as useful against as shields or raw hp.

I realize even if you guys do changes may not go but we'd like to talk very much. We know Talon as winrate/balance is in a good state, but we don't enjoy much when playing him because of reason we talked over there.

Why don't we see some champions get buffed who haven't been touched in a while or who you just don't see in games anymore? Why is it that when one of these champions who was really strong for awhile gets nerfed they get rebuffed so soon?

You reduced her use of q in lane by half which against almost all mid laners makes it impossible to win against. I've been playing her for 5 seasons straight and went against someone who I could usually stand against (viktor) and couldn't handle the difference. Having it almost half the time COOLDOWN6/5.25/4.5/3.75/3 seconds ⇒ 10/8.5/7/5.5/4 seconds makes her almost unusable in lane even with a cooldown spec. This was a bit much since her entire laning phase is determinant upon her q.\n\nKeeping this in mind what you have done is nerfed her laning power in half. I don't know any champion in the game where their power in lane should be halved, this is almost similar to what you did to rengar in season 3, hopefully you can avoid that..","replies":[]},{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2019-03-30T02:24:00.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meddler: Regarding Shyvana -\n\nPlease fix her passive to scale with Elder Dragons.\n\nAlso,I really think that they neglected to change W scaling to total AD (rather than bonus AD) when they removed the AP scaling from it.
