The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up:\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Simple ARAM balance changes every few patches**\r\n\r\nAs you might have seen we had some simple balance adjustments for ARAM in 9.10. Our current thinking is that that's something we'll be doing every few patches. Changes will be simple stuff like % damage up or down, with one of the core goals being that a champion's playstyle, timings etc don't change significantly between maps (e.g. avoiding changes to spell CDs, CC durations, dash ranges etc). \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**State of some champs in 9.10**\r\n\r\nNow that 9.10 has been out for a bit short thoughts on a range of champs:\r\n\r\n* Yuumi \r\n\r\nWas looking weak enough on release we got a micropatch buff out for her quickly. Waiting to see where that puts her  in combination with the expected learning curve. Most likely we'll hold off until making any other changes this week at least then reassess after the weekend. \r\n\r\n* Yi\r\n\r\nLooks a bit weaker in average skill games and a bit weaker again in high skill games. Increasing the delta between his performance in those two contexts wasn't a goal so we're monitoring how that goes. Want to give it a bit of time to see how players adapt to the changes though before making any assumptions, given a number of optimizations have changed.\r\n\r\n* Rageblade Users\r\n\r\nGenerally don't seem to have been excessively affected by the changes from what we've seen so far. Kog's probably the most impacted, but even then's still doing reasonable. Not immediate compensation changes planned as a result.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**Wukong Changes on PBE**\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback so far on the Wukong changes that hit PBE earlier this week. Overall perception seems to be positive, seeing some good suggested areas for improvement too. Will likely be a revised version on PBE sometime next week as a result. \r\n\r\nAs a reminder these changes are a prototype, not something that could be ready to go live shortly. They'll be on PBE for around 4 weeks, then they'll be taken off and we'll figure out whether to commit to making a more polished version of them or not.","replies":[{"poster":"GaliÃ¶","date":"2019-05-17T14:24:25.942+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just up extra early today or did you watch MSI?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-05-17T14:37:40.454+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"These days I get up whenever my daughter decides to wake up (newborn).

Guessing that's not the one though...\n\nHello Meddler! \nI just want kick off this post by saying I had around 2k + games on Ryze pre 2016 rework, after his last major update my enjoyment for this champion slowly dwindled away.  \n\nNow the issues stemmed from the poke-to-click burst mage aspect of his kit, Ryze should have NEVER got a \"complete\" rework however he did, and now he is just a living meme amongst the community.  Riot somehow turned a learning champion into one of the most complex champions in League of Legends, what I could not understand was if Annie can exist in 2019 why can't pre 2016 Ryze?  Obviously there was many issues with Ryze's old kit I cannot argue that one, however he had this unique experience that I will never forget.  \n\nNow I'm just going to throw out some suggestions of how Riot could have maybe balanced his old design.\n\n#1 -  Make Ryzes (Q) have stacks, each stack adds extra damage towards (R) desperate power similar to Nasus Q.\n\n#2 - Remove point to click snare, replace with skill shot snare (?) I'll leave blank for design team to figure out.\n\n#3 - flux? Ok! the new flux wasn't a bad idea, to spread you need to re-cast (makes senses) I can actually see this part working into Ryzes old kit.\n\n\nNow the Issues I had with the rework Ryze were his ultimate, it's situational and it really can only be used in though's rare games,  his learning curve is obviously way to overwhelming for any new player and I cannot see many of them wanting to learn or fully master his kit.  \n\nIf I had a time machine, and I could rewind back the clock to season 4 and only play in that time era I would.  {{champion:74}}\n\n I'm always open to further discussion in the future if Riot ever needs a veteran players input towards Ryze.\n\nFoRFiTz","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2019-05-17T16:38:44.419+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Know you can't comment on it but my guess is Ult is being changed?

Tricksters are assasins, with huge outplay potential and mobility [check{{champion:7}} an dash 2 times, and go back to same spot 2 times{{champion:35}} stealth that works as gap closer/dodge skillshots, W can trap/trick enemies, R can outplay any incoming damage]\n\n5) Wu lost a lot of damage, and doens't have any source of reliable [hybrid damage/true damage/ % damage] that would allow him to sacrifice building damage and go for defensive items, even with the 20% armor shred on his Passive, its still bad, since he lost 10% comparing to the previous Q\n\n6) Now you save W in hopes you deal damage in case someone tried to duel, cant work as an assassin or you will lose high damage output, cant be sneaky anymore [part of why he's not a trickster atm]\n\n7)  No CC at all, you cant contest with bruisers who can {{champion:92}} stun-knockyou up, {{champion:266}} many knockups and zoning spell, {{champion:24}} deny AA damage which W is heavily reliable on right now, and stun you, etc, All what wu got now is 1 second knockup on lvl 6.\n\nDo you know exactly what might change in Wukong's kit next week?\nand is there a possibility to shift wukong from bruiser to assassin and make him more like a trickster, by voting at least.","replies":[{"poster":" SeÃ±or Hot Buns","date":"2019-05-17T16:07:08.844+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't say 'we'.

I mean all those projectiles that she supposedly should become untargetable to.\n\nAlso yuumi needs to be able to cancel her R as there are times that yuumi miss-aligns her R and there is no point in staying unable to throw the Q or AA.\n\nAdditionally yuumi Q needs to have the projectile start slightly away form the ally and not directly under their feet as in many occasions if an ally is standing close to a minion yuumi can't fire her Q in any direction or it will straight hit the minion.\n\nThere is also an issue with her idle animation when attached. When that happens it makes the player unable to use any animations ctrl 1 2 â¦ until detached.\n\nAlso potentialy yuumi might need to get some range on her detatch and a increased speed at wich she detaches into an AA as well as additional 50 to 100 range on her passive AA.\n\nBut the most important one that i mentioned is obviously the first one with her W.

I tought you will give it in this patch... Its so long time without our lovely Nexus Blitz! 2 months? lol\n\nActually, the thing what was making Nexus Blitz so enjoyable is that how dynamic and short game was (simillar to URF), and these random events. IMO Nexus Blitz was the first ever gamemode with pure fun gameplay - no competitive. First time I experienced that feel while first URF was published. But still NB is giving more fun for more time than URF what was nice but not for too long, after some time URF is boring because of seeing the same OP broken champs again and again. \nPlease guys, lest do something and add again finally this awesome mode, IMO its the best gamemode released since 2013!!! Lets let it grow!","replies":[]},{"poster":"hyperherb","date":"2019-05-17T18:41:37.031+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is anything planned for Udyr ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"AIQ","date":"2019-05-17T14:31:52.143+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Shyvana is on the rework list, but even if she was to win, (which I doubt unfortunately and you most likely already know the result)...  \n\n...can she still get her Elder dragon scaling since it's still in 2020 and these are small QOL changes.\n\nAlso can she  gain fury while dead since shes the only champion that can't get her ult cooldown while dead. \n\nAnd lastly for her W, can we remove the decay and change the scaling more in favor for then AD/bruiser Shyvana?\n\nThanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Altarious","date":"2019-05-17T13:52:22.029+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi Meddler, first of all i know Ryze is delicated topic considering his presence in pro-play but, do you think he needs any changes done to his Kit or do you have any changes planned for him?\nThank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kadexe","date":"2019-05-17T14:11:03.658+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you're investigating ways to fix Master Yi's 'delta', then please read my post on the subject.
