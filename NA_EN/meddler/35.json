The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**Our thinking on jungle at present**\n\nGoing for a deep dive on some of our jungle thinking for this post. Looking back at last year, and at some of the feedback I got earlier in the week about these posts, one thing that stood out was a feeling that at times they&#039;ve become a bit too focused on what we&#039;re doing, versus why we&#039;re doing it and what else we&#039;re thinking. Going to try and get back to a better balance in that regard as a result.\n\n> First off, a run through of the changes we&#039;re currently looking at for 9.2:\n\nCamp scaling\n\n* General Camps : Experience scales to 150% &gt;&gt;&gt; Experience scales to 125%\n* Buff Camps : Experience scales to 157% &gt;&gt;&gt; Experience scales to 125%\n* Scuttle Crab : Gold and Experience Scales to Double base value &gt;&gt;&gt; Scales to 180% of base value \n\nChilling Smite\n\n*  Damage : 28-164 (20 + 8 * Level) &gt;&gt;&gt; 20-156 (12 + 8 * Level) \n\nChallenging Smite\n\n* Damage Per Tick :: 20-54 &gt;&gt;&gt; 19-42\n* Damage Total :: 60-162 &gt;&gt;&gt; 57-125\n* DoT Duration :: 3 seconds &gt;&gt;&gt; 2 seconds\n* No longer grants vision for the mark duration\n\n> Why those changes?\n\nFirst off, we believe that jungling&#039;s influence, in most MMR bands, is too high. Given how much control junglers have over the early game in particular we don&#039;t believe they should bringing quite as much damage as they currently are, nor that they should on average be keeping pace, or as close as they are, to solo laners in XP. Looking back a number of years junglers tended to be around, or slightly above, a team&#039;s marksman XP wise. We&#039;ve increased the gold and XP available to junglers pretty meaningfully over time and, while we certainly don&#039;t think they should be as far below solos as they used to be we do believe we&#039;ve pushed a bit too far. Similarly on the Smite upgrade side of things those spells were originally balanced around junglers having less gold/xp, with the upgrades therefore needing to deliver more power than we believe they should today. Reducing their damage is also part of a larger push to cut some unnecessary or excessive damage, probably from non kit sources in particular, that we&#039;re working on at the moment as well. More on that soon (hopefully next week). \n\nThe XP reduction is something we also made some changes to try and address in preseason (8.23). We didn&#039;t want to swing too hard, especially with the holiday break coming up, so erred on the side of what we thought were good but conservative reductions. In retrospect those were significantly below the mark they needed to be to get enough movement.\n\n> Other potential jungle changes\n\nWe&#039;re also looking at a couple of other possible jungle focused changes, though don&#039;t have a specific timeframe on them. The first is getting some form of utility alternative to Chilling/Challenging Smite back in. We removed Tracker&#039;s Knife last year because the impact it had on strategy/macro play was creating a lot of problems, including very conservative organized play and pressure on the effective pool of junglers. Its lack does leave a gap though we&#039;d like to fill in terms of the Smite upgrade choices offered. What we&#039;ve been trying so far is a Smite upgrade that gives you a brief shield and movement speed increase. That&#039;s showing some promise, but isn&#039;t there yet. Not sure at present if we&#039;ll go that route or a different one.\n\nThe second thing we&#039;d like to look at is the variation in effectiveness of junglers between pro and regular play. Our take is that jungle influence in pro (and likely other high MMR organized 5s play) is meaningfully lower than solo queue. That&rsquo;s not to say junglers are neccessarily weak in pro, but the difference does creates some additional challenges balancing champs, items etc for both contexts. That&#039;s due to pro play having a lot more coordination/communication (making it easier to track junglers and play around them), buffs getting handed off to laners much more in pro, more tendency to have laners, strongly multiplicative scaling ones especially, take more regular jungle camps. It&rsquo;s quite likely that in particular we put work into how jungle buffs work and pain points around keeping/handing them off, though we don&rsquo;t have specific directions identified yet. \n\n> What about X?\n\nLevel 2 ganks?\n\n* We&#039;re seeing a range of viable junglers at all MMRs, some of whom have strong level 2 gank patterns, some of whom don&#039;t. There are certainly some champs that do feel out of line at level 2 and we&#039;re looking at their jungling power as a result (e.g. Camille and Xin). We believe the issue here&#039;s individual problem cases, rather than early ganks being a possibility. \n\nSignificance of Scuttle Crab?\n\n* Similarly we&#039;re seeing a range of good against scuttle and weaker against scuttle champs as strong picks at present. Something we&#039;re looking at at present though is whether intended fall back paths for those not contesting scuttles are sufficiently rewarding (e.g. Red to Krugs). We don&#039;t believe safe play that doesn&#039;t require interaction with other players should be as valuable as riskier play, so don&#039;t want the gap to get too narrow, but are looking into whether it&#039;s got a little wide or not right now.\n* Separate to how much scuttle crab does or doesn&rsquo;t influence which champions are effective in the jungle is sentiment we see from a number of junglers that they just don&rsquo;t want to have to play around scuttle crab as much as is optimal at present. Can entirely understand that point of view. At the same time we believe keeping a fairly high focus on objectives in neutral spaces gives a lot of benefits in terms of healthy interaction, skill expression, risk/reward trade offs etc. \n\n\nJungler pressure/gank threat\n\n* Gank frequency/early jungle pressure&#039;s an issue on our radar too.  At present we want to see where lowered damage, likely nerfs to very dominant early gankers and reduced camp scaling leave things then assess how pressure&rsquo;s looking. Do agree that jungle threat on lanes can be a bit too constricting at present however.\n\nPowerfarming and camp respawn rate\n\n* A  request we see crop up quite a bit is for faster jungle camp respawns, usually with the goals of making powerfarming stronger and adding more cost to ganks. That&#039;s something we did do a bunch of testing on middle of last year. Our conclusion was that there wasn&#039;t much room at all to adjust however before chain farming became clearly optimal. The high strength of powerfarmers already at low and average MMR bands (Jax, Yi, Udyr etc) makes adjustments more difficult again, given in that context it&#039;s already the most effective playstyle statistically at least. \n\n\nX jungle enchantment needs to be changed\n\n* We&#039;re seeing a pretty good spread of users over the four jungle enchantments at present, including champs who are reasonably able to choose between multiples splitting their usage, including between offensive and defensive (Cinderhulk) choices. Bloodrazor is a bit on the narrow side though. It&#039;s got a group of core users, they&#039;re comparatively small however and its usage drops off hard in really high MMR. There&#039;s also been some long running feeling that Warrior&#039;s just not satisfying/interesting compared to the other three in terms of offering something more than just stats. No current plans to prioritize work on either of those items to address, given amount we&#039;re focused on things like crit itemization, systemic damage, general balance at present. Whenever we next end up doing a jungle item pass would want to consider addressing those points though certainly. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n**Baron Buff and Inhib Tower Scaling**\n\nMentioning this since not sure if it&#039;s been spotted on PBE yet. We&#039;re making a couple of adjustments to how baron buff and inhib tower stats in 9.2. Baron Buff&#039;s going to start a bit weaker at the 20 minute mark and then scale to the same point, so that a really early baron isn&#039;t quite as dominant (12-48 AD and 20-80 AP instead of 24-48 and 40-80, 50-70% minion DR instead of flat 70%). Inhib towers are going to have 70 Armor/MR all the time instead of scaling from 55-70 between minutes 31-45, making them slightly tankier almost all the time in the average game. \n\n \nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Methylxanthines","date":"2019-01-11T18:17:16.437+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey Meddler,\n\nHave you guys decided if the crit item changes will be in 9.2 or if they're getting pushed back to 9.3? \n\nAlso, I wanted to say this is the best QGT in a while.

Some risk of course of unintentionally removing them entirely while trying to make them a bit weaker but still present, we think we can probably find a middle ground though.\n\nIs the issue of how low risk lv2 ganks are going to be addressed? Currently the fact that the lv2 gank guarantees 1-2 scuttlers due to the created priority to the ganked lane AND has overall low risk due to how much exp scuttler gives compared to 2 camps with the amount of time used. Junglers don't feel that they are \"expressing their skill\" when all it comes down to is who gains a stronger lv2 jungler and has a priority midlane pick. Another factor is that the scuttler is randomized with the side they spawn to, creating an efficient jungle path and ganking accordingly or pathing a certain way for a gank is completely thrown out the window if a scuttler spawns on the opposing side, this being simply because of how much scuttler gives exp for the time used for the camp.\n\nCurrently most junglers feel like the problems with ganking pressure is stemming from the snowball effect of even a failed gank giving you priority in lanes for taking scuttlers, thus you snowball your exp lead from scuttlers, and not from farming efficiently or ganking efficiently. Because of this junglers feel like their \"skill expression\" is being denied because just an inefficient gank is enough to a lane to build up a lead from scuttlers.\n\nOnly way I see lv2 ganks being actually risky is delaying scuttler spawn so you have to farm lv3 in the jungle or doing a normal invade. The reason why lv2 ganking even became a thing was because of the exp nerfs to reaching lv3, making scuttler far more lucrative choice for pathing and ganking lv2 became the norm because the scuttlers become far more guaranteed from it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BadgerDrool","date":"2019-01-11T17:51:35.487+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Commenting on gap between safe jungle patterns vs crab control:\n\nMy issue is that the gap between fallback and scuttle is multiplicative on how many times you miss scuttle. So whatever gap exists isn't just a first clear issue but an entire game issue.\n\nSometimes an enemy jungler gets enough of a lead they can just walk into your jungle and take things from in front of you. If your laners don't rotate you have to let them have it. This feels _terrible_. It is also fairly rare.\n\nScuttle feels like that fairly often. All the time if you are playing a  jungler that loses too much from contesting. It feels especially terrible if it's so dangerous you need to retreat from a started crab _and_ suffer a risk of being followed after. Lower ELOs don't help ward jungle entrances and crabs often happen mid first clear. So the results of being \"ganked\" at krugs can feel pretty tilting.\n\nTo me, it feels like if you give up crab you should at least have some safety in return. However, you can _lose_ safety as a result of enemy regaining resources (health/mana), mobility (speed boost), and a lead.\n\nYeah this is an issue that is compensated for in higher ELOs due to more potential teamwork punishing overly aggressive map positioning. However, Scuttle's baseline design is very win more for the person taking it. With any potential gap growing larger and larger the more coverage of Scuttle the enemy has.\n\nI'm not sure on an exact solution. I'd find it interesting if Scuttle gave some \"both teams\" vision temporarily or some similar trade off that makes it easier for the \"safe\" jungler to achieve greater safety when they give up Scuttle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThornyZyra","date":"2019-01-11T17:37:18.933+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Were you thinking about changing/reworking Zyra so she could be balanced around mid as she was meant to at the beginning? \nIs the [E] dmg nerf the only thing you're testing on her rn?

Everything else seems fine. The problematic Junglers aren't scaling in to monsters, they're ganking at level two because they have no competition. Then they gank every lane with impunity, then take that gold lead from NOT DOING THE JUNGLE then buy items to easily do the Jungle and gank more. This strangles the Jungle pool because other Junglers cannot compete with them and get involved in a 2v2 or 3v3, they cannot contest Scuttle either. They can't power farm because it doesn't give them a meaningful advantage. I'm fine with your assessment on power farming but something else needs to give and *nerfing* Jungle XP is the opposite of what you need. The opposite.\n\nYou say Junglers have too much XP but why am I *always* level 4 when midlaners are level 6? Top laners only need a few more seconds to be 6. I *might* hit 5 when they hit 6. At this point bot is lvl 3 and will hit 4 before I hit 5. This is a trend that continues throughout the game where the Jungler has a small window of level advantage over the freaking **duo** lane. Imo this is fine, but you're going to ruin it.\n\nWhat's worse is when I see a top laner run over the game and it's not possible for a Jungler to compete. I've been farming my Jungle normally but the top laner is still 2-3 levels ahead of me. It's kind of disgusting.\n\nI still think Conservation was the best thing you guys ever did to the Jungle items. Maybe you can do that with XP too. Or maybe in a similar but still different form.

If adcs had an exclusive item to prevent dmg even for just 1.5 seconds I think the game could be totally fine. \n\nStormrazor is an Item with it's own caliber... You gave it to us as a \"compensation\" for losing crit power spikes to compete with burst mages or assassins. (The only actual method for an adc to defend himself against those) \n\nOfc adc's should not outclass any other class from early - lategame but the big problem is adcs get one shot in early and one shot in late. \nSo the main problem for so many ADC's is basicly \"why should I play ADC (which now has consistent dps instead of burst + consistent dps)\" when I don't have the chance to deal consistent dps, since everyone (even some tanks) are just one shotting me with a jump + 1-2 Spells\".\n\nLeague became a really fast paced game with all the long jumps or dashes and other movement abilities and some spells dealing obviously 2x more damage than they should do. I'm not trying to blame you for this neither i think this is bad for the game, but having a role who has no tool to prevent themself from that dmg is bad especially when nearly every assassin has a huge dmg point&click ability (Kha'Zix Q, Rengar Q, Nocturne Ult, Shaco invis autohit Q), those don't require any skills besides having working hands and eyeballs. \n\nThe point here is, if ADCs had something like Zhonyas or an Edge of Night which provides not only the stats you need in your offensive but also acts as a defensive tool for dmg prevention the role would be instantly viable again. \n\nMy Problem with Stormrazor is explained in the text above but here again. I have an Item that gives me 1 critcal autohit, and there is the problem, after this one autohit it loses 50% of it's gold value until it is up again. Not only that it loses so much power after the first hit but also the critical dmg is only 140% until you have another item which increases your actual critical strike chance. So the Item doesnt only lose half it's value after 1 autohit in a fight but also is missing 60% Crit dmg value until you spend another 2.5k+ gold. \nAt the point where an adc has his Stormrazor an assassin already has either a duskblade or a yomuus which both dont lose half their power after 1 spell/auothit and dont need another item until it reaches it's full potencial. \nSo why exactly should I buy an item like this? 2 Reasons!\n1. The perma stats you gain from the item are extremely cost efficent.\n2. Because you will lose your lane if you don't buy it. In lane you have the time to poke enemies slowly down over a couple of minutes or force them to back,  In teamfights this item loses nearly 100% of it's value after the first autoattack since once the teamfight goes on you need to autohit more than once. Ofc I can stand back and wait for the proc to come up again but this would make ANY adc (except jhin) just a bad poke champ, therefore I could play ezreal since he is an actual poke adc. \n\nI'm not even a main ADC and I dislike the state of ADCs at the moment. It just doesnt feel like a fair fight if I play an assassin or bruiser with either so many defensive tools like Steraks Gage or just a one shot against someone who can't do anything about it (not even heal since the heal amount is laughable against ignite or even the burst of an assassin or dual MP Mage).\n\nI hope my points make somewhat sense to you devs and you find a good solution for adcs.\nAnyone else trolling under the comment, you have no power in here!","replies":[]},{"poster":"UncleB3N11","date":"2019-01-13T03:53:56.195+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Meddler,\n\nI am sorry but I deeply disagree with the changes. as it stands in your post. I think the changes you are going to do. it's going to hurt both solo/duo and competitive Junglers.\n I think the junglers are on decent place in terms of how much they can influence the game. But they are weak in terms of  level and gold compare to solo lanes.\n \nWithout good laners junglers are useless or slowly become irrelevant through the game. ( Does matter if you camp bad player, you won't gain anything but get behind.)\n\nLet me start that might be the case what u describes in master+. and higher but rest of the Elo special from gold 2+ laners both top and mid just invades u at level 6 with ignite & ult ready (but most case ult is enough) and then you  just die to them. Of course you can just go away or ping for help but when your lanes are 15-20 cs behind 1.5 waves is crashing on their tower, they won't come. And from that moment on lane will snowball harder and they  will start to take more and more camps from you (specially when they took the first tower.)  Not even mentioning when your teammates who are behind they find it useful to taker your camps as well your own team mates think its good idea to taker jgler camps( so stupid).\n\nare you srsly complaining about level 2 ganks? 90% of time it's easily avoidable with well place ward at minute 1;30, and even than there are the summer spells... \n\nMaking jgler less effective. It's joke.

Jglers in completive play already like 2nd support role, that would even makes the role weaker competitive. \n\nYou nerfing JGL items???? is it a joke as well again ? when such summoners and items exist like ignite, BORK and GUNBLADE. when ignite does same amount of dmg at level 4 what red smite does on level 18?!!!! \n\nIn my option, **Jungle CAMPS ARE NOT OP FOR JUNGLERS BUT  it is the  for LANERS**. You said, it's hard to balance jungle camps around junglers when they can just pass the camp to laners. then here is a solution for you.** why not nerf the jgl gold(specially) gold and exp by 50 % and give the jungle item an unique passive to increase gold by 100% in jGL?** -it means that jglers are not affected by the change in terms of gold and exp in jgl. it would fix your balancing issue immediately. Also I think you should increase the gold income of the jglers. 90% of the time have 60% of the cs of solo laners and in the mean time jgl item cost 1000 gold when sole lanes by meaning full item parts.\n\nTbh at the end it comes down to two questions.

Nailing the vision plant, at many angles,  you clear the way to gank a lane completely, or at least remove vision and increase pressure (doubled by the fact you can see the enemy's plant animations from fog/see them clear the vision). Oracles and 75g pink wards really make it easy for a jungler/support or jungler/mid combo to completely eliminate vision in the bot-side river, and around the map in general; having the limited oracles back in some form might not be bad (waiting til lv 9 is displeasing though, maybe lv 6?). You're also not going to be able to place many wards early game. Given the many, cheap, ways that you can clear out vision having limited ward quantity, only available from trinkets or for 75g (but if your laner is losing it's just going to be cleared when you leave and they've pushed the wave and 75g/back adds up), makes a losing laner easy prey for a jungler. You're gonna hate to hear it but _you should bring back green wards_ make the cap 2 or 1, whatever, but **we need more vision options** _because there are too many counter-vision options_.\n\n**If we don't match laners in XP, they can start taking smite again and we'll lose our purpose.** Don't even start with that. We need to be somewhere between ADC and solo laners; _don't make us even to solo laners, but don't let them take smite again_.\n\n~~Purple~~ smite should be about utility, you're correct. The idea you floated with the shield is actually pretty cool. Why don't we have a smite that _doesn't target champions_ already? You're literally making our jobs harder by the omission of a neutral option. It doesn't even need to be good, I'd take yellow smite as is if I could get the enchantment; having to fight character models when going for objectives is unbelievably obnoxious. White smite was awful though, and if you're making jungle harder don't expect people to counterjungle. **I honestly think red smite and blue smite doing damage is weird**, I think they should just be a utility; purple smite was awesome. The spirit items were awesome too. **Oh maybe give us the warding smite back?** That'd solve the vision issue and decrease jungle pressure _because they can always see each other_.\n\nYup, jungle balance between pro and regular play must be difficult; you guys have done well in that regard, generally. Thanks!\n\nI disagree on forcing people to contest neutral objectives on the grounds of _you're limiting play styles and that's not cool_. Ivern is never going to beat a Kha'Zix at scuttle. Some matchups are just unforgiving like that, but punishing the players for playing stuff they like _or making them play other things by forcing the meta to make the things they want to play bad_ is super uncool.\n\nThat's all!\n\nThanks if you read it all! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Guts Man","date":"2019-01-11T19:25:50.633+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler,\n\nI've asked you a question about Wukong before, and just wanted to follow up based on the changes! \n\nIt seems like he'll be experiencing some indirect nerfs, at least in the jungle (blue smite nerf as well as jungle camp nerf to his early game, tiamat gold increase in the previous patch). \n\nJust wondering if the team is keeping an eye out on him or if there are any current plans for him (AD ratio to rank 1 Q, new passive, etc).

Have you guys considered delaying the first spawn of the scuttle crabs?\n\nJunglers feel bad about fighting over a neutral objective so early into the game mostly because of 2 reasons:\n1- not all junglers have a strong level 2, which automatically disqualifies a good portion of them from being able to contest;\n2- even if they do have a strong level 2, they're still totally dependent on the laners (which isn't just a matter of lane priority, but also of cooperating we strangers, and we all know how miserable the solo queue experience can be sometime).\n\nThe biggest issue with junglers like Xin and Camille is that their level 2 strength allows them to take a unique jungle route that leaves them open to few counterplays, since, after taking their own red buff, they're able to secure both scuttle crabs and pull off a pass-through gank in mid lane, take their own blue buff and then choose whether they want to keep clearing or to gank the lane on the opposite side of their red buff.\nMeanwhile, the opposing jungler is forced to bend his/her path in order to either avoid them or be in position to countergank. The latter is obviously the riskiest option: if they're able to pull off the countergank, the game opens up for them; if they fail and the enemy Xin/Camille knows how to snowball their lead, they won't get a chance to comeback. If instead they chose to avoid them altogether, they'd still be unable to take advantage of Xin/Camille's route, because they lost both crabs and are unable to invade Xin/Camille's jungle without being spotted by the enemy team.\n\nIn my opinion, delaying the first spawn of the scuttle crabs would help lower the early game pressure of junglers in general (which is something that laners would appreciate greatly, since being ganked at minute 2 by an enemy jungler with red buff who is the same level as you is a bit oppressive) and allow for more counterplays against junglers whose early game is strong enough to easily contest scuttle crabs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velasan","date":"2019-01-11T17:48:45.931+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been jungling since I started in season 4, and a lot of this looks fine to me.  I do question the context of some of the changes though.\n\nJunglers have a strong impact in the game right now largely because of changes to first tower blood, dragons, and other objectives combined with fighters/bruisers being very strong in early and pushing out most tank junglers.   Junglers who are slow to get going, particularly those that rely on an ultimate at level 6, are not as strong as the ones that can easily run in and gank at level 2 - 3.  Tanks are gated behind the timers on resolve runes like Conditioning and building up HP with Overgrowth, and usually don't have enough damage to secure a gank that early, but it's also a problem for champions like Fiddlesticks who heavily relies on his ult.\n\nFighters and other high damage early junglers have the easiest time lvl 2 ganking (where they have the damage to succeed with the gank and not waste their time).  We saw this back when Kindred was strong, doing the level 2 gank from red buff.  I don't see any of the above as being related to red smite being too strong.  It's hard to say if even red smite or blue smite are strong in general because there are only the two options to choose from, and thus nothing to compare it against.  However, I've rarely been an instance ganking or being ganked where getting smited was the single deciding factor.\n\nThen from there with turret plating and first blood tower if a jungler sits on a lane and pushes down the turret they are getting a significant amount of gold for themselves, the ally laner, and the rest of their team.  Same goes for taking dragons.  Over time the importance of these objectives has spiked and the jungler is the one responsible for map wide macro control on those objectives.  So, it's only natural that the jungler is seeing more power in their lane because that's their job.\n\nThe scuttle was a mistake though honestly; that was never a good change.  No one enjoys have to run to opposite sides of the map for a scuttle spawn when something important is happening elsewhere, and there are already enough things to keep track of as a jungler.  It's also exceedingly rare to actually contest a scuttle.  Most junglers either just run up and instant kill it (say for example Udyr can just tiger Q + tiamat on it while stunned from bear stance or Nunu just runs into it with W and Q chomps) or you smite steal it from the enemy jungler and run away.  Times when junglers actually fight on river are not because the scuttle happens to be there, but because they were looking to fight anyways and it gives them an excuse.  As with gold on turret plating it may be a way to push a desired game state, but it does so in a heavy handed and forced way that is not fun for the player.\n\nIt would also be nice to see Baron and dragons made into a more difficult fight.  Earlier last year when it was more difficult to take for a patch felt about right.  Since the baron was changed back I've seen several people solo baron from Master Yi, to Udyr, and several others.\n\nThe jungle enchantments are in a pretty good place IMO.  Bloodrazer may not be an instant go to option, but that's largely because it's the glass cannon on hit variation and the times when you can afford to build like that in the current meta are farther between.  It's still very good as an item when you want to do that though.  I also like Warrior Enchant.  It's not exciting, but it does exactly what it is supposed to do.  If anything makes me want CDR on Cinderhulk, but after so many nerfs to that item I'd rather not take anything more away from it to make room for CDR.\n\nTy for reading.","replies":[]}]}
