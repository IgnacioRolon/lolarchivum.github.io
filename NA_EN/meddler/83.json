The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Icon Updates and Items**\r\n\r\nOne question that cropped up a bit after previous discussion on icon updates was whether we&#039;d also be updating older item icons as well. Wanted to touch on that here. We do plan on gradually updating item icons, that&#039;s somewhere we need to be a bit more careful than with champion icons though. Being able to quickly identify items on the Tab screen&#039;s pretty important and whenever we&#039;ve changed too many at once we&#039;ve seen some very understandable frustration and confusion as a result. We gradually update item icons as a result, often though not always paired with some change in functionality (e.g. the recent Abyssal and GA changes). Wouldn&#039;t want to do a mass item icon change all at once.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Updated Subclass List**\r\n\r\nFor anyone that missed it and is interested we posted an updated subclass list yesterday. Link to that below, along with a couple of threads where Statikk, myself and a few others were talking about a thinking with the changes a bit.\r\n\r\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/taking-another-look-subclasses\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/AIEmHs8v-new-classessubclasses-list\r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6d3unl/taking_another_look_at_subclasses/\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**LeBlanc**\r\n\r\nWe got a bunch of people together this week to talk LeBlanc. She&#039;s been a problematic character historically, both in terms of balance and counterplay. Recently she&#039;s also been consuming a lot of designer time without significant improvement that could have been put into other champs. We concluded that there were some core problems that would need to be addressed to put LB in a spot where she&#039;s appropriately powerful, fair enough to play against, not universally a great or poor pick etc. Estimation as to what those are below:\r\n\r\n* Her risk profile (she gets a lot of assassin traits without the degree of commitment other similar champs take on when going for a kill, both in terms of personal risk and use of long CDs)\r\n* Insufficient counterplay when played well, in particular her safety/slipperiness (combination of W, mimicked W, clones)\r\n* A strong laning early game that, when combined with the above, makes her extra dominant in high Elo and pro play.\r\n\r\nWe believe we need to do at least a small update to her as a result, not just balance work. Without some meaningful changes we expect she&#039;ll otherwise get stuck in a state where she&#039;s still dominant in certain circumstances and feels pretty bad outside of those (as a point of reference Azir has similar, though not identical, challenges). An update doesn&#039;t feel great, given we put work into her just late last year, but we do think it&#039;s necessary. It&#039;s also possible the above analysis may change once we start looking at LB in depth.  \r\n\r\nIn terms of timing, not sure yet, the above&#039;s the summary of a conversation we&#039;ve literally just had. It&#039;s possible, though not guaranteed, that we may have to make some balance adjustments to her before we can get an update in. Also not clear yet what scope of update we&#039;re looking at, whether something on the smaller side (adjustments like those to Kindred or Heimer recently) or somewhat larger (Rek&#039;Sai scope, with more significant ability changes). \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**AFK a little while**\r\n\r\nI&#039;m going to be away from work for a few days starting pretty much now (visiting New York for the first time!). Won&#039;t be able to reply much in this thread as a result, also won&#039;t be another one of these posts from me until the later half of next week.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-05-25T16:22:15.198+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":2,"body":"Any chance we could have some of the threads about the subclass list that have popped up on the front page addressed?

My suggestion is to revert Leblanc's rework, the reason for it is beucase Leblanc's main role in a teamfight is to remove their ADC or catch someone with her chain, but thats where the new Leblanc is failing, her chain can do the work but her passive is holding her back in teamfights, where she needs to wait 1,5 sec to get acces to remove their ADC and in a teamfight, there is a big chance that Leblanc is already dead at that time, so my suggestion is to revert the rework or make the passive to atleast pop instant when you through a ability, if people sees that as OP, then there is always place to adjust her damage.{{champion:7}}","replies":[{"poster":"japhib","date":"2017-05-25T19:22:40.235+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"The main goal of all the assassin reworks was to inject some time into their combos so that there's time for counterplay (shields, heals, flashing/dashing away).

Katarina used to be the same way before her first rework replaced her W with an AoE ability specifically to enable her to farm minions waves easily.\n\nLB (and old Kat) was a massive balance issue back in the day because she was an assassin - i.e. an extremely item-reliant class that live or die on their gold income - that was very bad at farming and thus was at huge risk for having low gold income and being totally useless. The only way to offset this was to give her insanely high kill potential in lane so she could try and farm early kills until she got enough AP to farm minions properly. As you can imagine, this made a skilled LB a nightmare in lane and a LB that was denied early kills a total joke.\n\nFor the assassin update, Riot specifically wanted to ensure that LB could farm properly like other mages so they could tune down her early kill potential without making her completely unplayable. Having decent to good wave-clear gives LB a fallback pattern so she isn't completely screwed if she doesn't score a kill or two in the first 10 minutes. The power to clear waves comes directly from her power to assassinate with no/few items so it is easier to deny her kills and gives her opponents more breathing room in lane.\n\nIf you remove her wave-clear, that power will only go back to her kill potential so she can farm champions in lane instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Vouloir Oublier","date":"2017-05-26T03:00:13.670+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol I remember those days, one time I was so fed that all I had to do was q them once wait a little bit then qr and it killed them instantly from 3/4 hp","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ganked By Tilt","date":"2017-05-25T16:32:02.041+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Any plans for Diana? i know she's part of the diver update but small buffs would help now","replies":[{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2017-05-26T05:06:24.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Does she need buffs?
