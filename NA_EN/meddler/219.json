I'm not sure they do actually rely on their teammates more (as far as win loss goes), it just feels worse for an ADC to not get the help they need: When a tank initiates well but their team doesn't follow up, at least the tank did their job well.

I've seen a number of posts complaining about ADC burst.\n\nI would say the current Varus build(rageblade/bork/witsend/hurricane) is pretty healthy. You need sometime to fully build rageblade stacks for your best DPS and much of the damage is %health based. So it's good enough to kill tanks/big bruisers fast enough while not being able to burst squishes --- which is what I would say the role of marksmen is --- sustained damage.\n\n>Are you still considering crit rework later this year?\n \nIMO they should **nerf/change/remove crit in a gradual process**, starting with reducing the unneeded magic damage burst from statik/RFC right now. But compensation will be given to marksmen by giving them **more/buff items that deal damage based on max health/bonus health/bonus armor penetration**. This way they will only be nerfed in their squishy killing speed, but will have the same/higher speed of killing tanks, since this is their purpose after all.\n\n> I'm not sure they do actually rely on their teammates more (as far as win loss goes), it just feels worse for an ADC to not get the help they need\n\nIt is both. \n\n1) It feels worse because you just get deleted.  Other roles at least get to brawl it out longer with higher stats(win or lose). You just don't get to play league of legends as an instantly dead ADC.\n\n2) ADCs have no agency in decision making so they cannot affect the game in anyway other than doing tons of damage in teamfights and carrying from there(they can do this well right now because of the support role's hidden power --- two roles' influence gets added together and manifested in the ADC killing people fast in teamfights). Most other roles can do other things to affect the outcome of a match outside of teamfights only --- roaming/ganking, dueling/splitpushing, catching/initiating.\n\nEDIT: Consolidated my posts into one and made corrections","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Frozen Diva","date":"2018-02-07T17:07:50.006+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"@Meddler please, please talk about Lissandra. {{champion:127}} \n\nI don't know what happened but she feels SO bad since the start of season 8.\nShe wasn't strong before but now she is just bad.

Thoughts on either of those might be appreciated, specifically the former and how the non-mana-using AP characters are handling the changes.\n\nOn the less discussed topic side, I'd personally be interested in hearing anything about bot-lane role expansion plans, AD carry diversification (if that's still on the table), and perhaps where you internally draw the line between whether or not a character/role having a set build is okay. The latter is especially interesting because some characters seem very reliant on certain items (RoA, Trinity Force, Lichbane, Infinity Edge being some of the biggest offenders), while other champions (and/or other roles) enjoy a MUCH broader selection of itemization. Would be interesting to take a bit of a dive into that, and into how much itemization diversity you like to see be decided on a per-character basis (Lucian vs. Kog'Maw), how much on a per-game/per-opponent basis (a lot of tanks/bruisers), and how much on a per-role basis (i.e. tanks/bruisers typically having a wider range of build options than Marksmen, for example).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tomeksz","date":"2018-02-07T17:08:19.130+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler\nYou once metioned doing some work on Varus, you said you wanted to add additional effect on him.

Are there any considerations to take a step back a bit and take more time to proactively allow more runes to shine, rather than retroactively nerf the  best rune every patch. Also should not missing runes be added (like fighter keystone) before can real balance take place as currently some classes are very limited to what they can use as viable choice.\n* Zombie wards - should not they have separate ward limit? Champions that can comfortably run tracker's knife in jungle feel like much better option just because of this rune, not to mention it feels almost mandatory for jungle role (mandatory rune for role should never be a thing correct?).\n* Aftershock as damage class oriented keystone - it currently has patter very fitting champions that want to be in your face, including a lot of fighters. However it has limited damage scaling and non-adaptive damage type. Personally I see no reason why should aftershock even be oriented toward tanks anyway as dealing damage is not something I would associate with them.\n* Support itemization - considering very hasted changes to support items, is any larger scale pass planned - possibly including items like banner of command or ohmwrecker? Also coin currently has no reason to be a thing, it gives less gold and less combat stats compared to other two, while also it has the most worthless update ever, with only advantage being low cost which makes no sense since it fills your item slot with crap, worse than sighstone would have been. Important note about coin - it provides base health regen, stat that is very low for most \"passive\" champions like your Jannas or Sorakas and is basically worthless as you get close to nothing out of it.\n* Tank balance in overall, currently it feels a lot of tanks that should be about CC/Sustain bring unnecessary dmg output. My personal note on that would be, I would prefer to see more CC/sustain, but way less damage toward champions to require tanks having a damage dealer with them in order to have kill threat, currently they feel unreasonably deadly alone. Either way any reasonable take on aftershock tanks would be welcome.\n* Lethality items - as primarily  only source of lethality right now, is there an option to reduce their AD values, while increasing their lethality values? Effectively it would make assassins more about their base values and less about their items making them less snowball but more reliable and consistent. Also it would make them less appealing to marksman, who would want to scale with AD/crit instead, given they have lower base numbers and better scaling.\n* Shields - is there possibility of rune/item that would have some form of shield debuff, either preventing shielding or reducing shield values/ removing active shield etc. The amount if shields/ shield buffs feels a bit overboard as it is right now.\n* Stopwatch - possibility of reverting some value nerfs, but placing \"delay\" mechanic on the item (similar to taric ult). Wouldn't just delaying the stasis for 1 -1,5 second be better choice for play making around the item in general? Also it would make the item more unique, and possibly more appealing as proactive, rather than reactive option - \"Some inspiration to make the play\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snaketits","date":"2018-02-07T16:53:22.262+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's going to happen to Seraph's Embrace during the big AP item update? \n\nI don't recall seeing it at the recent reveal, it'd be a shame to lose out on the shield-active it usually gives.","replies":[{"poster":"Sorarozu","date":"2018-02-07T17:02:16.548+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"No changes made on that front, tear quest is the same","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2018-02-07T16:58:54.339+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler, I'd like to ask about GP again :P\n\nLast time I asked about him you said you guys were gonna talk about him for 8.4.\nThere's no changes to him or the stuff he uses on PBE rn, but I doubt that means you guys think he's in a fine spot rn\n\nCurious to know what you guys are thinking about him rn","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wobly","date":"2018-02-07T22:26:39.819+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Topic: Champs with huge pro play / solo Q performance splits\n\nA lot of the reworks and new champs that have come out in the last few years have been pick/ban in pro play while being balanced or even undertuned in soloQ.

HP/lvl given to mages instead of flat armor or hp in particular stands out as highly problematic in solo q. It makes sense for a lot of pro games where players were taking hp/lvl runes already because early fighting and attempts at kills are much rarer due to high coordination with junglers, vision, and super high map awareness. But in solo q it means a lot of people getting bursted down easily early on.\n\nAlso the lack of mr glyphs might work out ok for mages due to lack of pen marks and pen item changes but it means a bit more damage coming from all the champs that do any magic damage and weren't taking pen runes, mostly tanks but also some other champs.\n---\nAny chance of help csing early on for mages? Some have really terrible auto attacks and spells that are awful for last hitting. Especially as a mid Morgana main I feel like during the first 2-3 waves of the game I lose a bunch of cs simply because my W is extremely poor at last hitting and a lot of other mids (especially manaless ones) punish really hard early on if I try to last hit everything with autos.\n\nA few other mages I play have similar issues but it varies wildly because their auto attacks and spell last hitting also vary wildly. I wouldn't mind if it felt like a meaningful trade off in power for something else but it doesn't at all. It just feels like random luck whether or not certain spells (especially ones that do damage over time) last hit minions or not. Maybe give doran's ring a small minion execute mechanic similar to ASol's stars (but weaker, really not asking for much)?","replies":[]},{"poster":"emreecheek","date":"2018-02-07T17:21:23.458+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I'd love to see what work is planned for Lissandra!

Each cast additionally grants you additional mana maxed at 500.\nUpon max mana the effect changes to spell cast is refunded to 20% and increased to 25% with nearby ally.\n\nThis doesn't start until 3 minutes into the game.\n\n\n\nGathering storm: Similar to live but grants stats every 5 minutes and can be used as a catalyst (another hue) to improve ROA\n\n///////////////////////\n\nItems:\n\nTear of the goddess: grants 'Manaflow' like the rune. This lets you build Tear and upgrades later into the game.\n\nRod of ages: effect changes to giving you gathering storm or +5 minutes to gathering storm if you already have the rune. This makes RoA less of a feast or famine item which can help champ like anivia and kathus especially even if they fall behind.\n\n////////////////////////\n\nI think these can be nice additions to changes already made..","replies":[{"poster":"Sorarozu","date":"2018-02-07T17:10:07.814+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorcery tree likely won't get looked at until 8.5 cycle due to the amount of AP changes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jungle Morgana","date":"2018-02-07T17:09:50.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Meddler !
