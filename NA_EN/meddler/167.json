The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Loading Screen Tips**\r\n\r\nFor anyone still wondering, yeah, these are definitely lasting much longer in game than they should. We&#039;ll be shortening them in the next patch (7.16) so they&#039;re not still on screen as you&#039;re trying to jungle invade or emote spam each other.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Ward Consistency Pass**\r\n\r\nAlso going into 7.16 will be a consistency pass on how attack modifying abilities interact with wards. Our intent is that abilities should stack on wards, but buffs shouldn&#039;t get consumed by them (in part because those abilities shouldn&#039;t be applying their bonus effects to wards). Most abilities already work as they should in that regard, there are a number though that need correcting (Jax R from memory consumes its 3rd hit damage for example). That should be on PBE already, let us know if you&#039;re seeing anything that still doesn&#039;t behave as it should.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Brand**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re pulling the Brand changes that have been in testing for 7.16. Still looking to do a bit of work on Brand at some point, see if we can make him a better choice in mid lane, rather than being as skewed towards a support as he is. Changes we&#039;ve been testing don&#039;t hit the mark in terms of intuitiveness and feeling natural on Brand (bit too mechanical). \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Ancient Coin**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re also going to be hitting the Ancient Coin line in the next patch. The mana return especially&#039;s definitely too high, and we&#039;re seeing that come across both in a lot of general power and excessive removal of consequences from poor mana use by many supports (blowing a lot of mana for no gain should have more cost). Might or might not need some further tweaks to gold income at some point, unclear for now if that&#039;s in the right spot or not with the mana return also being out of line and clearly in need of reduction. Looking at dropping that down to 10%, also considering whether a lower % max, rather than a larger % missing, model might be more appropriate.","replies":[{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2017-08-01T16:32:10.578+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":5,"body":"Will there be any work done on Zyra and Karma to make them better choices in mid lane at some point?

If you do harass and push the wave as a result, you are very vulnerable and are a free kill. A possible solution for this may be to make last hitting minions reduce the cooldown on Zyra's passive. The slightly random element of the passive should keep it balanced and not a guaranteed way to stay safe whilst pushing, allowing for enemies to still punish. It also leaves the Zyra player to decide how they should best use the seeds which are spawning to win a fight if they do get engaged on.\n\n*****\n\nZyra mid player here! (Formerly support, but too many ADCs would complain about my aggressive playstyle and so my only option is to either upset most ADCs I play with, or play mid).\n\nI think there may be some bugs with how her plants work which would help her to start.\n\nI've noticed that you can QW an enemy, the plant will auto-focus the enemy as it should, because the Q dealt damage to them directly and marked them. But then the plant will just lose focus on the enemy and switch to minions instead despite no command for it to. \n\nLike I've tried ensuring that I don't auto attack a minion so the plant doesn't switch to a minion because of that. The enemy's not walking out of range of the plant either. I'm not really sure why it happens.\n\nHowever, this applies to Zyra mid and support!\n\n**Focusing on Zyra mid**, I find that I have a lot of issues dealing with the early game. So ideally when I play Zyra mid, I want to let the wave push in to me because of how vulnerable she is when pushed up. But what this means is that I can't use my plants at all. Like I can't even harass the enemy laner because it will always result in your wave pushing further than you want. \n\nFurthermore, because the Q you just used just used all the seeds your passive spawned, you now find yourself with a lane pushed up and nothing to defend yourself with if either the enemy mid laner or jungler moves in on you. It feels like you're punished for anything you do in the mid lane.\n\nPotential solutions for this?\n\nI was thinking you could tone down the passive slightly and offer Zyra a 3rd seed on her W.\n\n**Or maybe make this interesting and make last hitting minions reduce the cooldown on Zyra's passive**. This would be pretty interesting just to try out and the RNG-ness of it could allow it to remain balanced too. This way as Zyra pushes the wave, she's taking a risk and putting hope into her passive to spawn seeds in ideal locations around her, just in case. And then it's still up to the Zyra to use those seeds correctly in the best way to deal with whatever threat they're faced with for pushing the wave. I think it would worth a try to experiment with on the PBE to see if it's a stupid idea or not.\n\nAside from that, I'd strongly recommend talking to \"DorkLS\" about Zyra mid. He's an extremely good Zyra player, primary mid, secondary support, who hit master this season. He's a very reasonable and logical person to talk to and would probably be able to give you feedback more valuable than other player when it comes to Zyra in the mid lane.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nebuul","date":"2017-08-01T16:57:41.722+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":3,"body":"Is Riot happy with the state of Tahm Kench?

Mana regen has been nerfed, AP has been nerfed on all of them except FQC, a mandatory pause was added between procs coming from one ability — it's been too much. Spellthief's was the standard choice only because the alternatives were either even worse (Ancient Coin), or inviable for most (Relic Shield).\n\nThe quest reward on Spellthief's Edge isn't amazing, either. Compared to Relic Shield, which can easily out-gold-generate it during laning if you time your procs for cannon and melee minions _and_ provides a high-value health shield; and Ancient Coin, which grants your teammates extra mobility; Spellthief's quest exclusively gives _you_ bonus movement speed for a very limited window, and only after applying a proc — and on top of that, you reach your quest reward the latest in most cases.\n\nCoin isn't popular strictly because it's \"too strong.\" It's popular because the alternative for non-tanks is terrible.\n\n-----\n\nIf you really intend on putting further work into Coin, shift it toward an enchanter-focused item so it actually has a strategic identity. Part of the problem right now is, Coin really doesn't serve a unique purpose: Spellthief's Edge (despite its current state) is geared toward frequent damage on enemy champions and turrets, Relic Shield is for durability and surviving damage in lane, and Coin is — for what, exactly? High mana costs? Not anymore, with this nerf. Mobility? Highly generic, and not really a good thing to build an entire support starting item identity around, considering the sheer power potential of movement speed.\n\nRealistically, Coin should become a protective enchanter-oriented item — give it the Forbidden Idol effect, 5% as Coin, 10% as Medallion, maybe even 15% on Talisman since that takes up a separate item slot that could otherwise be dedicated to another Forbidden Idol upgrade. From my understanding, Windspeaker's Blessing is being removed in the rune/mastery update, and a direct analogue is unlikely; having a starting item provide the additional heal/shield power wouldn't be overbearing.\n\n-----\n\n**Edit**: Additionally, Relic Shield could use some improvements as well — not in its quest reward or its stats, really, but in the ability to actually use it to get gold after laning. People absolutely refuse to let you use your procs for _no_ reason during the mid-game, which not only hurts them (no healing), but severely hurts you (lowest-gold-income role not even getting to use its only way of earning money). Hell, past a point, people clear minions so quickly that if they don't let you sit there and smack the melee minion for six seconds to low enough, you _can't_ get procs off.\n\nIt needs functionality improvements. Its power during laning nowhere near high enough to justify the trade-off of how useless it feels afterward, and rather than make it stronger early, it should feel better later.","replies":[{"poster":"WintersWard","date":"2017-08-01T17:17:26.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you good sir.

(If the target is at 2 stacks when he dies, the third stack will give him 6 seconds to be resurrected due to the explosion; alternatively, dying could apply 2 stacks, meaning he's guaranteed 6 seconds so long as he was previously in combat with the target). \n\nAt the moment he has a lot of fire spells, but very little that makes him a Fire Elemental that infests hosts.\n\nMuch needed quality of life:\n\n* Conflagration now uses Edge Range for spreading (and ideally also for casting). \n* Conflagration now deals bonus damage to secondary enemies. (Anything to encourage its usage as the second spell in his combos, rather than always being the first; this would be a change that would be a luxury only mid-laners really have to play with.)\n* Conflagration's blaze effect will now trigger if Conflagration kills a non-blazed target. (Another effect that would only really be usable as a solo-laner, due to farm-taking). \n\nAnother idea:\n\n* Pillar of Flame, instead of 25% bonus damage versus blazed targets, now erupts a second time after a further 0.625 second delay if the first eruption hits a blazed target. This second eruption deals only 50% damage.

Support is the role that no one wants to play and now there is finally a reason to play it. Being the lowest level, having least combat effective items, and gaining the lowest amount of gold just plain sucks. So please give the other support items more power so that not all supports are picking up coin and keep support at its current power and fun level.\n\nSince his release, I've played more Brand than anything else, by far. I think Brand's Q/W/E are fine. I think most Brand players max W then Q then E, but I like to max E second for that sneaky damage no one ever sees the extra explosions from a flaming target coming. The only thing I would like to see is more damage on the passive burn. Maybe up to 4% max HP from 2%. ( I think that's what it was before the rework). And since there aren't too many tank killer mages in the game right now, he would have his place in the meta. His R feels really bad as well. I've always thought giving him charges of it, instead of giving it bounces. It is a pretty low range attack so you'd have to get in pretty close to use all the charges. I could even see the range being reduced to what conflagration's currently is and conflag getting the longer range of his R (that would help him lane quite a bit.) As it is now, I just get close enough to press R then run like hell the other way and hope that it hits more than one person. When it does, it is glorious and I feel super strong, but when it doesn't its depressing and I just have to sit back and try to stun people. Forcing him to get a bit closer in the fights but giving him more consistent damage from the ult would be a nice trade-off I believe.\n\nAt level 18 with 1000 AP, that would be 5 charges of 300 + 250 (25% AP ratio) on a glass cannon who dies to 3 auto attacks from and AD at that point in the game. It would require insane positioning and timing, but it could work with some really good players, or against really bad players. He would be great in Bronze and pro play but probably pretty bad everywhere else, unless you put a lot of time into him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Off ßrand","date":"2017-08-01T18:49:21.495+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a midlane Brand main and these changes to make him more viable mid have me excited. I'll drop some thoughts here. \n\nA simple solution to gear Brand more towards midlane would be to transfer more of his base damage into AP ratios and make his waveclear more instantaneous. That could make his early game a little weak though. Currently his W can only reach either the melee or the ranged creeps, with his E also being needed to further clean up the ranged creeps or do more damage on the  melee, with a second required rotation. Compared to other mages like Viktor and Anivia or even Ahri, Orianna, Syndra, and Lux, his waveclear is below average and extremely mana consuming. As so, doing something to better his waveclear would make him more viable for midlane, maybe increasing the radius to which E can bounce to other ablaze targets.\n\nI also liked the E used a little like a farm tool to last hit, putting it on a reduced CD. Since Brand's base AD is a little low, he needs 2 autos where most mages need one so tower farming gets difficult sometimes since it's relatively easy to push Brand in, especially early where his waveclear is mediocre with the mana costs associated with it.\n\nI think hitting the early mana regen but compensating with higher base mana and better growth could also help with gearing Brand towards mid rather than Support, since the spellthief line provides only just enough Regen to be spamming abilities in the bot lane.\n\nFurthermore, Brand is supposed to be an AoE mage yet his Q is single Target and being his main CC, requires the target to be ablaze, giving a huge window of time for counterplay opportunity whether with a flash, dash, or sidestepping its quite narrow hitbox and below average missile speed. Putting them ablaze to land a Q requires getting into dangerously close range with E or R or attempting to land a very telegraphed W. And in the end Brand just gets creep blocked so Q doesn't land.\n\nDespite these weaknesses I enjoy playing Brand mid because of his high AoE damage potential and his combo playstyle, where you can pick and choose your combos based on situation. Adding new and unique functionalities to Brand that support this playstyle could help him settle in the midlane.
