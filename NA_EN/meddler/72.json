The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Pre-Season just around the corner**\r\n\r\nBit of a quiet before the storm period for us at the moment. We&#039;ve just recently locked down the final changes of the pre-season patch and are extremely excited to see it go out after working for a long time on Runes. The second half of next week onwards is likely to be really busy again as we make needed adjustments based off how Runes etc are performing, looking forward to talking about our thoughts on that. For now though there&#039;s a bit less to discuss so a brief period of comparative quiet. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**More Word Clouds**\r\n\r\nThe last set seemed pretty well received with a number of people asking to see some more, so I figured I&#039;d throw some extras in here. As before this is hopefully a mixture of the instantly recognizeable and the harder to immediately identify. Most of these clouds are also a different format to the ones from Wednesday&#039;s post. The first one here, and the ones from Wednesday are based off a general survey that asks what players associate with a champion. The other new ones by contrast ask specifically what players feel is iconic about a champ, so they end up with a different feel to them. They&#039;re also based off translated data from multiple languages, so there&#039;s some non english speaking memeing going on there too (e.g. &#039;Science&#039;), compared to the previous set that were just based off english survey responses.\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ZC4wB\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Urgot**\r\n\r\nAlmost all the champion changes in 7.22 are adjustments due to the impact of the new Runes system. One champ who&#039;s getting some other work on top of that though is Urgot. We had some Urgot buffs in 7.21 and, while we liked the direction of them, looks like they went a bit far. We&#039;ll probably be increasing the delay on Urgot&#039;s Q a bit as a result, making it a bit more dodgeable. It&#039;ll still be significantly faster than pre-7.21, but not quite as reliable as at present (currently testing 0.5s -&gt; 0.6s, was 0.85s previously). Urgot might still be too strong after that changes, we&#039;ll wait and see where pre-season puts him though before considering raw power, rather than timing, changes though.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**What do you want to see more of in these posts?**\r\n\r\nI figure it&#039;s good to ask this every so often, and now&#039;s a good time since there&#039;s a bit less to discuss today given we&#039;ve talked so much about pre-season already. So, what would you like to see more of in these posts? \r\n\r\nA few notes: \r\n\r\n* I&#039;m not gonna leak upcoming skins, champions, features etc.\r\n* I work with the teams that work on the in game gameplay experiences (champions, items, balance, gold income, the jungle, UI like healthbar etc). The further something is from that the less likely it is I&#039;ll be able to answer usefully. I&#039;m not going to be able to respond too effectively for example to discussion around how matchmaking works, what&#039;s up with Chat Bans, how you earn Chests/Keys etc.\r\n* These posts get written a couple of days in advance so they can get translated into other languages, so anything really recent as a topic will need to get covered in the comments instead (or the next post). \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Dessem","date":"2017-11-03T16:35:54.945+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Swain, Yasuo (how the fuck does science go in there?), Anivia, Lux, Draven and Ezreal.\n\nWhat's the one for Viktor look like?

AGAIN, they are always thinking about where to take champions in a rework. \n\nWould you rather see Fiddle or Nunu (who while struggle, can find success) with broken, in-cohesive kits that disconnect from the champions' identities, don't work, make multiple Aatrox situations, or just SUCK more than they do now?
