Will touch on current crit marksmen thinking (our bad on patch note phrasing/thinking on how 7.4 affects them) and lethality at least a bit on Monday or Tuesday.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Bond of Stone**\n\nHas been in a sad state for a while. We&#039;ve got a new version that&#039;ll be hitting PBE soon (today maybe?) aiming to make it a better choice while still positioning it as a thing you take if you want to be tankier and keep your allies alive. Mechanics we&#039;re testing are:\n\n* You get 5% max HP for taking it.\n* Enemy champs you CC get a mark on them. Other allies who auto attack that mark get healed. Healing scales with your max health.\n\nGiven the mechanics are pretty different, and it no longer directly absorbs damage, we&#039;ll also likely change the name if this approach continues to test well. Suggestions highly welcomed, in particular ones that thematically suggest big/tough (max hp boost/scaling) and helpful/protective (the heal).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Quinn, Talon and Ashe**\n\nWe&#039;ve been testing Quinn and Talon nerfs on the PBE on the assumption that after the Ghostblade, Edge of Night and Mastery nerfs they&#039;ll still both be too strong and will need individual attention. We&#039;re not confident we&#039;ll have a clear enough picture on that at this point by the time we need to lock 7.5 down (mid next week) so we&#039;ll be pulling those changes from 7.5 and reintroducing them into 7.6 if appropriate. \n\nFor Ashe we&#039;re on the fence as to whether the E nerf is currently needed. Thinking&#039;s trending towards not at present, looking to get some testing on it both for a possible future change if needed and so we&#039;ve got the option for 7.5 if we decide it is needed. Might vanish from the PBE at some point soon.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Doran&#039;s Shield**\n\nChange has potential, but needs more time than just the 7.5 patch cycle to be done properly. Will vanish from the PBE at some point, with possible return in the next patch or two or potentially in mid-season with other defensive item changes. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Practice Mode and Bugs**\n\nWe&#039;re still getting some really good bug reports helped by practice tool. One thing I did want to call out though was that there are a number of spells that will behave in a buggy way in practice tool if you&#039;re using cheat CDs because the way they&#039;re set up doesn&#039;t behave well if their CD is shorter than it would be in an actual game (buffs/debuffs that normally time out before the spell could be available again still being around etc). The intent&#039;s highly appreciated, but calling out bugs that only happen in those circumstances is much less valuable than ones that can happen in normal conditions. It&#039;s unlikely we&#039;ll fix oddities like that if they&#039;re just slight practice tool weirdness - better to put that development time into fixing other bugs that affect actual games etc. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Couple of Hotfixes yesterday**\n\nFor anyone that missed it the Edge of Night hotfix nerf went out yesterday (apologies for patch notes still representing older thinking), with AD dropping by 5 and CD going up from 30s to 45s.\n\nWe also put out a hotfix to a Scuttle Crab bug where in some circumstances kill credit would be incorrectly awarded to the enemy team if they were nearby. Apologies for anyone that saw a bit of weirdness from that yesterday.","replies":[{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2017-02-24T18:27:09.397+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=kjauTenG,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-02-24T18:02:32.286+0000)\n>\n> Given the mechanics are pretty different, and it no longer directly absorbs damage, we&amp;#039;ll also likely change the name if this approach continues to test well. **Suggestions highly welcomed**, in particular ones that thematically suggest big/tough (max hp boost/scaling) and helpful/protective (the heal).\n\nI've been waiting my entire life for this moment.\n\n* Protector's Runebrand\n* Blessing of the Monolith\n* Bloodvigor Sigil\n* Mountain Vigilance\n* Patron's Tithe\n* Guardian's Spiritgift\n* Titan's Enchantment\n* Glyph of the Mountainborn\n* Celestial Harmony\n* Skywhite Vitality\n* Steadfast Rapture\n* Evergreen Concord\n* Solidarity of Eternity\n* Trueshield's Faith\n* Earthguard Absolute\n* Armor of the Devoted\n* Protectorate's Lifespark\n* Undying Spiritfire\n* Paladin's Passion (If you like alliteration)\n* Defender's Holy Sacrifice\n* Bastion of Sunrise\n* Lifedragon's Wombfire\n* Bond of the Sacrificer\n* Vorpal Bond (Since it's similar to Shen's old Q)","replies":[{"poster":"Robertsmash","date":"2017-02-24T22:53:17.580+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Blessing of the Monolith is great","replies":[{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2017-02-25T02:46:28.890+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:54}} MY PEOPLE","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ArnoldSchwarzens","date":"2017-02-24T18:18:51.380+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"Something that would help a lot when testing your damage and builds in practice mode:\n\n-set dummy armor\n-set dummy mr\n-set dummy hp\n-set dummy level\n\nThis would allow you to experiment much better with percentage damage, true damage, lethality and other forms of armor pen to see how it would affect differet types of champions in an actual game.","replies":[{"poster":"Dragonslayer RS","date":"2017-02-24T22:37:15.732+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally agree.

Thanks!\n\nQ1: Yep, works on all CC effects, including slows, blinds, grounded, etc. And yes this mastery is intended to be more powerful for more defensive champions who don't lean on initiation as much to express power. \n\nQ2: There is no cooldown or limit. You can mark whole enemy teams if you buy Rylais as Amumu, constantly and forever. Thoughts here are that if item interactions prove to be overly game wapring, we would tone it down to being based off ability driven CC effects, preserving the synergies we wanted. From our tests, it hasn't been too oppressive in the infinite case, but obviously we could be off. In the meantime, letting it synergize with item purchases is pretty cool from a play style stand point. I think we've actually enriched your strategies for winning on a champion like Leona if you can  see a new item path that enables a more supportive style in a particular game by taking this new mastery. If this proves to be abusive however, we will have solutions prepared.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2017-02-25T01:13:28.006+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Q2: There is no cooldown or limit.
