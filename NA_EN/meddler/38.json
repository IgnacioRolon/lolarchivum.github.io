The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Some more 8.19 context**\r\n\r\nOur thinking on a few more things we&#039;re looking at for patch 8.19:\r\n\r\n* Janna - As mentioned last week we&#039;re testing a buff to her passive&#039;s contribution to AA and W damage. Trying a larger buff this week (35% at all levels, instead of just late game), though might well go back to scaling values. Looking to get a clearer read on exactly how much power this lever gives.\r\n* Kog - We&#039;re been testing out buffs to Kog&#039;s Q shred, aimed at strengthening him a bit more as an anti tank pick, given he&#039;s currently a bit weak, that&#039;s been one of his historical niches. We&rsquo;ve got some concerns about pushing a shred too high though, especially on a champ with reliable damage output like Kog. More likely we go for safer buffs at this point (e.g. potentially a bit of base MS and R range)\r\n* Thresh - Looking at giving Thresh a bit more power in the early game in extended trading/fishing, without buffing his all in when it happens. Testing Q mana cost and CD buffs as a result.\r\n* Nunu - Putting a bit of power into AP builds, since we&#039;re seeing those be quite a bit weaker than tank builds on average. Aiming to add only a small amount of power to tank builds and avoid buffing AP so much it becomes the only build you should choose. Also worth noting that what appears to be a significant nerf to his healing off champs is actually just a tooltip change (was always lower on champs, but tooltip didn&rsquo;t reflect that)\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Kassadin**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re also looking at Kassadin, though his changes will probably be in 8.20 at this point. Likely direction is that we chip a bit of damage off his Q and/or E AP ratios, make him a bit less dominant when he really gets rolling, given he&#039;s now got an easier time getting there with the lower ult CD early on. Haven&#039;t playtested those changes for him yet though, so possible our approach changes depending on how that goes. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Odyssey Leaderboards**\r\n\r\nIn case you haven&#039;t seen them already we&#039;ve been regularly posting Leaderboards for the Odyssey high scores, both top 10 by region and globally. \r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/6J4vJkNs-the-odyssey-extraction-leaderboards-updated-sep-17\r\n\r\nSomething that&#039;s been particularly cool to see is the variety of different comps players have been using to post said scores. We were seeing a lot of Yasuo stacking early on, recently we&#039;ve seen other things creep in, like a 1 Sona/4 Jinx strat that a couple of teams have pulled off really effectively.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Why we don&#039;t always buff a champion&#039;s defining strengths**\r\n\r\nA question I saw crop up quite a bit last week we when first talking about buffing Janna&#039;s AAs and W was why we were giving her damage instead of buffing her protective/peel spells, given those are why you pick her. We do often target a champion&#039;s defining traits when buffing them to try and get/keep distinction between different champs. In some cases though we&#039;ll get to a point where adding more power to those strengths starts creating other problems. Adding too much peel and shield to Janna or healing to Soraka for example can lead to excessive safety for the allies they&#039;re protecting and low interaction/consequence play for extended periods as a result. That means if we want to buff them that finding other places to put that power&#039;s sometimes the way we think we should go. Some of our recent buffs to some assassins have also involved a similar situation. While they&#039;re characters defined by their ability to burst down a target that doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that buffing their burst damage is always appropriate. We&#039;ll then go for things like ult CD for target access on Rengar, or increased slow % on Kha&#039;Zix W for utility as a result. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Suero","date":"2018-09-19T17:30:05.145+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Meddler~\n\nI've  played about 5,000 games of Sona and since her Aura rework I've always felt  like there should be a  damage indicator when allies use her Q aura, Same to have how Leona's passive and Ardent shows the Allies damage.\nI noticed that on Odyssey Mode Sona has this visual effect and it  feels  really nice, especially since you'll see it a lot in a average game, I'm wondering if you keep/add this on Sona!

[...] In particular her E as sole defensive tool, but also farming/harass tool, leaves her really vulnerable in mid. Combine that with things like weaker than most roaming, lack of safety, we'd need to change quite a bit I believe to make her mid competitive with her support play. Attempts to narrow the gap with smaller changes, like the seed CD refund on kill, have helped a bit, but haven't moved the needle meaningfully enough at high MMR. At low/average MMR she does ok already statistically, though do see some vocal dissatisfaction from players about her mid lane state on Boards and Reddit certainly.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* This week Meddler gave a list of Zyra mid's weaknesses that impede her viability. 10 months ago, KingCobra tested the W change on PBE before the plant hp nerfs, and he described some of those exact weaknesses as *strengths,* specifically gank safety and lane harass. \n\n* My concerns outlined in the r/Zyramains thread have proven to be correct. She is too inconsistent and has too much counterplay to be a reliable solo carry. \n\n* Five months ago, Meddler acknowledged that plants needed to be \"better\" and announced that the issue would be explored\n\n* Four months ago, MapleNectar announced that plant hp changes were underway, but the direction was wrong and the problem wasn't as simple a fix as it may seem. SInce then, we have heard nothing about plants even as multiple bugs have been introduced without acknowledgment or bugfixing.\n\n* Since KingCobra's comments about W refund + pre-nerf plant hp being \"oppressive,\" nearly everything about his playtest build has been nerfed: Liandry's, Comet, Manaflow, Celerity MS, Scorch, and Magical Footwear were all nerfed. Alternatives, including Aery, Electrocute, Cheap Shot, and Coup de Grace were also nerfed. In addition, Zyra's base mana, mana growth, regen growth, and health regen growth were also nerfed.\n\nIn light of the above, can we not reasonably conclude that a full revert to the plant hp/duration changes could give Zyra mid exactly what Meddler says she needs? Added safety, better harass, lane dominance that fits her win condition, less reliance on E for wave clear. And is it possible that the multiple rune, item, mana, and regen nerfs were collectively a significant enough change that what was oppressive in 7.24 PBE may not be oppressive in 8.19 and beyond?\n\nThere is a lot of frustration involved in these bugs and plant reliability issues. I hope that this is a sufficiently well-argued and well-documented post that you will seriously consider making these improvements sooner rather than later. \n\n**PREEMPTIVE COUNTER-ARGUMENTS**\n\n* Revert would mitigate the frustration of bizarre plant interactions (Corki autos, Love Tap, Spiked Shell, Viktor Q, multi-hit aoe spells, dot ticks coded as \"aoe\") without Riot having to spend the time investigating and fixing the issue. While we're here, any chance of getting info on how these interactions are *intended* to work?\n\n* You guys have repeatedly mentioned the importance of counterplay for melees. Nearly all of her mid lane counters are melee, and I believe the metrics would support that. The importance of this layer of counterplay is overstated because Zyra already has ample weakness against mobile targets, forced all-ins, and burst damage - all of which are strengths of melee mids. In bot lane, Zyra is already very weak to hard engage by melee supports.\n\n* A plant hp revert would have minimal impact on support because both pre- and post-nerf plants require two ranged autos to kill. \n\n* If the problem is specifically the strength of Thornspitters against melee, consider changes that are more specifically tailored to address that issue. For example, Vinelashers could be very tanky if Thornspitters needs to be fragile. \n\n* If nothing else, Meddler did say that plants need to be worth \"paying the cost\" to kill. There's an assumption there that plants ought to have *some* cost to killing them, and right now they generally do not. This can be fixed in large part by making plants immune to rune damage, on-hit effects, and resistant to item proc damage.","replies":[{"poster":"emreecheek","date":"2018-09-20T17:48:58.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to point out, too, that this is reminding me of Zyra before her rework.\n\nI'm not super unhappy with Zyra's power right now, and am fairly indifferent to restoring her Q shape.

That's a HUGE issue.\n\nI understand that Zyra is a problem champ in terms of balance, but just fixing the plant bugs and making the interactions between the plant attacks and runes/items more clear would be great.

Her tuning is fine. The problem is consistency. She has far too much power in her plants for them to be as unreliable as they are between the intended hp nerfs, possibly unintended hp interactions (eg Corki auto), and multiple bugs.\n\n>I understand that Zyra is a problem champ in terms of balance, but just fixing the plant bugs and making the interactions between the plant attacks and runes/items more clear would be great. Not understanding how she works after playing her for years feelsbadman.\n\nFunny story about this. I've always loathed Jax and though he was absurdly overpowered. Three years later I found out that all my plant attacks missed during Counterstrike channel, and I was actually giving him a massive damage buff in the process. *No fucking wonder.*\n\nI mean, with over 1000 ranked games and ~1,000,000 mastery points on a champ, I'm still discovering or hearing about bizarre new plant attack and health interactions. It's extremely fucked up for a champ that's already inconsistent to have layers of *hidden* inconsistencies. \n\n\nAnd the interactions are extremely consequential. I remember losing a big fight because a teammate teleported to an ulted plant and it just stopped attacking for the entire channel. Or being totally helpless against Rammus because plants killed themselves on his shell after a single attack. Or Yasuo's aoe Q 1-shotting multiple plants with an aoe ability that happens to count as a melee auto because it applies on-hits and crits, but Ezreal and GP's Qs *also* 1-shot plants because they're single-target *abilities*.\n\nThere's not a single rule about plant autos that is followed with 100% consistency. It's like they wrote the rules by playing a game of darts while blindfolded. Of course, it's completely ignored by Riot, and our comments here will be ignored like the rest of them over the past 5 years. We can't even get a perfunctory \"we'll look into it.\" ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-09-19T17:39:44.467+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Meddler, isn't zyra's weak roaming an issue for her as a support since supports are supposed to roam now?","replies":[]},{"poster":"meteorbreaker","date":"2018-09-19T16:36:15.359+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I would like to hear a more accurate answer, for the answer was too obscure at the time and it contained only assumptions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"meteorbreaker","date":"2018-09-19T16:13:50.664+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I saw your answer.

It's currently looking unlikely we'll get to it soon but I'm hoping we'll manage to get it in a future patch at some point.”\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/Js0ngspm-patch-chat-with-the-playtest-team-84?comment=00430000\n\n\nAny information on this whatsoever is greatly appreciated, even if it's just that the work is cancelled. =)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-09-19T16:11:42.046+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bit of Gnar work was experimented with early in the year.

Obviously, you can gank-gank-gank and shut him down that way, but most of the time your jungler won't do that for you. So now you're left in a 1v1 that favors Kassadin since Fleet heals for so much and you normally start Dorans shield. The sustain is too high and we can't forget about the reduced damage from his passive vs magic damage. If you're playing an AD champion, the passive doesn't relate to them, but it's Kassadin can still sustain decent in lane with all the resources.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zoli Ben","date":"2018-09-19T16:06:49.980+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Meddler!

Something to consider if you want to avoid changing total damage after a hook, since Flay base damage increases by 30 for each rank, in addition to the stored autoattack damage.

Rifle - his old kit and mechanics, keeping some things in place maybe reworking his passive and toning it down on his e for adc graves. keeping r knock back.\n2. shotgun load out- allows you to play as current graves. \n\nThe problem with new graves in my eyes isn't his idea or how hes supposed to work. The shotgun is actually very fitting, however hes a nightmare to balacne and is always op when in meta. He 1 shots squishes, shreds tanks, survives assassins, scales well, out duels early, clears fast and healthier than any jungle. Hes just overall an issue in my eyes, and Id prefer a full revert but if thats not an option id like to see a compromise for players like me who would LOVE to play old graves.\n\nI've been trying really hard to get this opinion to reach a dev and those with power in the games production.

You tell us maybes and maybes but she's been sitting in the gutter for a long time.  She's a paper tiger trying to play as some odd combination of poke, brawler, and assassin while failing at all of them and her only defense is mobility and her mobility is becoming more and more of a joke with every patch you guys release.  You keep indirectly nerfing her with each buff and rework you give to her counters.  You haven't undone any of the past nerfs to her kit which in league's current state would have been completely unwarranted.\n\nShe's not the fastest jungler, the safest jungler, or even a good early game jungler and she doesn't shine in team fights or late game.  \n\nYou get this nice sweet spot somewhere in the accelerated mid game where she might be great but it's so hit or miss that you are almost always relying on your teammates to execute a perfect early game just so you can be relevant.\n\nShe's too slow and too squishy for how hit or miss/feast or famine her kit is.  She's too squishy and you expect us to do this whole melee deal with 0 CC, average to below average mobility, no CC reduction, no reliable anything to her kit.  She's supposed to be one of the epitome of skill expression champions but you've taken to trying to balancing her via clunkiness, sluggishness, and squishiness.\n\nHer combo's are difficult to achieve especially on the ridiculous level of mobility currently in the game and even harder to even get started with her binary hunt mechanic.  Isn't is hilarious how mobility creep has been hurting a champion that used to be among Leagues most mobile champions?  Half the champion pool can run us down and murder us with very little effort if we lose the element of surprise and it's so easy to lose the element of surprise.  A guy that fights people with a lamppost shouldn't be able to run us down or beat us in a race across the map... a horse sure but a guy with a freaking lamppost???\n\nLook you don't need a massive team effort to look into her.  You have people that would love to work on her at RIOT and you have tons of Nidalee players that have been trying to give you feedback for years but you've been ignoring us and balancing her in ways that are counter intuitive and just outright nearsighted.  We've had plenty of ideas and feedback for you but no one is listening.\n\nPlease stop trying to turn an apex predator known for being extremely nimble, evasive, mobile, and deadly and trying to turn them into a sluggish clumsy toad with a cat skin.  Cougar feels like playing game of frogger against oncoming traffic too often\n\nPlease listen to what we have to say and actually consider our input instead of taking the input of a few that have no idea what Nidalee even is.\n\nSo many people hate the idea of Nidalee getting most to a point where she's a competitive pick in ranked and the competitive scene but most of those players do not want a Nidalee in their game unless it's on the enemy team and there's a good reason for that.  You ignored us before, you messed up, and now we're paying the price for it.\n\nThat's it.  You're probably not going to respond but man we've been waiting and waiting and waiting.  She doesn't need massive buffs or reworks just to be functional.
