The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Possible 7.24 balance changes**\n\nWe&#039;re looking at potential changes for 7.24 (final patch of the year) at the moment. For 7.23, which goes out early next week, we wanted to just hit major outliers and give things time to settle down. We&#039;re now at the point where we&#039;ll want to do a fair bit more tuning of things around the new state of the game however. That work will involve looking at both Runes and Champions, so in some cases we&#039;ll need to either account for changes to one when changing the other or may need to circle back and do a follow up round of changes early next year, depending on how things go. That will be particularly true if we do end up adding any new runes to fill unserved champs, though we won&#039;t be doing that in 7.24 at least.\n\nSections below covering possible buff/nerf/investigate targets (none of this is final). It&#039;s also almost certain some of these things won&#039;t get changed and some other stuff will get added to the list instead as work on the patch goes on. These are also generally notes about things we&#039;ll be looking at, not as you&#039;ll note a list of what we&#039;ll actually be changing. That&#039;s because we haven&#039;t yet done the work to figure that out in most cases. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Possible Rune Buffs**\n\n* Fleet Footwork \nUnderperforming even on its best users.\n\n* Lethal Tempo\nThough need to make sure this is weak, that it&#039;s not just Press the Attack being strong.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Possible Rune Nerfs**\n\n* Press the Attack\nGenerally too strong on a fairly wide range of champs.\n\n* Aftershock\nArmor/MR granted is currently inappropriately multiplicative with temp Armor from stuff like Leona W or Rammus W, fixing that at least, might also be too strong in other respects.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Possible Champ Buffs**\n\n* Galio\nGot smacked too hard when we over corrected his AP build just before pre-season.\n\n* Jhin\nHas been weak for a while, Runes have amplified that a bit.\n\n* Aurelion Sol\nParticularly hard hit by the change from Stormraider&#039;s to Phase Rush. Other champs also affected, many of them have better alternatives to swap to though, even if they haven&#039;t done so much yet.\n\n* Bard \nStruggling noticeably, need to investigate why.\n\n* Riven, Darius, Camille \nAll are bruisers struggling in the new ecosystem, in particular because attack speed&#039;s not so valuable on them so Precision keystones are less applicable. Possible other candidates should also be considered here, also possible there&#039;s a missing rune needed to support some of these champs. Or that buffing them in general and letting them pick from a wider range of runes is the better call.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Possible Champ Nerfs**\n\n* Taric, Leona\nBoth are performing extremely well. Need to assess how much of that is Aftershock though.\n\n* Twitch, Trist\nWere strong before pre-season and have continued to be so. \n\n* Yorick\nWanted to let him sit a while, rather than nerfing him immediately in 7.23. Fairly confident now he&#039;ll be too strong long term so we should be working on him. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Need to be assessed more at time of writing**\n\n* Ezreal \nHow much did that bug fix help bring his power down? If he&#039;s still too strong how much is Klepto?\n\n* Corki\nSome of the team think he&#039;s sleeper OP, lot of debate over that though.\n\n* Kleptomancy\nDefinitely isn&#039;t weak. Its power is all very visible however, which can make it feel stronger than it is. Might be a good candidate for some tuning up for champions with less ability to proc it, tuning down for best case users. Some degree of champs being synergistic with particular things leads to really interesting play and trade offs though, so wouldn&#039;t want to normalize that too much. \n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Amaroq","date":"2017-11-17T18:28:37.225+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":2,"body":"Have you guys considered giving camille ult true sight on her target, I dont see it making her broken or op.

So many skills and items have been removed over less than this. It may have its uses, but when compared to other items, passives, spells, etc, it feels *very* bad. To the point where alot of people skip even putting a point into the skill until level 13, much less level it up early for objective taking purposes\n\nCompared to Lich Bane users, Demolish users, teams with multiple Mountain drakes or dedicated DPS character like Karthus, Cassio or Azir who can actually melt objectives, it's a spec of dust. Even in the Ardent meta with hybrid caster ADC's such as {{champion:236}} or {{champion:42}} being played as midlaners, Ezreal was nowhere to be seen outside of some cheese jungle games, even though on paper his W should have been scaling catalyst for botlane hypercarries such as {{champion:29}} for instance.\n\nThe skill has little to no visible impact or way to grasp how it affected the scenario. And because of how passive and niche this skill is, Ezreal has repeatedly gotten buffs to other parts of his kit (especially his Q) due to having fallen off favour. End result: item shifts cause him to spike massively in performance until said item or his Q (or both) are nerfed again and he falls into the abyss again. Rinse and repeat\n\n{{champion:12}} was another character who had the same issues with his passive and E providing too many minor and invisible/passive/niche gains, while his core gameplay was focused too heavily into a single thing which was one-way initiation.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Miss Old Rengar","date":"2017-11-17T19:26:36.721+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meddler, i have 2 questions for you about Rengar's (announced)possible update.

Let me introduce myself. Maybe you've heard about me. I've got thousands games with only mid/top Zyra in dia - chall elo. from S3 to pre S8. My game nickname is Lesba Zyra EUNE (had Lesbian Zyra)\n\nFinally I'm glad that you wanna buff mid Zyra only. Her current state as a midlaner is really weak. She needs to buy 2 items that costs over 2 600 (that's mask + pene boots) to deal a decent dmg. Yet. It's easily countered by a simple item for 450g (+25 mr). This means that I don't wanna buy pene items unless I know that enemy wouldn't build that. With old runes I had somewhere around + 21 magic penetration at level 1 that was giving me a nice early spike to win my lane.\n\nI can't buy Banshee or Zhonya since I wouldn't deal any dmg, because of missing magic penetration. She has balanced dmg only with true dmg (that means an enemy has less than 10 MR, because of MR pene items). Her E is hard to hit (very slow skillshot, easily dodged, countered .etc). Usually I am able to burst squishy that has no MR items, if i will buy flat magic penetration.\n\nI was playing against people rushing hexrinker or mercury (or both). I wasn't able to deal any dmg and to be honest, plants are easily killed.\nI was playing against tanks on top. They bought abyssal mask + mercury and it was over. Early burst did over 33% dmg to that tank.\n\nWhat's the difference between mid Zyra and bot Zyra?\n\nMid can farm and is playing a dangerous game, because of junglers. Not saying that enemy jungler can't gank bot too, but it's harder for mid Zyra to survive. Also midlane is full of assasins, jumpers .etc so it's so hard for a casual mid Zyra to survive or play the game. Sometimes I've managed to go 1/8/0, because of an assasin + enemy jungler babysitting me so hard. Or just anyone sitting my lane. Yes. I can play def, yet, plants are always pushing. \n\nWhat does that mean? She should be rewarded with a nice late game. Something like Nasus, Veigar, Anivia, Kassadin .etc\n\nMy idea is giving Zyra a passive that is able to stack just like Nasus or Veigar. I've been thinking about flat magic penetration.\n\nFor every 3rd killed cs, she gains +1 flat magic penetration. That would give her a huge late game spike as any other dps mage should have. I'm talking about Anivia, Orianna, Viktor, Velkoz .etc \n\nI know Zyra is designed to play with her (plants),yet, these plants are dying quickly, especially during TF against huge aoe dps dealers or dot users like Singed, Hecarim, Anivia. Anyway she should be able to deal dmg as a midlaner as any of others. For Example Heimer is able to deal extreme burst dmg, so he's got both things. Burst + Aoe control. Same to Azir. If he will use his ult perfectly, he is able to burst too.\n\nShe has mostly 'A good dmg graph' only because of poke + mask. Did you ever think playing Zyra without mask? You would see a huge difference. Poking tanks with tons of HP brings a different kind of dmg graphs. or against healers, shielders .etc so I don't believe dmg graphs that much.\n\nTo be honest. I've been always prefering burst Zyra over dps. That's why I'm rushing protobelt to gain more burst potencial. Unfortunately she is able to do that only with her ultimate. So I have no other way to decrease ult timer, because I've got to buy full magic penetration build (mask, boots, void). \n\nSo in the end, if you will give her this passive (3/4 cs = 1 magic pene), then she can build other items like HG, Banshee, Raba, Lich Bane .etc It can make her a really interesting midlaner. A squishy non-mobile champion should be rewarded with something, don't you think? And you can easily balanced her by increasing/decreasing magic penetration gain.\n\nThank you for your time to read my ideas and experiences.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Seviel Vorose","date":"2017-11-17T17:28:30.407+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we get some insight on bugfixes for Syndra?

On the contrary, it was normal for a majority of Darius players to run AS quints. It's just the precision tree itself is horrible for Darius as a primary tree, and item-wise we need tankiness more than we need AS. By all means, give us more AS, we'll welcome it happily.\n\nThat said, Fervor was extremely valuable to us too, and the lack of an equivalent replacement is one of the big things that hurt (this also hurt Riven players that didn't run TLD).

In fact, he was one of the few midlaners who used to take a full MR glyphs page. It was very useful vs most matchups. For example, today I died vs Syndra in a situation I know for sure I'd have been OK with my full scaling HP and scaling MR page (~level 8). On the other hand, traditional AP mids only tended to have 3 MR glyphs because they wanted CDR. I know he's supposed to be a scaling/farm lane early but he feels weaker than before till TF-Sorcs. \n\nHe's a well-known champion with a decent playrate and as lolalytics shows, he is simply mediocre atm. Even his late game winrate is only 50% despite him being an ADC and some expectation of indirect benefit for this patch. Corki's always overrated because people see his damage and that's a very visceral strength point. It's similar to how people think Zed's OP after he has some clean kills... ignoring that it's literally all he can do and it only occurs in specific conditions. Getting blown up is very raw and quickly leads to complaints even if in fact, the said champion isn't OP at all. I don't even main mid but it's frustrating that Corki has historically been overnerfed a lot nearly every year. Even when he was popular in pro play, his performance was nothing special. He wasn't actually pick/ban - he tended to be the mid that was let through after priority bans like Syndra. Moreover, just like in SQ, he was highly overrated in competitive - as his simply average performance showed (and this is with comps. built to have extra CC/frontline to help him excel). \n\nAs an ADC, Corki's supposed to be strong late and yet I don't think he truly outscales many of mids (Veigar, Anivia, Azir, Karthus, Kassadin, Cass, Malzahar, possibly even Annie etc.). Of course, as an ADC, if he is facing only a single target for an extended time, he probably would outdamge many mids but simply having more damage in that specific case is expected and isn't about overall scaling. He's also much more gold reliant than other mids since his kit has no CC or other contribution to teamfights. Those weaknesses are actually really significant even if more subtle (and people naturally think they deserve that situation since they made mid be behind). For example, an Anivia who is behind still has fantastic waveclear, can slow the enemy team, controls where they walk, can stun them etc. Corki can throw an R or two. He requires either decent gold or to be ahead of the game/have his rather telgraphed roams work out. \n\nI think Malzahar might still be a problem though. It's not clear to me since again, it's an easy champion to overrate because of his \"haha I killed you with RW\" feeling. I still detest facing Anivia more though. I'll also say that I'm shocked Kassadin with Ultimate Hat isn't performing any better.

He requires either decent gold or to be ahead of the game/have his rather telgraphed roams work out. \n> \n> I think Malzahar might still be a problem though. It&#x27;s not clear to me since again, it&#x27;s an easy champion to overrate because of his &quot;haha I killed you with RW&quot; feeling. I still detest facing Anivia more though. I&#x27;ll also say that I&#x27;m shocked Kassadin with Ultimate Hat isn&#x27;t performing any better. Anti assassin, high mobility champions tend to excel in squishy metas.\n\nAP Trist was similarly overrated. \"OMG SHE 1 SHOT ME!!! SO OP!!!!!!\" I wish Riot wouldn't listen to such clowns and make balance decisions off it. Although, in this case it was also very gimmicky and snowbally (not the most compelling gameplay). She basically hoped you didn't understand her level 3 damage (getting a kill most times - kind of like Talon did level 2) and that let her constantly stay in 1-shot territory. However, her CDs were pretty long so if she didn't get ahead enough to 1 shot, she'd be basically useless. Her waveclear was atrocious and her DPS was pathetic too. Her kit didn't offer anything else useful if behind either. She was actually a weak mid laner if people played vs her competently but people didn't want to deal with the  \"my mid's clueless and now Trist's just going to reset off our entire team and kill every lane\" situation. Despite all the complaining, I doubt even her winrate was good.  My point is that AP Trist was never OP objectively but damage, especially high burst, always makes people scream OP even if the champion they're facing is actually terrible overall.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Solari Fortune","date":"2017-11-17T17:28:05.787+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't go too hard on Leona please.

It allows Sona to run around without ever buying/upgrading boots for speed necessities (stacking way more AP yo), works amazingly well with the Celerity rune, and provides a ridiculous amount of mobility overall. I keep myself at a constant 5-600 MS due to constant E (with Lich's and Luden's built) usage late game, which puts next to no strain on my mana due to me building Tear early. \n\nLower safety could mean a transfer of power budget into other aspects of her kit, which she may make better use of.\n\nSimilarly, Sona right now starts out as one of the slowest, squishiest champions in the game; if you decide you want to buff her early safety (perhaps as a tradeoff for something else?) you could increase her base %MS on the spell.","replies":[{"poster":"Muf için Tuf","date":"2017-11-17T19:04:23.697+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think they should give her some early power. Sona is already a lane bully and can provide sustain, mobility and CC. Giving her a stronger early game means they will touch her up a bit mid-late game which is her best time to shine. Her ultimate passive makes you able to spam stuff more frequently. It isn't the most appreciated thing in her kit but it you can really notice the difference if you play her a couple of times.\n\nFor the mana cost thing, even with tear, you will be out of mana in a minute or two, spamming all your stuff to reach the ecstasy of mid-late game sona. I don't think they should touch his Q,W or R.  Her Q provides some significant mid game power and I don't think they can touch her W since it isn't the best ability on a single target (multiple targets is amazing). I agree with you on her E but you level it up later into the game anyways so her impact shouldn't be as much as you wrote and it should noted that not many people in high elo play her full ap and support players usually have around 200 ap if not less late game. That means she will provide a 3 second 26% movement speed aura every 3.96 seconds later into the game. \n\nI jumped into the practice tool and tested it myself, with 167 AP you will get 71 bonus movement speed. This is almost a permanent (with 0.96 seconds delay) effect. In comparison 3 cloud drakes gives you 75 movement speed.\n\nSona was and is the biggest Ardent Censer abuser in the game. She is also the biggest Cleptomancy abuser in the game right now since she can proc cleptomancy multiple times in laning phase because of her spammable abilities. They didn't touch her up because her early game is squishy (like most of the caster supports). Si in conclusion I think she should stay the way she is.","replies":[{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2017-11-17T22:58:53.183+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Keep in mind, in my post i was talking mostly about power shifting.
