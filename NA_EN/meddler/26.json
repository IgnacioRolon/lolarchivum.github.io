The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Pre-Season Balance assessment so far**\r\n\r\nSo, pre-season's here. We've been poring over games, discussion, stats etc to build up an understanding of the state of the game, it's still really early days though with a lot of experimentation going on. Collection of things on our minds below, most of this is more of a watch list than an action list though.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing's too crazy\r\n\r\n* Some stuff's quite strong or quite weak, nothing that's been on fire enough to need day one attention though, which is a relief with a patch this big. Some bugs that will get hotfixed, or have already been so however and we’ll potentially do a bit of champion balance hotfixing today or Monday.\r\n\r\nStrong Keystones\r\n\r\n* Some keystones are performing quite well, with Aftershock, Guardian and Summon: Aery being ones we're watching particularly closely. Aftershock goes really well on some champs for example (those with pick/lockdown combos). Aery seems to outperform Comet on some champs who should be good Comet users, assumedly because of its higher reliability.\r\n\r\nUnsealed Spellbook\r\n\r\n* Unsealed Spellbook's showing a really wide range of outcomes, from looking pretty powerful to not contributing much depending on the player and champion in question. Makes sense given it probably got one of, or the highest, learning curves of a keystone, so wouldn't want to judge too quickly there, definitely one to watch though.\r\n\r\nNon Keystone Runes\r\n\r\n* Nothing to note here yet beyond that nothing seems crazy or useless so far.\r\n\r\nStrong Champs\r\n\r\n* Yorick's potentially too strong. That's more likely a result of Q affecting towers adding more power than expected, rather than anything Runes specific.\r\n* Sona's looking really dominant with a range of different keystones. Not yet clear at time of writing if there's an issue with her, or just that she's taking better advantage than most of keystones that might be too strong.\r\n\r\nWeak Champs\r\n\r\n* Nunu and Ivern are both struggling quite a bit, assumedly in part due to a lack of obvious keystone they do well with as a default. Guardian seems to work fairly well on them, especially relative to the alternatives, but it's also stronger again on other Guardian users. Might need to buff them soon if they continue to struggle as much as they are. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Rune Path Popularity**\r\n\r\nFor anyone interested we're seeing some pretty strong trends in terms of what players are using so far. Precision/Domination and Domination/Precision are the clear favorites, though generally not the most effective on many champs. Lot of people seem to be avoiding Resolve/Inspiration as secondaries when they'd be great choices (e.g. tough lanes). That's not surprising though, we figured there'd be a lot of double damage tree use early on given that looks fun and with the ranked season over people aren't playing quite as competitively. Inspiration's the least popular primary path, which is also unsurprising given its got a lot of stuff that's not to everyone's taste and for some champs just doesn't work too well. \r\n\r\nNone of the primary/secondary pairings are looking too dominant power wise so far at least, it’s just popularity that’s varying a lot. If power does become a concern we’ll then use the stat bonuses particular pairings offer to bring them up or down in effectiveness as needed.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Skin Portrait Updates**\r\n\r\nPatch 7.23's going to have tweaks to quite a few of the skin specific portraits on the in game HUD, zooming some of them out mainly that are too close to the face at present. Those are on PBE already, thoughts on how they now look appreciated.\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Serednicki","date":"2017-11-10T16:44:27.806+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any info or news on Swain?

We need to figure out what to do instead as a result as soon as pre-season stuff's been dealt with a bit more. Given LB work's been going on a while that probably means prioritizing something faster over trying for a larger overhaul.","replies":[{"poster":"WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWÆ","date":"2017-11-10T23:15:24.943+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":3,"body":"Please give this a thorough read. \n\nYour first instinct when you see \"revert\" might be to ignore the comment, but hear me out: **until you guys find an appropriate solution**, why not just revert her to her previous iteration? \n\nCurrent LeBlanc has a massive list of problems which make playing/playing against her a bad experience:\n\n1. New LB has a ton of bugs I assume no one will address because she is being reworked eventually.\n\n2. New LB's kit is too complex. Because she is balanced around her maximum potential and her skill floor is high, she is too unfriendly for low elo/new players to pick up. Old LB had a simple design while having a high skillcap, which made her rewarding for low and high elo players alike.\n\n3. New LB lacks predictability. Being able to mimic W at all times ensures an escape, whereas old LB was punishable if W was on CD and Q/E was cast last. \n\n4. New LB is only made viable by awkward itemization. Building an AD/AP hybrid item feels horrible on an AP ~~assassin~~ mage.\n\n5. New LB demands too much key input precision. Pressing R locks you out of snapping back to W. Accidentally fat-fingering R twice is extremely punishing when you mean to use R(Q/W/E). Karma and Heimerdinger don't have this issue.\n\n6. New LB is too slow. _Static_ delays on W, Sigil cook, and Sigil cooldown remove the smooth, combo-reliant identity of the champion. An increased cooldown on R, the fact R takes two button-presses, and enforcing Q over W max are just some auxiliary factors that further slash the tempo of her gameplay.\n\n7. New LB has a non-interactive laning phase. The current Q max Pantheon-style laning phase is extremely oppressive against melee champions, since she does not need to use W offensively and can just E if they jump her. It's boring to play against and boring to play as. \n\n8. New LB lacks tradeoffs. With the old W max and shorter R CD, LB was forced to decide between trading/skirmishing or waveclearing. Each option was punishable: W'ing to trade and potentially getting ganked, CCed, or even out-traded, waveclearing with W-R but not having R for a fight, or saving R and being unable to clear the wave quickly. Each option was exploitable and made playing as/against her interactive.\n\n9. New LB suffers in an era where shields/burst mitigation are prevalent. Nullifying Orb, Hexdrinker, Sterak's Gage, Death's Dance, and shielding supports make her 1.5s delay brutally pronounced, particularly in teamfights. Old LB had natural/organic time delays with her mark/detonation system that telegraphed her spell rotation (Q/R(Q) telegraphs the use of W or E), and allowed her to match the burst of enemies that might kill her in _less_ than 1.5s (i.e. late game ADCs, mages, assassins).\n\n10. New LB's SFX sucks. \n\nAll of these factors, among others, make the current LeBlanc extremely unenjoyable to play. Old LB was not without faults, but she was balanced and enjoyable to play. New LB has been reduced to a state where she feels awful without being any more healthy to play against (except a static delay, compensated by overblown Sigil damage and unnecessary utility on R). [Even Riot phroxz0n agrees that new LB feels \"not so great\" to play.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeBlancMains/comments/78yzv2/playtesting_opportunity_at_riot_on_some_leblanc/doy7zm9/) \n\nI believe that there is inadvertent bias against LeBlanc since nobody on the balance team plays LeBlanc, so there is no one to play devil's advocate. From your team's perspective, it's understandable why you oppose a revert: \n\n* conceding to the demands of players casts weakness and doubt on the gameplay designers. \n* designer  time spent on current LB's FX, design, and gameplay would be for naught.\n* the playerbase would have adjusted to current LB now, and a revert would force players to re-adjust. \n* mains of Rengar/Fizz/Shaco would be in uproar, demanding the same for their champions.\n\nI can assure you the player merit gained by making her kit simpler/predictable/enjoyable again far outweighs the disadvantages of this change. Let Reddit and the LoL boards be a telltale sign: any discussion about old LB is met with swaths of players reminiscing of old LB's enjoyable playstyle. [Even high-elo players sympathize with this sentiment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeBlancMains/comments/6q7ww8/compilation_of_high_elo_player_opinions_on_leblanc/) In Korea/China (which are underrepresented on Reddit), LB was extremely popular due to the mechanical and macro demands of her kit, which Eastern players excel at using to potential. \n\nCompared to the other assassin reworks, there is no doubt that LeBlanc's was of highest controversy. Old LB had pronounced weaknesses (poor waveclear, single-target damage, waveclear/mobility/damage spell tied together) that were exploitable. New LB (and subsequent changes) had these weaknesses removed and was given power, but that was stripped away bit-by-bit, leaving a shell of a clunky champion sitting in limbo. A change at this time of year would be well-met since preseason is prime time, if anything.\n\nEverything in consideration, I ask that you cast aside any pride, any prejudice against LB/LB players, and any visions you may have for the game balance/design in regards to LeBlanc. Even if it's temporary, reverting LB to her old self would show you have the players' best interests in mind.\n\nFor that, many casual, hardcore, and pro LB enthusiasts would be dearly grateful.\n\n{{champion:7}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Lebłanc Bot","date":"2017-11-11T04:54:06.654+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"^^^^ THIS plz riot this is literally ever lb mains dream :)) at least get ride of her 1.5 sec cd her waveclear and revert the sfx  plz\nmake lb great again plz {{champion:7}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DonatellaVersace","date":"2017-11-11T07:02:47.833+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Everything about this....is beyond the shadow of a doubt...correct.

Especially sad since Aery seems to outdo it despite it requiring less effort to deal damage with aery than with comet. On the other hand Comet seems great on champs that brawl and skirmish a lot like Ryze and Swain so maybe it's just how the uptime's lower when your spells are single target, might want to look into it, as Aery seems just better regardless, and it'd be nice to have a choice between reliable damage of Aery and higher but requiring more work damage of Comet, which currently doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAlso seems like Glacial Augment is way less impactful than I initially thought it'd be, since you mentioned Inspiration being underused figured I'd ask whether you consider doing something about it, I know it's a slippery slope, can't have people run around with permaslows from level 1, but it seemed really not that useful with the brief and weak slow that the ranged champions do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ddoA","date":"2017-11-10T16:44:55.225+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a gameplay thoughts posted 2 months ago ([here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/9KovwJ7c-quick-gameplay-thoughts-august-4    )) where you mentioned that after LeBlanc rework Rengar will probably get one after her.

And I know you as a company mentioned possibly adding in a new Doran's weapon (or something of the like) that gives attack speed, but then these champions would have to sacrifice the mana sustain from D Ring, lifesteal from D Blade, or even make an inefficient early purchase in order to be an effective jungler (buying some sort of Doran's item instead of upgrading a machete, etc). \n\n_**I was thinking maybe it would be beneficial to have passive benefits tied to each tree so that you can pick and choose stats you'd like to have?**_ Currently, you get a passive benefit from your primary tree after you select your secondary tree, but what about getting passive benefits from both your primary AND your secondary tree? You could opt in to defensive stats from Resolve as a secondary tree, or attack speed from Precision, AP/AD from sorcery, Magic Pen/Lethality from Domination, a combination of stats from Inspiration - you get the gist.

There's a lot of champs that won't want it because their basic rotations already overkill minions, but low-efficiency split pushers like Shen (theoretically) get excellent value out of it, significantly increasing their waveclear speed because of the AA time it cuts.\n\nPersonally, I like it's strategic niche, but I don't think the implementation is very well done. I'd like to see the dematerialization aspect just removed, and the design as a whole refactored into something less gimmicky and more inviting.
