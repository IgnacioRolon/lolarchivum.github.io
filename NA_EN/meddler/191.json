The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Moving away from big patch/small patch**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve been trying alternating big/small patches this year, with more systemic changes in the big and mainly balance tweaks in the small. As mentioned recently we&#039;re looking to reduce the amount of change over the rest of the year though, focusing on follow up to midseason, polish and balance instead. That means we won&#039;t be doing the big/small alternation, and will instead go back to a regular patch approach like in previous years, with systemic changes concentrated more in midseason and preseason patches again too. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**New Tutorial**\r\n\r\nLast month we talked about some long needed improvements for the tutorial:\r\nhttps://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/2018/05/dev-new-player-experience/\r\n\r\nAt this point the new tutorial&#039;s now out and getting used by some new players. In order to understand where it&#039;s working well and where (if anywhere) it&#039;s worse than the old tutorial flow we&#039;ve got it currently enabled for around half of new players to give us comparison points between new and old at the same point in time. Barring any surprises it should be enabled for all new accounts in the near future though for anyone wanting to check it out. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**Some 8.14 changes**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve just done some initial planning for patch 8.14. Some of the things we&#039;ll be looking at:\r\n\r\n* Monitoring how our changes in 8.13 that impact bot lane, gold/xp funneling and snowball have gone, in particular to see if we should go further in 8.14.\r\n* Looking at mage balance, with a focus on mages who&#039;ve been left in too weak a state after the 8.9 mana changes. We&#039;ll be assessing a range of champions for that, with changes expected to some, but not all of them. Some possible candidates include Syndra, Annie, Vel&#039;Koz, Ahri, Cass, Viktor and Ori. Likely that some of those champions don&#039;t get buffed and some not on that list do though as we dig into things more.\r\n* Likely a buff to Karma. We&#039;re working on some longer term stuff for her, but will likely give her some straight power as well in the short term.\r\n* Potentially a buff to Liandries. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**Domination buff**\r\n\r\nAs a late addition to 8.13 we&#039;re buffing the Domination style bonus slightly.  We&#039;ve been seeing the Domination tree underperform, even for many champs it should be a great choice for. Buffing it a bit overall as a result. At some point (might be preseason) we also have plans for the vision slot to make it more appealing and satisfying, feel we should also just be raising the power of the tree a bit in the meantime regardless though. \r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Erenex","date":"2018-06-22T15:44:19.005+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":52,"body":"Zoe Buff?

You had two weeks to adjust to the changes and every single one of you said she was going to need small term buffs. I am not trying to throw any of you under the bus, but what is with the blatant hate with Karma? I mean you ruin her identity and take everything away from her in the VGU, to do absolutely nothing for 5 1/2 years. You don't comment about Karma at all and you guys are so delusional with your work ethic on her. The kit is not working, the art assets are not completed and working, the lore is not working, and the identity you gave her is not working. How much and how long does this community have to fight with you guys to do anything positive on this champion?\n\nIt's the same with Morde, Liss and so many other champions. How does the community have a better sense of your game than you guys do? Did you seriously think prioritizing work on Lux, Ryze Azir 2 times and Ahri for the past year was worth it? Do you think working on popular champions over the ones that have been waiting years now, was a fair and honest use of your time? No it wasn't. You ignored requests, discussions, and feedback on so many champions to work on the same garbage champions that get updates and VU every year, because God forbid they drop one or two points in their paly and win rates. Got to make sure they are always meta relevant in the game and have completed art assets.\n\nSeriously Meddler . . . I wonder why you still have a job sometimes. This is me not trying to be mean but this is me trying to make sense that you prioritize a hotfix for a garbage and annoying champion like Yasuo, but Karma is going to have to wait 5 weeks now for a small buff . . . and almost 4 months for a kit rework that is going to buff her shields again. You better be doing something meaningful with these Karma changes because the community on the boards and Reddit will come after you if you don't.
