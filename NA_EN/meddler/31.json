The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n**Tweaking CSing under towers**\n\nIn 8.4 we removed the extra 5 damage to minions champion AAs dealt (it got added back in pre-season) . One group of champs did get hit harder than intended though by that change. That&#039;s champs, usually but not always mages, with low base AD. They&#039;re now having to land two auto attacks on melee minions who&#039;ve been hit by towers twice, rather than the previous one. To maintain prior CSing patterns around towers we&#039;re shifting it so towers deal 45% of a melee minion&#039;s health per hit instead of 43%. Impact on other champs should be very minimal.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**Matchmaking Dev Blog**\n\nMany people will have already seen this, for those that haven&#039;t though I&#039;d highly recommend checking out the recent dev blog on matchmaking as found here:\n\nhttps://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/02/dev-matchmaking-real-talk/ \n\nIt covers a lot of topics that get brought up regularly like:\n\n* The relationship between ranked and normal MMR\n* Feeling you get matched with worse allies after winning a lot\n* Why we don&#039;t use KDA for matchmaking\n* Why you still get matched with people you&#039;ve muted \n* And a bunch of other things\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n**Some possible 8.6 changes**\n\n\nWe&#039;ve just finished working on 8.5 and are mapping out things we&#039;ll be looking at for 8.6. Some of our current thinking below, as usual stuff will get added or removed as patch development goes on.\n\n\n\nItems:\n\n* Jungle items - Two potential changes. First is changing sustain so it&#039;s more missing health/mana based. Goal there is to make early ganks a bit riskier like they used to be a couple of seasons back (not ganking at or close to full health, so more chance of a turn around). Would also potentially help out those unable to clear at present because they&#039;re so mana limited. Second change is lowering early clear speed a bit as well, push first gank times back a bit later in the game again. \n\n* Abyssal Mask - Potentially pushing it more towards just tankier users. Magic damage dealers taking it to both nullify opponent lane damage and still get sufficient personal damage hasn&#039;t generally created good gameplay.\n\n* Duskblade - Nerfing it.\n\n* Locket - Some investigations into ways to make Locket less consistent and less universal a purchase. More exploratory, so possible nothing ships in 8.6.\n\n* Rageblade - Looking to make it more accessible to melee, potentially also less of a first item power spike and more tied to other item power.\n\n\nChampions:\n\n* Rakan - Looking to buff. We&#039;re also fixing a bug between him and Xayah that leads to his performance with Xayah being much, much better than with anyone else. After that bug fix he&#039;ll be weaker when paired with Xayah, so a buff even in that case should be good too. \n\n* Rumble - Some form of buff, details TBD.\n\n* Lee Sin - Got hit a bit by Tracker&#039;s removal and had already been a bit weak before that. Buffing, details unsure.\n\n* LeBlanc - Changes will be on PBE during the 8.6 cycle from day 1, probably ship in a later patch though. Changes revert the majority of the previous update.\n\n* Ahri - Might have changes in 8.6 (testing, but not certain to ship). Still looking for ways to make her highs higher and her lows lower (does more when ahead, does less when behind)\n\n* Some Duskblade Users - We&#039;ll have some buffs to a number of champs who are pretty dependent on Duskblade at present and we expect will be too weak post Duskblade nerf. \n\n\nRunes:\n\n* Manaflow Band - Nerfing, details TBD.\n* Presence of Mind - Looking to change it so it&#039;s a reasonable choice on a wider number of champions. Then probably nerfing it for its current best case users, on whom its very strong already. \n \nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Kumungu Affair","date":"2018-03-02T16:34:59.224+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"Am I the only one concerned that Meddler is posting this from the future?\nIt's March 2nd, what is going on here riot?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-03-02T17:08:26.193+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, I seem to screw the day's date up in one of these titles every few months. \n\nInsert joke about how getting numbers right for Riot is hard here.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DemiluniS","date":"2018-03-02T16:19:10.507+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hi meddler, anything about liss?

Like let it scale for an extra 2-3 minutes, or let it scale faster.  The idea of an extra ability at the end sounds like a great solution as well, but I think Abysals passive on an AP Item would be more than broken, even if it takes 10 minutes.\n\nRight now it is the only item to offer AP, Mana, and health.  It’s a powerful trio, but in the face of Archangels protection once evolved, it’s not as shiny an option considering the loss of 20% CDR.  It’s a great item, but taking it puts me at a disadvantage early, as I’m behind in Ap and CDR, and potentially tied for health vs other items.  So I wish it didn’t simply go par for the course but rewarded me heavier at the tail end of it stacking.

It will always have a distinct group of champions that are the strongest above others. Even right now it's not just \"tank tops\", it's Gnar, Camille, GP, each of which play in completely different manners.

He&#x27;s built like a tank because he doesn&#x27;t need items that are offense/defense hybrids. Again, you&#x27;re a 600 game Nasus one trick with somehow a 45% winrate (over 600 games? wtf?) who ended their ranked season at division 5 with zero LP. You are not a good representation of juggernaut players. \n\nNope, {{champion:36}}  also does not use {{item:3071}} nor {{item:3053}} nor {{item:3742}} , which is the 2nd champion, and the only one I played alongside {{champion:75}} . Therefore, I'm exactly the best representation of juggernauts, and despite having performed better [than average challenger player](https://imgur.com/nemLkqd) in every single category, I was unable to only climb back to diamond.\n\n>There may be a time where certain juggernauts are good again, but expecting all of them to dominate top lane is a pipe-dream because they all have different playstyles, kits, and scaling.\n\nAnd that time is not even on the horizon, at least not with the slowest pace that Riot is addressing their issues (if at all). In no way am I expecting them to ''dominate'' top lane, just being picked occasionally would suffice. \n\n> The competitive meta is complex and values safety above all else. It will always have a distinct group of champions that are the strongest above others. Even right now it&#x27;s not just &quot;tank tops&quot;, it&#x27;s Gnar, Camille, GP, each of which play in completely different manners. \n\nAll in all, juggernauts have had 0% pick rate in pro play for 3rd consecutive Season. To put it in your words, their *''distinct playstyle, kits and scaling''* amount to utter garbage, and this is an overwhelming issue that's being ignored by Riot, and in the same the manner you are talking about it. League of Legends top meta has become so stale, that the average viewership has reached an all-time low during regular Season 7, many of the veteran players stopped watching it as a result (me included). \n\nTL;DR: Stop basing your subclass opinion (of juggernauts) on 2 most powerful members of the same, your sample range is not wide enough, and it only proves the overwhelmingly transparent issue of those you consciously **CHOOSE** not to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Vicimus","date":"2018-03-02T22:46:04.879+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't disagree with you here. I think juggernauts along with other aggressive top laners need some exposure in competitive games. \n\nBut that issue being an itemization one is debatable. Although items may be a part of it, juggernauts and fighters both just don't have keystones that work for them. Yes they can arguably run Grasp but that keystone sucks outside of lane and is suspect to being abused by tanks. Aftershock, again same issue of being abused by tanks/tank supports with low gold income. Riot needs to acknowledge both of these classes and give them more agency. Is the new conqueror keystone going to do it? Maybe. It looks promising but only time with tell. I feel like even that keystone can be abused by tanks with high %hp base damages like {{champion:223}} or even {{champion:78}} . \n\nThe bottom line here is that Riot needs to engage in discussion about these champions and the state of the lane in general. Perhaps the solutions offered here aren't the best, but they're a step in the direction we need to go with these archetypes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
