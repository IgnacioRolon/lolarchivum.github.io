The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n**Next post: Some Early Preseason Details**\n\nFor the second post later this week we're gonna have Scruffy jump in again with some further details on things we're experimenting with for preseason. Potential changes include buffs to early tower durability, changes to bounties based off learnings this year and snowball/comeback focused work.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \n**Current thinking on balance for Worlds** \n\nWe did some planning recently to identify initial targets for Worlds balance. Run through of that below. As usual this is subject to change. Worlds will be played on the 8.19 patch, though we're aiming to have a lot of the changes in for 8.18 in case any of them need followup. We believe the pro meta's in a decent spot overall. The overall targets we're using for Worlds balance are:\n\n* An interesting and fun to watch experience is most important from a viewer perspective. \n* A diverse meta's good, but not as important as interesting matches (better low diversity and exciting games than high diversity and slow, uneventful play repeatedly)\n* No champions should be 100% pick/ban, or very close to it \n* No major disruption (minimal systemic changes especially, changes to individual champs especially are more appropriate)\n* While we're putting more attention into pro balance for the next couple of patches, ideally any changes made should be positive for regular play as well. If not they should at at minimum not be highly harmful to regular balance. That's the case in particular when it comes to buffing champs, with a fair number we believe could buff into pro play relevance but only by making them inappropriately strong for regular players. \n\nBased off those principles the changes we're currently looking at making are as follows.\n\nNerfs:\n\n* Trundle - Jungle dominance\n* Gragas  - Jungle dominance (though does lead to interesting early play, especially with increasing common Predator builds)\n* Gnar - pushing champs out of top lane\n* Ryze - limiting mid picks\n* Braum - dominant support pick \n\n\nBuffs:\n\n* Renekton (lacking from top and has some room for buffs in regular play as well)\n* Vayne (unseen in pro, on the weak side in regular play)\n\n\nSome other points: \n\n* Top Lane - Watching a range of champs for their performance top, though nothing currently slated for them (Aatrox, Sion, Ornn, Cho, Mundo). Also want to ensure we're not balancing in a way that leaves blind picking a tank for top each type the default, low risk behavior. \n* Mid lane - While it would be cool to see Zed we don't have the room to buff him in regular play. Ekko would be interesting too for playstyle diversity, also lacking in regular play room though, plus has some tendency to low risk play at times (wave clear with Q, R to prevent deaths happening etc). Attractiveness of Galio is likely to change a lot depending on how safe tanks are as picks in other positions.\n* Electrocute/Dark Harvest - We're expecting some migration from Electrocute to Dark Harvest, especially for junglers, given they don't get much benefit from the lower Electrocute CD but certainly feel the damage nerf. Watching to see who that benefits/hurts. \n* Akali - Suspect we'll need to nerf her, want to give her a bit longer to see where she settles though, to better understand both how strong she is with a more experienced player base and how large the delta between pro and regular play is or isn't\n* Sejuani - A likely pro issue, especially with nerfs to Gragas and Trundle planned. At the same time she's in a pretty sad state in regular play. Might be able to find changes that lower pro value without further hitting regular, those sorts of changes are riskier to land accurately though which is a concern at this time of year.\n* Kai'Sa - Possible we chip her down given her consistently high presence and usefulness. Still discussing however. She doesn't have strong lane counters, marksmen in general are fairly blind pickable however.\n* Tahm Kench - Trying to get a better understanding of where the 8.16 changes left him. Was certainly a concern beforehand, unclear how big an issue he currently is. TK's a particular concern if too common a pick given he can dampen action more than most champs.\n* Annie - Possible we see some support play from her again, given the AA range nerf was what previously pushed her out of the meta. Also very possible things are just different enough now that that won't matter too much.\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Wukong Airways","date":"2018-08-29T15:29:08.561+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"@MEDDLER, I've recently read Reav3's comment regarding Wukong and he won't get any updates because the Chinese playerbase like him the way he is. doesn't this contradict with your game design and philosophy regarding outdated champions>\n\nand why wukong out of all champs wont get touched because of popularity in china? almost all champs are getting reworked/updated, but not the monkey,  and when will he get a reliable passive if not gonna get reworked?","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2018-08-29T16:12:49.174+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just wanted to jump in and clarify my comment since I think it has been misconstrued a bit. I was specifically speaking about Champions team giving Wukong a full VGU, not a minor gameplay update (Which are generally handled by the Live Gameplay team these days) We do take player request into consideration with VGUs, but that is only one factor, and my comment was more about why Wulong wasn't super high priority for a VGU right now (Which also doesn't mean that we would never update him, just that their are higher priority candidates at the moment). \n\nFor example, a Champion like Nunu was highly requested in all Riot regions for a VGU, had outdated gameplay, and very low quality art, which makes him a higher priority than Wukong who is only requested highly in some regions, has decent but not great gameplay, and has decent but not great art. Champions like Nunu or Morde are genernally going to be higher value then a Champion like Wukong for a VGU (At least right now.)\n\nEzreal is obviously a Champion that also bucks this trend, and if Ezreal goes really well and smaller VgUs are something we do more often in the future, Wukong could be a good candidate for something like that as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Roganox","date":"2018-08-29T16:34:05.163+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"There has been a while since we last had \"offical VGU\" candidate tiers.

I'd hate for you to gut him with this change and leave him for dust for a few months.\n\nThe other point i wanted to bring up was the absurd statement that was made alongside his nerf.\n> Top laners have unearthed Yorick as a dominant pick, in part due to the threat of his Mist Walkers. Players who understand the Mist Walkers' behavior and actively play around it avoid a lot of damage, while players who don't find themselves digging their own graves. We're toning down the damage of Mist Walkers to decrease his low level pubstomp potential.\n\nI do not understand the logic behind this. if you can acknowledge that counterplay **exists** to the extent that a percentage of the playerbase does not have issues dealing with him, then would it not make more sense to help adjust his kit's functionality so that this counterplay is more obvious to the average player?\n\nWhile we're at it, what exactly is the _behaviour_ that the reference was even relating to?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-08-29T15:45:14.428+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":6,"body":"We should have a good picture of how 8.17 has landed in terms of solo queue champion balance within a couple of days. Can then see if Yorick needs immediate followup. \n\nThe issue with Mist Walkers, as with most AI in PVP games, is that their effectiveness doesn't vary much with their allied player's skill. Opponents get better at playing against them as they become more skilled, but the value Yorick gets from them increases at a lower rate. That's an issue also visible on other non directly controlled minions like Malz, Zyra, Heimer who've also shown some of the low/high MMR issues over the years. It's certainly possible to mitigate it, usually by giving the summoning player more ability to somewhat direct the minions in question (e.g. Zyra's AAs guiding plants) or with skill tests that do translate into increased minion effectiveness (e.g. Yorick's E). Would like to do some work on Yorick in that regard at some point, smooth out his low/high delta a little. For 8.17 we felt we needed to bring him down a bit however, and that sort of work takes time and involves some risk. His high MMR performance has also been fairly strong recently.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharpest glasses","date":"2018-08-29T16:06:33.260+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":4,"body":">For 8.17 we felt we needed to bring him down a bit however, and that sort of work takes time and involves some risk.

It's really depressing seeing him join the ranks of ryze and azir?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Milvus ","date":"2018-08-29T15:57:32.724+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler,\n\nIf I may wonder, what buffs do you guys plan on giving {{champion:67}} and {{champion:58}} to make them more appealing in pro play, while also keeping them balanced in regular play?
