The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Kayle and Morgana**\r\n\r\nSome thoughts on what we're planning for Kayle and Morg now they've been out for a bit.\r\n\r\nKayle:\r\n\r\nIs looking on the strong side. Not all Kayle's are doing well, but we're seeing a lot of power come as players get through the learning curve. We considered a hotfix nerf late last week but decided to hold off since her performance was very variable. What we're currently planning instead are some nerfs and some feel improvements in 9.6 as below. Overall expectation is that her power will be brought down, she'll be a bit more item reliant than she was previously and her W/E should feel a bit better to use as well.\r\n\r\nStats\r\n\r\n* AD/lvl: 3 >>> 2.5\r\n* AS/lvl: 2 >>> 1.5\r\n* Default for Adaptive Force now AD instead of AP\r\n* Recommended items updated to reflect power of Guinsoo's and BotRK.\r\n\r\nW \r\n\r\n* MS %: 26 - 50 (+.1 AP) >>> 26 - 50 (+.08 AP)\r\n* Haste at end of 0.25s cast >>> Haste at start of 0.25s cast\r\n* No longer has ~1s cancel-able winddown after cast (could be canceled by spamming RMB on your target)\r\n\r\nE\r\n\r\n* Fixed 0.25 second cast time >>> Cast time now scales with AS (like a normal AA reset)\r\n\r\n\r\nMorgana\r\n\r\nWe're looking at Morg nerfs, with a focus on bringing her mid lane performance in particular down, since she's most out of line there. Aiming for a fairly light nerf right now.\r\n\r\nStats\r\n\r\n* HP5 5.5 >>> 4.5, given she's getting more healing via Tormented Soil\r\n\r\nW\r\n\r\n* Total Min AP Ratio :: .8 >>> .7 (.08 per half second >>> .07 per half second\r\n* Total Max AP Ratio :: 2.16 >>> 1.89\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Bounties**\r\n\r\nWe've been doing some further work on bounties for 9.6 and will have post detailing those out later these week, most likely tomorrow. Key things we've been focused on include having CS bounties diminish if enemies catch up on your CS lead, a somewhat slower rate of CS bounty building and support item gold contributing to CS bounties for the owner since those items are CS replacements. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------          \r\n**Clash tests follow up**\r\n\r\nAs mentioned last week we had some Clash tests over the weekend in BR, LAS and LAN. BRs went fairly smoothly, LAS ran into some issues on day 1 which also appeared to a lesser degree in LAN on day 2. We're digging into those with the intention of addressing whatever the cause is before the next round of testing. EU's tests which were scheduled for this weekend are postponed while we get those fixes in place. More details to follow once we've got them.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"YL 666","date":"2019-03-13T15:32:50.111+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":8,"body":"Hey Meddler,are you guys still doing works on Wukong?

By exchanging the Shock passive for the Mana shield active and potentially upping the amount of AD it grants by default or mana conversion grants?\n\nIf not, could you perhaps consider making Manamune stack in an identical way as Archangel's Staff? That being, +8 mana instead of +5 mana, and not granting +5 mana for free on-hit? One of the critical issues with the item is that it stacks too slow for modern game pacing. Typically the free mana charge is not something needed. And, in my opinion, champions should pay a mana price in order to stack it.\n\nThough admittedly, preferably I would not have Manamune and Archangel's Staff lock the other option out. I like getting both on Kog'Maw because of his hybrid scaling, but more importantly because he can actually use the massive mana pool with his **high** mana costs. And it isn't even strong on him, purely because the trade of early power for later power is too steep for Kog'Maw to not get abused by his opponents. Ezreal I guess sort of avoides this due to his inherint safety.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Almost Creative","date":"2019-03-13T15:41:26.083+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Any update about the new enchanter support?
