It means players have a bit more time to learn the game before diving into ranked.  Just my input though.\n\nOn the topic of the clarity posts I feel like sometimes clarity has to be sacrificed for game knowledge.  Honestly it still bugs me that I can't see how much health allied GP barrels have.  Considering how much of an impact they have I feel that knowing that is pretty essential, especially at earlier levels when they take a few seconds to reach 1 health.\n\nHow do you feel on the topic of having a clarity toggle option?  I personally would rather have all that information.  However that is the way I play games.  I love floods of info because that is how I focus.  I am that guy who actually reads the FF14 battle log to see when my allies start casting spells, when they finish the casts, every buff/debuff in the game getting both applied and fading away.  Most people don't like that info and for them clarity is the most useful.  Some of us want to know just what area and Ally Corki Q is hitting in though.  A toggle option for this would be wonderful imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-08-18T18:05:21.024+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, increasing number of champs required for ranked has some definite benefits. My personal suspicion is that that's probably at least as much a good thing as a bad, it's still something we need to assess though. \n\nClarity's one of those difficult values to work with. We do believe pretty strongly that showing everything is almost never the correct approach though, that ends up overloading a channel of information so badly it ceases to do anything useful. The buff bar's been a good example of that at times. When you get 10+ buffs on there it becomes really hard to pick out useful information quickly, so turns into a source of out of combat information primarily. Showing the few most important buffs by contrast shows less total information but conveys more.\n\nIn terms of optional toggles for some features  that makes a lot of sense and seem really high value (e.g. player name display). There are others though where cost of implementing the option outweighs the occasional value it offers (e.g. a toggle to allow allies to see the range Rengar can leap from brush with his passive whenever it's available). \n\nRegarding a combat log that's something I think's got some value, but as a separate feature that doesn't add noise to existing means of communication (not throwing a huge amount of info into the normal chat window for example). Priority on that's quite a bit lower than a lot of other projects we'd want to put time into first though.","replies":[{"poster":"Korend Slicks","date":"2016-08-18T18:23:32.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of curiosity, what would you think of having different pick and ban phases where it's like Ban two-Pick two and so on. It might be a good idea for pro play, since it might allow for potential increases in champion diversity. However, I'm not sure if it would even work for Solo/Dyna Queue, since that would definitely extend the champion select times. Might also cause a loss at champ select, which iirc Riot doesn't want that to occur at all (But it does happen on occasion).","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-08-18T22:55:06.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's an option, and a particularly appealing one in organized play where teams coordinate more and potentially have some information about their opponents.

Right now it seems to me runes lack a little luster, with a small portion being useful and run all the time, while another portion of them are barely used.\n-Increasing bans to 10 could actually lock out one specific roles. Your team could ban out the 5 best ADCs at the current time leaving them guessing who to play. Is this healthy game-play? (You can already do this with 3, but its best not to because of other roles. When 4 more bans are added there is a lot more possibilities and variety available.)\n-Juggling turret aggro, to me, is a fun aspect of the game that makes it challenging to early tower dive. Huge risk with high reward. If made impossible to juggle it removes early tower dives and the huge risk/high reward becomes more suicide/maybe reward.\n\nJust looking for some clarity in these. \n\"There is much to learn about this world.\" {{champion:161}}","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-08-18T18:34:56.178+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't have details yet on what we will or won't do with runes, how that would affect people's existing rune collections etc. It's something we'd want to talk about well in advance of actual changes though. \n\nThe potential for some roles to get effectively locked out is one of the big concerns that's been raised about 10 bans. We think it'll probably be ok, given the number of champions in each class at this point and that the extreme case requires both teams focus the same class. Need to confirm that though.\n\nWith you on agro juggling, both as something that drives cool play and a good skill to test.

Having teams ban a few champions, then pick a few champions, would prevent any Top-5 role shutouts from occurring. In fact, starting out with 5 or less bans then initiating a few picks would bring _less_ of a chance of getting a role shut out than we currently have, where six bans are handed out before any picks occur. What are your thoughts on this?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2016-08-18T22:07:29.982+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">The potential for some roles to get effectively locked out is one of the big concerns that's been raised about 10 bans.\n\nWhen I comes to subclasses though, 10 could ban out a role.  Take healers.  If I wanted to play one, it wouldn't be that hard for the other team to ban out Soraka, Sona, and Nami effectively banning me out from that role.  If the jungle favored a meta, I could see that class of junglers have the potential for getting banned out.  I could also see most of the better assassins getting banned out if an assassin meta came around.  Those would be my main class concerns with 10 bans.\n\nThe other two problems I could see arising is it would be easier to ban out popular and OP champs firstly.  Secondly is while this doesn't apply to most players, the LCS champ pool might shrink even more.\n\nSince I want to be a solutions guy and not just a problem guy:\n\n1.  Can the system automatically ban out 10 champs instead of the players, maybe focusing slightly more on ones with high pick rates or high win rates?\n\n2.  Since players are assigned to a lane, maybe limit their bans to champs that show up in that lane.  Going back to healers, the other support would be able to ban Soraka, but Sona and Nami are still open as long as I don't ban one of them.  People would still be able to limit what they can face, but just for their lane.","replies":[{"poster":"DevlinCrow","date":"2016-08-19T13:14:55.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) How do they know you're definitely going to play a healer that game?\n2) Why would they ban a specific role instead of the best champs in other roles?\n3) With 3 bans that is already possible","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Eskimo503","date":"2016-08-18T18:53:32.285+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think for the new Tower global \"call for help\", some special cases need to be accounted for- maybe damage over time ( {{champion:63}} ,  {{champion:90}} , {{champion:122}}  ) effects don't proc the global \"call for help\", as it would be cumbersome to wait for all enemies running back to base to stop bleeding in order to go back to attacking the turret.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-08-18T22:58:04.310+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, there's a range limit in there so that shouldn't be an issue (currently 1400, so slightly under vision range).","replies":[{"poster":"ntbcool","date":"2016-08-18T23:21:44.986+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's good and all but it would really suck if you pressure someone out of lane playing Darius and go to hit the tower and they just poke into range to force you off.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-08-18T18:35:10.646+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember you (or Reav3, not sure) mention Yoricks rework would be in 6.19-6.21 before, but it was also mentioned that he could be in 6.18, but be disabled for worlds.\nIs it safe to say 6.18 Yorick rework is completely out of question now? :c\n\n_I was honestly really hoping for 6.18 Yorick after that E indicator got uploaded to PBE :c_","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-08-18T22:57:12.259+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll leave talking about exact Yorick timing up to the Champ Up team.
