At this point it&#039;s statistically only just below the average power level of the other drakes. Perception of its impact is dramatically lower however. We&#039;re going to try an experimental, and fairly sizable, buff as a result in 6.14 to see what effect impact that has. Current plan is 25 out of combat momvement speed per stack instead of 15. \r\n\r\nThere&#039;s a reasonable risk this is a mechanic that&#039;s never going to be sufficiently appreciable relative to its power however. It&#039;s possible as a result that we might replace out of combat movement speed with a different movement effect at some point (we do think strategic movement&#039;s a good niche for a drake buff). First step though is getting a better understanding of the current mechanic, including whether it&#039;s actually good for the game if strategic movement offered in this way is really strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Assassins: **\r\n\r\nWill be our next class update in the end of year Pre-Season (November or December). Statikk talks about our goals in some detail in the link below. TLDR is more diverse assassins with more ways for other players to interact with them.\r\n\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/Tnfw1WW6-next-class-update-the-assassins\r\n\r\n\r\n**Support stuff:**\r\n\r\nA number of support focused changes are coming in 6.13 (which probably releases next week). We&#039;ve also got some champion changes that showed promise but need more testing time. We&#039;ll probably have at least some of those in 6.14 (Leona, maybe Sona, possibly some Alistar stuff we&#039;ve been playing around with etc).\r\n\r\nIn terms of the 6.13 changes some of the most significant are those to the XP system and to some items. Couple of posts below from Xypherous that run through a lot of the thinking behind those changes:\r\n\r\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/XWNXaWcc-613-planned-adjustments-to-secondary-systems-part-1-experience-changes\r\n\r\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/NT7UcOWt-613-planned-adjustments-to-more-stuff-part-2-teleport-support-item\r\n\r\n\r\n**Focusing a bit more on Pro Play in 6.14 and 6.15**\r\n\r\nFinally we&#039;ll be prioritizing work on champs that are particular problems in pro play a bit more in the next couple of patches (6.15 is the patch for most, or possibly all, of the Worlds qualifiers). First up we&#039;ve got changes to Rek&#039;Sai (initial thought - slower tick rate on Tremor sense?) and Azir (less early damage, more of a marksman like damage curve over the course of the game?). There will probably be some more changes prioritized by pro play impact in 6.15 too (Viktor and Karma look likely, potentially others like Elise?).","replies":[{"poster":"Utility Veigar","date":"2016-06-24T21:44:52.085+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is Heimer getting any changrs that will make him viable in pro scene and somewhat viable/healthy in ranked?

Karma has existed with this power level for much longer than she's been a popular pick. Peeling off the layers from from other supports has made her rise in popularity, but the effect she's having on the game isn't distorting other than her increased pick rate in LCS regions. Her average winrate in competitive play is below 50%, as is her solo queue one. http://lol.esportswikis.com/wiki/Karma/Statistics/2016\n\nI don't think Karma's pickrate is necessarily a reflection of her power level. She's a healthy midlaner and a priority support that doesn't really make teams win more games compared to other meta supports. The reasons why she's prioritized is unclear, she's being used as a bit of a jack of all trades that, in the past, paled to other similar options. I'd hate to see her nerfed unreflectingly; it took many rounds of buffs to see her be competitively viable and I fear an overreaching change will ensure she goes back into the darkness. \n\nWhen you guys say \"we're considering nerfs for x\", you include those nerfs during the first day of the cycle.

Can we make the mantras harder to choose from? Like not having RW scale with %hp, but have a flat heal that increases a lot on low hp (making it less OP on tank Karma, and more useful without tank stats)? Maybe give RW a more reliable way of helping, instead of having a long root, that her kit can't use (some people suggested ally healing)? And maybe the damage back on her RE (=shieldbomb)? It was a part of Karma for so long, people love it, and the decision when and where to cast it, made it actually hard to use.
