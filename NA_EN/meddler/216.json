The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Zoe**\n\nTo state the obvious, Zoe&#039;s been a controversial champion. She creates some really fun moments and does some really unique and interesting stuff. She&#039;s has also been a source of a lot of player frustration and remains too powerful. We&#039;ve been chipping power off her in various ways, overall though they haven&#039;t made enough of a difference. We&#039;ll be nerfing her quite a bit harder in 8.4 (next patch) as a result. In retrospect this is a situation where we should have made larger changes earlier and we need to get better at figuring out when to go from smaller tuning to larger changes in cases like this. We should also have been talking more about our thoughts on her as well, even if that sometimes wasn&#039;t more conclusive than exposing a lot of the debate going on amongst us here.\n \nLikely changes for 8.4:\n\n* Q: Only applies her passive damage on primary target hit. That reduces her wave clear, particularly ability to kill caster minions with one Q, reducing her power from gold and ability to shove/roam as easily. It also makes it harder for her to harass through a wave and makes it easier for allies to block Qs intended for sleeping allies. \n* W: Is no longer able to drop teleport. Teleport creates some cool plays, and is the only real out of combat drop to be had. At the same time though its power is generally significantly higher than the options and it doesn&#039;t present opponents with good ways to play around it either (which is particularly important with randomly picked effects).\n* E: Drowsy can now be cleansed, preventing the sleep from happening. That makes Cleanse, QSS, Mikael&#039;s noticeably better responses to her. We originally thought that the appropriate degree of cleanse countering Zoe E was to have the player choose between being able to reposition faster before falling asleep (cleansing the slow) or breaking the sleep once it hit. Having seen Zoe get a lot of play since her release though it&rsquo;s clear at this point cleanse effects ought to be a stronger counter, rather than a partial one. \n* E: CD increased, giving more windows where she can&#039;t threaten lethal as well and/or can be engaged on.\n* R: Bug fix, but one that&#039;s potentially power impacting: Was granting the ability to move through units for the entire game after the first cast, rather than just for a very brief period when she returned to the cast point.\n \nAs you&#039;ve probably noticed, there&#039;s no nerf to her Q damage in that list, though that&#039;s certainly a point of a lot of player frustration. We&#039;re confident the above changes are both a significant power reduction and changes that, regardless of whether we do or don&#039;t also nerf the Q at some point, are improvements to Zoe&#039;s play pattern. If we did follow up with a Q nerf, or if the above ends up being too heavy a hit, we&#039;ll also need to look at appropriate places to give Zoe power (she&#039;s pretty dependent on her Q burst to function). That could involve things like making W&#039;s damage contributions more meaningful later in the game. \n \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Summoner Spell CDs on the Scoreboard**\n\nThe display of those is currently bugged, making them much harder to read than they should be. On CD Summoners should show as much greyer/dimmer like they previously did. We&#039;re testing a fix for that at present, should be in the next patch at the latest. We&#039;ll also be reverting the orientation change, so Summoner spells are again shown vertically rather than horizontally. That was a well intented change that didn't hit the mark.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Keystone Development**\n\nWe&#039;re still working on that new keystone for the Resolve tree (probably) previously mentioned. Some aspects of it are still in flux, one thing that&#039;s looking promising (though also not yet guaranteed) is having some of its reward be some dual percent pen (both some % armor pen and some % magic pen). That makes it appealing on champs with mixed damage types, helps out its users against tanky front lines and helps distinguish it from other sustained damage keystones.\n\nOne challenge that goes with that is then ensuring that keystone&#039;s best users aren&#039;t exclusively ranged champs, getting another % scaler on already high offense builds, and/or champs building full tanks looking to multiply their base damages. We&#039;re looking at mechanics like a trigger on proximity to enemies, scaling with offensive stats etc as a result.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Lissandra**\n\nFollowing on from a question from earlier in the week: Lissandra. She&#039;s got a couple of issues. She&#039;s too weak and her passive&#039;s not interesting or satisfying to most players. We&#039;ll be taking a look at her sometime in the next few patches (8.6 ish?). Minimum target there is to offer her some more power. It&#039;s possible we also end up improving or replacing her passive, don&#039;t want to make any promises there that we might not be able to deliver on though, beyond that we&#039;ll be at least looking at it. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n**Next Week**\n\nAmongst other things planning to talk about a couple of other requested topics from this week:\n\n* Marksmen play patterns and thoughts on what&#039;s healthy/unhealthy \n* Mastery curves and how we think about them when designing and balancing\n \nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Roigaar","date":"2018-02-09T17:05:24.090+0000","up_votes":49,"down_votes":7,"body":"Hey, Meddler. I really dislike having to do this because I think these types of threads often get derailed by tone-deaf \"buff my champ when?\" posts, but I feel like this topic has gone completely under the radar. You guys have spent the last couple of months trying to address the state of toplane by adjusting runes, champions (those that seem[ed] to be struggling, like bruisers, as well as those that seemed to be unduly strong, like lane bullies drawing too much power from runes). None of those discussions/changes have taken Quinn into account.\n\nQuinn is the type of champion that you would expect to come up often since she's been typically considered one that bruisers in particular seem to have a hard time going against, and it should have been an alarm to you that she is *utterly absent* from the string of complaint posts that have appeared here and in other forums about the state of toplane. I invite you to control + F Quinn in the most vitriolic posts about toplane balance (you know the ones I'm talking about), or watch the high-elo community videos like Wicked's referenced tierlists, and you'll see what I mean.\n\nTo summarize the issue: Quinn's playrate has been falling dramatically over the weeks since preseason, to a point where she's beginning to disappear from data gathering sites, and instead of seeing winrate increases that usually happen when only players with 50+ games play a champion, her winrate has gone down by 3-4% according to most sources.\n\nQuinn is struggling. She has received indirect nerfs in almost every patch since preseason hit, the most egregious being lethality values going down across the board when the AD assassins and casters seemed out of line, but has also suffered from nerfs to almost every major rune she can viably spec into, including Press the Attack, Celerity, Eyeball Collection, Sudden Impact, Coup the Grace and Triumph repeatedly.\n\nThis period was supposed to evaluate where champions landed in terms of power level after preseason. Despite being a niche champion, Quinn previously appeared to be appropriately tuned considering her play rate, winrates. As you balance the things around her, that is no longer the case, but she is absent from the conversation. Her stats as a niche champion should be cause for alarm. Her situation has deteriorated immensely in the span of two months, she was significantly healthier on 7.22.\n\nAnd we would understand some apprehension: Quinn has historically been a champion that tends to cause frustrations in toplane, but that is simply a nonissue given her current power level. Moreover, there are plenty of parts in her kit where power can be altered not to contribute to alienating melee champions, such as W’s and R’s many levers. \n\nI can't stress this enough. Her playrate has **plummeted**, reaching sub 1% levels, only behind Volibear and Mordekaiser. Her winrate has dropped several points even though mains make up for the majority of her appearances. You guys continue to nerf tools she relies in, and in the current toplane discussion where she would normally get flak, she has been conspicuously absent because she is irrelevant in this state. This situation feels **wrong** and we are worried she will be held in this state indefinitely. Can we get you guys to at least comment on this situation?","replies":[{"poster":"Gurdi","date":"2018-02-09T22:02:00.168+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am an ADC Quinn player, but I was interested in this post and grabbed the top lane matchup table I gathered from last week to investigate Quinns problems. The matchup winrate difference can be viewed [in this image](https://i.imgur.com/PrUZXeE.png)\n\nShe loses mostly against: currently very very strong meta champions (gangplank and camille), champions with auto attack reducers (nasus, jax, teemo), and tank champions (especially malphite and maokai).\nShe has good matchups against: squishy champs (riven, trynda, rumble, pantheon).\n\nThese findings might indicate that:\n - The increased popularity and especially of tank champions with either more damage or more durability since preseason results in Quinn having some very hard losing matchups\n - The popularity of Quinn is hindered by the current popularity of anti- auto attack champions.\n - She still has a place versus squishy champions and fighters but they are also less popular since the preseason mostly due to tanks outperforming the fighters.\n\nMy conclusion is that she still is good versus a lot of less popular melee champions and popular squishy champions, but the increased power of tanks results in some frustrating heavy losing lanes while she traditionally could farm early game and win by roaming instead of trying to kill the tank. Thus, I think she has the same problems as the other top lane fighters at the moment making this not an issue to Quinn specifically. ADC Quinn has some other issues and perks but I focus on top lane in this post :P. \n\nWhat do you think has to be changed to either quinn specifically or top lane in general to make it more healthy?","replies":[{"poster":"jadelink","date":"2018-02-10T05:08:58.291+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"A nerf to GP would likely increase diversity in top a lot...

She's like Pantheon in that way. I think she could do with a change to her passive to remove the RNG factor from laning and give more skill expression. \n\nI also think that she as a champion is fine, but the state of top lane in general right now is bad for champions that want win lane, so Quinn is obviously going to suffer as well. If nerfs end up coming to early tank itemization she will be able to come back into the meta with champions such as Renekton. \n\nIn addition, though she should be a lane counter to Gangplank in this meta, there are several other champions that fulfil this niche better, including Lucian. I think it will be hard for Quinn to exist in solo lanes while Lucian does a similar job in lane and is more useful later on.","replies":[{"poster":"Roigaar","date":"2018-02-09T19:31:12.170+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"But she hasn't been strong ever Skystrike's AD ratio got nerfed. We don't want to return to those power levels, and are the first to admit that simply adding flat damage is going to induce more frustrations that it will solve issues for Quinn players, but there are plenty of things that could be done to add power without buffing the parts of Quinn's kit that feel frustrating to play against.\n\nI don't think she's fine, her playrate has fallen from slightly below average to the third worst in the game in a span of two months. She has suffered from meta changes, yes, but she's also been collateral damage for nerfs aimed at other targets, while her counterparts have been getting buffs to address *their* poor state relative to the meta and the tools they have at their disposal. Quinn isn't even in the discussion. It's not just tanks.\n\nQuinn has always had to compete with some of these champions, and despite being a niche champion, she's been fine during periods where the meta has been far more hostile to her than it is now. She has gotten progressively worse. She's not awful, but she was in a much healthier place before preseason. She doesn't feel particularly powerful during the periods where she should be, and given her power curve that's an issue, because the later it goes, the harder it is for her to have an impact as a short ranged AD with no on-demand steroid, no mitigation mechanics outside of Q, and a single-target intensive damage profile, same weaknesses that usually make her balanced.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Strongholde","date":"2018-02-09T18:02:56.341+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"is it possible that both her playrate and winrate have fallen due to an absence of champs she has favorable lanes against, or am I dumb and have seen so little of her in the first place that I dont see any bad matchups? no flame intended, just genuinely curious","replies":[{"poster":"Rework Quinn","date":"2018-02-09T19:35:22.888+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, you're not dumb, but it's mainly the second reason.

We did some surveying and overall satisfaction was about the same before and after the changes. Belief is that reflects some people who are dissatisfied because of the lost options, some people who are genuinely neutral and some who like the build flexibility it gives. We'll be bringing a standalone Twin Shadows back in 8.4 as the first step to help that first group, then Shurelia's (Talisman active) in 8.6 most likely. Still considering an Active Item CDR option (though would need to come with an actual Active Item CDR cap) and whether or not a FoTM active replacement is also needed.\n\nIn terms of wider ecosystem stuff, there are also some edge cases with non supports utilizing the Bandit passive. Looking into whether that's abusive and a coming balance problem or just an unusual build that's fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Qualdrion","date":"2018-02-09T17:23:36.957+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you considered reintroducing the spellthief quest reward?

I’ve seen a lot of complains about the Precision Keystones being weak (and little impactful), so, I have some suggestion to some of them (Precision tree), and also some insights on some Sorcery Keystones. I know you guys already have some buffs for PTA planned, but I thinkg you guys are aiming on the wrong aspects to change.\n\n**Press the attack –** The problem with PTA is that this Rune has a support oriented mechanic. Increasing the damage by all sources, means that this Rune can’t be buff enought without becoming op. My suggestion: Change the increased damage from All Sources to Only the Champion who has the Rune, this way you can increase this damage and make this a good sustaining damage Rune.\n\n**Lethal Tempo –** Is easily countered and easy to avoid. Why not take some ideas from our beloved fervor and put it here? My suggestion: Attacking na enemy Champion grants a stack of “Tempo”. Each “Tempo” stack grants X% attack speed (scale with level). When you reach 5 “Tempo” stacks, they’ll transform into “Lethal Tempo” granting more attack speed (a burst of attack speed) and removing your attack speed cap for X seconds. (You can also put a cooldown on “Tempo” stacks gaining after Lethal Tempo expires).\n\n**Fleet Footwork –** Its ok, the problem is that the other 2 Precision Runes are garbage. Also, the fact that this Rune is a sustain oriented Rune, this mean that take the other 2 Runes against this, will automatically make you lose the lane because you can’t sustain enough against a Champion with this. Suggestion: Make this Rune only procs on champions, this way you don’t need to gutted it. I know that this maybe will imply on doing changes on how energizes work, because energizeds attack need to proc on minions, in value to the clearwave from statikk, but maybe you guys could make a way for something like this to work, just don't ruin this Rune).\n\n**Sorcery**\n\n**Aery –** Aery offensive mode should work only on spells. This is the SORCERY tree, which means is about resources and spells, so, auto attacks should not be able to have synergy here. By removing it interaction with auto attack, you can make it better on spells procs, maybe Aery could be attached to the target (mark) and make it receive extra damage on the next allied spell, based on YOUR ap/ad. So, basically some kind of “Leona passive”. This way you would’t make Aery a raw damage Rune, and make it more distinte from Comet.\n\n**Phase Rush –** Phase Rush could be more interesting. Is very good on some champions, but a very few. My suggestion: Decreasing the cooldown based on level (15-10) and after the  3 seconds of the slow resist and movement speed, if the Champion stills in combat, it will keep 50% of the movement speed for 2 more seconds (only the ms, not the slow resist). For example, I’m fighting and uses Phase Rush , I'll gain +40% ms, AND if after 3 seconds I have still fighting with my enemy, so for the next 2 seconds, I’ll have +20% ms. This could help a little this Rune in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"ITakeYoSandwich","date":"2018-02-10T01:05:54.034+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upvoted for everything except Fleet Footwork.
