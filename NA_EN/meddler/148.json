The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Zac stuff in testing**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re trying out some Zac changes at the moment. Goal of those is to make his Q a less powerful spell, through lower reliability in particular, and then buff him in other ways.  Possible changes look like Q having less range and a shorter less break distance, but in exchange Q CD starting on first cast, rather than Q2 or expiration, plus a bit more damage on W. Overall goal would be a slight buff. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Looking at AP junglers a bit**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re going to take a look at a couple of AP champs from a jungle perspective, see if we can give them a bit of help. Not sure on timing, given there&#039;s some more critical work (runes stuff mainly) that&#039;s demanding a lot of work right now, hoping to do some explorations during the next few patches though. That might mean work on AP champs who already jungle, or at least used to in the past, could also mean work on AP champs with play patterns that would be fine in the jungle who just haven&#039;t been good enough at clearing historically to do so (e.g. someone like Morg might be a good candidate, Annie given her high reliability when ganking probably not). \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Eve Homeguard Anim**\r\n\r\nNo promises, but we&#039;re looking at potential ways to include the previous Eve Homeguard animation (link below to a video) as a hidden easter egg somehow.

It seems like it's a great opportunity to get a lot more variety into the jungle and enable some really cool team compositions -- anything from extra damage to damage resistance to monsters to mana restoration seems like a great way to enable interesting junglers without skewing their laning phase.\n\nMy initial thought is because, in addition to possibly adding a bit of extra power in specific situations, those statistics can skew perceptions into believing that champion is INTENDED as a jungle pick rather than simply able to be one, but I'd love to know your opinion on the subject.\n\nI'm thinking specifically about unique possible junglers here -- people like Akali, Aurelion Sol, Diana, Fiora, Illaoi, Gnar, Karthus, Lissandra, Malphite, Morgana, Orianna, Renekton, Rumble, Tahm Kench, Taliyah, Vladimir, etc -- characters who may have the AoE damage or the interesting gank possibilities but don't have the power or the sustained damage to survive clears efficiently (or junglers who need a little jungle edge without a power spike).","replies":[{"poster":"whyrawr","date":"2017-10-21T02:59:12.683+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kled can become huge in jungle if just let him gain courage from monsters.\nRito pls","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RheosTargaryen","date":"2017-10-20T20:57:59.877+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Put the {{champion:28}} homeguard animation as basic walk after penta because with no one to kill she have nothing to hide anymore","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dokueki Kenshin","date":"2017-10-20T19:33:49.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler, hope your day is going well.

Eve's Q is more so for upfront burst damage, and it is all about how fast one can mash Q, after that first skillshot, to stab people with spikes. Ekko uses his Q for waveclear as well, but he has to wait for the extra damage on the rewind. Eve's W is a far more offensive spell than Ekko's W, since its hard CC with shred, as well as single target, instead of hard CC and shield, that's AOE. Eve's is a short ranged gap closer, while Ekko's is actually pretty long ranged, in comparison, 225 to 750.
