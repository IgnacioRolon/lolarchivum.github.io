The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**More thoughts on damage later this week**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re doing some planning around where damage comes from in LoL at present as mentioned previously. Should have some further thoughts to share in more detail later this week. Things we&#039;re particularly looking at are:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Different systems damage is coming from (how much from kits, versus items, versus runes etc)\r\n* How much damage, from non kit sources in particular, is front loaded (burst versus sustain)\r\n* Which damage sources should/shouldn&#039;t stack together (non stacking unique passive on items for example)\r\n\r\nFor anyone that missed it also talked last week about how lack of tanks (defensive ones especially) being played can also contribute to damage being high (less champs to soak, more champs per team with high damage output). \r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/2RzBfAcE-quick-gameplay-thoughts-july-27\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**Experimental Game Modes**\r\n\r\nAs you&#039;ve probably seen we&#039;re trying something new at the moment where we&#039;re putting out a somewhat rough prototype. Goal there is to get early feedback from you folks on what is/isn&#039;t working, help figure out whether a mode has the potential to be a permanent addition to LoL or not. Feedback on the mode (currently called Nexus Blitz), much appreciated.  Would be particularly helpful to hear which of the elements that aren&#039;t like other game modes you do or don&#039;t enjoy. Also really interested to hear how your thoughts compare before playing it and after. Are there things that sounded good on paper that weren&#039;t fun in practice, or vice versa?\r\n\r\nWe&#039;d also love to hear what sort of things you&#039;d like to see tried if we do any further public prototypes like this. Depending on how this goes we might give it another shot with a different mode at some point. \r\n\r\nAnnouncement post for Nexus Blitz for those that haven&#039;t seen it already:\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/yKk22n3O-experimental-modes-nexus-blitz\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**Gold Funneling penalty in 8.15**\r\n\r\nWe made a couple of adjustments to the gold funneling penalty on jungle items in 8.15. The first is having it also apply to Twisted Treeline, based particularly off feedback collected from the regions with higher rates of TT play (EUW, EUN, NA, BR, LAN). Let us know how that additon&rsquo;s feeling for you if you play TT, we&rsquo;re certainly open to adjusting it further if needs be.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second change, which also affects SR, is having the penalty only apply when you&rsquo;ve got the most CS on a team, rather than the most gold. That should remove a lot of cases where early kills result in junglers who aren&rsquo;t being funneled get an early gold lead and therefore get inappropriately penalized. Feedback on that also much appreciated. In particular if you found the 8.14 approach really penalizing, would be great to hear whether this works better for you or whether it&rsquo;s still feeling like you&rsquo;re being penalized at times when playing normally. \r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2018-08-01T21:37:11.926+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler\nSomething I've wondered for a long time is.\n\nDo you actually read through these entire threads page by page poring over every single comment?\nor do you just kinda AMA the first come first serve questions then not look back at all and go back to work/regular life stuff?\n\nnot trying to throw shade or anything just legitimately interested because I notice what happens is that the first 15 or so questions get a response then as like 90+ more questions pour in there is just radio silence for the next few days until the next \"gameplay thoughts\" come in.\n\nIts always confused me how like if one just leisurely had free time during lunch/off work could you not come back and answer more of these to put some more worried or curious players at ease.\nare you only allowed to post during office hours or something?\nIs there a set amount of post you are allowed to make?\n\nits just really weird  and I would to know rather or not I should bother typing up post or responses in a these threads after the initial 6~24 hours passes","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-08-01T21:58:39.114+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I put a chunk of time aside in the morning to respond to posts.

Zacs my beacon of hope, the blobby trail path I presume to follow in hopes for a return to his former gooey self. I think he needs to be loved, by more than his pre reworked followers but by the riot team themselves. \n\nThere’s a few suggestions on reddit for improvements ~ \nOne suggested to bring back ratio on w as a quality of life improvement for off-role playstyle as it wont affect pro play but bring a build variation to his solo q.\n\nAnother suggested that zac had additional affects based on how many blobs have been picked up which buffs his overall kit and feeling but not break him such as every 10th blob picked up resets w CD immediately or every xth blob picked up increases base damage of q/w/e/r by x \n\nA lot of suggestions of a reverted ultimate, which I also lean towards.\n\nReduce the range of his Q to melee, but hand stretches while it’s attached to his target allowing him to chase another target to get in meele range to apply the collision of the second part of his q. So the second q  which also must be applied in melee range is a nerf to the effectiveness of executing the q cc for something like more damage elsewhere or for additional blobs drop maybe 2x drop to 4x blobs which would make zac feel tankier and make w feel more useful with the lower CD when the blobs are picked up and it will also help his clear speeds and encourage his skirmish and dueling. This would encourage different playstyles and make landing e more rewarding as it allows for a easy q interaction during the cc duration and also interacts with his passive healing and w CD and punishes missing the e more.

Some ideas are mine and some I've read include:\n\n* Spell Thief shards could use an item pool based off level to gate better shards/spells until later in the game.\n* Using Spell Thief fizzles all shards in a radius around her. So she can't bank spells on the ground from minions.\n* Can't pick up new shards for 5-10 seconds after using spell thief.\n* Spell thief shards from minions grant blank spells that only activates her W without doing anything else.\n* Balloons show the spell inside to Zoe's enemies. Allowing them to attempt to deny her last hit on the balloon minion when it's an impactful spell.\n* Lower W passive damage but allow Zoe to charge a neutral W activation. More consistent access to W _baseline_ means the damage can be reduced thus allowing the best case W passive damage to be lowered.\n* Last hitting a minion with a Balloon releases the Balloon as an object Zoe must auto once to release the spell. Add time to pick up by requiring her to interact with the Balloon first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AtaxiChaos","date":"2018-08-01T16:33:08.964+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Nexus Blitz were to fail as a permanent mode, despite its current positive feedback, would it still have the possibility of still being developed into an rgm?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-08-01T17:35:21.096+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that'd be one of the possibilities we'd look into if it worked in some regards but wasn't a good fit for a permanent mode.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zoli Ben","date":"2018-08-01T15:50:04.169+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi Meddler!

I don't want or need those potions often in those match ups.\n\nI want to take a {{item:1004}} **faerie charm**, or a {{item:1006}} **Rejuv bead**. And this completely removes that high risk/ high reward option. But with a 50 gold increase, that's impossible now. You don't have pots, so you either dodge the skill shots, or you make yours count with more spells from my fairy charm. It's a fun way to play, and I don't want to see it accidentally removed because something else is oppressive.\n\nTLDR: **I implore you to reconsider the pricing from _350>400_, instead make it _375 gold_, and we both get what we want. All supports can't buy another potion, making poke more impactful, but if you want to you could still opt for the beads or charms. ** \n\nThanks for your time! \nLaunchpad","replies":[{"poster":"TomiMan7","date":"2018-08-01T19:34:29.374+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont really care about those item, i much more sad about that i cant start with {{item:2031}}.

I feel that the removal of the old runes system is the culprit and I would like to elaborate on that. \nNot only is it impossible to get the usual 12 armor and 6 mr along with 10% CDR at level one, but the new runes are heavily focused on increasing damage, and in most cases the worst kind of damage: burst damage. We live in a frustrating state of the game where everyone is trying to outburst the oponent as oposed to longer fights with more outplay opportunities. That is especially true in the early game, with vastly lower resistances. Remember windpeaker's blessing? It was a very interesting keystone mastery designed for enchanter supports that helped keep their adc alive without giving them huge insane shields. \nThere are specific champions that for example relied on the lvl 1 CDR to get through the laning phase successfully (cough Riven cough), but this is just an example. \nThe old system allowed players to pick runes that cattered to their own unique playstyles. Maybe some prefered to go full mana regen runes, or full MS. I personally quite enjoyed going CDR+AS as Kayle, something that is no longer possible and which made playing Kayle with my particular playstyle impossible (thus why I never play her anymore). \nNowadays the runes offer very limiting options, usually if you want something, you have to give up on another specific thing. The old system was not only more versatile but focused more on strengthening the players in the early game and it wasn't all about increasing damage/burst damage.\n\nI'd be interested to hear what you think about my two cents, but I won't blame you if you don't have time to answer.\nHave a nice day, \nValentin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Inventive","date":"2018-08-01T17:34:34.993+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thoughts on some Champs haveing insane burst with Stormrazor, Drakthar and Stattiks, while still having decent AD and Attackspeed?","replies":[]},{"poster":"TomiMan7","date":"2018-08-01T17:30:49.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since supports are viewed as low income high impact role, would you guys willing to change this by allowing supports to get more gold by skill, BUT increasing the cost of their items? This could be a new way to show off a support skill in some way, so there could be a massive difference between a bad a mediocre and a good support, and that could reflect in how early they can get their items, or not. If a support plays well they are rewarded and will be able to get their item, if they dont play well they will fall behind.\n\nTips on income: \nreward for providing good vision(already proposed this giving gold if a ward placed by a sup spots an enemy. Ofc ther should be restrictions so cannot be abused)\nhigher reward for clearing vision\nbring back bandit since only supports can buy it now\nmaybe even increase the chances to get gold from items(reducing the dmg part on spelthiefs, the regen on targon, dunno for coin)\netc.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Queš","date":"2018-08-01T15:47:45.401+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Thoughts on {{champion:266}} ?\n\nAlso thoughts on the fact that conqueror is pretty much least used rune in high elo(toplane) ?","replies":[]}]}
