The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Rek&#039;Sai**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve got some follow up changes for Rek&#039;Sai in testing, though a bunch of them will be pretty hard to datamine. Mainly bug fixes and useability, though we&#039;re also testing an AD ratio buff on the ult, belief being that&#039;s still underperforming a bit versus where it should be.\r\n\r\nQ - does a better job of spell queueing\r\nW - Standardized unburrow time for W reactivation versus right click (right click was slightly slower), knockback for secondary targets now clears the CC properly on knockback end (was lingering sometimes)\r\nR - Ratio 1.6 -&gt; 1.85, CD updates properly for allies, visual effects clean up.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Ezreal**\r\n\r\nEz looks pretty weak at the moment. Some of that makes sense with the current meta, state of items in particular, which aren&#039;t so favorable to him. Something we&#039;ll want to consider before buffing him however is whether this is finally the time to do some work on his W, make it a more satisfying spell. Lot of value from doing that, main downside is that we&#039;ve got some other small updates in the queue already (Azir, LB being the main two). Would be looking for a W that had interesting skill expression, still felt right thematically for Ezreal and didn&#039;t remove gameplay or intended weaknesses from him (so not just W affecting minions or W removing the skilltest on who E hits for example).\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Rift Herald**\r\n\r\nRift Herald looks to be in a pretty good space still. We&#039;ll be making a slight buff most likely in the next patch however, increasing the gold reward for the kill from 25g to 100g. Goal there is to put a bit more power in for taking the camp in the first place, bringing up the baseline value a little even if you don&#039;t get much out of the summon itself (e.g. if your team&#039;s behind and can&#039;t support the push well). Also puts a bit more reward in for the jungler (usually) specifically.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Inhib Tower XP**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ll also be removing the XP inhib towers give at present in an upcoming patch. We removed most tower XP a while back, but looks like we missed that specific case. It&#039;s not a major impact, but it&#039;s a bit of extra snowball, that won&#039;t be appreciated or played around, in a situation where one team&#039;s already getting themselves into a powerful position (they&#039;ve taken an inhib tower). Snowball&#039;s got its place, good play should increase your chance of winning after all, but we still want it to be at the appropriate levels, clear, satisfying etc.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Xayah**\r\n\r\nSmall bit of follow up on Xayah coming in the next patch too, with her Q lockout now reducing with the amount of attack speed she&#039;s got. The lockout looks like it&#039;s having the appropriate impact in lane, but longer than needed later in the game.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Death Sounds**\r\n\r\nShortly, most likely in 7.14, we&#039;ll be testing out updated sounds for nearby allied and enemy champion deaths, aiming to make those a bit more distinct so team fights especially are easy to track. Bunch more details on those coming in the next week or two, feedback then much appreciated as to how clear they are/how they sound in general.","replies":[{"poster":"Comrad Black","date":"2017-06-20T16:33:18.778+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"...Could we get one of these with more info on tanks? Or top lane meta/balance in general?\n\nNot to repeat myself too much, but It just feels bad to be sold a huge pitch about how midseason would be amazing for game health and balancability, then follow up work takes the form of incremental damage buffs. Not better in-lane access to skillful parts of their kit, or tuning to improve itemization flexibility so an entire type of champion doesn't live and die by the state of Sunfire, just damage buffs.  \n\nIt's not a very fun time to be a tank/bruiser.","replies":[{"poster":"Chønklord","date":"2017-06-20T16:37:05.552+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":33,"body":"Don't bother asking about serious balance or gameplay update concerns; it's quite clear Meddler and other Rioters cherry-pick what/who they want to respond to, as evidenced by my comment down below being close to first posting, and it's just completely flat out ignored. \n\nThere's _no literal possiblity_ that Meddler didn't, at the very least, _scan_ my comment (now or previously) -- Meanwhile, single sentence \"easy\" questions are randomly answered in real-time in front of my face.\n\nIt's like if you had someone shouting and waving their hands next to you and instead of just acknowledging their presence, you greeted random passerby's.\n\nIt's a real slap in the face to someone who has genuine concerns and also possible ideas/suggestions.

There's **no way** Meddler didn't at least _glance_ at it -- it's not that easy to miss, you know -- yet other comments directly after mine were _immediately_ replied to.\n\nAs a long time player/customer who cares greatly about the future of League, I've invested not only a lot of time and money, but energy into trying to be useful in my limited capacity as a singular voice -- through offering what I can in the way of my own insights, ideas and creativity for Riot to make free use of, if they find any merits within them.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-06-20T17:39:38.684+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can give me a short version of the post I'll be able to give you a quick answer.

Either through runes or some other means. Current system obviously has limitations and lacks that in-game \"visual 'oomph'\", but we still get 9x runes and 3x quints of everything.\n\n**Q2**: Will there be _any_ major base stat modifier runes transitioned over, such as AD/AS/AP, MS/MR/HP; Scaling or Flat, etc? If so, will they be the same now just in \"bigger chunks\" (i.e. instead of 9x runes giving 8.5AD, having 2x runes give 8.5AD)? \n\n**Q3**: Will off-meta playstyles/builds be taken into consideration with the new system? E.g. On-hit/Tank Teemo (needs a lot of upfront early resistances and scaling hp); full crit dmg runes on Jhin/Panth; Spellvamp Karthus JG; stuff like that?\n\n**Q4**: Is there anyone or place where one can submit keystone rune concepts for the team to look at and maybe get inspiration from? If not, would you be open to providing such a avenue?\n\n**Q5**: Followup Is there a better way to be noticed / get in contact with you and other higher ups than the boards/reddit, and/or is Riot open to input from individuals in the community that may have valid suggestions or interesting concepts to work with?\n\n**Q6**: Finally, any thoughts on Rammus' W slow being reduced from 60% to something more manageable like 30%, or scaled per level or even removed altogether? He feels very..... asinine to play with when his whole identity revolves around _going fast and sticking to players_, yet completely dismantles that playstyle with the aggressive W slow _which literally makes him crawl on the rift_.\n\n***\n\nThank you for replying and for your time.

Few responses though since you've trimmed down a fair amount:\n\n* There'll still be some ways of modifying starting stats, through runes that give stats in some form, probably additional starting items etc. Some champs will also have their base stats or rank 1 abilities adjusted to ensure they still feel right and are balanced.\n\n* There'll be a lot of runes that enable off meta playstyles. Those won't necessarily be the same identical off meta playstyles as today though, with different content supporting new ones and likely not covering at least the more obscure old ones. On hit builds should have stuff they can spec into for example that helps them out, both offensively and defensively. With more specific stuff, like Spellvamp Jungle Karthus, I'd expect there'll be things that help Karthus jungle, though they won't necessarily be the exact same tools (e.g. could be other forms of survivability/sustain rather than starting spell vamp for example)\n\n* Posts on the Boards or Reddit are your best bets if trying to get discussion going with Rioters. We generally prefer to keep discussion public, both because the community often helps filter good ideas from bad and because there's a lot more benefit in having a conversation others can read too.
