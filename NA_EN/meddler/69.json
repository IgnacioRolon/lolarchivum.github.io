The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Thoughts on Senna so far**\r\n\r\nInitial thoughts on Senna below. It's still early days so these are more current observations than things we're extremely confident in.\r\n\r\n* Senna's looking a bit stronger than we predicted she'd be in her first few days. She's not sufficiently powerful to currently need balance changes however. She might end up being too strong in a while, depending on how her power grows as people master her kit, we'll wait and see before jumping to any conclusions though. We don't have any changes for her in 9.23, intent is to assess her again once we see where the combination of preseason changes and increasing player experience with her ends up. \r\n* From what we've seen she's effective as both a support and an ADC as hoped. Early indications are that both Lethality and Enchanter style builds are reasonable choices on support Senna. \r\n* Two of Senna's intended weaknesses seem to be present as hoped so far. She's vulnerable to getting jumped on and is more vulnerable to skill shots/AoEs while attacking, given how long her attack frame immobilizes her.\r\n* Senna's clearly too strong on ARAM. We're cutting her soul generation on ARAM back down to the same rates as on other maps as a result in 9.23. It was set higher for launch since other stacking champs have needed accelerated stacking on ARAM to avoid being excessively weak. That doesn't seem necessary in Senna's case now that we see how she actually performs in ARAM. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Kit Updates and the dangers of creating multiple incompatible audiences**\r\n\r\nA problem we've noticed with champions who've had their playstyles change really substantially is that we end up with multiple potential audiences for those champions whose needs can end up being incompatible. Karma's a particularly good example of that, with significant playerbase segments who want original Karma (1.11 to 3.4), initially reworked Karma (3.5 - 5.9) and current Karma (5.10+). While there's certainly overlap between what those groups want from Karma as a character there are also substantial differences. For cases like this as a result meeting the needs of one group can often come at the cost of excluding others. That's not a unique situation to kits that have been changed a lot, but it is a particularly amplified one. Other clear examples include Graves (bot lane players wanting a more standard ADC experience versus other players after the jungle/short range version) or Le Blanc (original/current kit versus the less bursty more clone focused kit the assassin update tried).\r\n\r\nGoing forward there are two things in particular we're keeping in mind for the next time we get a situation with incompatible group needs like that. The first is to try and identify cases where we've missed the mark for existing players quickly and then, if feasible/appropriate, adjust things before a significant player group become attached to the new form of the champion. Reverts like with Kog, LB and Rengar are examples of where that overall went well in our eyes since they happened comparatively quickly. The second is to avoid splitting audiences again if at all possible. Trying to serve two distinct audiences is tough already, adding a third direction to the mix makes it much harder again and all but guarantees we’'ll be leaving a lot of players unhappy.  \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------        \r\n**Some significant bugs being worked on**\r\n\r\nWhile I don't normally get into individual bugs here I figured these three had a wide enough impact that an update would be appropriate:\r\n\r\n* Camera locking sometimes even though you're playing with unlocked camera\r\n\r\nWe've got a fix for an issue causing this and will have it in 9.23 next week. \r\n\r\n* Client minimizing sometimes mid game when extra mouse buttons are pressed\r\n\r\nWe've got a lead on this one but don't have a fix yet. \r\n\r\n* Client Freeze/Crash in loading screen\r\n\r\nThis one's proven hard to track down a cause on. At time of writing we've just identified a possible cause and are about to start looking into what a fix would look like and what sort of timeframe that would involve. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------        \r\n**Upcoming TFT Patches**\r\n\r\nOverall we feel the new TFT Set is in a pretty good place balance wise. We'll be making moderately sized changes only as a result as we head into the start of the ranked season for TFT next week. We're expecting that some strategies will become clearly strong once ranked turns on and people start playing more optimally. Overall though we're cautiously optimistic based off play so far that Rise of the Elements will be easier to keep a wide range of comps viable in at once than Set 1 was, due both to the pool size changes and the design of its traits. \r\n\r\nIn patch 9.24 (last major patch of the year) we'll then be introducing a few new units to round out the roster a bit. Expect to see those on PBE next week, with two of those units being from a new class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-11-15T21:19:42.826+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"One update here - I'd forgotten that 9.23 was a three week patch.

But his rework destroyed a lot of what felt unique and interesting about him, being that you aren’t a burst mage you’re a dps zoning machine. Positioning around the constant stars was such an enjoyable experience, going through teamfights in his cosmic dance of kiting and positioning. Now he feels more binary, less interesting, and much more frustrating to play. Many of us old Aurelion Sol mains feel alienated now, that there is no champion that brings the same experience. I’ve tried and tried to enjoy it, but the reworked version of Aurelion Sol feels so wrong, it’s depressing to play something that’s pretending to be the champion you love but is just too different.

All you need to do is make it do reduced damage to minions and monsters. Sure taliyah is in a decent spot but as a 400k Taliyah one trick and speaking on behalf of the posts every day on the TaliyahMains reddit, Everyone agrees she is far less satisfying to play without her aoe q. I see it like this. When I started playing taliyah, I loved playing her because she was a “battle mage” and would constantly use her q to do aoe dps to a team in a teamfight, similar to azir and old Aurelion Sol. Now with the changes, she is more of a burst mage with some single target dps. Also, as was mentioned in the TaliyahMains discord, nothing feels more frustrating than being 3 kills ahead, landing a WE combo and then having a minion block all of your damage and then you die. I think that most taliyah mains don’t care about being able to permashove with aoe Q and I’m fine with her waveclear staying what is now. But the real purpose of the aoe q is to get some poke dmg in lane and do aoe dmg in teamfights. I would literally take the aoe q back even if it did 5% dmg to minions.

They play nothing the same even though  the abilities are the same because  how you use them is completely different. \n\nBruiser is considerably weaker than AP, while AD is not irrelevant, AD Shyvanas clear weakness of kiting only becomes more profound as mobility and kits with multiple things becomes more common place and as elo increases. Part of the reason AP Shyvana must be played more is because she ignores kiting and generally the champions that would give AD Shyvana trouble AP Shyvana decimates which are mostly META ones. \n\nDon't get me wrong I like having both, but currently AP Shyvana is the norm and AD is the \"specialist\" option. Most Shyvana players want AD Shyvana back in the spotlight, because of the fact that she does not play the same. You cannot jump in on AP Shyvana so her fantasy is lost as a Juggernaut.  \n\nIn short Shyvana does have the issue just in a different way since her kit is the same, but used very differently. Buffing/fixing AD Shyvana and having the option to go AP if the opportunity arises, is where Shyvana players want to be. Some hate AP Shyvana and want it gone, but I don't think that is the consensus. \n\nI don't think Shyvana will have much work done to her as she is not popular and likely close to her rework than most, but a way to mitigate the gap between AD and AP is likely some sort of health scaling option. Or a sustain/tenacity option that does not assist AP. Leaving AP at it's current power and bringing AD to it in a meaningful way will not only balance Shyvana, but be one of the few champions that can consistently run multiple builds.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2019-11-15T18:11:46.167+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you think {{champion:133}} falls under the 'incompatible audiences' issue?

Interesting to see a focus on it now so many seasons later since there have been a number of reworks already.  Some cases of splitting audiences:\n\n1.  Old Viktor was a sieging mage with a silence who focused on long range laser snipes and staying away from the enemy.  New Viktor (comparatively, at this point he was reworked a long time ago) is more about lining up Q hits and kiting around medium ranges.\n2.  Old Skarner used to be a bruiser focused on repeatable crowd control, the new one (with spires) seems to be very focused on being an engage tank who exists for R.\n3.  Old Aatrox was an on hit champion with his revive, and the new one is an ability based champion who layers crowd control in team fights similar to Riven.\n4.  Old Sejauni had less crowd control, but a stronger R, and now is focused around stacking her E.\n\nThere are more, and I was glad to see the Zac revert as the old reworked ultimate of grabbing enemies was never going to be balanced for the long term.  More recently the Swain rework was a large departure from his original play style (DoT oriented lane bully to mid game catcher).  Although have to appreciate that KingCobra put in a lot of time talking with Swain players a few patches ago when they added the HP stacking from souls.\n\nIs this a concern for the upcoming Volibear and Fiddlesticks reworks?","replies":[{"poster":"insejuaniwetrust","date":"2019-11-15T21:20:10.755+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I miss old seju,  he was a character that was better balanced than the new one that this hopefull reverse","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2019-11-15T18:11:18.891+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Regarding Split Audiences:\n\n{{champion:133}} - Any chance we might see some elements of her old Tag Team ult back?

An initial look at it (and some PBE experimenting) makes this rune appear largely mediocre, as you have to constantly pay attention to which rune you're given (sometimes in tense situations), and you can't be sure you'll actually get runes that meaningfully benefit you -- and, perhaps more importantly, you're trading a known quantity you can plan your laning phase around for one that's in the hands of psuedo-RNG. In short, it feels like a rune that requires a lot of attention and may only be viable if it's fairly heavily overtuned in terms of overall keystone usage.\n\nIn your testing, have you found situations where this rune is the optimal one? If so, on what characters? If not, are you content with this being more of a \"fun RNG\" rune?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nascy","date":"2019-11-16T16:31:14.988+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adding to the Taliyah talk earlier , it seems very likely Taliyah jg will be fairly strong with the jungle changes while her counters are being nerfed.

Combining this with the actual Knight's Vow might be too overpowered though...but since she can't heal allied champions with any of her abilities it might make sense to focus on **damage redirection** (since damage reduction has also been introduced on Leona's W). Considering Knight's Vow's effect is reduced for ranged champions (6% for both dmg redirection and healing), it wouldn't be too op imo.\n\nThis change could also mean Karma players would have to decide whether to use W on allied champions to redirect damage from them or use it to root an enemy (or if low hp, using the empowered effect to heal themselves as well). \n\nJust throwing this idea out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"i4got2pull0ut","date":"2019-11-16T08:02:53.502+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why does Riot seem to hate Aurelion Sol...","replies":[]}]}
