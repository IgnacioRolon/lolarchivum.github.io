The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**Some 9.16 SR Balance Context**\r\n\r\nLooking at some of the changes coming in 9.16.\r\n\r\nBuffs:\r\n\r\n* Jax - We're looking to give Jax a little bit of early power, aimed in particular at top lane play against ranged opponents (Q CD 8-6 from 10-6) \r\n* Lux - Now that the 9.14 nerfs have had some time to settle we're confident we took a bit too much power out of support Lux. We wanted to hit fairly hard, hit her harder again than intended though. We're putting a bit of power back into the W rank ups as a result. \r\n* Shen - Some buffs aimed at giving Shen a bit more split push power mid-late game, especially against tanky opponents (buffs to Q % health damage and E damage). Intent is they should benefit top Shen more than support, given top Shen maxes Q earlier. \r\n\r\nNerfs:\r\n\r\n* Azir - Going for just a small nerf here that gives slightly larger windows against him late game (Q CD 15-7 instead of 15-5). We originally tested some larger nerfs but given he's not highly OP and we're buffing other champs who tend to play mid conclusion was a light touch here made sense. \r\n* Corki - Here by contrast we're looking to take noticeably more power out of. We're hitting his reliable damage specifically  (base AD and AD per level). Changes look small on paper, we've seen small looking base AD changes have large impacts historically though.\r\n* Riven - Riven we're targeting due to her High MMR solo queue performance being really strong. In retrospect lowering the Q CD significantly in 9.10 wasn't necessary. Going back on most of that buff as a result. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**Honor 5 Chromas**\r\n\r\nWe've got some chromas coming this year Medieval Twitch and Grey Warwick. Goal there is to be able to give Honor 5 players who've already got both skins additional rewards. How that will work is that your Honor 5 capsule will contain two Honor 5 tokens, each of which can be exchanged for Medieval Twitch, Grey Warwick or one of the chromas for those skins. When we revealed the chromas a couple of weeks back we originally stated players would only be able to get one. We've since corrected the plan so folks can get both as originally promised earlier in the year.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who've already opened Honor 5 capsules for the year we'll send you tokens separately sometime during 9.16.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------        \r\n**TFT Ranked**\r\n\r\nWe've got some work underway looking at ways to improve how Ranked works for TFT. While we did a fair bit of tuning of the existing system to adapt it to TFT we think, based off what we're seeing and feedback received, that there's a fair bit of room to customize it further to better meet TFT needs. Don't have details ready to share yet, will do so as soon as we've got some specific tactics in mind though.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------        \r\n**RNG in TFT: Item Drops**\r\n\r\nI'm aiming to cover this topic in detail in a post within the next couple of weeks. Was hoping to do so this week but would like to give the TFT team a bit more time to map out their upcoming item work first. Short version for now though:\r\n\r\n* We think high game to game variation is very important for TFT given adaptability is one of the most important skills TFT tests\r\n* We don't think solutions like exact same number of items per player every game are the way to go\r\n* We don't think the current drop system gives sufficient options/alternatives to players who aren't getting many items either though, so are looking to make some changes. Details, or at least planned direction, to come once we've got something solid enough to share\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Winterkill","date":"2019-08-09T16:54:36.513+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":25,"body":"{{champion:43}} \n\nCan you please comment about Karma?

Lots of abilities/effects are starting to have overlaps. Mundo has a aoe dot (sunfire cape), malphite and cho have cone cleaves on autos (titanic hydra), trynd/yi have \"autos reduce cd on abilities\" (spear), sylas and zoe have damage on autos after ability cast (sheen)... need I go on?\n\n> the model itself is clunky\n\nHer model looks a lot better than other champs (mundo, udyr).\n\n> What does Karma offer to the game that any other Enchanter or support does better than her?\n\nA tether that leads into a root, spammable fairly strong AoE damage, and the flexibility of choosing when to mantra, which opens up a self heal, bonus slow/damage, and a unique AoE shield.\n\n> How fun is Karma to play as and against when her kit is anti-fun when overbuffed and unfun to play with if she isn't buffed into oblivion?\n\nThe only part of your post that I think has any merit. I agree that she is unfun to play against when strong, and pretty lack-luster to play and outclassed when she is weak, and it seems like it may be hard to find a sweet spot in between.\n\nOne thing I think would make her more unique/fun to play with is making her R ignore cooldowns on other abilities (like Heimer or when rengar hits max ferocity). Obviously some tuning would have to happen, but being able to self-shield, tether, into mantra shield, or mantra Q into Q etc would be a lot of fun.","replies":[{"poster":"DesuGamer","date":"2019-08-09T22:08:43.555+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Totally unique ult\" which small yordle-engineer has, but just not from the start of the game(and without really nice quotes when activated)?\n\nModel has some defects like broken kimono on Sakura skin or deleted shield casting animation(which was wip when they released and later they removed it :/ )\n\nRoot in late game makes you more like kamikazee when you want to catch somebody, it's very risky tho, but I know it may not be such an argument, but I feel like it lacks something.

Karma has a potential with her early damage, but if she failed in dominance the lane, I feel like later she just has her shield, because if you behind, usually your team is behind and you cannot engage quite good with mvs from shield, especially on soloq, where communication is limited(?)(I can find the right word, sorry >_&lt;). \nI was happy for changes, when they wanted to improve mechanics on W, the idea of cloth-line was interesting, but I was worried with those changes due to the fact giving her reducing cooldowns and refreshing mana skill for allies wouldn't be that good on  not-coordinated teams and could have become OP on proplay, like she used to... So they left it again... I wish she could got even smaller visual update like Ezreal, to match more of her splash arts and improve her gameplay. \nI like she has a lot of ways to play, but I feel like it always end like every of that is way too good or so not worth to even pick her... I often feel I should have pick Morgana, even if I fell off and be behind I still have quite long snear and CC-prevent shield which is always good to have and I can build AP, supportish or even tanky... Or just pick Janna, Lulu or Nami, because usually they are better enchanters and they can poke and deal dmg in lane(not quite high as Karma, but still they are better in late games). \nI love Karma, but seriously, sometimes I feel like I have nothing except shield and just some damage.\n{{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MooooooooreDakka","date":"2019-08-09T16:57:24.390+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Could we get a bit of insight from you on Twisted Treeline being removed?

Our conclusion was that the time we currently spend on it would be better spent doing things like getting Nexus Blitz to a state where it can be a mode we bring back moderately often.

Carousel's remain the same to keep the win and loss incentives intact.\n\n***Item exchange system \n- spend 5 gold to trade an item into one of your choice\n- spend 2 gold to re-roll a random item\n- spend 15-20 gold to BUY an item??\n\n***Make items removable from champions\n\nTFT is VERY different from League. Please don't get caught up in the mind set of trying to be different for the sake of being different at the cost of making the game worse. Equal items still means RANDOM items, which still means adjusting strategy and build around your RANDOM drops and RANDOM champion rolls. There is TONS of RNG left over if players receive the same number of items. Please keep in mind this game is something I try to enjoy in my free time and games take over 30 min on average to complete, and it REALLY sucks when I spend that time at a disadvantage from everybody else in a ranked competitive match where they just out item-rolled me. Equal items means a more even measurement of skill in each game between players. I think you need to decide if TFT is going to truly be a circus or if it's something that can be played competitively in a more serious way, I really do think it comes down to what you do with itemization... the rest is all champ tweaking and everyone is kinda sorta on equal footing there, that's mostly game knowledge. Items are simply TOO STRONG as is to be unevenly distributed between players currently. \n\nif you don't allow players control over items, and they have no control over champ rolls.... then all that's really left here is knowing your rolling odds and best comps/current metas right? Then rolling and hoping for the best?? Does that sound like a game that's going to keep people engaged long term?\n\nThanks for reading and your hard work and long hours so far!

Then afterwards I would like to talk about CDR and other over abundant stats.\n\nJungle is a frustrating role, for both jungle and laners.  \n\nPlaying as Jungle (when in off role) against on role junglers of lower skill (not much lower, probably like d3 to p2.).  I noticed a few things.  First jungle is just awful for power farming.  You are better off cheesing the enemy laners than you are farming your jungle.  Let me talk about something I did and tested out.  I stole the enemy's first buff, after their leash.  And prevented the enemy from getting their second buff.  BY ALL MEANS.  That player should have been out of the game.  Losing first two buffs + still level 1 at 3-4 minutes in game.  But, the player was able to simply gank non-stop (even though they were dying in the ganks, still getting a positive trade).  They managed to crawl back into the game vs me who had taken both sides of his jungle 2 times + my own jungle 2 times.  He caught up in level.  By no means at 10 minutes should a player that has been denied 11 camps be able to crawl back to the same level as a player who is 10 camps above.  Said player had 5 assist and 3 deaths.  To my 1 kill and 2 assist.  1 death.  \n\nWhat this means, is that gaining a jungle advantage means absolutely nothing.   This means, that even if you are the better jungler, better solo laners can still out perform you, having a longer lasting impact on the game.  Me denying the enemy jungler should have meant that he never comes back.  That is a heavy denial.  That would be equal to a top lane player, freezing the wave in front of his tower for 4 minutes + zoned the enemy top laner away from the wave (to where he didn't get EXP).  We see that the top laner, actually gains more from this style than the jungler does.  Jungle is a glorified support, at the moment.  And not in a good way either.\n\nNow to my primary role.  Mid.\n\nThe most frustrating thing in existence, is seeing a jungler come by  5 times in 2 minutes.  That means in a period of 120 seconds, you will have a period to fight and punish the enemy laner of 24 seconds.  Now accounting for Minion Travel and Moderately Safe Play, that window is diminished to 6-12 seconds (depending on the champion).  The jungler does not allow for the laners to play skillfully.  The jungle currently presents a issue of Safe play > rewarding play.  There should never be a time in which I engage without my jungle.  If I engage without my jungle the chances of me winning drop by 50%.  I can say the same statement for top lane as well, since that is my secondary role.  At least with the top lane, they are more ignored than Mid and Bot.  \n\nHow do these two things tie into each other?  \n\nJungle as a role, is just not a good role.  Because they have to HEAVILY rely on the early game.  (mainly due to ward coverage being heavily nerfed) and then rely on their laners to perform well.   Right now we don't see this issue, because Damage is SO GOD DAMN HIGH.  But the second that damage is back to acceptable levels, the game is going to go into a period of massive changes again.  Jungle will feel extra bad, compared to right now.  As damage packed champions will feel much weaker, and have less impact in the early game, and thus fall off even harder in the late game.  \n\nLets move over to CDR.\n\nI have been saying this for years.   CDR is too abundant.  We have CDR on every item that you can imagine.  Start items for Mages, and Fighters.  CDR on AD assassin items.  \n\nBack when the game was picking up traction and popularity, CDR was something you had to go out of your way to get, often times forcing you to make a trade for the CDR.  Nowadays, CDR is packed into a very strong item, making you take no trades, other than \"which one of these 2 or 3 strong items do I want?\"  \n\nCDR should not be in any starter items.  Mages, Supports, Fighters, or Assassins.  Very rarely will a tank start the game with a CDR item, as they are not the greatest items for them to start with, and weirdly enough.  Tank CDR is in a very good spot right now.  \n\nMages will hit 30% cdr after 1 item, because there is no reason to take celerity or the other one.  \n\nFighters will hit 40% cdr on 3 items, Notably if they go BC/TF > DD > SV or BC/TF > Spear.  Now I know that the second one isn't going to happen.  But it is a possibility.  \n\nTL:DR.\n\nJungle needs better treatment for the players, and the laners.    As in, make ganking more punishing, and raise jg exp on blue side, while tuning it down on red side.  \n\nCDR needs to be heavily removed from the game.  At least on starter items, no CDR item should be a starter item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blooface","date":"2019-08-12T21:16:27.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=wYcVRQBO,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-08-09T16:40:27.241+0000)\n>\n> Hi folks,\n> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> **Usual Disclaimers**\n> \n> These posts will often contain talk about future work we're doing, or planning to do, that isn't yet guaranteed to ship.

We wanted to hit fairly hard, hit her harder again than intended though. We're putting a bit of power back into the W rank ups as a result. \n> * Shen - Some buffs aimed at giving Shen a bit more split push power mid-late game, especially against tanky opponents (buffs to Q % health damage and E damage). Intent is they should benefit top Shen more than support, given top Shen maxes Q earlier. \n> \n> Nerfs:\n> \n> * Azir - Going for just a small nerf here that gives slightly larger windows against him late game (Q CD 15-7 instead of 15-5). We originally tested some larger nerfs but given he's not highly OP and we're buffing other champs who tend to play mid conclusion was a light touch here made sense. \n> * Corki - Here by contrast we're looking to take noticeably more power out of. We're hitting his reliable damage specifically  (base AD and AD per level). Changes look small on paper, we've seen small looking base AD changes have large impacts historically though.\n> * Riven - Riven we're targeting due to her High MMR solo queue performance being really strong. In retrospect lowering the Q CD significantly in 9.10 wasn't necessary. Going back on most of that buff as a result. \n> \n> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \n> **Honor 5 Chromas**\n> \n> We've got some chromas coming this year Medieval Twitch and Grey Warwick. Goal there is to be able to give Honor 5 players who've already got both skins additional rewards. How that will work is that your Honor 5 capsule will contain two Honor 5 tokens, each of which can be exchanged for Medieval Twitch, Grey Warwick or one of the chromas for those skins. When we revealed the chromas a couple of weeks back we originally stated players would only be able to get one. We've since corrected the plan so folks can get both as originally promised earlier in the year.\n> \n> For those of you who've already opened Honor 5 capsules for the year we'll send you tokens separately sometime during 9.16.\n> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------        \n> **TFT Ranked**\n> \n> We've got some work underway looking at ways to improve how Ranked works for TFT. While we did a fair bit of tuning of the existing system to adapt it to TFT we think, based off what we're seeing and feedback received, that there's a fair bit of room to customize it further to better meet TFT needs. Don't have details ready to share yet, will do so as soon as we've got some specific tactics in mind though.\n> \n> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------        \n> **RNG in TFT: Item Drops**\n> \n> I'm aiming to cover this topic in detail in a post within the next couple of weeks. Was hoping to do so this week but would like to give the TFT team a bit more time to map out their upcoming item work first. Short version for now though:\n> \n> * We think high game to game variation is very important for TFT given adaptability is one of the most important skills TFT tests\n> * We don't think solutions like exact same number of items per player every game are the way to go\n> * We don't think the current drop system gives sufficient options/alternatives to players who aren't getting many items either though, so are looking to make some changes.
