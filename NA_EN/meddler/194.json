The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png              \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Preseason so far**\r\n\r\nHopefully preseason's treating you well so far. Thoughts on a range of topics below.\r\n\r\n* Bugs\r\n\r\nGetting high impact gameplay bugs addressed is one of our main focuses after each preseason ships. We've hit the highest urgency ones through hotfixes (Fiddle R missing its visual effects, Death's Dance and Infernal Soul interacting incorrectly, Elder sometimes executing at too high a health threshold). Aim is to hit a range of other preseason associated gameplay bugs in 9.24.\r\n\r\n* General Balance\r\n\r\nEarly indicators suggest the game's in a reasonably good state so far for just after a large patch. Champion win rates have changed at most one or two percent generally, with most not moving much at all on average. A few specific categories covered below, next up we'll be looking at how the difference SR types (Cloud, Ocean etc) affect the win rates of different champs (e.g. how much does an Ocean game actually help Rengar?). After that we'll also be digging into various other things not touched on below (e.g. impact of RH changes or side lane alcoves, how jungle and top lane agency have changed etc). \r\n\r\n* Kleptomancy and Oministone Balance\r\n\r\nKlepto users look to be down meaningfully in power as expected. We'll be putting some power back into some of their kits as a result, starting with a hotfix (probably out already by the time you read this) to Ezreal who's been the most affected.\r\n\r\nEarly indications are that Omnistone is too weak so we're discussing a potential hotfix buff to it. It's not the optimal choice on any champion at present, though is moderately close to being so on a few champs (Kayle, Kennen, Illaoi, Twisted Fate). \r\n\r\n* Balance impacts of Crit, Lethality, Support item changes\r\n\r\nCrit changes so far seem pretty power neutral to crit users. Lethality users seem to be somewhere between neutral and slightly weaker. Support item changes don't seem to have shifted the balance of power substantially between different types of support, with no clear trend yet for how tanks versus enchanters versus damage supports have been affected and win rate changes almost all below 1%. \r\n\r\nIt's early days still though when it comes to assessing these sorts of changes. Things like players adapting their builds, the meta being a bit uncertain and team comps being less optimized with ranked off will likely impact assessment of item changes somewhat. We're going to keep digging into them as a result, early signs are things are pretty balanced though.\r\n\r\n* Infernal Screen Tint\r\n\r\nWe'll be toning down the amount of screen tint the infernal SR transformation creates. Feedback on that's been pretty clear that it's overly dominant. We'll have some changes on the PBE the next time it updates and would love feedback on whether the change feels right, goes too far or doesn't go far enough. Plan is to then ship a change in 9.24. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Worlds Champion Diversity**\r\n\r\nOne of a number of things we look at each year post Worlds is how champion diversity compared to previous years since we believe that's one of the components that supports both a great viewing experience and a good competitive experience. 2019 was overall quite a good year in that regard, even if a few champions (Panth, Qiyana, Kai'Sa and Xayah) were much higher profile than ideal, leading to some meaningful staleness of champ select/team comps at times still. Some slides one of our analysts (thanks Blaustoise!) put together below that show some of the ways we look at that sort of data. \r\n\r\n https://imgur.com/a/0J125gD\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar, the Gini Coefficient is a statistic usually used to measure income inequality. In our case, we're using pick/ban presence instead of income. A score of 0 means perfect pick/ban equality among the entire roster, so lower's better.\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/KChXZaH\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \r\n**TFT Ranked Season start**\r\n\r\nTFT ranked kicked off on Wednesday with the new set. For this set we opted to go for a complete LP reset and a partial MMR reset. From discussion we've seen so far that's creating both some confusion and some frustration, particularly in cases where LP and MMR feel very far apart (e.g. LP climbing slowly for Masters players because max LP is capped per game at one division's worth). Feedback on how the reset's felt to you much appreciated, we'd like to refine our approach here.  Since TFT seasons are much shorter than SR ones issues will be felt more often, though on the positive side it also means we've got more opportunities to make the sort of large improvements that can only happen at a season start.","replies":[{"poster":"Scarletmeow","date":"2019-11-22T18:06:20.454+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":5,"body":"Everywhere else I've tried people have hated this opinion but I play support and feel the need to get my thoughts out there anyways:\n\n As a Nami main, the new spell thief line feels really, really bad.

In the aggressive case, that lack of mana sustain combined with losing the on-proc damage means you not only have much less likelihood of winning the trades you take, but can barely perform them at all; in the defensive case, melee users can't afford to approach minion waves for procs without getting smacked to all hell by anyone with a range advantage, and then they're left with no help to recover except devouring any consumables they have, with this also meaning that it's much harder to sustain poke in later stages of the game since most previous Relic Shield users would rush tier 3 that brought 200% health regen.\n\nThe majority of tanks don't care about the AD or AP coming from the defensive items, and would much prefer additional health and health regen. While there are certainly outside cases who enjoy the added AD/AP, the majority of the champions benefiting from this are ranged, and would rather be going for the aggressive items if they gave better stats to facilitate their playstyle. Getting rid of the heal from Spoils of War was good to prevent tank supports in particular from getting to act like mini-enchanters, but that, in conjunction with the lost health regen, has proven very damaging. There aren't any tank support items that grant health regen, and even with increased gold income, telling a support they basically have to get Warmog's or Righteous Glory _every_ match seems counterintuitive to the goal of giving them more gold freedom in the first place.\n\nMaking the support items upgrade automatically was a good change, but the stats that were lost from that have gravely diminished the ability for a wide swathe of supports to be interactive in the laning phase. Mana-reliant supports simply can't afford to be proactive unless it's an all-in, and their ability to be reactive is down as well; melee supports are even more vulnerable to poke than before, and have gained basically nothing to show for it.\n\nOverall, the support experience feels worse right now. Having access to slightly more gold than before more quickly than before does not compensate for just how little agency is being felt, particularly in the laning phase. The only type of support that seems to have truly been benefiting with these adjustments are damage supports that want high-budget mana items early anyways, or all-in/one-combo ranged supports that aren't going to feel a mana burden.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Natron","date":"2019-11-22T20:25:13.782+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler, have you seen any reports on performance issues?

It gives far more damage than dusk more usefull and reliable slow, revolver costs 50 gold less than dirk but it can give more damage yeah fair, and its scaling is better than dirk ever was and does more damage in every single point of the game (40 damage vs 50-120), but dirk now gives absolutely nothing. WaiT BuT iT gIveS LeThaLity, yeah so much of it that armor per lever compared to mr per level completely negates it because base resistances are heavly skewed in favor of magic damage. It just sucks I cant be treated as fair as mages are","replies":[{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2019-11-23T07:30:18.641+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"On account of how strong lethality has been let's give it some time, and chock it up to growing pains in the mean time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"astralwit","date":"2019-11-22T20:46:49.613+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please bring back a variant of S8 Dark Harvest. The new one removed the fun soul pickup game and changed the rune's identity as well as core users (despite keeping the name!). There's no skill to it anymore. It's just more damage for your damage. \n\nThe old DH really changed my positioning in fights, my pathing and my approach to the game (even invades could be different if I had a chance to outsmite a camp and get a double proc.). It was also less tilting when teammates died because I could at least use their souls to possibly turn things. And of course, it had an actual late game. It wasn't just a snowball rune with no fallback mechanic. You could really see it evolve and there was a huge difference at 150+ stacks when the timer changed. Right now, there's hardly a playstyle decision or any thought in using it. It's just about which one is better on a particular champion.\n\nAs far as the \"Omnistone\". I just don't see this as a useful addition. If the CD is low enough, it will be used a lot just because it would be overtuned. However, if it is balanced, almost no one would prefer it over an alternative rune with an actual clear purpose.\n\nFinally, I think making the Rift channel time so much shorter is a step back. 4 seconds gave some counterplay to it if you could land CC. It was sometimes even worth sacrificing a summoner spell to do it. Why eliminate the counterplay to it? It's essentially impossible to interrupt now.\n\nBTW: Even if you don't want to bring back Smite buffs as a whole, it would be cool to have at least side camps or buff camps have them. Of course, it would need a lot of thought so that it's not too complex or gimmicky but I think there's some potential there. Although, S10 already has a lot to learn so maybe for S11! :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Muh Meh","date":"2019-11-22T20:28:45.374+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Meddler,\n\nThanks for the continual updates. What exactly is the goal of Omnistone? It seems like such a gimmicky keystone with no clear intent other than being unusual.
