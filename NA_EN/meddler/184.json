The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Runes Reforged**\r\n\r\nAs I&#039;d imagine almost everyone&#039;s seen already we&#039;ve got some big changes coming to runes and masteries at the end of the year, with the two systems getting merged into a new system that&#039;s still called Runes but free and modifiable in champ select. Detailed explanation of how the gameplay works from yesterday can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/coming-preseason-runes-reforged\r\n\r\nA few other things important to note about the new Runes system:\r\n\r\n* It&#039;s still pretty work in progress. We&#039;re talking about this stuff far in advance because we want to give you folks context into what we&#039;re doing and to get feedback on the design while it&#039;s in development. That means some things will change from what we show, some questions aren&#039;t ready to be answered yet (e.g. what happens to existing runes/runepages?) etc.\r\n* Speaking of showing content in development we&#039;ll be continuing to reveal work in progress runes for discussion every couple of weeks or so. Goals there are to help people get a better understanding of the system and get feedback as we work on individual runes. Given how far out numbers certainly won&#039;t be final and other details, or even the concept of a specific rune could change. Feedback on how you&#039;d expect a rune to be used, what sort of choices it offers/skills it tests etc&#039;s going to be really helpful. Comments like &#039;that&#039;s busted and will break the game&#039; or &#039;I don&#039;t like it&#039; by contrast need good explanations paired with them otherwise they&#039;re not very useful.\r\n* The updated Runes system has been called &#039;Perks&#039; internally for quite a while. That&#039;s never intended to be a final name, but we did want some way of clearly distinguishing it from existing runes while we were working on it initially. Mentioning that since it&#039;s all but guaranteed that someone (probably me...) will refer to Perks at some point while we&#039;re talking about Runes over the next 5 months.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Some 7.12 Changes Context**\r\n\r\n* Doran&#039;s Shield - Good to see it getting used when you want to give up lane offensive power for survivability. Looks a bit too strong though. We&#039;ll likely increase its cost a bit as a result, shift it to a 1 health pot start item instead of 2.\r\n\r\n* Singed - We&#039;re testing some Singed changes at the moment aimed at letting him be a more meaningful damage threat later in the game. That means shifting some power later in the game, giving him better AP ratios to reward builds that mix some AP and some tankiness. These changes won&#039;t be ready for 7.12, so expect to see them vanish from the PBE at some point soon, we&#039;ll be continuing to investigate them in future though.\r\n\r\n* Xayah and Rakan - Looks like Rakan&#039;s a bit weak and Xayah probably a bit strong. We&#039;ll likely buff Rakan (E CD probably) and might nerf Xayah a bit, now or next patch (most likely targets: W attack speed and/or ability to AA while Q missiles fire). \r\n\r\n* Support Items - We&#039;re working on a big pass on Support items at present too, looking to allow more build diversity and iron out a range of smaller issues. That includes things like Locket having a smaller base shield but gaining a bonus HP ratio so it&#039;s more rewarded with some build paths than others, Athene&#039;s giving AP based off your % mana regen etc.  That work&#039;s still going through some iteration, so expect to see ongoing changes over the next few days (e.g. Talisman&#039;s build path is likely to go back to something similar to its current one). \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Warded Ping**\r\n\r\nCan&#039;t make any guarantees on timeline, we&#039;re gonna be looking at this though. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Ancient Coin Hotfix**\r\n\r\nWe fixed a bug earlier in the week where the Coin line was giving non mana resources to champs with other resources. Most visibile with Rengar getting a bunch of Ferocity whenever he picked up a &#039;mana&#039; coin. Script was set to restore resource, not mana specifically. Oops. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**New Champs and VGUS (full updates)**\r\n\r\nNow that we&#039;re past Xayah/Rakan we should be back to generally alternating new champions and VGUs again for a bit. Up next&#039;s a new champ, then Urgot, then another new champ, then Evelynn.","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2017-06-02T16:06:34.570+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hi, have you heard that a lot of people are dissatisfied with Rek'Sai's new ult?

If that becomes too strong, cut into its damage, we rek'sai players are very disappointed with these changes to her ult, and the fact that the tremor sense nerf from season 6 was kept in so we can't even land Q to ult despite the rest of her problematic utility for pro play being taken out. \n\nEDIT: Reworded for clarity.

This is a point and click ultimate ability, you have no control of whether it'll land or not and thats the flaw in this design, and the channel adds more moments for mobility spells on the target to come off CD as well. Rek'sai could easily be left with only 3 abilities if the enemy team simply has a karma, or if they consist of nothing but mobile champions like talon, camille, ezreal, elise, rakan, etc. \n\nYea the ult is powerful as all fuck, and the scaling is actually stupidily high as it is, but theoretically with all that power it should be broken, and it feels it needs buffed and that alone speaks for itself on how putting power into this ult doesn't matter when its more the issue of how it works.","replies":[{"poster":"swampert919","date":"2017-06-02T23:35:25.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> if they consist of nothing but mobile champions like talon, camille, ezreal, elise, rakan, etc\n\nCouldn't that be said about every skill shot ult... if you've got someone who is quick enough they can negate your ult.

You can predict where the target will blink to or walk to. \n\nAnother example, WW ult, you can get into a range for it to land or you can ult in a different direction to where they may go, such as ulting over a wall catching them doing the same to avoid it.\n\nRek'sai's ult is point and click. You can't \"aim it\" or \"calculate it\" you have to just press it when they're low (assuming you're trying to execute) and hope the game works in your favor because besides the button you press all control is taken off of you. Its fair for a skillshot to be dodged, but a point and click ability should come with point and click results, not the results of a skill shot which you can't aim or redirect. \n\n> Secondly if you incorrectly use any ability it will feel like it needs buffs... the thing about the new rek&#x27;sai ult is that we don&#x27;t actually know how to properly use it yet, if we do then it might not need buffing after all.\n> \n> Consider this... instead of using it to get on top of people just use rek&#x27;sai&#x27;s natural mobility for that, I mean she has been getting onto people for years now and none of that got changed... when you jump on them they will use their mobility, let&#x27;s say you jump on an ez, do your knock up combo and he uses E to disengage, you&#x27;ve already got him marked so you can ult him then and either he flashes (win for you as a flash for an ult is a worthy trade) or he gets hit because he has already used his mobility.\n> Honestly this is how the ult is likely designed to be used... it relies on you damaging them first and is % missing health damage so it implies your not supposed to start with it...

My points would involve explaining what the ult is meant to do, but again, that would contradict the undeniable point above. I do still believe there is some tuning because the way the ult is meant to work seems to contradict with rek'sai's kit. (a burst assassin move it seems, on a fighter who's been diving as you described).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Frozne","date":"2017-06-02T18:07:38.178+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=L97PHhaf,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2017-06-02T17:38:46.227+0000)\n>\n> The intent is that Flash/dashes/fast movement speed like powerball can be used to avoid the ult.

I mean why would you be able to dodge an ultimate ability with something that would be on like a 5 second cooldown? What makes it even worse is that it's a point and click ability, so that it limits your ability to control it and possibly aim it. It makes no sense that a point and click would be able to be dodged if you guys wanted that you could've just made it a long range skill shot like an underground warwick ult. The range is also pretty small as well to chase, along with the fact that you have to mark them first there's too many things that need to be in place in order for your to use it, like I could understand it if it actually did something instead of being able to be dodged you know, the point and click ability. So we're just gonna special snowflake it to reksai because she's been a balancing pain before but warwick follows your flash if he holds q on you right xD on top of the reason you guys made it be able to be dodged by a normal ability and not just a summoner spell. This rework seems pretty awful, and i'm hella scared for azir because if this is what they did to reksai oh boy rest in peace.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9 Squeeky ","date":"2017-06-02T18:37:15.197+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

I also doubt Riot agrees with you, and that's likely why they wouldn't revert her at all.

The 20% damage increase working on turrets on top of the already good AS steroid makes her as good at pushing as trist or jinx and I'm fairly sure this is not one of the things xayah is supposed to be good at. It's literally the same problem as when reworked ashe Q worked on turrets. This needs to be adressed before you consider doing anything else to her.\nRemoving QautoE snare combo would make her a little bit clunky. If her Q was castable while on the move a la syndra Q this kind of change would've been necessary but with the way her Q works now I can't agree with it. QautoE is truly strong only with RFC (which is otherwise vastly inferior to PD/runaans) and it has a fair tradeoff: if you go for QautoE even with full CDR you can't E again for 5 seconds (with less CDR and less than 5 points in E it's much longer than that). That's a ton of damage and utility gone in exchange for a 1s root. It's worth doing if you have a teammate with damage in range to follow that up or if you're so ahead you can kill the rooted target on your own with no need to E.\nIf you're looking into addressing xayah's overall performance would be to give her a bit of jinx rockets/caitlyn treatment: reduce the scaling with bonus AS a little. Something that would keep her earlygame AS unchanged but tone down the attack speed values she can reach later a bit. The amount of autos xayah can pump out in a short amount of time with ER + double zeal item or ER zealitem zerkers is pretty ridiculous. Just be very careful with this kind of change because it would be twofold, not only decreasing direct autoattack damage but also lowering potential E damage.\nRakan E cooldown is pretty ridiculous early on (20s base cooldown rank 1). With the post release set of changes he received that was trying to push him away from maxing E and into maxing Q (or perhaps W?) E is now used as a one point wonder and could definitely use going from 20-12s to, say, 17-12s. Rakan's bulids generally don't involve much CDR (unless you were to sacrifice a lot of defense) so the E is nowhere near close to being abusable as some free escape (especially without xayah). Out of other ideas for changes to rakan: the Q heal is not very satisfactioning, especially later on when people have a lot of health (a 4k HP zac will never even notice he got healed by 150). Throwing in a small % missing health ratio on top of it (2,5%?) would make it much nicer. That would make for a \"my team's tank will be aware he got healed by me\" heal without at the same time making it a \"I top off my ADC from 80% to full\" heal. I know that % teammate's HP heals are pretty volatile because the same amount of HP is actually a lot more effective HP on a tank/bruiser. The only heals like this I remember existing throughout the time I play league are pre-rework karma RQ (long gone) and the previous iteration of mikaels crucible (huge cooldown, also gone). I think rakan's Q is a good candidate. Lastly you should consider making rakan count as melee, opening him up to using relic shield line, full gold from bandit and full effects of knight's vow. That change alone would be enough to make him strong right now, I don't know how that would go with the upcoming pregame setup overhaul and support items changes though.\nI definitely agree with the dshield change and I would like to point out that it affects one more thing that was probably not the intended target of the nerf but I agree with it nonetheless: it prevents the possibility of starting double dorans if you manage get first blood in an invade. This is a bit of an edge case but I have seen it happen a few times and it was disgusting every time.\nThe \"warded\" ping will definitely be a very welcome addition. None of the currently existing pings are a clear enough message that a place is warded and stopping to type that is often not an option. This resulted in many unnecessary awkward situations with junglers and supports.\nAs it was already brought up reksai ult needs to be fixed, I understand the necessity of a targetted dash ability not dealing its damage if the target moves too far away but that is meant for the \"ezreal E'd and flashed away\" situations, not the \"anivia with tier 2 boots walked in a straight line\" ones. In fact I would like to see reksai's ult possibility to miss embraced more strongly: my suggestion would be to give its target the ability to see how wide the zone within which they will take damage from it is, make that zone aim directly at the point where the target will be if they continue moving in the same direction with their current movement speed (you can probably borrow some code for that from draven's axes). This will allow counterplay to her ult in similar fashion as already existing counterplay to her burrowed E: make her use it in a certain direction then walk in the opposite direction. This is of course not always possible (you aren't exactly going to turn around and walk back into the enemy laner when ganked very often) and it will give her much more counterplay in 1v1. Especially if the \"new\" reksai turns out overbearing in top lane a change like that would maker her ult not be like \"I am slightly below half HP and reksai has touched me with something within the last 5 seconds - that means I am dead, period\". Also reksai ult could leave a tunnel behind it - it already visually spawns one except it disappears right away. Make it not count towards E tunnel cap and be on cooldown at first (so that it can't be used by reksai to get out right after until later into the game) and if not that then at least give it a slight cooldown refund if it misses. An ult like this would make for nice prey/predator gameplay with meaningful decisions to be made by both sides and not just some generic dash with damage.\n\nOverall I like a lot of the recent balance decisions. Good work, keep it up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-06-02T16:57:24.741+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome back!

I main singed as well, and have made the whole mastery 7 challenge (multiple S+ in ranked) without ever needing to touch ghost.

Although my 70% win average dropped to 50% i dont think it has anything to do with the above request mentioned. However i can agree that the teams are assuming our roles to be team-fight oriented. Singed isn't built for those playstyles, and i dont want to promote the idea of him being reinvented to accommodate that suggestion. He IS a split-push champ, and behaves well as one. I personally enjoy the challenge of absorbing all the focus of the other team, by even inviting the 1v2+ top lane battles, sometimes even forcing enemy mid AND junglers (sometimes support) to leave their lane, to aide their top to defeat me. Though some teams often misses the opportunity to seize the opening in out-numbering for objective control, that doesn't mean when it comes down to late game grouping 5v5 mid, that i'll be the one to lead that charge. (There's nothing in my kit for me to survive a frontal engage, and i actually prefer to keep split-pushing as it's usually a strong a viable option for singed mains).","replies":[{"poster":"Silver Singed","date":"2017-06-05T16:30:12.166+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you must have misunderstood my post, friend.
