The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n**Sion**\r\n\r\nWe fixed a couple of bugs on Sion in 8.3, which likely made him a bit stronger. At the same time it turns out we also unknowingly introduced a new bug as well, which is likely adding quite a bit more strength to him than those bug fixes did. In order to address an issue where minions he E&#039;d would sometimes die before the end of the knockback we ended up rebuilding the spell. The rebuilt version was unintentionally set to use a different check to determine what was hit (distance between the E and the edge of the target&#039;s model, instead of the E and the center of the target&#039;s model). That basically means Sion E is wider than it&#039;s meant to be at present, which adds noticeable extra power. That will be fixed in the next patch. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**Conqueror**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re continuing to test the new Precision keystone, Conqueror, with the goal of shipping it in 8.6. Been seeing quite a bit of discussion about it and wanted to talk about out a few things with its design:\r\n\r\n* While you do have to be in combat for 4s before it triggers that&#039;s not the same as you have to be hitting your target for 4s before it triggers. Like Grasp of the Undying you can prep it by taking or dealing damage (e.g. poke spells or other targets) before getting onto the enemy you particularly want to fight. \r\n* The true damage conversion it offers is somewhat anti synergistic with champions who build pen or have it on their kits, or have true damage already. Converting a % of your damage to true is much more valuable when that damage was previously getting mitigated at a high rate. If you&#039;re got significant % pen/shred already (e.g. Darius with BC and his E armor pen) and/or deal a lot of true damage regardless (e.g. Fiora) you&#039;ll be getting less of a damage amp than champs without either. Might still be a good choice, especially if you&#039;re facing really tanky enemies, but less likely to be the strongest use case. \r\n* The delay and the true damage are both there in part to create more distinction from other keystones. To get meaningful choice between runes they need to be offering significantly different things, which can be tricky when their output is just damage. That means creating distinction between damage runes through things like when in the fight they offer damage (e.g. up front versus after a delay), who they&#039;re good against (e.g. squishies versus tanky targets versus low health enemies etc), whether they&#039;re pure damage or also include some other effect (e.g. healing) etc. Lack of that sort of distinction was one of the big issues with Fervor, given it switched on almost immediately (most of its users could rush its ramp up significantly) and then stayed on while being equally effective against whoever (given it was raw AD). \r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n\r\n**Longer thoughts on Marksmen delayed**\r\n\r\nI mentioned a while back I was looking to talk about our thinking on the state of marksmen in detail soon. Going to have to delay that until quite a bit closer to mid-season. We&#039;re still working through a lot of interconnected issues there around marksmen and bot lane overall that will need a fair bit more time before we&#039;ve got some clearer conclusions. Apologies this is taking quite a bit longer than originally hoped. \r\n\r\nSome of the things we&#039;re looking at:\r\n\r\n* The arms race between champs who build multiplicative damage and multiplicative defense and how that affects champs building a mixture of both \r\n* The need to be able to kill full tank builds late game\r\n* Whether the balance of power between marksmen general damage and marksmen tank busting effects is correct\r\n* How front loaded marksmen damage can get, later in the game especially (e.g. crit + Shiv crit)\r\n* What stats are needed to make playing a marksmen feel good earlier in the game versus what power&#039;s actually needed\r\n* How much reliable burst mitigation there is available for marksmen, both from supports and from other sources\r\n* How marksmen power curves compare to other classes and whether marksmen have sufficiently distinct power curves from each other\r\n* Marksmen wave clear late game (and wave clear in general)\r\n* Amount of power having decent resourceless ranged damage early game offers (while many champs are still quite mana gated)\r\n\r\nPlus likely a few other things that will emerge as we keep working. One of our next steps is going to be narrowing down to a subset of issues, with the goal of making significant progress on some rather than a little bit on everything. We&#039;ll also going to need to do some work on non marksmen too as part of our work to open up bot lane more.\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Pink Ward","date":"2018-02-28T17:23:42.993+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":5,"body":"I tweeted at you about it, but I was wondering about thoughts on giving champions Adaptive abilities?

I feel having adapativeness on either his Passive or E, or both, could help when wanting to play him as AP. It wouldn't touch AD shaco, even though I know nerfs will probably be coming out for him, but would touch up AP Shaco enough, to not fully need hard buffs to it.

One thing that's fairly obvious is that, when combined with Infinity Edge, Stattik Shiv actually out-damages {{item:3147}} at _all_ levels when it crits (even on triple Lethality builds, since Stattik Shiv deals magic damage and champions tend to have more Armor than MR), which seems kind of odd, given that Duskblade is the item designed for single-target burst to begin with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blossom Crown","date":"2018-02-28T17:18:21.610+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hi Meddler, anything on Syndra? \n\nSyndra's performance prior to the mage itemisation update wasn't too good and has only gotten worse since 8.4.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Guardman","date":"2018-02-28T17:13:22.420+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just wanted to say hi.

Your chance to crit initially is equal to the displayed value. The more the amount you crit diverges from the expected value though the more your future crit chance will get adjusted until it gets back close to expected values. If you've got a Zeal, and have got a string of crits in a row for example your chance of critting will be somewhat below 20% as a result. Or if you've got an IE and a PD and had a whole run of non crits your crit chance will be higher than 50% and continue to rise if you keep not critting.\n\nHaving said that, it's not a dramatic change over a small number of attacks. Two non crits when at 50% chance to crit won't give you a massively increased chance on your third shot. It's more a system intended to counteract more extreme streaks over a larger number of hits.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MalrothDragonia","date":"2018-02-28T17:17:26.588+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"I've often thought of the tankbuster niche as something that should be champion specific, by having mechanics like %health on a kit (like vayne) or heavy defense penetration (wukong, vi,etc.).\n\nIs that a direction you see yourself going as giving an entire class of champion that identity as tank buster is what may have been narrowing the choices?\n\nAlso, as the premier tower damaging class, I always thought waveclear was an inherent weakness of the class, and specific kits would sacrifice power to gain access to it (sivir, and should be trist but right now she's pretty dominant so it seems she's not sacrificing enough power there) also that shiv and such shore up that weakness so well that it's not really seen as such. \n\nIs waveclear as an adc weakness something you see pushing more for in the future?

What are you doing to improve her, Meddler? You keep talking about the same things and not addressing the elephant in the room for five years now.

What are you doing to make Karma a cohesive champion, more unique, to fix unfinished animations and parts of her  theme that you couldn't be bothered to complete? What are you doing to bring back her old theme and kit if you are not willing to do the actual work to make her new theme and kit work?\n\nYou are making all these rectifying changes to other champions but Karma remains in the state she has been in for 5 years now because you cannot be bothered to work on her, talk about her, talk among your peers about her, and more.\n\n----------\n\nHere are some ideas since you cannot be bothered to do your job.\n\nPassive - Give Karma a better passive that plays off of her theme as the Enlightened One or through a Twin Dragon concept.\n\nQ - Make Karma's Mantra Q like Lux's and make the explosion damage heal any ally inside of it and do more damage late game.\n\nW - Bring back Karma's clothesline mechanic through Mantra so she can interact more with her allies. Remove the healing she gains from her current Mantra W.\n\nE - Have Mantra E be shield bomb when it is cast on Karma but the current version of Mantra E when it is cast on allies.

If I sound condescending and rude to the Development team, maybe there is a reason. I don't mean to be rude and hurt their feelings. The fact of the matter is that Meddler himself and Reav3s on several occasions have blatantly ignored responses, pleas, ideas, tags, and positive reinforcement to work on a champion they know they screwed up on.\n\nWe were promised a massive rework to her kit last year and it was supposed to happen at the end of 2017. The rework was pushed back to this year and then it was mentioned to be pushed back within 6 months. Now we are still waiting for a hypothetical large scale rework that may or may not happen because Riot games wants to give Ezreal a new W, fix Superman and Valor, and make Ahri's W more interactive. Meanwhile we have several champions with lower playrates and winrates, horrible VGU and botched reworks, and thematic ruined because Developers cannot be bothered to communicate with the real players of that champion when they completely relaunch them into something that is unfinished. The same goes for Morde.\n\n--------\n\nYou want to know what the problem is? A bunch of scared little players who are too afraid to call out a Development Team that cares more about making an oversexualied Kitsune and and Blonde Explorer more popular and buffing them because they have one thing in their kit that fails . . . . while we have champions completely butchered by a VGU/update, outdated, and ignored for anything that isn't a 10 plus number on one of their abilities. For the past 3 years I have been trying to light a fire under these Developers bums to do actual work on Karma and many other champions that are being ignored year after year. Ezreal needs a VGU more than Karma in Meddler's eyes. Ahri needs more interaction with her W while Karma has almost an entire kit that is bland, all over the place, and horrible.\n\n------\n\nYou do you. I will do me and continue to say what I want to say to a Development team that hasn't been listening to me since day one of Karma's VGU. They didn't care 5 years ago and they haven't cared since the 5 years to communicate or work on her, despite saying they are going to do stuff on her. I'm so excited to see Ahri's new W though.","replies":[{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2018-03-01T02:48:45.126+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure why you think people are \"scared\" to call out devs, that's about 90% of what we do on the boards. \n\nNot sure where you got the _**promise**_ of a Karma rework for the end of 2017 from, Meddler said they wanted to look at her in the 1st half of this year. \n\nAlso not sure where you got \"large scale\" rework from, nothing beyond** \"small mechanical changes\"** has been stated and even that wasn't confirmed.

He's not bursty like MF, and no hypercarry like Twitch. He goes in, and dances around the battelfield, all while dealing as much damage as he can. Thats why I can see him taking Conq, since it will help both in his 1v1, and generally in teamfights as well.\n\nAs for Kalista, it's all about her Rend. She already likes to stick around in prolonged fights to get as many spears in her targets as possible, and once she has enough spears stacked up, with Conq proc'd, the true damage conversion would make her Rend hit even harder than it already does.\n\nWhat do you think?","replies":[]},{"poster":"onionsan01","date":"2018-02-28T18:30:11.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why would you still nerf rzye wiht his 43% winrate?!","replies":[{"poster":"SalterinoK","date":"2018-02-28T19:33:46.066+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love how low elo players cry at riot to Nerf champions like Yi but then when Riot balances for competitive they cry not fair ?!?!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xyntios","date":"2018-02-28T19:31:24.066+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler,\n\nfirst thank you for keep informing us about the stuff behind your team etc.\n\nSecondly could you give some thoughts about the changes on PBE for Tristana? You told us you want to lower her power a bit, but in my opinion scaling up her range in lategame and higher her Rocket Jump damage is not really lowering her power at all. She got an incredible good all in in lane anyways and often is a bully anyways. With higher damage on her all in the range won't matter and she will burst you even harder.\nOn that point I wonder why u guys don't look at her Rocket Jump interactions. For me it seems a bit unnecessary, that Tristana can buffer her Rocket Jump in nearly every situation. For exemple I saw it several times that she jumped out of a Warwick ult while being surpessed. That just doesn't feel right for the Warwick player when he hits the crucial ult and it also seems like too much safety for the Tristana player. \n\nHope you could give me some insights on this one and thanks again for keeping up your great work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jmman","date":"2018-02-28T19:09:20.546+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you happy about fiddle's current situation?\n\nAfter the \"buffs\"?\n\nhttps://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/fiddlesticks/platinum = 49.3%  jungle, 48.8% support, 47.6% mid\n\nhttp://na.op.gg/champion/fiddlesticks/statistics/jungle =49.12% jungle, 50.52% support (yes is this korea only)\n\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Fiddlesticks/Jungle? = 48.8% jungle, 50% support\n\n\nSo you took 53% win rate mid and it dropped to not event playable.  (guess that was the plan because we all warned you)  .8% increase in support, and roughly 1% increase in jungle.  Was this worth killing the only position that had a 50%+ spot.  Then think about all the Mains that have a lot of games that are struggling to get a good winrate with him.\n\nYou know I have played this game from the start.  Look at the other buffs you handed out to other champs.  You own us at least a explanation on what the plan for fiddle is.  Because it looks like support only now.  He isn't a \"high skill champ\" as you say with others.  So there should be no reason for the low win % unless he is just weaker.  Fiddle is still the WORST TIER for junglers.  Why do other champs get buff to at least make then good at where riot wants, then nerfed to balance, but fiddle never is.  I have played 1000's of games on him.  But every time I pick fiddle now, i'm decreasing my chances to win.  You say you want diversity but you can't event make him good at the jungle.  Can fiddle gank a lane at level 3 while they are lvl 2 and stub stomp them.... no... is fiddle tankish.... no....  Cant fiddle quickly punish the other junglers mobs if they gank or out of position.... no...Maybe you don't understand what is making the jungle good.  Fiddle has sustain for the jungle.... well you added it to everyone so that isn't a strength anymore.  Heck a lot of champ clear faster with more hp and don't use mana.\n\nMy question is are we going to have to wait another 2 or 3 years just to get looked at to be nerfed and called a buff.  Because honest I would give the ult Timer back (event thought it was way out of line with the other ults and should have been more of a creep fix than buff) for the %damage to minions back.  All the fiddle feed back..... do you look and see what champs they play?  Most of them have no games played on fiddle.\n\nedit:  every time I see all the 53% plus win rate champs and then look at the play rate, it honestly tilts me that you killed fiddle mid and \"no comment\" of the others.","replies":[{"poster":"Killer of Night9","date":"2018-02-28T19:30:19.774+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you the last change to Fiddle jungle didn't change him at all but it killed middlestick.\nFiddle need 2 thing at all.\n1 (Jungle change) Change the W cost mana from 80-120 to 16-24 for every second and giving more damage to monster (20% extra damage on moster every tick) for making him less mana dipend with a better clear of the single camp (Bluebuff and Gromp).\n2 (All lane change) Make W a significant spell on battle.
