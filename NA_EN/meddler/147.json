Goal there&#039;s about counterplay primarily, not power. Quinn&#039;s assassination pattern&#039;s pretty non-interactive for how repeatable it is. Given her ult&#039;s low CD she&#039;s not windowed in the same way other champs with similar kill potential and target access tend to be. We&#039;re exploring changes that shift her towards more sustained damage as a result (less AD ratio on R, more attack speed \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Graves**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ll be looking at Graves in 7.7. Starting belief is that he&#039;s too general a pick. First change we&#039;ll be testing is removing the MR from True Grit, making him a significantly less attractive pick against Magic Damage heavy teams. Very possible we make other changes in addition, or instead, of that though.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Changes to struggling junglers**\r\n\r\nLooks like those changes will be split across at least a couple of patches. We&#039;ll have buffs to Fiddle in 7.6, along with Red Brambleback getting less MR (makes it easier for magic damage dealing junglers to take it). 7.7 will then almost certainly have Amumu stuff in it, with Nunu and J4 likely though not guaranteed. Nid changes previously mentioned are unlikely at least in the short time. Volibear a possibility in 7.7 or later, though nothing proven good yet.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Unanimous surrender at 15 minutes testing**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve had the early surrender option available for testing on OCE for a little bit now and are starting to get a decent amount of data to analyze as a result. More details about at thoughts there to follow at some point. So far it does look like one of the main trends is a similar surrender rate (in terms of proportion of games that end in a surrender) but with some of those surrenders now happening earlier. That&#039;s a hopeful sign all else being equal (the earlier option isn&#039;t causing more people to give up if so, but instead letting people get out of games they&#039;d be leaving as a group anyway a bit earlier). \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Scuttle Crab and Honeyfruit**\r\n\r\nScuttle Crab&#039;s been trying to steal Honeyfruit for a few patches now and we figured it was a good time to look at how often that happens. Big question there is, as an easter egg with low gameplay significance, it&#039;s cooler if it only happens occasionally, rather than whenever Scuttle gets near fruit on the ground (rare = bit more amusing/special?). We&#039;ll likely play around with some different tuning&#039;s on the PBE at least for that, feedback on the concept in general now that we&#039;ve all had some time to play with it much appreciated too.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltNPetty","date":"2017-03-14T17:58:22.160+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":2,"body":"You guys haven't forgotten about Lissandra right?

TBH \"testing\" a build in a real game is pretty bad since unless you're committed to a proper statistical test (unlikely, as you'd need at least 30 games + randomly swap between build A and build B to eliminate the effect of random chance), the empirical data is useless. \n\nOf course, no one actually does any of that. They'll just do it once, have a bad game since they aren't used to it/random bullshit, and never try it again. \n\nThat's why I put way more stock in a theoretical analysis based on mathematical intuition, rather than something so error-prone like how a build \"feels\".","replies":[{"poster":"cemorn","date":"2017-03-15T07:28:37.575+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make a valid point there, except the main issue with aatrox when Ive played the theory crafted builds isnt that the builds themselves are weak, it's just that his early game has been severely hampered; he has a lower AS steroid that only procs with 2 abilities and 9 autos....incredibly hard to pull that off in lane consistently, and nearly impossible to do while being ganked early game cuz he's not tanky enough yet. Oh, and JG aatrox is flat out dead. I've played...10(?) games with him and the new builds, and as an aatrox 2nd main, I feel pretty damn sure about it.\n\nHe needs AS to pull off his passive quickly, but now is being pushed towards an HP heavy build---which is fine, but doesn't solve the probably that he is a stat hungry champ. He used to need AS and AD, now he needs AS, AD  aaand HP/MR/Arm. So being pushed towards a tank build, but having no abilities that make him innately tanky (bonus mr/armor, damage reduction, shields, etc) kind of sucks. He is also kind of like a juggernaut now...with a dash. So he's more mobile that other juggernauts...but deals much less damage (has to trade off healing for damage and AS, something no other juggernaut has to do). Tankier than dps champs, but not as tanky as tanks or as \"damagy\" as juggernauts, and needs a crap load of items, something harder to get now that his early game has been hard nerfed.\n\nSo he was in a bad place previously and in a worse place now, but apparently it'll be easier for riot to tweak his numbers. So even though I'm really bummed with the new changes, I'm hopeful that 7.7 will see some buffs to make his early game playable again.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2017-03-14T17:02:16.544+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"What was the conclusion at Riot surrounding the Nunu/Singed Smite Support cases?
