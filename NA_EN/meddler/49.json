Few short notes below.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Aatrox hotfix**\n\nAll going according to plan we should be putting out a balance hotfix for Aatrox today. We concluded he was definitely in too poor a state to leave until the next regular patch and wasn&#039;t likely to recover enough just based off relearning. Changes include increased starting health (580, was 537 and had been kept low historically because of the impact of the previous revive in lane), Q CD down (13-11, was 16-12) and W damage up (45-185, was 30-150). Suspect it&#039;s likely we&#039;ll also make Aatrox changes in 7.6, though we&#039;ll need to see where these put him first of course.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Rek&#039;Sai Timing**\n\nIt looks like the Rek&#039;Sai small update&#039;s going to be after mid-season at this point (we won&#039;t have the artist time needed available until then).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Mid-season**\n\nSpeaking of which it&#039;s very likely mid-season will be patch 7.9. That could still change of course, but that&#039;s what we&#039;re shooting for.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Next new champ**\n\nThe next new champ will be coming out before the next VGU. Once they&#039;re out we&#039;ll also share some details for anyone curious as to why the longer than usual gap between new champ releases and whether the circumstances that caused it are likely to crop up again or not.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Knight's Vow on PBE**\n\nWe saw some reports yesterday that Knight's Vow had been reverted to its older stats and build path on the PBE yesterday. Going to be looking into that today, it's not an intended change so it's either a datamining error or we've accidentally stomped the newer version with an old file somehow.

The boots weren't the be all end all before you implemented lethality. People bought tenacity and CDR boots. Junglers loved swiftness and mobility. But this meta isn't full of CC tanks and CDR is plntiful outside of boots. It's full of low CC assassins and adc's bulding lethality. And in order to **survive** long enough to do anything WE LITERALLY NEED THOSE BOOTS!\nThe boots themselves have been fine for an extremely long time, and have only now rose in popularity because they are a need against the currrent lethality meta. Not a want. Hell I'd take any other boots any day of the week if lethalty wasn't a problem.\nKinda like boots enchants. We didn't buy the best one, we simply bought the least shit one. In this case ninja tabi are the least shit pair of boots against lethality users.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-03-11T01:19:40.043+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're more interested in Ninja Tabi because Ninja Tabi are much more common.

Can I give some input on graves pls? I have more games than I can count on him and would love to save my guy from unnecessary nerfs. \n\nGraves is benefiting from a few things right now:\n\n* All of the people that could compete with his early game were nerfed. Kha and rengar both provided safe early clears but also gank pressure, which meant that although graves had a safer clear, he sacrificed better pressure on lanes and the possibility of snowballing heavily through kills.\n\n* Graves' synergy with Maw is stupid, and where I think the best place would be for nerfs would be. The passive shield on maw is more effective on graves than anyone else becuase of True Grit. With the runes/masteries I run now (scaling mr blue/oppressor/unyielding), Graves can have up to an almost 600 magic damage shield. Playing ap junglers into graves especially is miserable atm because of this.\n\n* Phantom Dancer. This is another item that's just too good on him. The damage reduction is a lot of hidden power, and is one of the most frustrating things to play against when graves already has so much survivability.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Archlord Aatrox","date":"2017-03-10T18:46:45.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who was the next VGU on the schedule, couldn't remember if it was {{champion:28}} or {{champion:6}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2017-03-10T18:57:08.275+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urgot.

He has no built in % damage reduction.\n\nThis seemed like a balance team concern because you already changed Lord Dom and BC. 45% armor reduction and fully stacked 30% total armor reduction is too much.
