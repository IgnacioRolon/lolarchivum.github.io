The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------      \r\n**Some non &#039;gameplay&#039; content in these posts**\r\n\r\nAs you might have noticed I&#039;ve started adding a wider variety of content into these posts occasionally, in addition to talking about core gameplay topics like champion balance, items, the jungle etc. Recent examples include things like how we explored new VO for Miss Fortune, or how the popularity of different queues compares. That broadening is due to a few things.\r\n\r\n1. Wider topics like that seem to be of interest to a lot of players. I know some people aren&#039;t interested in them, but many are.\r\n2. There are some times of the year where there&#039;s just not that much gameplay wise to talk about. Right now for example patch to patch change is fairly low given we&#039;re focused on preseason development and Worlds is going on. We&#039;ve already talked about preseason in some detail. We do still want to take the time to communicate with you folks though, so shifting focus a bit makes sense as a result.\r\n3. My role at Riot&#039;s changed since I started these posts. In particular I&#039;m now better able to talk about some things that I didn&#039;t have enough context on previously to talk about confidently. There&#039;s still a lot of stuff I&#039;m not the right person to cover (when is X champion getting a skin, can you unban my account, what&#039;s up with server maintenance etc). I&#039;d like to share wider info as well that isn&#039;t just gameplay when I can when it feels like it might be of interest though.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \r\n**Preseason changes and the PBE**\r\n\r\nPreseason changes will be on the PBE for longer the just the usual 2 week patch cycle. More details on that, and a run through of a lot of the changes, including many of the harder to spot numbers, next week. Changes are coming along well, still room to iterate and improve though, so feedback on them highly appreciated, especially early in their time on PBE.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------     \r\n**Context on some 8.21 changes**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve added, or tested, some late changes to 8.21 as you might have seen. Wanted to share context on a few of them:\r\n\r\n* Aatrox - We looked at a couple of possible nerfs to Aatrox, both lower base MS and/or shorter ult duration. Ended up pulling both though to instead go for more testing and potentially a larger set of changes in 8.22. \r\n* Aurelion Sol - Taking a bit of power out, in particular making him more vulnerable early to being all in&#039;d. Giving him a bit more regen to make his learning curve a bit less painful (newer players don&#039;t take advantage of going back to base to top up as much as they should on him, so regen is disproportionately valuable on them).\r\n* Irelia - Wanted to cut some power from her in all contexts (lanes, skill levels, different game phases, etc). Mobility looks a bit high, so hitting her base MS by 5 as a result. One of those changes that looks very small on paper but for some champs does have a pretty meaningful impact. Will reassess once its live, see if more is needed or not, with W CD a possible second target. \r\n* Zac - Buffing Q damage, both base a bit and rankup. Base is aimed at giving a little more early power, rank up at reducing the discrepancy between Q as 2nd max versus 3rd max. \r\n \r\n \r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Lethality Aatrox","date":"2018-10-19T16:16:10.180+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"meddler, an important question that has been bugging me\n\nis it ok if i spam urgotted in all chat if i kill someone as urgot?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-10-19T16:18:14.735+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":4,"body":"Just personal opinion but IMO spamming anything tends to make you a bit of jerk.

I feel really sceptical about making Aurelion Sol easier to all in, especially in the early game. I play him a decent amount and I know that when your lane opponent gets in your range, you literally can't do anything unless you have flash, ult, zhonya's, or an ally who can help protect you, and it is the worst feeling ever losing because you physically can't fight your opponent at that point. I know that weakness of 'being in his zone' is crucial to his counter play against him but still, I feel like if you made his strengths weaker instead of his already glaring weakness more apparent the changes would feel better.

I totally understand the rationale behind this, but as a Shaco player I have to ask:  Is our favorite clown going to be compensated somehow, either in numbers or with a mini-rework of his boxes?\n\nI completely see how the game as a whole might benefit from spawn times being earlier, but Shaco NEEDS the extra time to set up his first clear, and if camp spawns are earlier thus not allowing him to put down four boxes, his first clear is severely hindered.  The champion thus far has been balanced with his strong and/or versatile first clear in mind, and he needs the pre-spawn time to enable this, so making the proposed change could essentially gut Shaco unless he's compensated in other ways.  He already struggles enough in the early game because it's so easy to fall behind on him.\n\nWhat if the boxes were changed to a \"charge\" system similar to other champions' traps, and upon first level-up he received two traps?

This would make her clears nicer but not too overpowered early as it takes time to scale. This make counter jungling and assassination all the more present in her power spike. This could also help with top lane nid and some unique way that isn't too abusive midlane.\n\nHow about removing the attack speed buff part from her human e and replace it with some on hit dmg for the same period? Idk this one was just a random thought that sounded kind of fun. Don't take this one too seriously. Or do if you want.\n\nWhat if her traps instead of doing the minor dmg they do how about a slow and reduce magic resistance. Not by some crazy amount on either of the numbers but yknow make it feel like a hunting trap not some baby burn that gives vision. Do keep the passive part of it still and please make it not affectable by lane minions.\n\nHere are some other random ideas I got but idk I don't know nid that well. For obvious reasons none of these ideas are meant to all be put together.\n\nHer cat q gives a bonus on kills of minions and monsters.\n\nHer human e heal is stronger in a bush or jg.\n\nAfter killing a monster or minion her next auto attack is empowered. Has level scaling+mediocre AP scaling and a 20-15 second cooldown.\n\nWell that's all. Hmm one last request or Idk what this is lol. Create a way for behind nidalee to make an impact. I feel as though if she gets behind slightly and the enemy builds one hexdrinker or any mr she suddenly drops way too in damage and then provides not nearly as much use as even an Elise could provide. Give me feedback, I don't play nid almost at all but I love her design and used to play her season 5 quite a bit on my old account that got hacked...","replies":[{"poster":"WindLord7070","date":"2018-10-20T20:18:59.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"She doesn't need mana refund when just hitting enemies. That would also be abused by jungle nidalee same with giving her damage while in a bush. The attack speed buff is something that is very important despicably for AD nidalee so unless they buffed her base attack speed this wouldn't be a good change. I could see traps slowing champs and not damaging them for more than 1 damage as a thing. It's not something that can be easily abused at all and it's not the different from when she does build rylais.

That would also be abused by jungle nidalee same with giving her damage while in a bush. The attack speed buff is something that is very important despicably for AD nidalee so unless they buffed her base attack speed this wouldn&#x27;t be a good change. I could see traps slowing champs and not damaging them for more than 1 damage as a thing. It&#x27;s not something that can be easily abused at all and it&#x27;s not the different from when she does build rylais.

Like what I talked about with the  &quot;adaptation&quot; thing.\n\nI guess so just thought of some things they did for other champs that's why. Like compensation changes I meant if she were to get any of those maybe her mana costs would be higher so she can't just completely abuse them but just use q to last hit or poke once in awhile before going all in. Tbh Idk just wanted to put out some ideas maybe pique a new idea from you and others. I always love seeing people discuss and put live towards a champ that deserves it. Maybe if enough people talk about it riot will see and take the ideas they like best.

His strengths rely heavily on his team until late game, and if your team falls behind, Gnar will not be able to carry. His range is short, and his mega form is only as impactful as your team is.\n\nGutting his mobility and %hp dmg will even further reduce his carry potential and make him easier to build against ({{item:3047}}).

That would give him enough reach to do more damage on his own without getting easily popped. His %hp could then get slightly nerfed if need be, as he’d be more able to poke down tanks and may need to be managed.","replies":[{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2018-10-22T19:08:55.142+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lemonfaace,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=O0zz8A8c,comment-id=00210000,timestamp=2018-10-21T22:34:38.553+0000)\n>\n> TLDR; Gnar does not need a weaker mini form, and buffing mega form won’t fix his problems.
