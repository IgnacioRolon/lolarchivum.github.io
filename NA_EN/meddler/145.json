The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Patch 7.14**\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s a chance 7.14 might be a bit smaller than usual in terms of number of balance changes in it. That&#039;s from a combination of a holiday weekend coming up during the patch&#039;s development and that we&#039;re putting more focus than usual into some upcoming work (focus on research for qualifiers/Worlds patches, plus other stuff)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**7.14 Balance changes on PBE today**\r\n\r\nUsual deal, some stuff will still be under development so likely to change. Particularly worth calling out that the Udyr and Diana changes are pretty new to testing, so haven&#039;t been validated directly yet (possible those don&#039;t even hit PBE just yet). Lethality and other item changes are also still going through a bit more testing, so some likelihood of further change there, both since they were last mentioned and between now and the patch locking (Black Cleaver change for example hasn&#039;t tested as originally hoped so that&#039;s likely gone). \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Speaking of PBE today**\r\n\r\nNot much of a surprise alas, given some stuff went up early, keep an eye out a couple of hours from now though for both some details about our next new champ and at some point some more Darkin details for those of you interested in that side of the lore. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Starting Items**\r\n\r\nSomething we&#039;ve been finding as we work on the new runes system is that there are some choices existing runes/masteries offer via stats that are interesting choices but not currently included in the new runes system. In some cases that means creating new runes that cover those stats, in some other cases though we&#039;ve been looking at a wider range of starting items to cover those needs to. A good example of that which we&#039;re currently testing is a Doran&#039;s Attack Speed item, allowing an AD for AS tradeoff for those that want to go deeper down the AS path. Let us know if there are particular starting item niches you can think of that seem really promising, we still won&#039;t want to have too many, avoid overloading the system, but think there&#039;s probably room for at least a couple more than there are today.","replies":[{"poster":"T8 Speedwagon","date":"2017-06-27T16:36:56.704+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Given that worlds patch will be 7.18 and usually you keep that patch and 7.19 not so different to not make difference between what we play and they play at worlds.

The problem with champions like Azir and Ryze is that there is such a discrepancy in between the skill level of pros and regular players that the champions become oppressive in the hands of a skilled player and weak/ineffective in the hands of a less skilled player. Fiora isn't anywhere near the level of Azir or Ryze in terms of mechanical discrepancy. \n\n>she is the 1v1 queen so don't get too upset if you get smashed by her\n\nI understand that, but I shouldn't be dying to a squishy champion who is stacking AD items if I'm a tank. All the sustain she has in her kit paired with her stacking triple lifesteal makes her unkillable in the mid to late game. If she had a weak laning phase to make up for her power spike in the later portion of the game, it would be fair...but she's strong in the early game too. There is never a point in the game where her opponent can take advantage of her and come out on top.

There's a lot of champions that can use AS on runes and masteries, and that feels a lot better to play with it (adcs, junglers, some tops like irelia,jax, I even use on poppy,camille and yorick, and the difference of playing without any AS is HUGE).
