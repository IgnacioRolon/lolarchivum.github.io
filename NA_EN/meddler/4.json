The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped.\r\nIf you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Health Bar Improvements**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve got some health bar improvements coming to the PBE in the next week or two. Some of the changes will be more subtle stuff like making it a bit easier to tell how much damage you just took/dealt based off how the bar updates. Other changes will be more explicit like adding a clearer visualization for champs with resurrection effects available (Zac, Anivia, GA etc) so that figuring out whether someone will respawn or not doesn&#039;t have to involve digging through a bunch of icons on the buffbar. \r\n\r\nA lot more details about those changes to come from the team working on them once they&#039;re on PBE. We&#039;ll be continuing to work on them while they&#039;re on PBE, so feedback once they&#039;re there would be highly appreciated.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Item Tweaking in Pre-Season**\r\n\r\nIn addition to base stat and ability adjustments we&#039;re trying out some item changes to also adjust for the impact of runes. We&#039;re buffing a range of items, primarily those that offer magic pen or lethality, to compensate for damage their users have otherwise lost. The particular items in question were chosen because they both generally offer anti champion power (what was lost, and we don&#039;t want to increase waveclear unnecessarily) and because they&#039;re pretty closely tied to champs who need a bit more help in the new runes world. We&#039;re still planning to look at AP items as well sometime early next year, it&#039;s likely a change or two we&#039;d originally been considering for that package of work gets pulled forwards and done here though. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**7.21 will be a really light patch**\r\n\r\nJust a quick reminder that there won&#039;t be much in 7.21 given there&#039;s so much coming in 7.22. A few small balance adjustments, but nothing too major. Most of it&#039;s on the PBE already, possible we get one or two more things depending on what time permits though (chance of Udyr buffs, Locket adjustments). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"KennysDreamGirl","date":"2017-10-13T17:49:06.112+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"i cant think of a question so im just gonna say hi","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-10-13T19:19:29.722+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can think of an answer: Hi!","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2017-10-14T00:19:49.596+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey since you are talking about improving health bars.

Other than basic resources like health and mana, we feel the healthbar space should be reserved for much more timely info or else you end up with a cluttered game-space pretty quickly.\n\nTotally different scenario would be if those champs gained that enormous offensive power off a button press in-the-moment.","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2017-10-16T23:12:39.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"why not display \"milestones\" graphically then?

The next best solution I think would be to add in-game cues to the characters that scale with stacks, similar to how Cho Gath scales in size and Bard has more meeps\n\n----------------------------\n\n* **Rengar:** Global Quote/Rawr to enemy champions whenever he gets a bounty stack\n\n* **Kindred:** Global Quote/Sound each time they achieve the next power level\n\n* **Nasus and Veigar:** Glowing particles on their model that gets more pronounced every 50 stacks or particles/effects that \"scale\" in another way\n\n* ** Veigar 2:** His voice could be modified so that the more stacks he gets, the more \"evil\" he sounds (teaches inexperienced players they are getting more powerful) \n\n* **Thresh:** Lanterns gets brighter by X number of stacks\n\n* **Bard:** Global sound by X number of chimes collected\n\n* ** Sion** you can look at his health bar already I guess, but his belly could glow briefly and make a sound by X number of stacks so inexperienced players know they are doing a good job","replies":[{"poster":"CrabDust","date":"2017-10-17T00:51:23.506+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We haven't explored a solution, but I could see the scoreboard (TAB screen) being a really good fit for this kind of info.

The Guise + Chapter (or Cata) item would be a great rush item; fill a distinct niche between Morello, ROA, and Archangel; and maintain the power curve for mages who need some early pen + Precision but don't necessarily stack pen. And it's usable by champs with no feet.\n\nThe point of the Liandry's change is to give pen-stacking and dot mages a flat pen component early that builds into % shred item to maintain scaling in late game. The % pen is mostly just replacing Piercing Thoughts and stacks over 3 seconds, making it unappealing to burst mages.\n\nI'll spare you the math, but the True Damage threshold with this itemization is 1 MR away from live, and the power curve is more fair to mages and enemies alike. Don't believe me? Assuming max pen, here are the intervals:\n\nLive: 22 at spawn > 37 at boots > 52 at 1 component > 52+35% at 2 items > 56 + 35% at lvl 18\n\nReforged: 0 at spawn > 15 at boots > 25 at first component > 35 at full item > 45 at item + component > 45 + 6-12% at two items > 45 + 51-57% at three items\n\nBalance achieved.\n\n**TL;DR: This idea works, is more fair, and is more sustainable. Free pen on Sorcs and Void are not the right changes. These buffs are disproportionately strong in some fights (eg Syndra/Veigar vs. any squishy) and disproportionately weak in other fights (eg Cassio/Zyra vs. Galio, Vlad, etc).**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkrown","date":"2017-10-13T17:22:25.985+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Meddler!

Would probably leave it at total pen though, given base MR's so much lower so the value of changing versus disruption cost isn't as meaningful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zoms","date":"2017-10-13T17:47:43.276+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've noticed that Rakan's ability Battle Dance stacks when cast on the same target.

Why delay some champions but then leave others to delete people in .000001 seconds? Why is it only bad when certain assassins do it?\nNotice that assassin kayn has no delayed burst too.\n\nI truly do think you guys should get rid of the delayed burst thing. It creates too large of a window for adc's to melt the class that's supposed to counter them.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Redesignated","date":"2017-10-14T16:30:33.521+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The vast majority of assassins are hyper-mobile â€” they can get in and kill you, then almost immediately get out. Before their damage output had a more significant time delay added to it, they were excruciatingly frustrating to play against, especially if you couldn't match their mobility, or didn't rush a high-price, low-combat-efficiency defensive item; there would be significant chunks of time in a match where you had basically zero counterplay against instantly being killed as certain roles.\n\nConversely, most burst mages are immobile, slow, and have higher starting cooldowns that can be punished. Barring one or two (coughcoughSyndra), they also tend to be highly reliant on skillshots for bursting people instantly, meaning their damage can be dodged. Very few mages can exert strong roaming pressure like assassins can, as well.\n\nADCs, though, have been problematic for a while â€” not necessarily in terms of their general killing potential, but in how quickly they can *achieve* that killing potential, how that killing potential applies to not only champions but also turrets and Drake/Baron, and the added protection that they get because of their universal threat.\n\nThe strength and sheer variety in their item choices coupled with a \"protect the ADC\" meta have let even \"scaling\" builds powerspike really early. Someone standing there right-clicking you is going to kill you in about the same timeframe as an assassin given equal tools, which would be fine, but now top and jungle are usually expected to play secondary support to the ADC, and the primary support is forced into rushing their strongest ADC-enabling item because their other choices are terrible. ADCs will have an entire team backing them up, even more than they used to.\n\nYes, ADC is overpowered, but that doesn't mean assassins need buffs. People have been complaining about powercreep for years; we don't need to remove an important balancing factor to one role so that it can become broken, just to compete with another role that's already broken and needs nerfs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Off Meta Zilean","date":"2017-10-13T21:12:10.238+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, Meddler - why are champions like Zilean who buy Lucidity Boots midlane not being compensated for the damage loss that other mages are getting back via Sorc Boots?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tantarboy","date":"2017-10-13T17:16:42.508+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any update on the Galio anti mage/MR changes that you had mention a bit ago?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-10-13T17:30:03.146+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Galio work got delayed as we had to pull the designer on it onto other more urgent stuff.
