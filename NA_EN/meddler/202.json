{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-04-11T16:18:07.667+0000","title":"Quick Gameplay Thoughts: April 11","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi all,\r\n\r\nApart from the upcoming duo release (Xayah/Rakan) we&#039;re pretty focused on mid-season right now. Imagine we&#039;ll be talking about our plans for that, possible followup, and actual followup for a while to come.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**AD item changes**\r\n\r\nAlong with the durability item changes there are now also some AD item changes on the PBE. They&#039;re part of the mid-season changes too, so won&#039;t be shipping in 7.8, which means they&#039;ll vanish for a few days as we test a final 7.8 build at some point. \r\n\r\nMore context on the AD changes at the link below, short version is:\r\n\r\n* Reducing % armor pen/shred in the item system (too high, invalidating armor purchases too much when multiple sources are stacked).\r\n* Zeal item tweaking to do things to make it so Runaan&#039;s isn&#039;t simply the best choice in too many circumstances (currently best AOE, best single target and best build path), Kircheis Shard isn&#039;t as weak if you have to sit on it for a bit, RFC is more about increased range attacks/less about damage etc\r\n* Tweaking IE, Zeal to offer a bit more of an power spike like other frequent early/mid game items\r\n* Tuning big lifesteal items (BotRK is too strong, others too weak, so nerfing it and buffing Death&#039;s Dance, BT, Ravenous Hydra slightly)\r\n* Making Greivous Wounds less accessible in AD builds\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/Ejyoz66h-midseason-ad-itemization-changes\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Amumu**\r\n\r\nIn 7.7 we made some changes to Amumu, which included a new passive that amps magic damage. Due to some internal miscommunication we ended up shipping a version that gives 15% bonus true damage calculated off the amount of magic damage dealt post mitigation. That&#039;s effectively bonus magic damage rather than true, since it&#039;s calculated after MR&#039;s done its things already. We&#039;ll be changing it in 7.8 as a result. Since 15% true damage is a lot stronger than 15% magic damage and Amumu&#039;s looking fairly strong already we&#039;ll be toning that number down though (current value in testing is 8%).\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Randuin&#039;s**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve got some further experimental changes to Randuin&#039;s Omen underway at the moment that will probably be hitting PBE sometime today. Long term we think we&#039;ll probaly position crit as a multiplier that lets marksmen get through tankier targets, without being as effective as it is at present against squishies. We were testing one way of doing that until a couple of weeks ago with IE&#039;s passive being changed so it added armor pen to crits instead of increasing crit damage, though we didn&#039;t get enough confidence from testing that that was something we should ship in mid-season given it&#039;s a pretty major change. In that context Randuin&#039;s having crit reduction didn&#039;t make sense (if crits are for killing tankier targets reduced crit damage arguably belongs on an item for squishy champs instead). Since we&#039;re not going with that change though Randuin&#039;s will likely get its crit reduction back, at least until we potentially look at crits in general again (unlikely to be before pre-season at the earliest).\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Support Item Changes**\r\n\r\nStarting support item changes will be part of the 7.9 PBE deploys at this point, they&#039;re not quite going to be ready in time for testing during 7.8. More details on those to come later in the week. One thing I will mention in advance though is that we&#039;re changing the actions you need to take on the Ancient Coin line to something a bit more noticeable/skill expressive (so optimizing around it gives you more rewards if done well/less if done poorly, rather than being as flat as it currently is).","replies":[{"poster":"Hikageya","date":"2017-04-11T16:26:51.611+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Is there some change planed on nami?","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-04-11T16:28:41.766+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm missing some context here, why does Nami need changes?","replies":[{"poster":"Hikageya","date":"2017-04-11T16:32:25.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Heard somewhere they were planing to nerf her.
