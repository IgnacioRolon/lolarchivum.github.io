The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n**More solo carry potential work**\r\n \r\nWe&#039;re continuing to work on changes that get a bit more solo carry potential back in the game. 8.10&#039;s got the bounty changes (solo gold, not team gold) and jungle changes (junglers not being able to level 3 gank as early). For 8.11 we&#039;re looking at shifting some tower gold, on both outer and inner towers, from team gold to solo gold, focus that increased power more on whoever&#039;s gained that advantage for their team.\r\n \r\nOne important thing to note is that increased solo carry potential is going to result in more cases of single champions snowballing and deciding the game. We think we&#039;ve pushed too far on teamplay, hence some movement back in the other direction. Does mean there&#039;ll be more cases of one person doing well, getting fed and dominating though. If your actions as a single player can carry the game, so can other people&#039;s. We think that&rsquo;ll be good overall, but will come at some trade off. \r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n**Other 8.11 Changes**\r\n \r\nBanner of Command:\r\n \r\n* Looking to make it less rushable. We think Banner creates some cool strategic play post laning phase. During lane though it tends to just somewhat degrade laning interaction, particularly on champs who use all of its stats pretty well (hi Sion). Might do something like make the bonuses it gives minions scale with champion level as a result.\r\n \r\nCelerity\r\n \r\n* Celerity&#039;s currently a strong all purpose choice in its row that drowns out other options too much. As always on movement speed it also contributes to creeping up average speeds. We were going to make some changes to it in 8.10 with the other minor runes balancing, but concluded something a bit larger was needed than just numbers tweaking. Going to be looking at modifications like MS only in combat, or after every ability cast, rather than on all the time as a result.\r\n \r\nShurelia&#039;s\r\n \r\n* Currently looks too good on a few champs using it primarily personal power (Vlad, Singed etc) and not good enough on those picking it up to help their team (supports for example). Going to look at equalizing that a bit (team users stronger, other users weaker, or at least not stronger again).\r\n \r\nChampions\r\n \r\n* We&#039;ll continue work on Taliyah and Kha&#039;Zix that was started during 8.10 but didn&#039;t make the cut off for the patch. \r\n* Other champion balance changes to come too, we&#039;re currently trying an approach where we focus on systemic stuff (items, runes, jungle etc) early in the patch and then champion balance implementation kicks off a bit later. More details to come as a result. \r\n* Likely for smaller changes we take a look at at least Sejuani (hit too hard by recent changes) and Zyra (seeing what we can do to make plants a bit better without putting them back in &#039;it&#039;s not worth paying the cost to kill these&#039; land).  \r\n \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Sterak&#039;s**\r\n \r\nWe&#039;ll be holding off on Sterak&#039;s changes (e.g. decoupling it from TriForce builds somewhat) until we know where other possible fighter item changes are up to. Will revisit in a few patches as a result.\r\n \r\n \r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-05-11T16:00:21.371+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":4,"body":"Re: Celerity\n\nBefore Rune Reforged, it was possible to get +4.5% MS from Quint.

It was basically designed as a decent rune choice for everyone.

It's not fun feeling at the mercy of your team to win the game. That creates toxicity because people feel that they don't have agency to carry if they get 1-2 truly clueless players. Their performance is intricately tied to that of their teams and when there's a huge disparity, it creates enormous frustration. If you've got a troll or someone not really trying or playing in a selfish way (hello full AP Sona), it's even more demoralizing because it feels like you got trolled and despite being serious and doing your best - perhaps even playing near flawlessly, these players robbed you of the game. They have that power over you and in S4 it didn't feel like this was the case as much. I remember using hypercarries like AP Kog and being able to win 6-25 games if the enemy team was toying with us too long (hello Zeds spamming laugh in base for 5 minutes straight). It's also not fun to watch and makes people appreciate high ranked or pro players less. Even watching pros, it's often \"oh, he gets the worse team so he loses\" or \"oh, his team is quite behind\" so he's useless. No flashy plays, no outplay from a 5 year LCS veteran.. just waiting for the FF vote or trying hard but being ineffectual.\n\nOn top of that, you've got this massive snowball meta where being behind is a death sentence (again making it really hard to win if you RNGd a worse team). It's not enough that the enemy team has way more gold/levels/dragons etc., they also get more pushing minions, nearly unstoppable Baron/Rift pushes and so on. Watching a tennis match with a lopsided score can still be exciting because each point exists in a vacuum. There have been comebacks from 2 sets down and match point. The better player that day wins but it doesn't feel like \"because he won the first set\" now his opponent has no chance. No, he won the first set because he was better but now if his opponent is better, he can just as easily lose the next set and the match. You're not artificially rewarded.\n\nLeague shouldn't be this extreme since you want players to be rewarded for good play/to be able to close out but the discrepancy created by Baron/Rift, the easily killed turrets, the pushing waves when behind etc. make comebacks few and far between even if the other team is playing like monkeys. It feels like getting ahead almost guarantees a win no matter how badly they play after that (as long as they don't get Baron stolen). They don't have to play well the entire game and this makes it a horrible match when it is a bit destabilized by one lane or something like that. It also makes luck far more important. A good player can only really exert his skill in the first 15-20 minutes because after that it just snowballs like crazy in either direction and the quality of decisions has little influence. In a tennis match or other sports, you have to play well the entire time to beat a player (no matter the score). You don't get to chill just because you're ahead. You can afford to lose more points but you're not handed free advantages in each individual point.\n\nComing back even with a scaling comp. is not just an uphill battle but a near impossibility. Even competitive play shows this. It's just win early -> clean/efficient stomp, first securing baron vision + a pick if possible -> baron -> unavoidable game winning push. Comebacks shouldn't be artificial like how catch up XP made it a while back but they should ALWAYS be possible if the enemy team makes enough mistakes. Why would I want to watch or play a game where if my team is shit I'm useless and also stuck there another 10-15 minutes? If at least I feel there's a solid 10-20% chance to scale up, outplay etc. I'd have my head in the game more and people would rage/blame less too. Raging and blaming happens mostly because a player has mentally given up on winning the game. \n\nRight now, it's just terrible when behind. You can't even leave base or fight if you get the perfect engage. The base just crumples, the minions kill you during the fight etc. It's mentally draining and not fun. It also warps the meta for champions and strategies. S4 and S5 were both FAR more interesting to play and watch. I still remember the amazing CLG matches with split pressure. \n\nNow, competitive especially is like watching paint dry and that's coming from a devoted fan. I don't see the solo carries like in the past with SKT's Bang holding the base and acing the enemy team with 3 inhibs down almost by himself on Ezreal... amazing match and skill. I don't see the nail biters and the tension. I don't see the outplays (reducing JG gank options won't help this). I see one team stomp or one team get stomped. It's almost robotic. There were super tense matches I linked to my friends years back and I haven't for a single one this year. \n\nEven small leads snowball way too hard because you just can't do anything. Turrets are taken easily/dived, you're zoned from objectives, what do you even do? Every mechanism artificially makes the game unwinnable after a lead is created. That's the key word ARTIFICIALLY. It's not just their items and level advantage. You can try to play around that or scale. It's everything else. It's like if someone playing tennis and up a set then gets a \"fun new mechanic\" where his ball speed on hit is increased by 50%. Now, it's not just the opponent having to battle from behind a set. They are also having to play a really unfair match. This is how League games feel when behind. \n\nI think Baron and Rift probably just shouldn't exist in their current form. They make the game a lot worse. Even if you want minions to push/takedown structures, maybe don't make them do so much damage to champions too. Let the other team have a chance to at least fight and hold their ground rather than just autolose. There's just so much artificial help for the winning team and it makes the game much less fun on either side. Even removing base turrets completely but not having Baron/Rift or artificial super strong pushing would be so much better. Maybe at least give the enemy team some options to counteract it if you keep it the same? Perhaps something like shrines which can disable baron minions in a particular lane etc. Create ways to give the team from behind a chance to outplay. A fair chance that they need to earn not just \"oh here's some free catchup XP and a lot of shutdown gold\". Shutdown gold is maybe OK but it seems to overly punish you for being ahead and making a mistake. It's not an equivalent exchange. Your mistake becomes bigger than the enemy team's in the same situation even though I see no reason why this should be the case. It's another artificial mechanic.\n\nYour goal should be to make the game require fair but quality play at all points. No artificiality, just skill (with multiple dimensions required and less down time).  When being ahead is all that matters, there isn't even much skill expression possible when significantly behind. It rewards getting a lucky lead rather than outplaying. This even makes matchmaking worse if a few players managed to RNG that 5-10 games in a row and are then placed way above their true skill. This reduced skill expression because of how critical it is to be ahead also makes it much more important to play meta junglers who are strong early/mid game. It all becomes so constrained.\n\nBeing ahead needs to give advantages but nothing insurmountable and it shouldn't be this  \"oh, we get a free win now because we got baron/are ahead\". The behind team should always have options to come back that if ignored/not managed properly will allow them to turn the tables. If your game seems like a foregone conclusion just off a rift or baron, there's something really wrong with it and it leads to the \"I give up mentality\" that's so prevalent. Players give up as a result of their experience and seeing that should be a huge red flag for Riot that the game is NOT fun when behind because the ahead team gets too many artificial advantages just by virtue of being ahead, not any real sustained outplay. The complaint will be that \"how will games end then?\" \"won't people be really risk averse and just farm all game?\" \"won't teams outplaying for 20 minutes be overly punished for one mistake throwing it all away?\" This is fair and that's why it has to be well designed so that there are important objectives for both sides and in both situations. I think fallen turrets providing some sort of shrine you can capture to offset baron/supers somewhat could be a way to deal with it. If the enemy team wants to keep pushing, they have to take over that area of control and fight for it. Right now the game is only fun in the 25% or so games that are balanced. The stomps are kind of fun but not really because they are just too easy to win. Getting stomped sucks and is draining, especially if you had no agency. 25% of games being fun is not good. I want this to be a high skill came that is worth mastering but artificially winning from an early lead isn't OK.","replies":[{"poster":"YourQQ","date":"2018-05-11T20:31:33.554+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=wobaji,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=B3kWBlWr,comment-id=006e,timestamp=2018-05-11T19:55:09.057+0000)\n>\n> This is probably the worst aspect of the game right now.

Now, they all get stronger so you don't even have a clear target to focus. Or, it doesn't matter because the whole team is so much stronger overall. League's bad enough when behind without rewarding players who don't deserve it.\n\nThe best way to make the game more fun is to have it be a bit like football with territory or score in other games. Make turrets REALLY FREAKING strong and reduce power for baron and rift. This way, getting these static advantages is very powerful but the other team isn't artificially gimped for combat and teamfighting.\n\nBTW: A lot of players wouldn't enjoy winning as much if they made it so hard. People like to relax and mess around a bit in games with large leads. The winning team being a lot stronger and messing around a bit is part of the fun. If turrets really mattered, maybe the winning team could still do that a bit since a lost teamfight would just equal a turrets taken, not an inhibitor. The progress in territory would really matter, just like having a high score in a sport. It matters because it gives you a lot of chances to mess up without being behind but not because it gives you any other special advantages.\n\nAlso, teams definitely still can come back even now. It's not impossible. It's just hard and the winning team gets more than just what they earned through outplaying. On the other hand, if they didn't, a lot of early game risks or snowball picks would become silly. If a pick falls off or you're taking a high risk, you probably need more than just what you deserve to make it a good choice. I don't know what to think about this. Maybe there can be more fair ways of snowballing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LetYourSleepWane","date":"2018-05-11T19:58:28.178+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"game's just way too meta dependent... it's less about growing and understanding it by being a better player rather than just abusing broken shit/strategies\n\nI don't feel like I'm better a lot of the time I win. I just pick a stronger champ while they pick a trash comp and then just can't do anything. say the enemy JG goes Lee and Pick Trundle. he has to win hard early or he's just useless if I just farm and he doesn't even win 1v1. He has a lot of mobility and playmaking but if we just group 5v5, it doesn't mean as much as Trundle pillar + dps + R. he can look cool playing Lee and then I just farm and show up for rift or dragon. we 5v5, we win. same with Elise and a ton of other junglers. they pick \"cute\" champs and I pick efficient champs. they basically win the games they'd win anyway and I win the close ones. they just diceroll the close games. \"cute\" champions like Ekko JG, Elise, Fiddle, etc. don't even have great late games so why are they taking all that risk? just snowball early and hope to have a 2-3k old lead by 10 minutes or useless. why would you ever pick them if you want to win? most ganks don't require a fancy cacoon or lee flash R, they just require a dumb laner overpushing with no wards/refusing to adapt to getting camped. it almost doesn't matter what you play there. you can even be a nunu and they'll still die. so who really cares that lee and ekko can go over walls or do other fancy shit? it doesn't mean anything in most teamfights and that's what makes or breaks the game. efficiency wins. flashy champs don't.\n\nit's mostly about about picks/comp/meta, not individual skill/general game knowledge. if I have a shit comp and players 110 MMR higher, my chance to win is actually still worse despite the better players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HighIqLowLife","date":"2018-05-11T16:06:33.775+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":15,"body":"Guys consider lowering the CD on supports items if you want to change the meta","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-05-11T16:15:14.864+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"What's the problem you're trying to solve with that change?

Like returning her to her old kit pre mid year mage update. I feel her old kit was much better then the current kit and her power was better distributed to areas of her kit where she could display skill rather then the RNG machine she feels to be now. I PERSONALLY feel her old Q Deadly Bloom was better prefering the range over the width. Also I feel having less plants that were more impactful was better then having a bunch of them that werent that impactful. And if not that change.... could you concider increasing Zyra's ROOT duration rank 1 so that its on par with other Mid Lane mages. ATM her 0.75 second root is not enough to peel a gank. I just see alot of area of improvement for Zyra as a champion and I feel like improving on her CC is smart as thematically Crowd Control fits her... Another idea I thought of was maybe lowering the Cooldown of her ultimate so its on par with other mages with similiar abilities. Orianna comes to mind... she has a fairly short cooldown on her ult and its much more reliable then Zyra's.

But THIS IS HOW MUCH I CARE about Zyra! I would reallly REAAAAAAAAAAALLLLY REALLLY like to see Zyra reverted to pre mid year mage update. I feel she was far more balanced then she currently is and much easier to tune. Before Zyra had less plants that were allowed to be more impactful and last longer because there were less of them to deal with for the enemy. Her old Q had further outward range allowing her to be safer in mid lane her being an extremely fragile champion she deserves to have that bit of outward range that she lost. Also the skill was a bit harder to land but also allowed her to manage her waves a bit better AND it allowed her to set her Seeds up in favorable positions without accidently spawning all her plants instantly when she uses her Q to farm or poke. Sometimes its not always favorable to pop all your plants. Regardless though, she had less plants which is a good thing but those plants were more impactful, their only issue at the time that most players had with them was their buggy targetting system. Really the mid year mage update didnt need to be this big for her, she just needed her plants targetting code to be fixed and maybe a bit more interesting passive. But the passive she was given was a huuge power budget waste on a passive that is RNG and has little thought or player imput in controlling. OLD zyra only needed a few changes to modernize her, not this huge kit change that she got and became very annoying to deal with when strong or really useless when weak. PLEASE RIOT give us old zyra back... id take OLD passive over the current any day of the weak as well as the old Q Deadly Bloom.\n\nZyra holds a VERY VERY SPECIAL place in my heart... ive loved this champion for many seasons... and it devastated me when you guys changed her. I STILL hold hope she will get reverted like the other mid year mage updates. AND IM LITERALLY BEGGING U GUYS AS A DEDICATED MEMBER... please.

I'm not sure if I agree with the goal or not, but I definitely don't like the methods being used. Who gets a shutdown kill and who gets a tower kill is far more about random luck or which champion you're playing than a player's actual ability to carry. These changes feel lazy and uninspired with likely little to no positive impact at best.\n\nFor me personally the solo carry issue is being addressed completely backwards. You should be working on ensuring we are paired with teammates who have similar understandings of how to work as a team and a desire to do so. But that's a big, complicated issue involving far more than the live balance team, so we're back to shutdowns to the killer which even if it works decently well comes with costs and is obviously the far worse solution in the long term...\n\nI feel that Celerity would be better as a flat ms increase that either goes up with level or with boot tier (I prefer boot tier). Balance it around giving as much ms as it currently does to typical slow champions. Not sure what to do with the AP/AD it gives but maybe just scrap that and add a tiny bit more ms on top of what I just said about the speed? Also as others have said, part of Celerity's issue is that the competition is a bit lacking.\n\nKha'Zix changes are very welcome but also very late.

They played it and were attracted to it because they wanted to carry or appreciated amazing displays of skill by other players. Team play is not interesting and just breeds toxicity. I want to see and demonstrate individual skill above all. Most people want an audience, not a team. I want to see Faker's LB shit on everything not Faker's team carry him through \"team play.\" Plus, team play just makes duo abusing even stronger and now you guys even allow Masters and Challengers to do it. I think it's pretty ridiculous that even top 25 challenger can have people duo abusing a lot. How can you even have players be \"worshipped\" or really impressive if you don't even make top 25 challenger just about individual skill? You tried team play, you tried the dynamic queue cancer that took a dump over competitive integrity and made this game a joke in many people's eyes, now bring it back to what people ACTUALLY want to see. It's a hell of a lot more fun even when stomped to watch some Ekko 1v5 rather than his team be all stronger everywhere and the people who contribute to the 'team\" aspect most often don't even get any credit.\n\nYou might ask why I play a team game at all. Well, I enjoy the feeling of carrying them, of having an audience and of seeing different roles/champs all try to outplay each other. I sure as hell don't want to be dependent on them though. The social aspect is kind of fun too but again, the minute you make me highly dependent on them, you suck the fun out of it for me and make it feel like a chore. Even the people who play support mostly do it because they win more, it's very impactful but the competition is less fierce and they get a lot of positive feedback from the team. A lot of them would want a carry role if they were equally effective on it. It's just that support is more impactful than a lot of carry champs. But if you discover that you can be a Janna main and get Gold pressing just E while sitting behind your ADC, maybe you won't bother trying something else.\n\nAlso, the way the bot now punishes even banter from competitive players or criticism is just insane and that kills the game for people that actually are dedicated to it. It takes half the fun out of a competitive game. People even talk shit in spots all the time even if they might not do it on TV.

Or maybe 5% more AP on Q (but that's probably more annoying to face than W since it's so spammable). Idk, but his late game should be a lot better considering he can't solo-carry and one-shot like a Fizz can or even a Xerath can. The Liandry's change really sucked for him as a poke champion. He's also really vulnerable. His damage isn't even bad at all if he can hit consistently but that's not realistic.
