{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-02-17T17:32:59.316+0000","title":"Quick gameplay thoughts: Feb 17","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi folks,\r\n\r\nAnother set of current thoughts here. Previous set can be found at the link below. These should be pretty frequent, but certainly won't happen every day. Length is also likely to vary a lot too. Also important to mention that these aren't remotely comprehensive - they're quick notes on some things we're thinking about, not a full list of every gameplay change going on. \r\n\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/NxMaaYvf-quick-gameplay-thoughts-feb-16\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Aatrox**\r\n\r\nWe've got some Aatrox changes that should be hitting the PBE early next week. Those are balance/game health changes, aimed at putting Aatrox into a better place until we can get to a larger update for him at some point. \r\n\r\nMain changes there are:\r\n\r\n* Shifting the passive to a windowed one (proc that grants AS/AD and revive if off CD for a duration, with some downtime). Goal is to offer periods of comparative strength and weakness (lot of the issues we've had with Aatrox's game health have been due to the nature of his revive passive)\r\n* Removal of % health costs, probably a flat health cost on E. One of Aatrox's big issues is that he's pretty feast or famine, stat checking people hard with a drain tank pattern or just dying. Giving him the flexibility to build defense more (health) without getting as punished by his kit for it gives some good fallback options/alternate builds.\r\n* Changing the W heal so it's not dependent on his AD, or as extremely different above/below 50% health. Ties in with the build path options above, with a % missing heal looking like a fairly likely mechanic. \r\n* More details and context next week. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Someday support possibility**\r\n\r\nOne idea we've been kicking around a lot recently is that we should potentially be giving support power in non gold means more. As a position support has some pretty different gameplay. At present it also earns noticeably less gold than other positions, resulting in reduced feelings of agency. Something we're interested in exploring at some point though is giving alternate forms of power, rather than increased gold (other ways to earn specific stats or unique items?).\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**7.5 Visual Changes**\r\n\r\nAlong with other gameplay changes in 7.5 we're also aiming to ship a number of things that should improve the visual quality of LoL in small ways. Current list (more details coming next week) looks like:\r\n\r\n* Better communication around the recall state for champions/skins without recall animations\r\n* Adjusted tooltip color scheme in game, slight layout tweaks\r\n* Corrections to make certain spell indicators always draw over the top of terrain regardless of height differences (should always see Panth R or Zyra R for example)\r\n* Making more spell indicators not show in spectator or to allies (e.g. the ring around Varus E on the ground's meaningful to enemies and Varus, but allies and spectators don't need that level of precision)\r\n* A quick sizing pass on a few champions and skins (adjusting outliers up/down to where they should be relative to other champions' height). \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Edge of Night**\r\n\r\nWe're going to see if we can pull a nerf for Edge of Night forwards into 7.4, or at least do a low risk hotfix the same day 7.4 hits. Urgency on that feels high enough at this point we don't think we should wait another patch. Most likely changes (still being discussed) are increasing the CD again and lowering the AD on it. Possible whatever changes are made will be temporary as well if the conclusion during 7.5 development is a different nerf is better long term.","replies":[{"poster":"Sevixys","date":"2017-02-17T18:36:22.300+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":0,"body":"> #Aatrox\n\n**IT'S HAPPENING!!!

Currently it just feels like the worst experience ever when a lane opponent buys an item for 800 that has no counterplay and ruins him pretty hard.\n\nInterested to hear some clarification and thoughts.

Not necessarily something that external to the champion or that impactful, but that sort of alternate thing to do you can be good or bad at.\n\nI can't see removal of Soraka's W health cost happening without her being an extremely different champion. She's designed around being a premier healer and the health cost there's pretty important to making that more acceptable.

And there's no way you're going to be able to exploit that whole \"channel cancel\" bit because, unless your opponent is brainless, he'll never expose himself until after the channel is complete.\n\nIt isn't the cooldown that's the problem; it's the duration. 10 seconds feels like forever in a fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-02-18T19:43:44.475+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Reducing the duration (7s? 5s?) is one of the possible nerfs we're looking at for 7.5.
