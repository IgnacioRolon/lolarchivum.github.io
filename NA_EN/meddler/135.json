{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-06-20T15:56:12.964+0000","title":"Quick Gameplay Thoughts: June 20","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi folks,\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**Usual Disclaimers**\r\n\r\nThese posts will often contain talk about future work we&#039;re doing, or planning to do, that isn&#039;t yet guaranteed to ship. The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**AD Item Micropatch**\r\n\r\nEarlier this week we put out a micro patch that buffed Stormrazor (AD and MS), IE (gold cost) and ER (more AS, though shorter duration). Goal there was to buff marksmen who use those items somewhat, with our goal still being to get marksmen back into a better spot without pushing other classes out of bot lane. We decided to go with a micro patch partway through 8.12 both because it helps address a clear need and because it gives us a chance to assess the impact of these item buffs while we&#039;re considering which champion buffs to put into 8.13. If the items add more or less power to individual champs than predicted means we can react to that for the upcoming patch, rather than needing to wait another two weeks.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the impact of the micro patch we&#039;ve only seen a bit of play with the buffed items at time of writing. Looks like Xayah and Tristana have benefited noticeably, though not enormously. Other ADCs haven&#039;t changed much, some movement in how much they win but just within normal fluctuations. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------   \r\n**Gold/XP funneling**\r\n\r\nAfter spending time assessing funneling strats last week we&#039;ve come to the conclusion that, at least for now, the correct approach to dealing with them is to address a small subset of champions, rather than trying to make wider systemic changes. The systemic options we looked at all came with significant costs to other types of play we didn&#039;t want to affect (lane minion XP penalties with jungle items, return of over leveled jungle XP, limit of one support item per team etc). Looking at funneling play most of it&#039;s heavily concentrated on just a few champs who are also on the strong side and nerf candidates anyway. \r\n\r\nChamp changes/rationale:\r\n\r\n* Master Yi - Removing bonus damage to minions so that he can&#039;t clear waves almost instantly. Reducing Q mana cost as well to reduce degree that hits lane/split push Yi.\r\n* Taric - Lowering E base damage and increasing Armor ratio so his effectiveness isn&#039;t as gold independent. Also increasing ult CD which is just a bit short for its power.\r\n* Nunu - Nerfing W AP bonus. He&#039;s got a VGU coming up moderately soon and AP boosting isn&#039;t on the revised kit. Hitting it as a result given Karthus/Nunu is the other big problem case apart from Taric/Yi.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"Shaian","date":"2018-06-20T16:06:17.868+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":10,"body":"Can you finally give Zyra changes to her passive and plants. AoE, melee attacks (especially melees who build attackspeed actually have no downside from attacking plants), tiamat (yea i spawn a plant on top of myself, enemy uses auto on me +  tiamat and kills it rly cool interaction) are still way way WAY too efficient against her. Yasuo and Irelia oneshotting plants while using them as dashes is so unfair. One wave of gps ult insta kills any ULTED PLANT. INSTAKILLS IT. ONE WAVE OF HOW MANY? Its so boring to play. I dont care how much power you take from her passive or what else you can nerf. Just make it not suck to play. Im not talking about power. Im talking about gameplay. And that part really really sucks and its not addressed after 7 months and im really really upset, it decreases my enjoyment and deteriorates my experience of playing league so much. Can this get addressed please im so depressed.\n\nAh yes and new Taliyah Q. Rly fun when she kills 2 plants and throws 3 rocks on me with a single Q. Really nice interaction. Corki and MF oneshotting plants with a single auto as ranged rly cool too. Karthus oneshotting plants with his Crit Q rly cool too. So much interaction i love it yes.

One being the fact that TT is used to it and Jungle meta on TT is still viable and capable of dealing with Support meta if played correctly, Jungle vs Support meta there is some kind of skill matchup, while on SR nobody seems to know how to play against the strategy. This in my opinion would definitely not explain why one would want to nerf it instead of waiting for players to find strategies around that one. The other issue is how SR is designed and ressources are distributed there. Your potential gold income with this strategy on SR is significantly higher than on TT due to a multitude of factors so you get to a point where Support meta overpowers Jungle meta way earlier and it takes even longer for Jungle meta to catch up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SonicÐeHedgedawg","date":"2018-06-20T16:22:13.574+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler, hope your day is going well.\n\nDo you feel like Sejuani's buff landed her in a good place or that she's going to need more buffs?\n\nI think when she got nerfed for pro play it hurt her a lot for non-pro, and the shortened game time has crippled her ability to be a late-game scaling tank","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-06-20T16:27:55.327+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We were just talking about her yesterday.
