The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get delayed or even stopped. If you'd like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    \n**Karma**\n\nLate last year we explored some changes to Karma that involved giving her a new W that reduced allied CDs amongst other things. That tested pretty well, though also raised some questions about whether Karma was the right fit for it. After some further testing and discussion while waiting on some code changes for it we've backed away from plans to put that on Karma. We'll likely explore it for another champion at some point instead though. \n\nWe don't have other changes currently underway for Karma. Something we'd like to try whenever we do next work on her though is an adjustment to her passive. That would involve giving it charges that get consumed whenever she deals damage that reduce her Mantra CD by a much larger amount than at present. Goal would be to allow spikier, clearer successes, rather than the more sustained Mantra tick down as at present. Curious how that sounds to those of you who play Karma?\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------       \n**Spectator Bugs**\n\nBrief update here. We've confirmed that some fixes (e.g. Sion weirdness) are good to go for 9.4 next week. Got some other bugs work's still underway on that should be addressed in 9.5. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------         \n**Likely 9.5 balance targets**\n\n\n* Akali - Putting some simple power back in now we've had enough time to see where she stabilized after the 9.3 changes. Waiting a patch after large changes rather than doing immediate follow up is something we're planning on doing more often for champs who've been really challenging to balance.\n\n* Neeko - E buff, aiming for power and potentially better clarity of gameplay.\n\n* Aatrox and Rakan - Potentially simple power buffs, not as guaranteed as Neeko and Akali though.\n\n* Urgot - Very unlikely he gets changes in 9.5. More likely we look at him in 9.6, given his nerfs are in 9.4 and as above we're aiming for a bit more observation time more often now.\n\n\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2019-02-15T17:28:23.705+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":9,"body":"Hey Meddler, I'm glad to hear the CDR changes aren't going through, they really didn't fit Karma.\n\nIn regards to the passive, I'd like to ask why this \"spikier\" variant is preferable to the more sustained route? \n\nBack in S4 when I started playing Karma, her passive was 2s and that seemed perfectly fine. It encouraged Karma to engage a lot more frequently and felt more rewarding when you actually got Mantra back, because you worked hard for it. It seems as if a lot of her problems since 5.10 have been rooted in getting too much reward for minimal interaction - especially once her passive refund reached 4s. \n\nThese changes were all to compensate for the removal of damage from RE, which caused more problems than it solved. This brings me to my 2nd question which I hope you'll answer so I can stop going on about it lol, why isn't Karma being given changes similar to Leblanc and Rengar? That's what we thought we were getting based on statements from yourself and MapleNectar...\n\nThey all have failed mini reworks in common and were all better off before their changes, although not perfect.","replies":[{"poster":"FafliX","date":"2019-02-15T18:01:05.429+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Actually the problem is not her getting too much for minimal interactions, it is her getting too much for long interactions.\nEspecially since better players are significantly better at getting the maximum out of her passive, compared to lower skilled players. One of the biggest reasons she is doing so much better the higher you go in elo.\nAt least that was the reason stated when the changes were first shown.\n\nAlso those changes were not meant to compensate for removing her RE damage, the removal of her RE damage was meant to balance out the buffs to her passive (since one RE would refund the entire R CD in teamfights). Again, that was the reason we were given back then.\n\nHonestly, if they just revert her to the S4 variant, I wouldn't complain to much, especially since I loved the bonus damage on RW, but I was exited about the proposed changes, and now I'm disappointed we won't get anything for a while apparently. I'm prepared for Karma to not receive any changes for month again.","replies":[{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2019-02-15T18:16:57.752+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Actually the problem is not her getting too much for minimal interactions, it is her getting too much for long interactions.\n\nThis doesn't actually clash with what I'm saying.\n\nWhen I say this I'm referring to Karma being able to potentially land a 5 man Q and take 20 seconds off her Mantra. Or even 12 seconds for 3 enemies. The point is; regaining Mantra takes significantly less effort because the passive rewards spell hits too greatly. \n\nNaturally, this will be abused even more over longer interactions, like you said.\n\nEdit:\n\n> Also those changes were not meant to compensate for removing her RE damage, the removal of her RE damage was meant to balance out the buffs to her passive (since one RE would refund the entire R CD in teamfights). Again, that was the reason we were given back then.\n\nLol again, we're arriving at the same destination from different starting points. What is clear is that whichever way you approach it, these changes go hand in hand. We can't know for sure what came first the passive buff or RE damage because we weren't at Riot. However, I fall on the side of believing shield bombs removal came first simply because the stated premise of the rework was \"increasing contextual decision-making\". In other words, giving each Mantra an entirely separate identity of their own... which created it's own issues, but I won't go there..

Where do you think he would fall balance wise if his heal lost the AP scaling component and gained armor scaling? The problem with many support items is they give him AP which I generally think isn't as useful to him as tackiness.

I still don't understand how Charges and the current Karma would have different Mantra results. You're saying what I'm assuming are two different things:\n\n1) You'd have easy access to Mantra possibly twice a skirmish.\n\n2) You'd also run out of access until you recharge the charges.\n\nCurrently a good Karma can almost instantly reset Mantra anyways, so the benefit end of this tweak probably would be negligible unless you explained more in depth where and when the charge system would benefit.\n\nIt sounds like an outright nerf to me.\n\nHere's why:\nKarma's current skill expression is NOT in just Q spamming.\nIt's in getting close enough to champions to secure a W, while moving fast enough to avoid skill shots, and then accenting play with Q's when W is secured as a root. It usually requires 2 sets of casts to kill, but is far more reliable than just flinging Mantra > Q.\n\nWhen you put a cap on Mantra recovery, the result is she may lose this identity, because it may remove her auto attack/w/ then Q viability. It would basically bottleneck her methodology into 2 volley Q spam, which is a reduction of expression.\n\nIt basically turns her into a short range Zoe.\n\nSomething I did like in the previous Karma talk:\n\nYou mentioned that your Karma passive was going to activate on Large/Epic Monsters/Minions.

That tested pretty well, though also raised some questions about whether Karma was the right fit for it. After some further testing and discussion while waiting on some code changes for it we've backed away from plans to put that on Karma. We'll likely explore it for another champion at some point instead though. \n\nI think this was a good choice. \n\n> We don't have other changes currently underway for Karma. Something we'd like to try whenever we do next work on her though is an adjustment to her passive. That would involve giving it charges that get consumed whenever she deals damage that reduce her Mantra CD by a much larger amount than at present. Goal would be to allow spikier, clearer successes, rather than the more sustained Mantra tick down as at present. Curious how that sounds to those of you who play Karma?\n\nI have 130k Karma points, plus 200+ games in S4 before champion mastery was introduced. I never played pre-rework Karma.\n\n1. I've said this to you before (in client), but the main thing I want is making Mantra choice a more nuanced decision. Pre-5.10 Karma got damage from all her Mantras, and you chose based on which kind of utility you wanted (heal/slow+easier Q/aoe shield). It was harder to figure out which Mantra was optimal, but that allowed for a deeper mastery curve and kept her interesting to play after many games. The only problem was that RE was overtuned compared to the others in 5v5 teamfights.\n    - One significant problem introduced with 5.10 is that Mantra's late game cooldown is too low relative to her other spells, W in particular. I often want to use W to reduce Mantra's cooldown, but doing so would make R come up significantly before W. It's weird anti-synnergy when I have to ignore my passive in order to maximize my ult choices.\n2. Regardless of lane (mid/top/supp) or build (ap/supp/bruiser), Karma thrives in extended fights. I like this about her and would like it to stay. I do appreciate that it means she can't have the same kind of power in short fights, and I'm OK with that.\n    - I also appreciate that it's hard to balance for lane and teamfight power, since laning is basically one super extended fight, but I think it's possible with gating behind mana costs and levels; I'd like you to try.\n3. Also regardless of lane or position, I think Karma is most interesting at closer ranges, where she's forced to use her whole kit to avoid damage. While I'm sure there are some people who prefer spamming RQ and playing safer wannabe Xerath, I think they're a small minority of Karma mains.\n    - **Answer to your question:** I'm concerned that a spikier passive — particularly one that removes the incentive to AA — would promote in-and-out combat patterns and/or boring, reactive play where you poke with Q, wait for the enemy to engage, and grab your passive charges while disengaging with W+E.\n    - Probably just me: I used to run a hybrid Karma top build (hybrid pen runes with bork+zephyr+roa+tank) where you relied on AAs to proc your passive. Called it SUPER SUPPORT since your goal (after bullying lane with dblade start) was to body block everything for your adc while whittling down their frontline. Nowadays R cooldown is so low you don't need any extra AS to ult constantly.\n\nIf Karma were on the table for a full VGU, I'd probably be more willing to compromise on a couple of these as long as the end result was well executed. However, I don't think she'll be a top priority in that department for a few years, so I'd prefer to see a small gameplay update that uses 5.9 Karma as a starting point and investigates:\n\n- Tweak RE for better teamfight balance\n    - Delay the explosion (Ivern-style)? → Less reliable to hit multiple targets for quick ult refresh.\n    - Maybe even delay the AOE shield until the explosion happens (though I'm wary this might feel bad).\n- Tweak or even replace passive with something else that encourages extended fights.\n    - Only keep reduction on autos?\n    - Passively generate charges; hitting spells generates additional charges; hitting autos consumes charges and reduces ult cdr?\n    - ????","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2019-02-15T17:14:26.258+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey Meddler can I ask when we may expect more news about Nexus Blitz?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2019-02-15T17:16:45.890+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Should be fairly soon, we're expecting the final data analysis this week or next after which we should be able to share where our heads are at.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"C9 Squeeky ","date":"2019-02-15T20:48:01.388+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"When will Manamune get a rework?
