The nature of the work could change or, depending on what we discover, projects mentioned may get put delayed or even stopped. If you&#039;d like to see a Tweet whenever a new one of these posts goes up: https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n\r\n**Some 8.5 Changes**\r\n\r\nLike 8.3, 8.5 will be a small patch, with quite a bit less in it than large patches like 8.4 or 8.6. It&#039;s also likely there&#039;ll be some things on the PBE during the 8.5 cycle that don&#039;t ship until 8.6 or later. 8.5 will have some changes though of course, likely including:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Nerfs to Tristana. She has insufficient weaknesses at present, so looking to introduce or sharpen a weakness most likely, rather than just hitting power generally.\r\n\r\n* A nerf to Duskblade&#039;s proc damage and potentially some clean up to the rules around how the Blackout passive work.\r\n\r\n* Changes to make at least some of the dragon buffs more desirable/fought over early game. Not sure on any details here yet.\r\n\r\n* Azir, Ryze and Galio nerfs. Ryze particularly challenging given how stark his discrepancy between regular performance and pro performance already is. \r\n\r\n* Nocturne and Olaf buffs.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n**Baron Buff and Bug Fixes**\r\n\r\nFor 8.4 we concluded we should be increasing the amount of damage Baron Buff gives to Cannon minions, since at present their damage contribution&#039;s often irrelevant. At the same time however we also ended up fixing a bug where Cannon minions weren&#039;t properly considering their total AD in some circumstances (most relevant: Banner of Command buff). That meant a situation where what was intended to be a moderate damage increase became a massive damage increase when the two effects multiplied each other. We&#039;ve got some tweaks going in for 8.4 as a result so that the extra damage Cannon minions offer is increased as originally intended by a moderate rather than enormous amount.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n\r\n**Blast Cone Timing**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne change in 8.4 that&#039;s easy to miss is that we increased the initial spawn time on the Blast Cones near each Gromp camp  and behind Baron and Dragon pits significantly (was in the 125-140s range, now 300-330s range). Goal there is to provide a longer period where laners aren&#039;t being threatened by its use by junglers, meaning they either have to pop it, can&#039;t play as aggressively or have to ward its location. Mentioning in part because also wanted to hear people&#039;s thoughts on plant spawn times and frequencies in general. Are there other plants you think should spawn earlier/later, more or less often, in different locations to where they do at present? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/img/champion/Ziggs.png","replies":[{"poster":"She Was A Virgin","date":"2018-02-16T16:52:13.389+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":4,"body":"@Meddler, what are your thoughts on {{champion:62}} ?\n\nand will {{champion:91}} receive different buffs in the next PBE cycle?","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2018-02-16T18:18:28.060+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Especially with that Nerf to {{item:3147}}  they are planning.

Overall think he needs a gameplay pattern with more versatility to it, which would take substantial kit changes, not just small work. Other champs are in need of a VGU more though. Possible Duskblade nerfs do hit him noticeably, will be assessing him and other core users after those are out to see if we should do follow up on them.\n\nTalon - We want to see where the MR change and Duskblade nerf put Talon before considering other possible buffs.

It feels like the damage of their kit is balanced around having those proccs available (thus limiting item choices imo, but that is a different story). So depending on the nerfs this could affect them a lot - keeping in mind that it is not easy to even get a full combo off as soon as the game hits the stage of teamfights due to the cc/sustain meta.\n\nIf nerfs to duskblade happen it would be nice to shift power elsewhere. This could promote diversity in both itemization and playstyle.\n\nAlso as a Talonplayer I fear that the incoming armor reduction might hit him harder than the mr increase buffs him. Spells can be dodged and reward you for skill, but every mage can also autoattack. As it might buff Talon slightly versus natural counters to him (midrange battlemages as anivia, cassio) it makes his life harder vs champions he should be good against (long range mages with low mobility/defenses).\n\nBut I do not have a PBE account so this is purely speculation.\n\nOn a sidenote: Is Riot actually aware of Talons passive only scaling to level 11?

Kayn is arguably better than him due to how he can move through walls as opposed to Talon's linear jump mechanic and high wall cooldown. \n* Kayn has much more reliable target access than Talon due to his movement speed boost while moving through walls, and his ultimate.\n* Kayn has a more reliable assassination pattern\n\nAre there any plans to address these issues?

I don't think Quinn's current problem is that she's underpowered per se, but she's certainly underperforming. Check the relation between playrates and winrates for the last few months: she used to have a stable, slightly below average playrate and a good winrate that befit her status as a niche champion. Regardless of the logic we use (I saw some objections to my previous take on the matter) I think it's undeniable that a champion that rapidly loses both winrate (3% overall in two months) and playrate (sub 1% now) with no direct changes is under duress. Quinn has always had to compete against champions similar to those in meta, across many different metas in fact, while having the same stable numbers she hasn't shown ever since the preseason, specifically since the lethality item nerfs.\n\nI agree, Quinn players tend to be divided over what they want for Quinn, even though Repertoir was very explicit this version of Quinn was designed to be a solo laner, a facet that Volty wholeheartedly embraced, but I feel like that's a conversation to be had in the future once her rework looms. For now I think it'd be a disservice to simply say these things and not move to improve Quinn's current state, because she's not in immediate rework priority, which, you know better than I do, means that it'll be nearer to two years before you guys can address her.\n\nReturning to my original point, I don't think Quinn is underpowered. I think we'd be insincere to say that she needs a return to former states because there's very good reasons why you guys moved to nerf what you did. But this is a perfect opportunity to move to improve Quinn's feel at the very least, and I do believe there is room given how she's performing to add at least a tad of power as long as it doesn't contribute to alienate melees.\n\nWe would really like for Repertoir to evaluate Quinn's state, for two reasons: one, he stated that he would procure that Quinn was always at least somewhat relevant. Two, a year ago said he knew that Quinn's kit has a few pain points he would like to address but Quinn's state at the time did not allow for him to do so on good conscience. I think Quinn can be said to be objectively under the relevance bar, and for the first time since the rework she exhibits room for work.\n\nAs for ideas for places you can add power without contributing to abusive patterns, I suggest:\n\n* First and foremost, fixing some of her bugs. Currently, there are situations in which Skystrike doesn't fire at all, or fires and deals no damage. A bug that was fixed previously has come back, too: if you cancel Harrier's auto, you can no longer proc the mark on that target.\n\n* Disallowing creep damage to cancel her ult channel. A 2 second self root is deterrent enough for quick escapes, and it ends up feeling awful to have a single creep auto cancel a nearly complete channel due to erratic creep behavior.\n\n* Easing on the slow inflicted by creep aggro when using her ultimate. Currently, Quinn is massively slowed if she takes creep damage during her ultimate. This mechanic often feels overbearing because she isn't merely slowed by a percentage, her movement speed is set to her base, negating any bonus her ult might have given. The change is extraordinarily jarring, there is no easing into it. We dread it so much we call creep autos during ult \"minion glitterlances\".\n\n* Improving W's active. This ability feels very lackluster compared to similar vision tools. The cooldown is way too high for a point blank ability, vision doesn't linger long enough to justify said cooldown and it feel like it's overall the place in Quinn's kit where the least power is allocated.\n\n* Make Skystrike deal additional damage to creeps or execute creeps at a certain threshold. One consequence of the nerf to Vault out of ult was that Skystrike lost its usefulness as a pushing mechanic because it deals negligible damage to creeps. I am not exaggerating when i say that Skystrike contributes far more to ruining your ability to CS when pushing than aiding it. It feels awful.\n\n* If you're amenable to bumping up Quinn's power levels, simply increasing W's passive uptime slightly would go a long way in bolstering healthy combat patterns. The buff duration often creates pain points where the sudden change in attack speed induces mistakes, and part of it is lost simply adjusting for the shift. R's mana costs early are also a huge pain point, which puts a heavy damper on what Quinn can hope to accomplish with it during the part of the game where she's supposed to be strong. It scales to cost 0, which trivializes her mana costs late. I think she would benefit a lot from a flat cost.\n\nSummarizing, I commend you for addressing Quinn, but please don't allow her to stay in this state indefinitely, especially now that you're moving to nerf Duskblade. We beg of you.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-02-16T18:43:38.635+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the notes, I did indeed miss these in the previous post.

Playing as Ahri FEELS HORRIBLE! And I think you're putting way way too much stock into her win rate being at 51%. Just because it's over 50% doesn't mean she's actually a strong champion.\n\nDelete her W and give her a real spell. Make it a similar spell but with 3 manual skillshots if you have to, that way it can actually be given damage instead of nerfed to the point where no one even levels it up anymore. And revert the R from 0.25 to 0.3 already, no one likes their ultimate doing joke damage. You know what, having some range on R would be nice too, I remember the days where it worked from outside of melee range.\n\nHell just revert her back to assassin form. I'll gladly give up the Q movespeed to get back that 50% damage lost, which would mean you have to give us DFG back to reach that number again considering she was designed for E to work multiplicatively with DFG's active. Well... get on it.\n\nThat sounded almost sarcastic and I obviously don't expect DFG back. **But I expect not to get run down and murdered like an animal at lvl 11 when I'm 10/0/5 by a lvl 8 0/5/0 Maokai.** Do you know how it feels like to have your class thoroughly outpowered by all other classes in the game aside from the ADC's servant (unless it's Brand or Zyra, they'll 100-0 you anyway)? Like shit. Combine that with playing Ahri for the worst feeling possible.\n\nAhri can't do anything unless disgustingly ahead, which isn't easy considering how many champions outright bully her in lane, then she falls off a cliff late game anyway. She's powerless against any tank. Mages need high damage back, change her targeted spells to skill shots if they're that problematic.\n\nHaving mana regen removed from the game, mana pots removed, and all AP items losing AP while costing a ridiculous amount more didn't help either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ivoryreaper","date":"2018-02-16T16:41:32.322+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Any plan for Gragas?","replies":[]},{"poster":"heroikc","date":"2018-02-16T21:29:56.206+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you said making changes to make Dragons more worthy to fight over, were you referring to the non-Infernal types?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-02-16T23:39:03.688+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep.

Is it due to Pro-play usage? Like Ult nerfs? Or something else? He seems to be a weird spot.

Right now, it only costs 60 mana at all ranks, which is really low for an escape (her E costs more mana). Sure, it has a long cooldown, but usually in lane she just uses it as an easy escape and plays safe until its back off cooldown. Having an ability be defensive is aggressive at the same time is cool, but too much for lane, especially as a hypercarry.\n\nMy proposed changed:\n\n**W - Mana cost: 100 mana at all ranks from 60 mana at all ranks\n--> New effects: Hitting at least one enemy with rocket jump refunds 50 mana. Rocket jumps used within 5 seconds of a reset cost 50 mana.**\nThis:\n- Nerfs her safety in lane by punishing defensive W usage.\n- Doesn't nerf aggro plays in lane nor teamfight resets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hexshot","date":"2018-02-16T23:58:33.021+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like how riot just gave us a new reason to not to play assassins.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]}]}
