Lot more change than the average patch going on, with some stuff that looks pretty weird, overpowered or over-nerfed at least at first read. Lot of details in the threads below that hopefully offer some context on what we&#039;re thinking and what we believe the impact of some of these changes will be.\n\nThese threads are on the PBE forums specifically to gather feedback from people that are testing/will test the changes in game. Very interested in feedback from other people as well though of course, and currently reading a lot of it both here and on various 3rd party sites. As usual these are PBE changes and therefore subject to change as we polish kits, balance numbers, fix bugs etc. There are also some changes that are much more, or less, impactful in game than they may appear at a glance on paper (e.g. Morde gaining a bit of extra attack range). \n\nSkarner:\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/d2bmpMif-skarner-pbe-changelist-and-feedback-thread\n\nGaren:\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/Y7ELMJAK-garen-pbe-changelist-and-feedback-thread\n\nDarius:\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/Grx91k8I-darius-pbe-changelist-and-feedback\n\nMorde:\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/KhcvQBlG-mordekaiser-change-summary-feedback-thread\n\nNew Items:\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/rFbd7hyy-new-items-steraks-gage-and-titanic-hydra\n\nDefensive Item Changes:\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/yMtrbjGs-core-defense-items-pass-516","replies":[{"poster":"Archenz","date":"2015-08-05T01:55:32.917+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":3,"body":"Meddler, I've played Skarner through all the reworks and nerfs and buff.

But this rework looks truly awful and I wouldn't ever want to play it. \n\nHe is now going to be weak as a base state but only situationally has any move speed and attack speed since everything has been taken from his q. That's crap.  His passive stun which allowed him to stun multiple people throughout a teamfight or in a camp is practically gone - one *maybe* two stuns from an E on a much much higher cooldown. I'm really doubtful about his early jungling - no matter how much attack speed and mana sustain he gets from his pillars he won't be able to stun camps nearly as often (especially because he won't be able to have access to stun to start the game since you won't start E). \n\nThere are so many problems with this rework it is depressing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sp441","date":"2015-08-05T02:05:31.957+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hoooh boy...\n\nMeddler boy, you jus don goofed with these changes...\n\nI mean, I can't comment much on the Darius rework since I don't play with him, but the Garen rework is *really* bothersome to me. He lost most of his already minuscule sticking power, and traded almost all of his early game power for late game power that he most likely won't get to use because he has no way to access it.\n\nI mean, not only are you making it impossible for him to stick to quick targets by making judgment slow when going towards enemy champions, but you're also removing Tenacity on his W. Garen is already insanely peelable as is, removing it so that a support's widdle feelings aren't hurt when he walks through their CC is not a fair trade off for him not being able to reach his target because any crowd control is enough to completely halt his advance.\n\nAnd that's not even getting to how Skarner's entire power budget went to giving his enemies free wards and gold...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcane Azmadi","date":"2015-08-05T02:32:41.989+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":11,"body":"Oh good, a red thread. Now I can finally tell you _utterly fucking retarded_ these changes are!\n\n**Darius**\nThe changes to his Crippling Strike are (pun intended) crippling. The MS slow being doubled is pretty meaningless with its duration halved since he can no longer chain it on bleeding targets. Additionally, the flat removal of the AS debuff means other bruiser champs can just stand right up to him and murder him now, especially with the nerf to his passive damage and removal of the split damage type that made him hard to defend against. He's not even a bully any more. Also, while I get that his E's ability to grab people AFTER they blinked away was a bug (a bug that you let fly by for _over 3 years,_ mind) it was the only thing that really made him viable. Now he's REALLY going to get the living shit kited out of him. Oh and since the Q now doesn't make targets bleed if they get hit by the handle, his E is worse than ever because it still pulls people into handle range, so he's going to have to actually _move away from them_ before he Qs. Also, what the _fuck_ is the point of putting a 0.75 sec delay on his Q?! You also gutted the damage on ALL of his damaging abilities and no I DON'T think the new passive is going to make up for it (that said, I do think the new way the passive will _automatically apply 5 bleed stacks to anyone he hits_ is absolutely stupid). I don't think the rework is a COMPLETE write-off, but I still think it kinda sucks. Still, there are too many moving parts to do a proper assessment yet.\n\n**Garen**\n\n**FUCK YOU!**\n\nI cannot BELIEVE you can shit out something this _incredibly moronic_ and think it's a good idea! You are trying to force AD Garen to be a thing by nerfing the flat damage of Judgement, buffing the ratios, and adding extra ticks to the spin, but then you go and take his actual _weaknessess_ (you know, the ones that _already prevent him from seeing play_) and turn them UP TO 100! You remove his tenacity, gut his silence, make him _slow himself_ while spinning on an enemy and give him NO new mobility or CC or ANYTHING that will encourage the opponent to sit around and take his damage like a good little noob! You also reverted his W back to its old, incredibly shitty state (presumably to further encourage us to build him glass cannon AD by nerfing his tank build), COMPLETELY oblivious to the fact that, thanks to how easily he gets kited now, he's going to need to be _tankier than ever_ (and can't be)! Additionally, thanks to the changes to Judgement's ticks, Garen won't reach his power spike now until level **16!** This so-called \"rework\" is so utterly worthless that it makes the Zilean rework (oh yeah, Zilean still sucks balls btw) look like release LeBlanc. It's so UTTERLY moronic that Forrest Gump would turn up his nose at it. \"I may not be a smart man, but I _do_ know what nerfs are!\"\n\n**Skarner**\n\nWhat the fuck is this shit?! \"Let's remove all his steroids and put them onto stupid map objective things that the enemy can easily take from him, making him super-mega-ultra vulnerable to invade junglers and completely WORTHLESS at contesting Baron and Dragon if the opponents get there first and further reduce his CC because ganking and duelling aren't important for Skarner, a champion designed as an uber-ganker and duellist.\" The new passive is just _retarded._ Simply retarded. It is literally the DUMBEST idea for a champion kit you guys have ever, EVER had. Even Ekko's suggested \"rewind the entire map\" ultimate wouldn't have been this dumb. Yeah, let's concentrate all of a champion's power into 6 specific locations on the map, and THEN allow the enemy to take this power away from him- of COURSE the enemy won't take his shrines and they'll all obligingly funnel in to the places where Skarner is strong to let him fight them! Why wouldn't they? Dumb, _dumb, DUMB!_ Are you guys taking the piss?!\n\n**Mordekaiser**\n\nNo. Just no. People are NOT going to run Mordekaiser in bot lane in place of an AD carry. If you think this would ever, EVER happen then I'm afraid it's time to put on this long-sleeved jacket and go with these nice young men in the white coats to the room with the padded walls. That idea is RETARDED. The only way it would ever, EVER happen is if you made Morde as a carry so insanely OP that he'd be a 100% pick ban for the 24 hours it would take you to hotfix him back to worthlessness again. The BEST case scenario is that people will just continue to play him in solo top by maxing his E and Q and not putting ranks into his W at ALL until laning phase is over because it effectively doesn't exist, and then just leaning on the sheer bullshit factor of his new ability to enslave Dragon ghosts. I'm actually kind of approving of the change towards making him an AD or hybrid bruiser because, like Sion, it never really made sense that this Sauron-on-steroids with a mace the size of Akali is basically a burst mage, but the W changes are really, REALLY stupid.\n\n**Items**\nThe MR buffs are good because you horribly overcosted MR in the first place. The AR nerfs are bad, but I can live with them. The new items? Eh, who cares. They're probably going to be abused by someone you didn't intend for them to be by like Yi or Xin or something.\n\nBut you're nerfing Cinderhulk AGAIN while apparently continuing to leave Sated Devourer untouched, even as it continues to destroy the game. Because carries rule and tanks drool.\n\nI'm sorry Riot, but seriously, this time you've gone too far. You've overstretched your \"benefit of the doubt\" credit limit. I'm not going to have faith this time. This is moronic and stupid and you're killing the game. If these changes go out like this, I think I'm done with LoL. I've been playing for 5 years, but this is just the final proof that you guys have completely lost the plot.","replies":[{"poster":"RocketRelm","date":"2015-08-05T04:11:13.085+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> But you're nerfing Cinderhulk AGAIN while apparently continuing to leave Sated Devourer untouched, even as it continues to destroy the game.

At maximum the Cinderhulk nerfs make you have 90 HP more when you buy the item, in exchange for considerable nerfs later on.\n\nYou already nerfed Cinderhulk an incredible amount with the previous incarnations, and by introducing all of these % HP (and true damage) mechanics. Does Cinderhulk really need 'another' nerf? Will you at least buff Sejauni to compensate because the primary reason she was nerfed was because she abused an overtuned Cinderhulk, but now Cinderhulk will be extremely underwhelming?\n\nI predict that tank jungles will be dead and buried after patch 5.16 if the defense itemization goes live as-is.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sp441","date":"2015-08-05T02:12:06.169+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man, do you even want to go through all the grievances that we have with these changes?

God forbid you let him get his new passive, it'll be a slaughterfest. However, in order to become that unstoppable force, he needs to find a way to get the passive going, because without it his general damage is nerfed. Overall, although q can use a few more number adjustments, this is an example of a good rework. (That fear on his ult is probably the best part.)\n\nGaren: This rework, although it had some good ideas, only ended up hurting garen. Now, he is even more kiteable than before. Some of the main grievances are towards his new w. Its purpose was to be the one point wonder it was, not something you have to farm. Also, by removing tenacity, you pretty much ruined Garen's ain way of even thinking about getting to the back line eventually. And even if he gets there, he won't be able to make his damage stick due to the fact that his e slows him down when doing its job of damaging a champion. Although some people also complain about the silence nerf in comparison to others (Hi Cho), this is more up for debate. Really for this what you messed up on here is making him more kiteable. The villan system is a cool addition that gives him some nice strengths to him, but due to the fact that he can be kited even more now it is basically pointless. Really just fix the issue of him getting kited and make w a one point wonder again, and you have yourself a really strong champion. \n\nMorde: This is where things get ugly. As someone said on the boards, you basically made him into the badass metal demon that devours souls who requires a babysitter on order to even function properly. Simply put, trying to pidgeonhole him into bot is, while creative, just not a good idea.  The purpose of the marksman is to bring dps to a fight, and morde does not do that in any way. You could say his new q, but good luck landing that on anyone besides the tank. If you really wanted to put something unique bot, something like cassiopeia makes some sense, as she has dps. (Don't get any ideas though.) Having a pet dragon is badass, and definitely a good unique change, but making the rest of his kit weaker in solo lanes for it just isn't a good tradeoff. He is in no way fit to be a duo laner, and he does have a unique identity of being the huehuehue faceroll immobile mage tank he is. There is zero reason to change it.\n\nSkarner: Across ALL of the boards, there in a general consensus of the skarner rework. It is, for lack of a better terminology, a massive steaming pile of sh*t. There is practically NOTHING beneficial to him in this rework, aside from one thing and that is the w change, which is actually pretty good. Skarner is a freaking scorpion that will hunt you down, maul you, and drag you away to your doom, not some little insect that requires to be near a horribly misplaced rock to function as a playable character that isn't the legend known as prerework eve. It should be obvious just by looking around that these changes just aren't good in any way, and should pretty much be scrapped before more damage is done. Without his rock he is slow as hell and offers barely anything to the team, and all they really do is make him harder to counterjungle, something that was already pretty hard to do to him since he clears pretty fast. You guys messed up before with skarner, and only made him into his current, fun model by listening to the community. Don't make the same mistake again, listen to us, and just scrap this entire spire concept. Skarner really only needs a change to his e, and that's it. He already has his gameplay fantasy of being the scorpion that will drag you off to your doom and will make sure you cannot escape his pincers, and not only does it fit him perfectly, it is both fun and has counterplay. So please, don't do this to him. Do not ruin this champ a second time. Please.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArcticSirius","date":"2015-08-05T04:48:19.544+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Might want to take a look at the Mordekaiser fanbase and have a chat with CertainlyT.

I actually don't mind the idea of him having these crystals as part of his gameplay but I don't think the current iteration of them is fun or provide anything interesting to his gameplay. I know it might seem kind of lazy but I'm going to quote what I said from a post I made on Reddit about this. (If you want to just skip to the part where I talk about how his crystals don't make him any more unique then skip to the bolded part at the ened)\n\n> As an avid Skarner fan, I'm currently rather pessimistic about his upcoming changes on the PBE as they look like a net nerf, however...\n> \n> I did think of something that could perhaps make it a little better which is instead of his crystals just being in these six designated spots, what if they made it so once you have your ultimate, you can use it on these crystals to move them to new positions (Maybe you could reactivate his R to let go of it or have it so it lasts twice as long as it does when he ults an enemy) and have a 10 second cooldown before you could use it on that crystal again (With the enemy cooldown being separate from the crystal cooldown).\n> \n> This way you could actually set up your crystals ahead of time and plan strategies around them, maybe you drag one into a lane bush so when you gank it you'll get the boost, or maybe have a line of them down mid lane for any big roaming teamfights.\n> \n> If you want an example of this kind of mechanic then look up Earth Spirit from Dota 2.\n> \n> Edit1: Adding on to this. Someone pointed out to me that this could make laning Skarner oppressive with the buffs since he could move on of these crystals to his lane and then just be really powerful forever. My solution to this is they could have his crystals slowly lose effectiveness the longer Skarner is within their range before reaching some minimum effectiveness and only start recharging once he leaves their range.\n> \n> Edit2: I thought I should bring up one of my replies to xxx in the thread since it describes my general feelings on this rework.\n> \n> \"I think you underestimate how strong or unique current Skarner is but I do understand how if you just look at how the game plays out at the end of the day with him on your team it is about the same as it is with a lot of other champions.\n> \n> And while Riot does follow up on their changes, the time in between making them and changing them can sometimes be months or YEARS, so I can agree with the people that are a bit more... boisterous about the changes in the sense of raising our issues now rather than later.\n> \n> **I think the main issue with this change as it is now is just that it actually doesn't go far enough. If this new passive is supposed to define Skarner then it needs to be more meaningful than it is.**\n> \n> **Someone mentioned that Skarner is currently just a ball of stats champion, and while I disagree with this, it does make sense in that a lot of the things in his kit are buffs and debuffs. The issue with this rework is that it doesn't actually fix this sentiment, all it does is make it so his buffs are tied to these crystals. So instead of a \"generic\" fighter that pretty good or even great no matter where he goes, he's now a generic fighter that's only great on about 15% of the map and terrible on the rest of it.**\n> \n> **Instead they should make it so he can move these crystals or when he uses one of his abilities on them then it causes some other effect, maybe qing a crystal causes it to ring out and silence enemies in the area for 1 second, maybe e'ing a crystal causes it to splinter out in all directions from the crystal.

He just runs at them, hits E, and prays his laner has the damage and cc to back him up.\n\nPassive- If the enemy decides to invade, all they have to do to be successful is to take away his shrine. That's it. Further, if ONE lane get ahead, they can invade his jungle and take away his shrines. I will admit that when he is on them, he is strong. But he has to BE on them.
