Bunch of mid-season related thoughts below as a result, once 7.9 is out and we&#039;ve got whatever balance changes are needed underway we&#039;ll also start talking a little bit about future plans again too.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Mid-Season watch list**\n\nWe&#039;ll be assessing the game as a whole post mid-season patch of course, with enough stuff changing that there are arguments a lot of different things, whether they were touched directly or not, might need follow up work. There are some things we&#039;ll be keeping a particularly close eye on though, as things more likely to need tuning than others. Examples include:\n\n* Rift Herald, and whether it benefits early teams too much, generates the desired interesting siege/defense gameplay, how easy/difficult it is to defend against etc.\n* Ancient Coin, particularly the revised pattern&#039;s impact on Enchanters and other really mana hungry champs.\n* Adaptive Helm and its effectiveness against champs who rely on repeated spell casts for the bulk of their power\n* Garygoyle Stoneplate and whether it&#039;s leaving champs that deal true damage and/or scale damage off HP too threatening\n* Etc\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Rakan and Xaya**\n\nSeem to be in a reasonable at least for now power wise, so the only likely changes in 7.9 are a few bugfixes. Will definitely need to assess again in a couple of weeks though, see whether their performance stabilizes around an appropriate power level or whether when the average player on them has enough experience they&#039;re too weak or too strong. It&#039;s also very possible that Coin changes, or AD item changes, have a meaningful effect on them in 7.9. too.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**CC Tracking Stat**\n\nOne of the new end of game stats we&#039;ve been working on for mid-season is CC contribution. Based off some testing while that&#039;s been on PBE it looks like there are a couple of issues with it we&#039;ll need to work out though. We&#039;ll almost certainly be delaying that to 7.10 as a result, given amongst other things there&#039;s some possible impact on server performance there.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Updated Sub-Class List**\n\nSomething we&#039;ve been working on for a little while is an update to the sub-class list we posted last year (link to the previous version below). As mentioned we&#039;ve always expected that would be an evolving set of guidelines/assumptions, rather than a definitive set of rules, a way of looking at/talking about champions rather than a set of requirements. We&#039;re now at a point where we think an update&#039;s appropriate, should be able to post that sometime in May. Nothing too major, mainly shifting a number of champions around and some changes to one of the sub classes&#039; definition.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/3A5uuBw7-champion-subclass-list","replies":[{"poster":"Casual Skarner","date":"2017-04-25T16:49:50.384+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"when we will see changes for {{champion:72}}?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-04-25T17:43:05.247+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nothing currently scheduled.

The only good build that somewhat works is rushing liandry.\n3.  Any changes to look over fiddlesticks? Felt he needs so much stats; CDR, AP, Mana/Mana regen, and Magic penetration. If he's underperforming, can you change to make him less reliance on any one of those stats. Rather just focuses on buying 3 out of the 4 stats.\n4.  Any chance on looking at botrk?

After his relaunch, he moved from jungler to top laner, and rather than trying to balance them out, Riot pigeonholed him into a Top, and this new rework reinforces that.  The goal was to make him less of an issue top, and that could have been solved with 3 easy steps:\n\n1. Increase the W range.\n\n2. Reduce damage to players.\n\n3. Increase damage to monsters.\n\nDone. That way, he can still be a dependable brick wall in the top lane without out-damaging his opponent by building full-tank, requiring him to build damage to _deal_ damage, meanwhile, he can clear a little faster in the jungle since he currently struggles with single targets, and has better gank potential without having to blow Flash on every engage.\n\nIf this rework goes through, he's not going to jungle again, and that's depressing.  He'll need to use his ult on cooldown for even a slight chance of a gank working, and as has been demonstrated, you can outrun it, meaning he'll only be able to gank if the enemy is literally hugging a wall, or doesn't know what a minimap is. Needless to say, I'm not a fan.

I've played thousands of games in Garen and I'm still struggling to get toward high Diamond or Masters with Garen. In fact, many Garen mains haven't been able to exceed this threshold of low Diamond. Sometimes it's decision making for sure, but we feel like Garen's limitations offer seldom a decent matchup. Although his W has strength lategame, it's absolutely a nonexistant ability in laning phase. This is why if you were to spectate a Garen game in Diamond where the enemy can easily anticipate Garen's approach of attack, Garen loses a lot of trades, even when I know I time my W correctly for example after I see my silence wears off. When a juggernaut simply can't even trade with tanks that are cc oriented like Maokai, Nautlius, and sometimes Zac, you know there is an issue. Even rushing Black Cleaver feels like a losing battle since these above champions, and Shen, who can get Sunfire Cape - punish us even more thanks to the percentile magic/physical damage scaling from the recent addition of 100 health.\n\nCourage of the Collusus is a keystone yet provides greater worth than Garen's W in itself. I'm losing matchups vs a player that has played less than 20 games on Darius, simply because mathematically there is no way to come on top on trades unless Darius refrains from hitting buttons on his keyboard.\n\nThe ability has to be reworked. The feeling of fulling stacking your W is nice, but I feel like the lack of skill I basically provide later on in the game (Hit W while going in) is just devoid of critical thinking.

Each wall could soak up an amount of damage. The counterplay is enemies positioning to remove one part of the wall, and then they can attack Garen's HP directly. It would be so cool to juggle positioning with a strong shield like that while chasing the villain. This could also encourage actual trading in lane, as if you run in lane, you're backside wall in the shield will be easily broken, but if you stay you could kite to a wall in Summoner's Rift and use the second shield wall. Further counterplay exists when the enemy could flash behind you to expose your backside for a kill, or even Garen flashing himself to get in a position to use his other walls in his shield.\n\nIt's similar to Fiora but since they are both Demacian champions, thematically it could work, and by scrapping the always relevant, always spammed Damage Reduction you can give all elo ranges more counterplay in handling Garen.\n\nHonestly it's your call though.
