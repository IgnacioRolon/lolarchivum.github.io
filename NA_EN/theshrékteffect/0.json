Ideally, the best solution would be to concentrate hot-button issues onto single, high-visibility threads, so that the same discussion wouldn't take up most of the front page, but we've had technical problems trying to implement that in the past.\n\nI'm with you here, it's tiresome to see the same thing get said over and over again, and I think there needs to be a means of culling repetition across the front page of Gameplay, where there are many topics that deserved to be discussed and precious little space. What are your thoughts on answering this? Do you think hosting a pinned megathread on a particularly high-visibility topic could help Gameplay?","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2017-07-07T17:51:29.997+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dig deep enough? There's been years worth of complaints pointing out a handful of issues. Some of the problems are direct design flaws, others incidental oversights, and occasionally ignorant co-operation between the different branches; but usually a combination. \nSo let me elaborate for you.\n\nMarksmen get too much damage too fast for any other class to meaningfully compete unless some cheesy strategy is used; critical hits specifically turning them from dps threats to physical bursters, often hitting quadruple digits on a single auto-attack once they get fed. \nReduce their damage output in some fashion, whether slowing their power curve or curbing their overall power. Rework critical hits, or lower damage or attack speed on their items. Or significantly increase the costs of their items, since they already have some of the easiest time farming.\n\nLifesteal is disgustingly prevalent, applying both on critical hits and repeatedly from boosted attack speed, generally prevents them from being killed by other dps dangers; and practically requiring stun-locking or even more burst to kill them. \nLower lifesteal or remove it's boosted interaction with critical hits, or make it an overtime effect similar to the bleed on death's dance. \n\nSafety nets! I remember back in season one through five when they had to be protected by their teammates in a fight. Thanks to tacked on effects to their already powerful primary and niche items, they get increased windows of power via extra damage reduction and delay, ontop of guardian's angel being reworked to benefit them. A few niche items like essance reaver and runaan's hurricane should've stayed on the sidelines, as they can give way too much influence over the game depending on the marksmen. That's not counting the extra movement speed on a handful of items, or several activatable items to give them even more of an edge against any competition. \nUndo the excessive buffs from the items in pre-season six (as I doubt they've kept previous states of the reworked champions), this alone should be enough to pull them back into line with the other classes. Either remove the bonus movement speed, the free damage reduction/delay, or the extra  effects on their counter items. Things like maw of malmortius and phantom dancer did their job well enough before getting buffed; while other spiteful designs like dominik's regards and guardian angel, are just double standards, allowing one class to screw over another for doing it's job.\n\nIf an item is good, marksmen will eventually abuse it, then riot guts the item instead of their interaction with it. It noticeably started in season two with ezreal, and it's become a more obnoxious as time has gone on. Ask juggernauts about sterak's gage, or tanks about dead man's plate, or assassins about edge of night. \nDrop the favoritism; make items melee only, or change them to rely on bonus stats so it benefits intended classes significantly more.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-07-07T18:18:52.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you read through my post history, you'll see that I'm personally well aware of the various threads that got made about marksmen, and share many of the opinions you posted here. :P\n\nI'm not saying that the conversation about marksmen doesn't dig deep enough in general, but as often happens when a topic trends on Gameplay, many threads often copy other threads on the front page without adding much to the conversation, and sometimes just try to cash in on the sentiment with a catchy title and too little substance. In recent times, one of the topics _du jour_ has been marksman balance, and while many valuable things have been said about marksmen on the Boards, many threads unfortunately missed that opportunity while still bringing up the subject.\n\nI agree that there's years worth of complaints around marksmen that have yet to be resolved, and I definitely want to see those issues get discussed more and, with enough luck, answered by Riot. One of the current issues with Gameplay, though, is that often there's a pretty big noise-to-signal ratio that makes discussion difficult, largely because of those less contributive threads. There is plenty of useful conversation to have around marksmen, but in order for that conversation to have more of an impact we all need to collectively step up our game, and avoid simply jumping on the bandwagon for easy upvotes.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2017-07-07T18:35:27.178+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tend not to unless I've had several conversations with someone, I already burn too much time going down similar rabbit holes, lol.

However marksmen have had the biggest trend of being buffed out of any class, thus stirring up hatred for them. \n\nSadly I concur any meaningful discussion is problematic to reach the right people. Doesn't help riot outright ignores their own forums in favor of other media. \nUnfortunately I don't see more sophisticated discussions becoming prominent as long as esports is the focus of the company; as it's drawn in much younger folk who lack more detailed and critical thinking, along with sports fan style players who merely mimic other more popular players and defend them regardless of evidence.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LightIsMyPath","date":"2017-07-06T20:43:12.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about inserting an undercategory in which similar thread are grouped, refreshing every x time.

Why have the terms adc and apc even been born? Why not call them simply carry? If those characteristics were fused in the name it means they had some important meaning. Why should I care if a carry is ad or ap? Having to distinguish between ad and ap is important because it changes the stat I have to buy to counter him. If it's an adc, I buy armor. If it's an apc, I buy mr. So why did they use the stats attack damage and ability power and not directly physical and magic damage? Well, because, at the time, physical dealers built ad, and magic dealers built ap. There was an association between the two because it was all there was.\nIt was clearly a faulty way, since no one at Riot ever relegated ad to physical and ap to magic. They are simply stats used to balance the game. Like for example Lee Sin's E that scales ad but deals magic damage.\nThe problem is that now we have a carry that scales ad but actually deals magic damage, Corki. How should we call him? He scales ad, so adc? But the core meaning of adc is that \"he deals physical damage, so I build armor\", and here's the problem. So, at the end, it's probably more correct call him an apc since, even if he doesn't build ap, he deals magic damage which is what apc means.\nIn the same way, if someday Riot decides to create a \"true\" physical damage battle mage that scales ap but deals physical damage (so he doesn't double down on auto attacks) he should probably be called adc, because you will still use armor to counter him.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JaxMoonStealer","date":"2017-07-05T05:27:00.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meta does not mean \"most effective tactic available.\" Not sure why some people keep claiming that.","replies":[{"poster":"SnakDatSmilesBak","date":"2017-07-05T05:53:57.308+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Maybe because it actually does mean that in this context.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2017-07-05T05:59:41.126+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Meta is short for metagaming.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagaming","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-07-05T00:57:05.391+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"lol you can argue what you want... \n\nbut in every game played  besides a few of the ziggs bot. mord bot here n there . an adc has been in every team comp\n\nthe marksmen adc\n\nnow yes there has always been tops of all kinds of champ classes/subclasses\njust as jungle and mid and support \n\nbut there is always \"marskmen\" and the reason why we have the adc/support bot lane is cuz adcs need to be funneled gold and protected to reach their mid -late game to be the hyper dps range carries that melt targets and objectives \nby having the game played as is supports typically dont get gold or take cs they use gold income items/runes/masteries and are there to get the adc fed gold through laning phase...\n\nthe other lanes get solo experience and gold but typically scale earlier but as every one cries ranged auto attackers have an unfair advantage and when a \"marksmen\"reaches the pinnacle of their power curve they typically take over the game and the game with the better adc wins\n\nthis has been meta forever","replies":[{"poster":"SnakDatSmilesBak","date":"2017-07-05T01:36:44.634+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":12,"body":"lol you can argue what you want...\n\nbut in every game played a support has been in every team comp\n\nthe support\n\nnow yes there has always been tops of all kinds of champ classes/subclasses\njust as jungle and mid and support\n\nbut there is always \"support\" and the reason why we have the adc/support bot lane is cuz adcs need to be funneled gold and protected to reach their mid -late game to be the hyper dps range carries that melt targets and objectives\nby having the game played as is supports typically dont get gold or take cs they use gold income items/runes/masteries and are there to get the adc fed gold through laning phase and provide large amounts of utility throughout the game\n\nthe other lanes get solo experience and gold but typically scale earlier but as every one cries ranged auto attackers have an unfair advantage and when a \"support\" reaches the pinnacle of their power curve they typically take over the game and the game with the better support wins with their massive utility\n\nthis has been support meta forever\n\nNow my objective isn't to poke fun at you, but rather to show you that just because a role has always existed and been important doesn't mean that the meta has always revolved around that role.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2017-07-05T16:18:27.778+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support is a role, not a class.

The only thing marksmen really lack is tankiness, but with the current builds this is also arguable.\nSo no, dps is not the reason marksmen are always picked.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-07-05T18:27:11.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, marksmen are the only class who can sufficiently build full damage and utilize DPS.","replies":[{"poster":"Fefnil","date":"2017-07-05T23:24:20.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said, try it on a dummy. Take Master Yi and build him full crit/as and he will probably have even more dps than marksmen. Take Darius, build him like a juggernaut, and you'll see he will have similar dps to a marksman. Take any juggernaut, skirmisher or battle mage, build them with their optimal build and try them on a dummy. They will still deal comparable dps to a marksman.\nWhat makes marksmen special is range, reliability and sustain, not dps.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-07-06T00:05:55.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi is the one exception.

You said marksmen are mandatory because they have the highest dps. I said no, that's not the reason, there are many classes that have same dps.

You people come up with shit, ignoring the fundamentals of the game. Fine, you tell me how you're gonna nerf ADCs without breaking the entire game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
