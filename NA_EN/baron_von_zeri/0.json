I've been having a problem when ever I enter the match loading screen. As the title of this thread states, everytime I pick me champion for a match, and enter the loading screen. I'm greeted with a bugsplat error. Now this is were it gets frustrating. It doesn't just happen once, but several times. Constantly day after day it kept popping up. Now 50% of the time all i have to do is exit the client and relaunch and the problem is solved...but it's only solved for that particular game mode. If it was 5 v 5 then I won't have to worry about the bugsplat again unless I exit the game entirely.  If I choose to play another game mode, I would get the bugplat, and THIS time i would be locked out of the game completely it wouldn't let me reconnect.\r\n\r\nThe other 50% of the time it would do the same thing with 5 v 5's and lock me out of THAT completely as well. Now i've noticed an increasing pattern here. every 6 patches or so there is a constant problem. The game either constantly crashes rendering it unplayable until the next patch comes out. or It crashes due to antivirus program which should'nt be affecting the game if the program has already been set to ALLOW the game to run. Or It crashes completely then kicks you right back into the home area. Now I've made a thread about the client being all buggy with the patches a while back and i don't think something was done.\r\n\r\nAnd before you say \"Reinstall the game or repair the game.\" Just know that I always test that first before I write these threads. I've done everything that has been suggested and have constantly tested it FIRST. So clearly it's NOT on my end. This problem has been constant and apparent every few patches dating all the way back from patch 6.0.\r\n\r\nPatch issues:\r\n6.0 Constant crashing immediately after champ select, locks out of game. Tested it again only to not get the crashing EVER again.\r\n6.1: Crashing stopped completely.\r\n6.6: Crashing, in loading screen, no errors. match was over as I was locked out. Never got the crash again after the first one.\r\n6.7: Seems to have been fixed, no issues,\r\n6.12: No apparently errors, patched normally. Started a match only to be immediately kicked back to the home screen with no way of getting back into the previous game, but somehow allowed to immediately start a new game. This continued every single day until the next patch,\r\n\r\nYou get the idea, every few patches it's been a different issues and very frustrating ones that can get good non toxic and honest player banned from the game when they did nothing wrong. \r\n\r\n6.20: Star Guardian patch: Bugsplat error immediately after champion select. Sent in error report, clicked reconnect. Won't reconnect. Bugsplat error again, constantly popping up everytime I hit the reconnect button. Tried again, this time exiting the client completely. Clicked reconnect, still crashed with Bugsplat error.  Tried again, Game was remade.\r\n\r\nAs I said in the above section, I repaired the game. Got the same issue. I then reinstalled it. Same issue. I'm either being locked out of the games completely or the bugsplat goes away and I can play normally, either way it's frustrating and none of your \"suggestions\" work to resolve it. Therefore your client is busted for 6.20. Please fix, because again honest players can be banned for this if they are reported. and I'm positive that some already have or have pending reports claiming them to be leavers. Fix your system. it's embarrassing.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T03:34:03.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugsplats are often caused by a poor interaction with your system drivers or hardware.
