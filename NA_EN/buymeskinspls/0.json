Weekends make it even worse. I'm trying to stop raging at my team and be more calm in solo que but these kids make it so freaking hard.  If I have a bad game the team decides to all gang up on me with insults or whatever and make me even *more* angry.  \r\n\r\nI'm just so sick of the 'better than you' attitude kids have. For example a malzahar that does nothing but brag about how he warded jungle more than me or ganked more than me, tells me I suck, I stood around all game, blah blah all the while insisting he has said nothing bad. Just makes me feel like crap.  Not much I can do when the enemy team is 4 levels ahead of me, they're so fed I can't farm jungle without them wanting to gank me IN it.  \r\n\r\nWeekends are freaking terrible, I just end up raging when I play ranked, and I'm tired. Tired of not being able to have fun in a game anymore.  I feel like it'd probably be good if I was chat restricted for solo q so I don't go off on someone for doing something incredibly stupid.","replies":[]}
