There is a chance you can get a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) for leaving games, but you don't have to worry if it was just for one game.  If you continue to accrue leaves, though, you may find a lower priority queue on the account.  This isn't something we'll remove because all leaves still causes others a negative experience, even if not intentional.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
