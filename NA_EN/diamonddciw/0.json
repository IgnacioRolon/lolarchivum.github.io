Then for some reason, I just randomly disconnected, to follow that, I had to restart my computer to actually quit league. Then I had to restart it again, because league made it crash when I tried to reopen it. I finally got back, and about 3 minutes later, I disconnected again. It wasn't my internet because I was playing music for the majority of the time my PC was running. The first time i crashed my music was running while i was stuck trying to leave. I'm not sure what to do about this, it doesn't happen all the time, but when it does, it really sucks. Is there any settings I can mess with or anything to fix it?\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-06T17:50:04.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a yucky series of events, and I'd like to help!
