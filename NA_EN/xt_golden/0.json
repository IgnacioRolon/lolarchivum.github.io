Vayne is more mobile and focuses on sustained damage, Graves is a lot more burst.\n\nPlay Yorick, win games, have fun pressing all the buttons.

Vayne is a late game single target dps marksman, with a better focus on mobility and kiting. She is also among the best AD carries for 1v1ing late game.\n\nGraves is an early-mid game marksman with a higher focus on killing enemies flat out in 2 seconds over raw sustained damage. Graves is the better solo que pick by far, so that would be my recomendation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nucleophilic atk","date":"2015-02-22T18:52:10.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If soloQ, go Graves. Vayne is late game, and in soloQ, your teammates will try to go ham and feed early most of the time. You can't play vayne against a 5/0 assassin.
