At least you never get more than one cycle in a meta. Mostly bc people just kinda pick whatever they want most of the time, so even if you pick up a champ to deal with the meta, there's no sense picking up something to deal with THAT champ because so few people are using it even though it counters the meta champ.\n\nOnce in a while we get a true rock-paper-scissors homeostasis but only when nothing really changes for a couple months so people figure out the meta, and even then only rarely.\n\nIts also just part of us only getting to pick one champ. Might be different in 5s idk, but this is way different from pokemon where one or two guys are often a revolving door of counters to things in the meta that are a threat to your core team.","replies":[{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2016-12-07T20:11:18.129+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Spacesuit Spiff,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3sjtRkFM,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-12-07T20:03:11.229+0000)\n>\n> \n> \n> Once in a while we get a true rock-paper-scissors homeostasis but only when nothing really changes for a couple months so people figure out the meta, and even then only rarely.\n> \n\n\nThe most recent true rock/paper/scissors I remember is season 3 top lane, and maybe mid lane at the time.
