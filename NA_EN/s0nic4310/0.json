Nobody should be surprised to see Liquid choking because they are all known for choking hazards. Had 2 game leads in playoffs and as always knows how to throw so hard.\r\n\r\nOnce again, as I mentioned before and I will say it again: $h*tlet is overrated trash. If the whole Liquid/Curse team would&#039;ve put Keith in the game, I was sure that they were going to win but they didn&#039;t because they are all acting like hotheaded losers. Curse&#039;s stupidity is why that they will stay in 4th forever.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-13T14:50:57.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has to be one of the most ridiculous analysts of professional League of Legends I have seen. Go back to bronze please and stay off the forums. C9's adaptation to the Best of 5 and TLs inability to adapt back is the cause.\n\nBringing out the Piglet/Keith argument AGAIN is completely asinine. You either did not watch the games or you did and everything going on went above your head. So I can only assume that you are either a troll or looking for some sort of infamy with this thread. Either of which should see you in put in Troll Prison. TL 3-0d CLG, 2-0d C9 then tilted from the 1 threat Jugger'maw comp not working. (Damn you C9 for taking Corki, and TL giving Quas Sion).\n\nFair-Weather fans such as you make me sick, please go fanboy for another team, TL doesn't want you as a fan. Hell, no professional organization wants someone like you as a fan. Overall, if you are going to bring up idiotic arguments and lack of substantial information. All you are doing is complaining and making yourself look bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DoraTheBrown","date":"2015-04-12T02:37:56.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"maybe they'll beat tip/tsm\n\nwait nvm 4Ever4th","replies":[]}]}
