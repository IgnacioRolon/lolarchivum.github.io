Hai was in no way a weak mid laner that people said he was that is BS. He could compete at top NA lvl. But that is not a world class lvl it is good enough but with his shot calling he makes up for it. I always say because Hai is not the carry the other players have to. That worked until Balls and Meteos could not carry, Balls he just not good enough I guess, Meteos mostly just the nature of the meta Junglers can't really carry.\n\nIt will hurt C9 to replace Hai. But if they can get a strong carry mid laner it could work in their favor. Not having to have balls be a carry could be enough.\n\nIt is to bad but it sound like it was also his decision.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-23T14:18:02.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course, My comment wasn't about Hai leaving.

It limits my ability to play as much as I need to and my ability to improve. I cannot keep up with the amount of Solo Queue games my teammates play and it’s not fair to them. At best, my wrist injury would have only allowed me to play for another split and that wasn’t even certain.\" \n-\"Team environment/morale was at an all-time low since Worlds 2014. We didn’t have the most spectacular 2014 Summer Split and our run at Worlds was not the best we could’ve done. We tried very hard to figure out how to get back into shape for winning Worlds but we struggled and the team atmosphere started to decline. Winning IEM San Jose brought back a bit of that Cloud9 feeling that we know and love, but it left as quickly as it came. \"\n-**\"I want to make this clear to everyone. I am NOT stepping down due to community criticism for my play or myself. I would be lying if I said I didn’t care about it, but I was able to brush it off thanks to my teammates’ confidence in me. Over time, my teammates started to lose confidence in my abilities as a player and a shotcaller. That’s what really hit me hard. I don’t think that is an obstacle I was able to overcome and it really got to me. I’ve always played the role of a Support Carry from the very beginning and with the meta changing the way I think it is, my play style was not going to work anymore.\"**\n-\"I’m hoping with the addition of a new Mid Laner (which we will announce soon), the issues that we were going through will resolve themselves through hard work and the team can experience a new beginning. Will all the problems be solved? I’m not sure, but if there were ever a time to try it, it would be now. I’m confident they will be able to improve and take back the title of Best in NA and make a presence on the international stage. I hope all of you will continue to cheer for Cloud9 as I know I will.\"\n\nEven his team said he was not perfoming well so please don't act like you know everything.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-23T14:21:25.314+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"His decision to leave was not the point of my comment.
