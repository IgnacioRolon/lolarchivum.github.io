Lulu as a top can sacrifice for a 2v1 and still be helpful to the team with kit (GG Growth). \n\nMost of the time that is what the top lane of most teams are relegated to, comp specific roles. Tanks, Supports, etc. Some teams though have top lane carries (See ZionSpartan) but the team forces him to play champions that don't fit that role.

No one wants to see everyone supporting one person and having that one person get all the highlight moments. That doesn't make for exciting _anything _. It's like everyone blocking while the quarterback throws a Hail Mary... and then it gets caught at the end zone by that same quarterback. Boring _and_ dumb. I much prefer comps that allow everyone to have high moments, everyone gets to be a star, make plays, and contribute in meaningful ways beyond \"if I press this button, my teammate will win the game for me.\"","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-15T08:02:17.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It's like everyone blocking while the quarterback throws a Hail Mary... and then it gets caught at the end zone by that same quarterback. \n\nThough a quarterback catching his own throw for a touchdown would be pretty awesome tho.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2015-04-13T20:07:22.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it's not\nThe problem is that certain comps are easier to execute so teams that pick lulu have to show better execution. Lulu is a contested pick for a reason, her statistic speak for themselves. It's just that people like to run scenarios in their head using another champion. Oh if only that team had Sion instead of lulu in that fight..etc that's a stupid way of doing it because that Sion or x champion would not have gotten you into that situation in the first place","replies":[]}]}
