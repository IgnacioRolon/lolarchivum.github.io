Both top and bot lanes are similar but TSM mid and jungle are better, in my opinion. \r\n**Verdict: TSM win**\r\n\r\n**UOL vs FNC**\r\nHard to call since both teams are great and entertaining but I think FNC, with their experience, is gonna win because all their lanes are better, except jungle.\r\n**Verdict: FNC win**\r\n\r\n**TL vs TIP **\r\nI think both teams are even for the skills matchup, it will all come down to TIP Rush if he can carry and play fighter junglers and not tanky ones like Nunu.  TL, on the other side, have to work on their pick phase (DO NOT pick LULU mid omg ... Fenix need to pick carry mid laner) and on their motivation. \r\n**Verdict: TL win**\r\n\r\n**SK vs H2K **\r\nAnother one that is hard to call since all lanes are pretty even, except H2K top is better in my opinion. SK Gaming sucess depends on FORGIVENGRE perfomance unlike H2K. \r\n**Verdict: H2K win **","replies":[{"poster":"SinatraZ","date":"2015-04-21T15:43:24.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its funny how my 4 predictions were right.

This is the defining matchup in UoL v Fnatic.  If Kikis can get the best of Reignover.

TSM will come out slightly behind in the early game for the majority of the games maybe except 1 game where they may come out ahead. It has been this way with TSM forever, they are a comeback team that wins in teamfights. Overall both TSM and C9 players are about equal if you compare every lane head to head.\n\nTop: Balls is known as a better \"carry\" top laner and Dyrus is known as the guy who gets killed non stop early game but in the end Dyrus does NOT try to carry, and by late game he is always a meat shield for his team and that is exactly what TSM needs. The difference here is while Balls can stomp a game every once in a while, Dyrus cannot be taken out of the game while Balls can.\n\nJungle: Comparing this season alone, Santorin could be considered equal to Meteos, the only difference here is Meteos has an edge in experience but the overall difference this will make wont be too big if Santorin plays the same way he has been all split.\n\nMid: Bjergsen wins in most aspects honestly, but Hai is underrated and is a better mesh with his team in a teamfight while Bjergsen is an outlier in TSM's teamfight but manages to make the plays.\n\nBot Lane: About equal overall. WildTurtle and Lust are more likely to make a mistake, and Sneaky is a better laner than WildTurtle. But LustBoy is better than Lemon once outside of the lane. Turtle's average play skill is lower than Sneaky's but Turtle max potential play skill is higher than Sneaky's. He is essentially High risk, High reward while Sneaky is more of consistently pretty good.\n\nBut it will all come down to the Teamfight, and TSM is the best Teamfight team in the LCS by a mile. They are the only team consistently doubted because of their average early game and slow closing but they are the only team who manages to dominate like that. They can be down 3-5k gold and still pull off those Teamfight wins that no one else in the west can do. A very underdog style but very effective.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Helmight","date":"2015-04-16T18:06:18.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I agree with most of your predictions, except for H2K beating SK. SK's been way too consistent this season, and even though they lost to UOL it was a close series. H2K's good, but I don't think they have what it takes to come out on top of the most dominant team of the split. \n\nI think Liquid has a chance to beat out TiP, but it all depends on which TiP shows up to play. If they manage to get their heads together by the time the series starts, it'll be a quick 3-0 for Impulse. If they're still beating up on themselves though, I could see Liquid pulling out a win in 4.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pigby","date":"2015-04-16T18:02:34.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think TiP is better than TL.
