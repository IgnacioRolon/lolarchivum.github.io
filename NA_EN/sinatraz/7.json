My champion pool is pretty small and consist of: {{champion:104}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:21}} . Problem is Corki is the only meta champ right now. I often get yelled at when I pick MF even if I have a 70% win ratio with her. \r\n\r\nSo ADC mains, do you think is it possible to climb in elo with these champs ? I don&#039;t really like the meta champs like Kalista, Vayne, Jinx and Tristana.","replies":[]}
