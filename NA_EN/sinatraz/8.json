My top 3 is: \n\n1- Jarvan IV{{champion:59}} : He have fast clearing time, good knock up and his ult is awesome to lock someone down. \n2- Nocturne{{champion:56}} : Clear even faster than J4, he can catch any champs and his ult is almost a guarantee kill. \n3- Nautilus{{champion:111}} : Tanky as hell, love his hook and passive combo and also his ult. \n\nI like Maokai and Amumu too.\nIm not interested in over popular champs like Lee Sin and Kha'zix.","replies":[]}
