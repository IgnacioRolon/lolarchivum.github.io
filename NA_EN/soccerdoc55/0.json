(Before Sugar Rush!!!!!!)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Today I was opening my client, after the Userkernel finished opening and it was about to go to the patcher, it said it suddenly stopped working.  It continuously kept stopping, which was not the case last night.  This happened after it suddenly kicked me out of the client, which it has been doing for some time but I never really thought of as an issue until now.  I then went and deleted the game, and went to re-download it, but after I downloaded it, and moved it into the applications folder, when I clicked on it, it would ask me to select a folder in applications, so I went and created an empty folder for it, and after that it would begin to run.  It opened the UserKernel and began loading the LoLLauncher.  Once the patcher finished loading it would immediately shut down, saying the LoLPatcher quit unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nI do not know what to do and I really want to get back to playing it hopefully before the double ip weekend.  \r\n\r\nBy the way, this isn't a toaster, it is a more recent Mac Laptop that can run the game at 50 fps.  \r\n{{champion:131}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jannå","date":"2014-08-27T16:21:40.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing with me.. =(\nI restarted my computer, didn't work.
