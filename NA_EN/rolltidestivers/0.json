The one that is probably most reliant to us as users is matchmaking. Your MMR is a measure of your ability and that is used to match you with other players of similar abilities. Anyone you let play your account is not going to have the exact same skill level as you but are going to get matched based on your MMR. So they will either be too good and stomp people or not good enough and drag their team down.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-08-30T02:28:10.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Short answer, yes.\n\nIf you wanna share?
