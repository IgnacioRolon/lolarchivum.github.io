How do I get defaults back?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I've been trying to improve my attack moving and heard that you could bind attack move to left click by going into the game files (C: Riot Games > League of Legends > Config > PersistedSettings). I tried it out but wanted to go back to the old settings so I tried to unbind the setting. However, it appears I did something wrong as now when I try to left click something (say a minion or jungle monster) my champion won't move to or attack it. Ironically, in my endeavor to get better at attack moving, now, the only way I can choose what I attack is through attack move, other wise my character will just auto the closest enemy unit. If anyone can tell me how to reset all the settings in the folder back to their defaults I would really appreciate that.\r\n\r\nP.S. This discussion has already been posted but I felt that the title wasn't good so I deleted it and made a new one.","replies":[{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-09-06T18:39:22.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, try this:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761934-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Issues#wq2","replies":[]},{"poster":"Draclen","date":"2016-09-06T22:16:04.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll consider it, thank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Draclen","date":"2016-09-06T21:20:15.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it did reset my settings, however I'm still having they issue with my left click. I'll mess around and if I get it fixed I'll tell you but hey, maybe it's not such a bad thing, perhaps having to use attack move is what I need to get better at it. Thanks a bunch by the way.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-06T21:28:23.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Modifying game files can end up causing more trouble than good.
