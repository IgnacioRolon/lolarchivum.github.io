Some I&#039;m aware are a play on words (Heimerdinger is a mash up of different scientists, Lee Sin sounds like listen, etc.) but what about others?

But currently we take a lot of time and care and it often takes several weeks (or even in some painful cases months).   If the language for the area hasn't been outlined yet-- that's the first set.  Then as series of goals are set.  (i.e. Sound's exotic, sounds mean, is one syllable, has three syllables. relates to a place, etc..).   Next the writer does some research and generates a list of names. --The pod and other writers cull that list to a top ten.  This is checked with localization teams to make sure the name isn't something terribly wrong of off-color.  Assuming the writer doesn't have to start all over again- the remaining few choices are narrowed down and final selection is made.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-04-14T22:59:22.391+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the amount of effort you put into naming, are there any older champions that you dislike name-wise?

You're getting extremely triggered about Riot using a subtitle that was a nickname for a character in a obscure narrative created long long ago. What's even more is that the narrative has nothing to do with Tahm Kench or his character in general. The context is different as well. It could've just been a coincidence you know?\n\nEdit 1: OK you created that story for your daughter who died. Now you're demanding credit from riot for a nickname that you allegedly created and used in an entirely different context. They don't need to give you credit. They created the name themselves. Like is a future riot naming employee going to just stumble upon your post remember the nickname and eight years later name Tahm Kench that? It's insane.

Also The world is one river, and I, am it's king line wasn't exactly in your narrative. So just suck it up and stop acting like a little kiddie.
