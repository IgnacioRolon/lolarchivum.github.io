I don't really understand what's going on. I'm currently honor level 5 so shouldn't it be working? I tried downloading the PBE client and seeing if I could get the account from there but no luck ether. Am I missing something? Is there some other requirement I need? Did I miss a deadline? If someone can explain please do.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-17T02:12:55.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That signup site has been a bit overloaded from all of the traffic.
