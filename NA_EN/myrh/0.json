Whenever I try to make a lobby, it is just stuck on \"Please Wait\" until it eventually kicks me to the home screen. I've tried restarting my computer, repairing the game, and even reinstalling the game and it wont work. I've seen a League board with a similar problem, and my ultimate goal of this board is to get the attention of a rioter so they can get to fixing this. Though of course if anyone has any suggestions that would be just as good.","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2016-06-07T22:41:26.805+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Rankook,\n\nI understand that you're having issues queuing into a Normal/Ranked Draft game. I've been tracking this issue for a few days from player reports through our Support Site. As far as I can tell, this is an issue associated with certain accounts rather that something happening on the local-end. I'm in contact with some of our engineers currently to get it fixed and we're still investigating the bug. If you haven't already, please send us a ticket through the [Support Site](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new). \n\nWhen you do--or if you already have a ticket opened with us--please include your [LolClient logs](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674#wq8) in the ticket (make sure to try queuing up into the affected matches and then closing the League of Legends client so it's logged properly into the .log file). This will help with our investigation.\n\nIn the meantime, you should still be able to queue up for Blind Pick and Howling Abyss matches if you're looking to get some League action in.","replies":[{"poster":"Van CIeef","date":"2016-08-15T21:06:30.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same Problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Big Lez","date":"2016-06-14T07:31:05.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least we got a response finally, hope you guys can fix this soon!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tykvin","date":"2016-07-04T17:12:56.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi guys,\n\nI have the same problem and i really want to play more ranked games..
