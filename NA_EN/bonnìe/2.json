Karma speaks an &quot;ancient ionian dialect&quot;. the way to form rek&#039;sai and the name kassadin are ancient shuriman. \r\n\r\nI mean aside from English, do languages such as French and Japanese exist in this world? \r\n\r\nAre there languages particular to each region and dialects across them? \r\n\r\nIs this an aspect of lore and world building thats been looked into? \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t expect riot to create an extensive conlang for each &quot;country&quot; but i am interested in the idea of this for my personal sanic oc champion concepts, as I call them. \r\n\r\nI know Ezreal is an archaeologist so I imagine there is higher education and specialization to pursue, so I&#039;d think there would be some form of anthropology or linguistics to study in the realm of runeterra. \r\n\r\nAny deeper information on runeterran languages would be appreciated.\r\n\r\neven if its saying its possible for lets say a shuriman to go to university and learn a bilgewater dialect or something. idk.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-03-07T01:11:47.989+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"There has been some small amount of info given on the various languages of Runeterra, but not as much detail as folks would like.\n\n* The Buhru (Illaoi's people) have their own language - you'll find a few of Illaoi's lines are in that language, and words like \"paylangi\" which mean outsider.\n * Here's [WAAARGHbobo with some guidelines on the Buhru language](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/OPkqt6tg-waaarghbobo-you-say-you-work-on-champion-languages?comment=00000001000000000000).\n* The fairly recent teaser for Ornn had his legend sung in Ancient Freljordian.\n * [The Path to Hearth-Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e47AEBnu9SQ)\n* Xayah and Rakan speak a few lines of a Vastayan language (I'm not sure which one).
