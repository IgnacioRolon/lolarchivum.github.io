It's most noticeable in ARAM, where everyone is packed together and non-existent in bots where there are no enemy players. If I'm say, at my base, or in I can play perfectly fine without any lag. I can be by whole my team and 3 waves of super minions crashing on our nexus with no issue. The moment an enemy player appears near me, I lag like crazy.

I suspect that during your matches, you'd see considerable changes in your route and there may be more packet loss or latency spikes during gameplay than when we simply run tests. Just to confirm there's nothing local exacerbating this issue, I'd recommend confirming all your network settings are aligned with our [network guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\nShould you continue to experience these issues even *after* confirming your local settings are good, I'd recommend running another WinMTR traceroute while you play a match (with symptoms) and reach out to your ISP with that traceroute.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2016-12-14T09:45:50.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My issue with that is... it might happen for 2-3 minutes, be perfectly for the next ten, hapen for another 2-3 minute etc etc But I will attempt to do as you reccommend and I thank you for your help.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI ran the test and the red and yellow indicated this:\n\n\n\n    We received unexpected and possibly dangerous results when looking up important names\n    Your DNS resolver returns IP addresses for names that do not exist \n\nMinor Aberrations\nâ€“\n\n    Certain TCP protocols are blocked in outbound traffic\n    Some DNS resolvers appear to be down\n    Only some root servers returned DNSSEC information \n\n\n\nI will contact my ISP, but any advice on to what actually tell them?
