And it’s still an AOE Slow zone with high base damage that can still slow a second time PLUS resets her bladesurge.\n\nI think she may be weak after these changes, but these changes did need to happen.\n\nThe only thing I find unecissary is the wall duration nerf. Without the disarm there that seems a little too much of a hit. I’m also skeptical about the change to minion damage, I guess it’ll limit her mobility and be easier to balance with lower bonus damage and flat numbers, but that seems too low.","replies":[]}]}
