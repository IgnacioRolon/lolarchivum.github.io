Her Q missile speed is way to slow next to Lux binding who almost is the same as Morgana (2s next to 3sec on level 5 as Lux is 2 second on every level) but she also have faster missile speed and it snare 2 target. I think something could be done to Morgana binding to make it more iconic than slower Lux binding.. I would like to have something attached to the bind. I can&#039;t tell what but it could be so much more. Her W is really bland and boring ability overall. It&#039;s a nice farming tool when solo lane but later in the game, everyone finish your creep before you can pick one. Her magic sheild is iconic but feel bland. The damage it block is fairly low and should be increased since mage are often seens elsewhere than mid. It&#039;s decent at best because even on support role there is more mage than before so if you don&#039;t invest on black shield early, it&#039;s basically popped by a basic spell. They could increase the ratio if base shield is too strong, so Morgana have to invest in AP as support to have bigger shield and Mid lane Morgana shine the most. I love her ultimate, but sometime I feel like I don&#039;t have any ultimate. Like the time it take to actually pop is huge and by the time it&#039;s going down, people either dashed or flashed away. I&#039;m not here to ask straight buff to Morgana but I feel there could be more work to do on her future rework than Add charge on her W... Oh well..","replies":[{"poster":"BlueBilberry","date":"2019-01-06T05:14:23.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want them to leave Morgana alone.

Kayle is one of the most binary champion and she is easy to punish and feel more often than not weak . Morgana need work to go back where she truly belong: mid lane mage.","replies":[{"poster":"BlueBilberry","date":"2019-01-06T05:19:14.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mc Raton,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Fk3HWOis,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-01-06T05:17:25.683+0000)\n>\n> I mean Rework is not a bad thing.

You can still climb with her...but the early game is not great because the runes just don't fit her.\n\nAs for Rework not being a bad thing, I have to say that, as a person who plays at a higher but stable ping rate, the reworks have not been that good for me.  Every single time we get a \"the champion is now more skill-reliant\", I find that I lose one more champion from my roster of playable champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Mc Raton","date":"2019-01-06T05:26:27.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BlueBilberry,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Fk3HWOis,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2019-01-06T05:19:14.797+0000)\n>\n> Kayle&#x27;s problem right now (as it is with a number of the other champions) is that the runes and items generally don&#x27;t suit her.

Same goes for Taric but they add mechanic to champion that were bland and boring to play. Irelia was legit bad pre rework. Now she fit the standard and reward good play . We all have to adapt. We are only players . We can't stop change.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Percentages","date":"2019-01-06T04:53:39.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe it will snare you for 5 years instead of 4 now...","replies":[{"poster":"Mc Raton","date":"2019-01-06T05:02:13.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Percentages,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Fk3HWOis,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-01-06T04:53:39.119+0000)\n>\n> Maybe it will snare you for 5 years instead of 4 now...\n\nLol.
