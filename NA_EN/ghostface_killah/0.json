Does this mean I have to lose 10 in a row, or when I win 1 game the shield breaks. What I'm asking is if I win my next game I will be around 20lp but how many games can I lose now consecutively to drop down, is it 7 in those case or  is the 10 game shield work no matter if you win or lose the game. Sorry if this was confusing you can ask me anything for clarification. In simple terms of an example if I'm plat 5 and win 1 game, then repeatedly lose the next 8 will I get demoted","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-02T18:01:19.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your shield would last for 10 games, regardless of winning or losing them.  Matchmaking would decide if you're close to being demoted or not, so I wouldn't be able to offer any specifics to how close you would be.  If you're in danger though after your shield, you should receive a warning notification on the client!","replies":[{"poster":"Ghostface Killah","date":"2017-09-02T19:02:15.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thank you for your helpful response","replies":[]}]}]}
