Maybe I perceived it bad or it is not a consistent bug. Sorry for the inconvenience and I'll open it again if I am able to find any evidence of it happening.\n\nGAMEPLAY bug. **Steps to reproduce**:\n\n* Karma uses focused resolve on Shaco revealing him\n* Shaco uses deceive, entering stealth mode and **avoidings being revealed**\n\nKarma&#039;s focused resolve is supposed to reveal stealthed enemies as Caitlyn&#039;s ace in the hole. According to LoL wikia page [1] (non-authoritative, I know) this is not the expected behavior.\n\nI will edit the post with a follow up video as soon as I record one.\n\n[1] http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Stealth\n\n\n**Edit #1**: I do not think this is intentional: Why focused resolve is then supposed to reveal stealthed enemies if you can only succesfully apply it when they're already stealthed? It should have the same behavior that Caitlyn's Ace in the Hole: Shaco Q doesn't breaks slashes abilites, R does.\n\nLets raise the issue and wait Riot response.\n\n**Edit #2**: Commenters (like Maximum Morde and Inquisitor Karma) reports that the same issue hapens with Vayne, Khazix, Shaco, Akali and Leblanc","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-02-18T17:12:43.108+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I'm pretty sure it used to work, but was broken a year or so ago. I think it was during one of the vision patches where they changed the way different vision types worked. I noticed that it stopped revealing Vayne, Khazix, Shaco, Akali, Leblanc, and others a while back as she used to be one of my go to counterpicks for stealth champs. \n\nIt not revealing stealthed champions makes that whole feature pointless since you can't cast it on someone you can't see in the first place as it's a targeted spells, so you wouldn't be able to use it to reveal someone who is stealthed, only to keep them visible while the tether is active, which is how it used to work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-02-18T12:25:16.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Because that reveals the person on cast, and Shaco's steal happens after. Similar to how challenging smite reveals a champion for 4 seconds, but if cast on Shaco and then he deceives, he is no longer visible.

Very lame. I don't mind not having the tether update (morgana's doesn't) but outright breaking?
