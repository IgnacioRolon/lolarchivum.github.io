Without frame rate issues or Lag","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing league from 2014 and this is my first time coming across a bug- ( I don't know ). My ping and my frame rates are fine but my character still seems to respond odd to movement. If I right- Click to move my Character will go into that direction and he will shudder a bit before responding properly to a click. On a long distance he responds to a click then shudder/ glitches a little bit  before moving on. On his/ her way to the point where I click he/ she doesn't shudder/ glitch. This only happens when I give a Right- Click to move command to the Character. I've tried allot of methods to to fix this problem, including setting my games video settings on the lowest it can go but the Glitch/ Shudder still remains. \r\nI don't know if the problem is at Riot or at me\r\nCan someone please help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-21T15:34:09.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a first step, do you have movement prediction enabled?  This is a feature that can be enabled in the Game interface options and has similar symptoms of packet loss.  Otherwise, you may be experiencing a network issue that's failing to maintain a stable connection and suffer from input delays.  I suggest running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) to get an overview of what's going.  The results will also provide some troubleshooting steps specific to your case.

I had this problem for most of season 5 and posted here repeatedly without any luck. It's a really common problem and is extremely frustrating.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Catrian","date":"2016-09-21T13:04:04.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been having a very similar problem ever since the patch that added the Yorick rework.League was running just fine for me up until that point.Now I have a very similar stutter issue to what you described.It's hard to explain but they'll be normal at the initial time I give the move command,but on the way to their destination the model will either move very fast,or incredibly slow and once they finish moving into an idle position they'll sort of \"slide\" into the position where they would have ended up.\n\nI know it's not normal lag since I can still kill minions at the time I give the command to attack and get the gold pop up for it,and the clock isn't acting out of the ordinary.But the champion and minion models are NOT where they should be while this is going on.","replies":[]}]}
