So I have 1 thing I am going to ask of anyone reading this. Before you play a game of ranked, do a speed test. If you have poor results, or are getting interrupted (some speed testers will also tell you if you drop signal often). BEFORE you play a ranked game for the day PLAY A GODAMN NORMAL MATCH. Do you know why? Not only does this help prepare you for ranked (gets you \"warmed up\" and makes your game-play better.) But guess what else it does? IT ALERTS YOU TO THE FACT THAT YOU MAY BE LAGGING! So, you dont jump in a ranked match, and go \"welp im lagging today\" and proceed to loose every teamfight we get into, because we lack an adc(whatever role you are). \n\nAlso, while we are all being intelligent and thinking about things why don't we all go crazy and learn not to hit the sejuani that has 4 completed defensive items by 30 minutes because she *somehow* is sucessful in 95% of her ganks! You can't stop her from ganking you, so lets push the wave as hard as possible (while csing 1-2 creeps per wave) and try to poke under enemy tower, while not wasting money on wards on each side of river (if your mid obviously). I mean hell, why ward? That is 75 gold that you are giving up. Who cares about helping yourself/team out with map vision anyways?\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Kitten of Evil","date":"2015-03-13T04:56:13.570+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's lag?

Like 1/4 of the time my screen will freeze for like 2 seconds whenever someone engages on me or when I engage.
