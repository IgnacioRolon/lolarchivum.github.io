I understand that it is not the same thing as video game development by any means, but I would think there should be quite a bit of similarities.  Foremost, math.  While some balancing makes sense that it isn&#039;t something that can be updated weekly (If you change the range on something you have to take into account the graphics need to be updated, their interactions need to be checked insert 400 other things here etc etc).  However for just general balancing, I don&#039;t understand why it often takes so long.  Maybe this is just my curiosity getting the better of me.  While I welcome all responses / opinions / thoughts / theories, I&#039;d highly appreciate anyone with actual video game experience that can elaborate.  I also understand why a Rioter probably can&#039;t respond, but if they could without disclosing code or anything like that it&#039;d be fantastic.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure there are more than 10 million layers to league (its why this game is awesome), however there comes a point where you actually get to just numbers for common balances.  Some of the lower layers I would think would be champion damage.  Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 represents the levels of your Q for example.  I would think it would be written in a way that you can more or less copy and paste into every champion.  While you may need to rename things, the formula shouldn&#039;t *need* to change.\r\n\r\nQ1 damage calculation = (Base Damage) + (AD Scaling * AD) + (AP Scaling * AP) + (Health Scaling * Health) + (Mana Scaling * Mana) + (Armor Scaling * Armor) + (MR Scaling * MR). (This of course is probably an over simplified version of how their formulas actually look but for demonstration purposes)  Anything that doesn&#039;t scale with a given stat will automatically zero out.  While I wouldn&#039;t think a couple integers on each skill would cause much additional stress on anyone&#039;s computer playing the game, I guess there&#039;s really no harm in pulling the zero factors out.  This also gives the ability to &quot;scale the scale&quot; that is Maybe rank 1 Q scales by 10% of your AD and at rank 5 its 50%. Now imagine this same thing for W E and R.  Same thing with stats.  Base Health X + (Scaling amount * level) Mana armor ad attack speed.......\r\n\r\nTheoretically you could put anything in here.  Spell vamp / life steal / slow / stun etc that is reflective of itself. (That is, you don&#039;t account for spell vamp here unless it&#039;s part of the skill itself (Vlad Q), I wouldn&#039;t think you&#039;d account for here but maybe I&#039;m wrong, maybe my whole logic is... *starts overthinking posting*)\r\n\r\nThen something another section that calculates the actual damage dealt (Insert formula with a lot more interactions Ad damage percent * (some number less than one based on armor) etc etc) special interactions like % health (BOtRK / Vayne passive...)\r\n\r\nSo, given my thoughts I would think when champions are unbalanced, a small nerf 3% off your Q AP scaling becomes changing literally 1 number in 1 file that is always referenced and never directly re-written anywhere but those ONE files per champion, or champion skill depending on how it actually ends up, or changing base damage is changing 5 numbers. I would think with even a semi-organized file system this is a 2 minute project between finding the file making the change and committing the changes for an intern (don&#039;t let your interns decide the scaling, their favorite champs will get OP quick :p)  With it only taking a couple minutes to balance each champion, I would think small nerfs / buffs could hit EVERY champion if needed with a weekly balance even if that was an intern&#039;s only job.\r\n\r\n*Again I state that these are for SIMPLE balancing and again is not me calling Riot out*\r\n\r\nWhile I&#039;m not trying to say how it *should* be done, I&#039;m just curious where the flaws in my logic are.  Or, if this was developed like so many commercial projects that started one way that worked but now really should be overhauled entirely but that costs too much time / resources and so it goes on as is.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for reading my really long question!","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-04-07T06:36:22.504+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":5,"body":"Fair question.\n\nThe actual process of entering balance changes can be almost that quick for something really basic. Changing a spell's base damage for example probably takes 5-10 minutes (find the right file, change a few numbers, make a note of the change for the patch notes, create a ticket to ensure the changes get tested, submit the changes to the internal server). Some stuff's much harder to adjust than changing a couple of numbers though, so can take quite a bit longer (modifying Bard's Magical Journey so that clones could use it too in the last patch for example).\n\nGenerally though, implementing the change isn't the time consuming part. Most of a balance designer's time is spent on analyzing the state of the game and testing changes that have already been implemented. Changing stuff quick's not the bottleneck, it's getting sufficient confidence that we're changing the right things in the right ways (and even with a lot of time put into that we'll be wrong sometimes of course).\n\nOne small side note - while we do get interns each year, they're not here to do menial data entry to make things easier for other people. Goal of the internships is basically to offer a couple of months of work experience as a normal Rioter. That means that interns on design teams for example do the same analysis, testing, implementation etc that other designers do (though with a chunk of extra support and mentoring of course, since they've got less experience to draw on usually).","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2015-04-07T06:48:01.554+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":13,"body":"So if a number change is 5-10 minutes and \"Modifying Magical Journey\" takes \"a bit longer,\" then _hypothetically_, how long would it take to revert 29 separate nerfs all on a single champion?

The documented amount is 21, we know for a fact they also secretly decreased Hymn's range by 50 and her base AD by 2, but there are suspicions there were more than that.  So in actuality, the number might be higher than 23.\n\nAs for the recent \"buff,\" ya it was a nice change, but one that was 1 year, 4 months and 2 weeks overdue.  That was when they made the exact change to countless other champs and players have been asking for Sona to get the same fair treatment this whole time.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-07T07:23:56.850+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't know what the big deal with Sona was. Her three hard counters are the three most popular supports, for one. She's not overpowered, but she's annoying with her Q (and who else is annoying but not overpowered right now...?).\n\nI mean, I know they must have a reason, but when they nerfed her movement speed on top of everything else I just wondered if Riot just hated her. Even the patch notes when her ult got buffed made a quip about it being a buff (for once) :/","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2015-04-07T08:21:27.367+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"People talk about her Q being \"annoying,\" they use reasons like \"damage,\" \"long-range\" or \"auto-targeting,\" but those arguments are inherently flawed.\n\n* The damage on Q is tied with 3 other spells on 2 champs for the lowest base amongst the entire support class at only 40 per cast.  Matter-of-fact, her damage potential as a whole is the 2nd lowest only to Braum.\n* The range on Q is 700, whilst most spells tend to be 900 or more.  For some reason, Riot and Wikia still have this listed incorrectly and both are different from each other in addition.  Worse, for the on-hit of Q and Power Chord in general, she needs to get in 550 range, average ADC range, making her always vulnerable to retaliation.\n* Being auto-targeting may make them arguably more reliable than skillshots, but less reliable than targeted spells.  It's mandatory that the player instinctively knows the exact range on it and there's the chance that even the slightest mis-calculation ends in burning cast-time and mana, much the same as missing a skillshot.\n\nAgreed the movement speed nerf was baffling and absurd.  Nami is unanimously considered a superior carbon copy of Sona, yet sits TWO whole movement tiers above Sona.  Despite Nami having easy access to 2 forms of CC, 1 being a knock-up and Sona's E on all 4 of her spells.  In addition to a heal twice the base of Sona's on the same CD.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-07T08:27:37.082+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only saving grace on Sona's W is the shield.

As a matter of fact, it reduces far less incoming damage than the old armor/MR aura used to give.  The only upside is for true damage and nothing else, it's literally a blatantly inferior spell otherwise.\n\nAlmost everything about Sona is \"worst of\" or \"2nd worst of\" in regards to either the support class as a whole or even the entire champion base.  The few remaining stats that don't fall into these categories still sit in the bottom half of champions.\n\nHaving the lowest number of total stat points in the game, including all factors, Sona is mathematically the weakest champion in League.  This is reflected in the fact that her pro win-rate fell to 0% immediately after 4.13 and to this day has yet to rise above it.  Additionally, the top Sona mains worldwide have all been getting demoted multiple times and the larger majority eventually quit the game altogether.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-07T09:34:50.324+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">On the other hand, it's both the weakest and shortest duration shield of the entire support class\n\nB-but it's weak because it's a shield AND heal in one... with no aa bonus {{champion:117}} {{champion:40}} \n\nBut...

That was awesome one time, but it's not a reliable strength like other support abilities.\n\nHonestly... *sighs*... I think she needs an actual rework.

No, Sona is not at all the weakest in terms of pokes. She's actually among the strongest. Same for her healing, and keep in mind that shield value can be given to up to five people.

Changing a spell's base damage for example probably takes 5-10 minutes (find the right file, change a few numbers, make a note of the change for the patch notes, create a ticket to ensure the changes get tested, submit the changes to the internal server). Some stuff's much harder to adjust than changing a couple of numbers though, so can take quite a bit longer (modifying Bard's Magical Journey so that clones could use it too in the last patch for example).\n> \n> Generally though, implementing the change isn't the time consuming part. Most of a balance designer's time is spent on analyzing the state of the game and testing changes that have already been implemented. Changing stuff quick's not the bottleneck, it's getting sufficient confidence that we're changing the right things in the right ways (and even with a lot of time put into that we'll be wrong sometimes of course).\n> \n> One small side note - while we do get interns each year, they're not here to do menial data entry to make things easier for other people. Goal of the internships is basically to offer a couple of months of work experience as a normal Rioter. That means that interns on design teams for example do the same analysis, testing, implementation etc that other designers do (though with a chunk of extra support and mentoring of course, since they've got less experience to draw on usually).\n\nI think you guys spend too much analyzing and not enough time PLAYING lol. Sometimes you just gotta play the game a week and you find what stuff needs balancing. What's been happening to your game is that you're buffing whole classes of champs with item fixes that now become meta picks and people now follow a new meta every week. The pick and ban phase is almost meaningless since whole classes of champs are in the same state. I think you guys need to focus more on bug fixes than actual champion changes, stuff like hitbox detection, ability reads, and champs like Quinn that are almost at a state of nonplay because of bugs. Essentially you can find out why champs are underplayed or lower than average winrates based on these issues. I still play the game alot and enjoy the game but I feel like I have to relearn the whole game because of the meta paradigms. Last couple patches I'd never play Olaf, now I'm wrecking with him because enemy comps stack cc teamfight tanks now. Essentially I think you guys need to diversify carry itemization, everyone just gets TF or IE and same other stuff, bruisers and tanks need some more itemization as well, give magus sustain or magic pen, give devour cdr or tenacity. This is a weird meta where champs like Kog are seen as massive threats and Zed seems to do no damage lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2015-04-07T05:24:59.589+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are just so many ways to balance a champion. lets take a controversial one, because it is one of my favorites: {{champion:115}}.\n\nSo, lets look at every way I can think of off the top of my head (and if i miss a reasonable one, comment it as well, as he has a LOT)\n\nyou can:\n1. change mana costs\n2. change damage values\n3. change the spell width of his Q\n4. change the explosion radius of Q\n5. change the number of bombs that come in his E\n6. change the spread distance of his E\n7. change the distance of the knockback on his W\n8. change the time ticking on his W\n9. change the range on his spells (especially ult)\n10. change explosion radius on ult/damage per distance from center\n11. change base stats (health, health per level, mana, mana per level, MR, Armor, MS, the like)\n12. change the travel speed of his abilities\n13. change the number of bounces on his Q\n14. change how the spells interact with minions (especially on bounces with the Q)\n15. change the cool-down lengths of spells\n\nAll of these are viable changes, and frequently riot looks to a mixture between these options. Riot is very good about not just blanket fixing, but making sure that they fix the real issue with the right tool, not just 'buff teh damages!' or 'nerf teh cool-downs!'. it's a ver delicate slider between OP and UP for many champions, as kassadin and zed and ryze show very well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PodunkTheMighty","date":"2015-04-07T08:32:57.356+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot's policy seems to be balancing after something's proven to be off on a pro/overwhelming level.

So if a certain champion is dominant, rather than complain, Riot wants people to _counterpick_ that champion. The problems stem from when there aren't enough champions or items for a champion to get counterpicked, or even when counterpicked these champions do well.\n\nI think Riot's goals have gotten skewed over the years. They've put a lot of work into making the game an enjoyable spectator sport without factoring in the fact that 95% of their players are never going to play at that level, and have to deal with annoying bullshit like Lee or Nid all the time. Yes, they look cool for everyone watching, but being hit by invisible spears, or executed with a 600 (+200% bonus AD) damage kick isn't fun to be on the receiving end of.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BlueThingamajig","date":"2015-04-07T18:15:06.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's also an argument to be had for an imperfectly balanced game. By constantly cycling buffs and nerfs, different champions get exposure and playtime, causing the experience to evolve. The champions picked in LCS change. The champions picked for solo queue change. Its becomes a fresh (ish) experience when something big like Cinderhulk happens. Lane dynamics change because Tank junglers have a different kind of threat than the fighters that had been dominating for such a long time. I can play more aggressively in lane because I know that I can escape certain junglers that aren't Lee Sin in the first 3 levels.\n\n\"Perfect Balance\" also has disparity between \"LCS Perfect Balance\" and \"Solo Queue Perfect Balance\" (And even then, disparity between Masters perfect balance and Gold perfect balance). It is why so many people dislike Lee Sin and #LC$BigPlays. Having Lee Sin as a top-tier competitive pick for over 2 years made LCS less interesting to watch. Now, we suddenly have support Nautilus and the resurgence of Volibear or Amumu jungle. \n\nAnd will the tank-jungle get boring in a few months? Absolutely.

You could use more majority wins type decisions when it comes to who is actually annoying since it is subjective. Basically take a stance and stick with it so that people shut up about it. For example when someone says \"You nerfed this champion now they are weaker so rebuff them back to when they were a problem.\" Just tell them what's up and move on Give them the hard truth. If a champ gets 30 nerfs and goes from 52% winrate to 51% winrate chances are they are fine and didnt need the excess power. If you get 15 silver players complaining about lee sin when he isn't even problematic at that skill level but they wanna be in the circlejerk them just tell them that and move on.","replies":[{"poster":"MAZZ1M0","date":"2015-04-08T03:19:01.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you, especially on the Lee Sin bit. So many threads b#$%ing about him and he doesn't crowd out anyone. He's just _safe_.  There's nothing wrong with that considering he can't carry past the 25 min mark (assuming your team isn't rolling over against him.)\n\nI think Riot is two things; One: generally gun-shy. They ask us to share our opinions on changes and they get them. Sona feedback was overwhelmingly negative. Even now I'm still wondering what the deal is. Half the people I play with who like Sona never played her pre-rework to compare. I don't find her fun to play anymore. The groans about a supp picking Sona post-rework are a less frequent now though.\nTwo: Riot is learning. With a game like LoL, past experience doesn't mean as much when you're changing something new as circumstances or unpredictable oddities will alter the success of a change. Some of the changes don't make sense at all, but I think that's more due to bad planning than anything. They appear to piece-mail changes each patch without just waiting and dumping a theoretically functioning system on us all at once. While that makes us suffer in the meantime, they get data that lets them adjust as they go. That's the only logic I think up anyway.","replies":[]}]}]}
