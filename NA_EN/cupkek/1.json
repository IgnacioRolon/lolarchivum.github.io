Most of these changes will make him a more reliable and effective skirmishing... scorpion... thing...\r\n\r\nFrankly I&#039;m happy to see most of these changes. The one thing that was holding me back from playing Skarner frequently was the fact that, in his current state, he&#039;s a sub-optimal jungler and his cc is reliant on his ability to stick to a target for extended periods of time. \r\n\r\nThe on-hit stun being moved to his E was a brilliant way to make his gank potential far more effective without making him overbearing. His CC is reliant on a slow moving skillshot rather than having to get off 3 abilities and a clunky auto attack within close proximity to an enemy champion, so kudos to you buddy!\r\n\r\n_**My only concern is:**_\r\n\r\nThe crystal capturing mechanic is... less than appealing. From what it seems like, it limits Skarner to jungling exclusively. On top of this, crystal locations are set and static, making them easy targets for enemy players. While I&#039;m sure this is intended, it seems to be a hindrance for the Skarner player. Assuming they&#039;re jungling, it adds another thing to his _**&quot;Sh!t to do&quot;**_ list on top of ganking, farming, holding a lane, etc. \r\n\r\nIn a game where 4v5 or mega-feeding situations run rampant, I feel like the crystal-hunting aspect of Skarner would hurt him more than it would help him. Or at the very least become a noob-trap priority that leaves laners without ganks and Skarner running around the jungle counting his rocks and trying to bait fights in his crystal zones, which is easier said than done, only to have them stolen mid-fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_**Proposed change:**_\r\n\r\n**Current: ** _~~Skarner&rsquo;s presence causes crystals to spawn in set locations around the map. Crystals can be captured by either team by standing on top of them. Capturing prevents them from being captured by the opposing team for 15 seconds.~~\r\n\r\n_\r\n**Revised:** _Skarner&#039;s presence causes crystals to spawn in the jungle near random jungle camps around Skarner&#039;s team&#039;s side of the map. Crystals can be captured by either team by standing on top of them. Capturing prevents them from being captured by the opposing team for 15 seconds. Crystals will despawn 1 minute after their corresponding camp&#039;s &#039;big&#039; monster has been slain and a new crystal will spawn elsewhere. Up to 2 crystals may be active at once.\r\n_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal with this revision is to encourage Skarner to hunt crystals and vary his jungle pattern from the stale Krugs&gt;Red&gt;Chickens or Gromp&gt;Blue&gt;Red/Wolves route. This provides Skarner a potential reprieve from counter-junglers predicting his route while also granting more aggressive junglers ({{champion:80}} go geddem buddy!)  the opportunity to snag a crystal, find out where he is, and bludgeon him to death in his own jungle. \r\n\r\n**TL;DR**\r\nSkarner&#039;s passive is lackluster and is a bunch of extra work for sub-par reward. I&#039;d like it to be a bit more focused on his jungle, opening up opportunity for him to vary his jungle route while still offering enemies the opportunity to slow/stop his roll. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read (if you did), I&#039;d love feedback on this to hear what people think :)\r\n\r\n**_Aegis of Zeonia_**","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-10T05:18:19.393+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hi Aegis of Zeonia, thanks for the thoughts on Skarner.

It gives Skarner players, teammates, and opponents an expectation as to how they're going to play about them in any given game. This is important to me because, even following these changes, we aren't aiming to have Skarner be extremely popular and in every game. We're okay with his niche appeal, and we just wanted to give a little more uniqueness to the games he's in, as well as another point of mastery for Skarner players.

Unless you're planning to predict, invade and center a fight around the crystal in the enemy jungle, and I can think of a few junglers who can invade far more reliably, I don't see it being a boon to Skarner. In fact, I see it more as 30 free gold to the enemy jungler. \n\nThe tedious aspect about the crystals is that they can be taken by the enemy, yielding that ** *sigh grumble-grumble* ** feeling when someone kills/jacks one of your wards/crystals and you feel compelled to reclaim it.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the OCD nature of a lot of League players (or online gamers in general). Some folks, myself included, will be sorely tempted to capture all 4 crystal points. **Sure, it does nothing... BUT I'VE GOT ALL 4**! The fact that there are multiple points, a few of which are in enemy territory, will cause plenty of players to wander into the enemy jungle just to secure those points, putting themselves at risk. Why? Because 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 just doesn't feel right. It's just the nature of the beast. Frankly I'm unsure as to how that could be avoided. \n\nPerhaps keeping one (or two) crystal(s) activated on Skarner's side of the map would increase Skarner's gold generation or gold received from monster kills for a limited time? I believe it would counteract that OCD feeling of \"**MUST HAVE ALL THE KRISSLES**\" while allowing Skarner players to pick up crystals on the enemy jungle's side, should they care to go on the offensive. Virtually eliminating that 'need' to activate all 4. It would also incentivise counter junglers as well as the enemy team to make an effort to keep Skarner behind by keeping his crystals on his side in check.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-10T06:21:03.417+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":">  I can think of a few junglers who can invade far more reliably, I don't see it being a boon to Skarner.

On the surface it looks like a gimmick that is intended to gate his power (into very specific areas of the map).  The general assumption is \"Sure he may be strong in those zones, but outside of them he can be kited and killed easily.\".  I think what's not realized is how often teams fight over an objective (like dragon for example).\n\nLooking deeper into it though, Skarner's passive doesn't gate his power as hard as most think and rather works as an anti-snowball mechanic for both Skarner and the enemy team.  Skarner's Q on PBE is much weaker without AD early in the game, but the massive attack speed buff he receives from his passive while clearing his jungle counteracts this.  As the match continues Skarner's Q becomes VERY strong (essentially he can use his Q much more often with a lower mana cost, and it inflicts even more damage than Skarner's Q on live).  It breaks even at 135 AD (easily achievable if Warrior is purchased, which honestly is fairly strong on his PBE iteration).  He really doesn't even require as much attack speed as his past iterations have (because of the lower base CD on Q as it ranks up).\n\nI'd be hesitant to push more power into his passive at this point.  The attack speed boost is massive (and the movement speed buff is about equivalent to a 25% MS increase).  He also has huge mana sustain and very low mana costs (which removes his dependence on blue buff).  When in a fight around baron or dragon Skarner's offense is HUGE.  If there were any changes I'd think Skarner needs, it would be very few (and to name examples):\n\n\n* Standardize W's movement speed buff, instead of a ramp-up.  Right now it's 0%/4%/8%/12%/16% + 16% over 3 seconds.  To help him deal with kiting, remove the ramp-up mechanic and just have it as a static MS increase for as long as the shield is active (10%/14%/18%/22%/26% maybe).\n\n* Increase the time it takes for capturing a Crystal Spire.  It's somewhat difficult to keep hold of a Crystal Spire (and respond to someone capturing it) because the channel is very short.  If it took longer not only would it introduce more risks (capturing a spire alone could be a bad idea for Skarner) but it would add a safety net of sorts for Skarner in his own jungle (it would be difficult to take it from him before he makes his way over to the spire and beats you down).\n\nI think Skarner has definitely received the correct changes in his kit (what with the damage and frequency of his Q, the massive shield on his W, and a slow + stun on his E).  He'll be in a great spot hopefully.  I'm excited mainly because his ganks should be stronger early, he shouldn't be dependent on snowballing, and he will actually deal damage late-game (compared to current Skarner).\n\nMan, I wish other riot employees on the balance team interacted as much as you do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ToxycBanana","date":"2015-08-10T15:36:07.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As for making his ult more unique, I've been giving it a little bit of thought.\nI was thinking along the lines of making it a short dash that impales any enemy champion he comes into contact with, like Hecarim's ult (except a much shorter range) so he has at least some mobility in his kit aside from the speed boost from his w and allows him to have more of a \"Heck yeah I just did that!\" factor in his kit other than just spamming Q and auto attacking until everybody dies or he dies killing everyone.\nIt would also make the ult cd on live right now more reasonable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcane Azmadi","date":"2015-08-10T05:31:53.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":14,"body":"I see you still think the stupid fucking stationary crystals are a _good idea._\n\nThere is no hope.

This would slightly balance out the fact that the spires are near useless when you aren't in the jungle.\n\nHowever, I do feel that the spires should affect the whole portion of the jungle you're currently in. if you take the Spire in the red section, you should receive the buff for the monsters in the red section. That includes, Raptors, Krugs, and Red itself. If you take the Spire near dragon, you get the buff while in that part of the river.\n\nThis might be a little overpowered, but it's some suggestions.","replies":[]}]}
