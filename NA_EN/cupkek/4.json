CC. A full team of support-type champions can lock down not just 1 or 2, but entire teams and deal enough damage to either force a disengage, or pick up kills. The people you play against don't matter. Their skill doesn't matter. A 12 second CC chain that can't be dodged once the first one lands means no matter how much skill you have, you will die.","replies":[]},{"poster":"exiledFromBadmen","date":"2015-03-23T19:25:43.370+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No {{item:2049}} \nYou're exiled from the support train.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-03-23T13:27:02.917+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg your teamwork is out of orbit, those assists ...\n\nMy guess is you could win even if you had actual opponents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-03-23T06:57:32.317+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would've helped if their Diana didn't build flat HP all the way across lol","replies":[{"poster":"Cupkek","date":"2015-03-23T21:03:17.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Valkyrie Witch,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=Ot0zN1Zl,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-23T06:57:32.317+0000)\n>\n> Would've helped if their Diana didn't build flat HP all the way across lol\n\nYeah, after losing lane horrendously to annie, she decided to build troll.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-03-23T06:54:43.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blade of the ruined king on leona....\n\nI need to try that out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Zilean","date":"2015-03-23T08:01:10.334+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"3 champions on the enemy team comp are easily kitable.
