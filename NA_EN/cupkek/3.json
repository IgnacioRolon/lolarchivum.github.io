Get this: It&#039;s called \"_Summoner&#039;s Alliance_\". Really? Even the name is unoriginal.\n\nIt&#039;s not the only example of this out there, \"_Summoner&#039;s War_\" actually has gameplay footage of a fight where the Boss is just a recolored version of {{champion:40}}. Like for real?\n\nLook at these names! Galen, Jarven, Zhao Yun! For the most part, it&#039;s just one letter being changed so it&#039;s not blatant. Hell they even use DEMACIA because they weren&#039;t clever enough to think of an alternative!\n\nEverything about this 'game' is bullshit. The Ashe-character (name is Icey) has a description that literally reads; \"She is rumored to use ice arrows...\". Ho-Lee-Fuck. At least put some effort into your blatant plagiarism! \n\nOut of curiosity, I downloaded the app to see how bad it was. The voice acting is hilariously horrendous because it's entirely composed of half-chinese infused broken english. I can feel my soul writhing in agony every second I have it open. The first item you get is a goddamn Doran's Shield, same name and same sprite as in League.\n\nWant to know the best part? They go the whole iPhone freemium strategy, you can buy 'heroes' and items for RL cash. Downright pathetic.\n\nCan someone from Riot confirm these jerkoffs are being sued into the next dimension?","replies":[{"poster":"TheFancySkeleton","date":"2015-07-26T20:03:57.095+0000","up_votes":83,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a guy named Daaaaaaaaaaaaarvan?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lights And Magic","date":"2015-07-26T18:45:00.530+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":8,"body":"Another one is called \"League Of Angels\".
