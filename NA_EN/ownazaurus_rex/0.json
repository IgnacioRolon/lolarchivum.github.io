(I don't generally post on the forums.) If someone can move it please do it I'm not sure where it goes.\r\n\r\nThis morning I did what I normally do, log in and play ranked. I picked Garen (Why not? I'm a great garen and he's broken as all hell.) into gnar knowing that I'd be sitting at tower farming until level 6. The farming lane stayed steady until he hit 6 before I did and he used hop to bounce over me, ult me into the wall and then flashed and threw the killing boulder at me. So yes, it is safe to say that I lost lane 0/1. However, I stayed above him in farm by about 10 all game which made his gold lead very minimum. \r\n\r\nAnyways, we had a Yi and an Ashe, appeared to be duo, who started bashing on me right away. (I am chat restricted for a reason, normally I would swear at people who call me out instead of focusing on their own damn play.) I refrained from arguing and we had a huge gold lead.\r\n\r\nHowever, this was one of those, what I like to call power ranger teams. Where one person engages 1v5, someone runs in to help, the original person in the 1v5 dies and then the next person is left in a 1v5 and the cycle continues until all 5 members of the team are dead. I refused to play this game with my team. They called me dumb and swore at me all game saying how I was useless and not doing anything as they kept running into a modified 4v5 one at a time (1v5, 1v5, 1v5, 1v5) The yi and ashe were able to cross team chat and I was not. They made up lies about me saying that I was telling everyone to kill themselves and got the whole enemy team to report me. I am already chat restricted and don't want to be restricted any farther. I tried explaining to the enemy team afterwards but none of them appeared to buy it. Instantly my screen came up warning me that my in game behavior was unacceptable. (My team threw a 4k gold lead btw.) As I was sitting there bashing yi telling him that I did more damage than a sated master yi. (What good is sated yi that can't deal damage?) He told me to drink bleach and that I should kill myself IRL. The exact thing that he told the other team I had said to him.\r\n\r\ni have pictures and proof of the postgame screen. Is there anyway that we can get this guy permabanned?\r\n\r\nI always try at the end of ranked games to reflect upon my mistakes and see why I am still Silver 5 (have been up to silver 3 before) but games like this make it feel meaningless sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"LeonDemonOfDeath","date":"2015-08-31T01:35:11.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry bud, but you should just immediately mute anyone who displays negative behavior.
