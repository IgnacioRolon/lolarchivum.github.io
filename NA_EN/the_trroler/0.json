Basically, about 1-3 days ago(not too sure when), there was a problem with the client. People were having problems with logging in, finding matches after a game, unable to connect to rank, and so on. Right before ranked queues were disabled, i was playing a match. Long story short, nobody in this particular game was having problems, and my team won._ I noticed that I had only gained 11lp from that particular game_, whilst  before then my average LP gain was around 23-25. I was duo with a gold partner, and my rank was silver 1 at the time. I was also on an 8 game winning streak! So what I want to know is why I only gained 11LP from that game. I totally understand how LP gains and MMR works, and matchmaking. When i expressed my concerns to Riot, I also told them so. Obviously, Riot gave me an automated bot response not directed towards my problem at all. If you want to read it, here:\r\nLP is used to track progression through a particular division as well as determine qualification for advancement. However, hidden matchmaking rating (MMR) is the variable used to determine placement for a division/tier as well as how much LP will be gained or lost in a ranked game.\r\n\r\n\"If your MMR is significantly lower than where the system believes you should be for the division you are in, then your LP gains will be reduced. Furthermore, the amount of LP you earn will not increase until your MMR is raised to a point where the system believes you should be for that particular division. On the opposite end of this situation, you may experience large LP losses due to the fact that the system believes you should be in a lower Division based on your current MMR. Please keep in mind that as long as you continue to win more than you lose, your League Point gain will even out and youâ€™ll continue to make progress towards the next advancement series.\r\n\r\nI hope this explanation has helped. You can also check out our Ranked Play FAQ here:\r\n\r\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or concerns\"\r\n\r\nThis riot member(whose name i will not reveal because i want this post to stay on the boards), did not answer any of my damn questions, and it is quite bothersome. I asked if it was some sort of bug, and as you can CLEARLY see, nope. Enough of my ranting, I am just annoyed at this. Can the community help me come to a conclusion on why this happened? I think it has something to do with the servers being bugged at the time, and the client itself.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-03T23:41:59.286+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me cut to the chase and get rid of the bullshit:  When we activate Loss Prevented due to server issues, it not only forgives players who lose (they get 0 LP), but players who win get halved rewards since they may have had unfair advantages due to people disconnecting and not able to join again.  This is by design so players cannot \"abuse\" the system possibly by winning a ton of games in a row when the servers are having issues.\n\nI hope this makes sense!  Let me know if you have any other concerns.","replies":[{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2016-05-03T23:48:09.863+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for immediately answering his question and paying attention to what he wrote. Sending in support tickets and getting a canned email response that you know is wrong is super frustrating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Trroler","date":"2016-05-04T02:26:59.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes. Thanks for the help, it was quite bothersome to see just another \"automated\" response. Sorry if I came across as rude or spiteful, I was just upset that was the response i received for going out of my time to write the ticket, and wait almost a day for a response. Keep up the good work on the forums, i appreciate it once again!\nEdit: I never knew that the LP gain was halved due to Loss Prevention, but I was thinking something along the lines of that lol!","replies":[]}]}]}
