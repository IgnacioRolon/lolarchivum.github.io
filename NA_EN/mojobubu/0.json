It seems likely there is a {{summoner:4}}  of players, new and old every new season. \nWhat I'm most fascinated by the amount of people who give up. Stems from frustration, sure. It's like people look for reasons to rage. Even when we're winning. \n\n(Spams pings, Sits near tower, Spam types about a miss play)\n ^ granted we're winning here, if we had been behind he would have {{summoner:6}}  his way to the base.\n\nOkay so, above is a particular example, but I've played about 50 ranked games this season. I've noted roughly 50% of games someone is afking. (I haven't tally'd) It feels higher than normal. I was playing quite a lot about a month ago, took a break after hitting platinum waited for season. I feel like its the new season to blame for the surge of players and granted higher anxiety about placements / promos. It is just ridiculous. I find myself reporting every other game, sometimes games back to back. Yes back to back afkers. (I know I'm not alone, I've read enough posts about the same thing in the past). There is a correlation between new season and perhaps rank tiers? People in gold / getting knocked down with silver bronze players. You have skill gap differences that trigger people causing them to quit or any other reason you can think of that happens when skill gapped players are mashed up together. I understand I can climb out, but at this point it feels like such matchmaking RNG. Do I get a griefing afker.\n\n(P.S. Are reports working? No notifications for these acutal inting afkers or even verbal abusers. I think riot is asleep, maybe they need extra help? Why not bring back the tribunal, Honor 5 players get to join tribunal maybe? Help weed through this barrage of griefing/toxic/afking/trolls) ","replies":[{"poster":"Lemmy","date":"2020-01-24T16:56:47.483+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rank is pretty irrelevant here, afking players occur across all ranks.\n\nI think at the beginning of the season you just have a lot of players that think, \"this season will be different\", and they end up getting the rude awakening that they are in-fact no better than they were last season and it wasn't \"muh team\" holding them back. Other players probably get dumped on in lane and feel really hopeless about continuing and would rather just go next and start over. /shrug","replies":[]},{"poster":"Metal Janna","date":"2020-01-24T16:05:04.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There did seem to be a huge burst of AFKers at season start when I was doing my placements and for the next few days.\n\nOne would think that since MMR persists you'd be playing with/against the same ELO you had been.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-24T21:30:22.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"When AFKs are this rampant...\n\nNow understand that I don't think Riot is doing the best they can, and I only say it because this is gonna sound very defensive of Riot.

People who want to afk / surrender rather skip and go to the next that is fine. People who want to fight to the bitter end should be able to do without boycotting is that asking for too much? Opting-in to no surrendering is just a different mind set. Neither one is wrong. What is wrong is sabotaging other people trying to actually play.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-25T00:22:10.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand where you're coming from, and from that point of view it is a good idea.\n\nHowever, one of the guiding principles of League is that you don't get to choose who you play with, outside of premades. All their reasoning revolves around their fear of the Prisoner's Island dilemma, which you can google. Basically, 'bad' players are more 'bad' when you group them together. I applaud that you've come up with an idea, once again I say it is a good idea from a player perspective such as yours, and that is not a bad thing. In the big picture, however, it is a bad idea. (edit: Your perspective is not bad or wrong either.)\n\nSo, given that, it falls upon the players to create a positive experience for their team. This is a tall order, but it is well worth doing. Try it. Try criticizing your team within the rules, and you'll see more players AFK. Try emotionally supporting them, being positive yourself, and you will see fewer players AFK. People seem to forget that playing a multiplayer game is about winning/having fun _together_. That includes BOTH having fun AND playing to win.\n\nEdit: Do not blame them for AFK. You control how/why YOU play. How YOU play can be encouraging, positive. Think about a sports team. A team that builds each other up and supports each other through rough spots is a strong team. One filled with hot-shots is a bad team. A good movie to watch that demonstrates it: Remember the Titans. I know, it's bad to AFK, but they can have fair reason(s) to do so. (I don't AFK... pretty much)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Billybaroo2314","date":"2020-02-15T09:33:46.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot does not care about the community.
