Sheen, to them, is just for the bonus damage from Spellblade, not really about the bonus Mana or Ability power.  For example:  Lee Sin does not use the Mana, and Ability Power only scales with his W - Safeguard.\r\n\r\nTaking this theme of movement speed and the application of Rage, as well as Riot's theme that continuously making good plays should allow you to win, I'm imagining this item being built out of the {{item:3096}}  Movement Speed + gold income item, making it much useful for champions who are behind to catch back up as they aren't selling it back to the store.\r\n\r\nThese stats and prices probably aren't the best, but that's why I'm posting it here, to see if we can get it into a balanced state for the game.\r\n\r\nAero-Maul = Phage + Nomad's Medallion + 800g\r\n\r\n+10 HP/5\r\n+15 Movement Speed\r\n+15 Mana/5\r\n+25 Attack Damage\r\n+250 HP\r\n+3 Gold per 10 seconds\r\n\r\nUNIQUE Passive - Rage:  Basic attacks grant 25 Movement Speed for 2 seconds. Kills grant 80 Movement Speed instead. This Movement Speed bonus is halved for ranged champions.\r\n\r\nUNIQUE Passive - Favor:  Being near a minion death without granting the killing blow grants +5 Gold.\r\n\r\nUNIQUE Passive - Gold Income:  You may only be in possession of one Gold Income item.\r\n\r\nI used the [Gold Efficiency Page on the Wiki](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Gold_efficiency) to attempt to sample the price.  The stats on top of what Phage and Nomad's Medallion provide are worth an additional 690 gold, not counting the Unique passives or gold generation.  Still not counting gold generation, the Rage passive must be valued at 89 gold for it to be Gold Efficient, for comparison the Rage passive on Phage must be valued at 77 gold for it to be gold efficient.\r\n\r\nPlease, discuss and help me balance / consider this item as to fine-tune it for the state of the league.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-08-17T02:49:05.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a problem with this: you shouldn't build non-support items off support items. It screws up the gold balance in the team as it makes more mathematical sense to start with an ancient coin and then a nomad's medallion, so that you can get more gold generation, and then get a phage (which means delaying your damage and tanking capabilities). If you do this on a non-support, you are also wasting the item's passive, which gives you gold for nearby minions that die without you killing them. This makes the item horrendously useless and gold-inefficient on a solo lane or the jungle.\n\nI would suggest making the item build off Aether Wisp if you want the %movespeed. It also makes for a low-cost hybrid item (providing both AD and AP, like Trinity, but far more easily accessible). Removing the mana regeneration also makes it useful for non-mana-based AD champs, such as Shen (who loves the Phage quite a bit, and has plenty of AP scaling on his abilities).","replies":[{"poster":"Willahelm Fulber","date":"2014-08-17T04:01:49.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except the thing is, not every champion can use the ability power the Aether Whisp gives effectively.  It *would* make a great low-cost hybrid item, but I want to give bruisers an item to help them recover from a lost lane, and most bruisers only scale with AD / HP.  Perhaps an AD equivalent of aether whisp?","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-08-17T04:21:39.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be reasonable, but keep in mind that mana regen is not a good stat to hand out just like that, since many champions have no use for it.\n\nIf you want an item for a losing lane, make one that can be bought in very small chunks and provides some form of utility over raw stats. The items that give the best raw stats are pricey for a reason (their gold efficiency is amazing). Since lanes that are losing tend to be reduced to farming under tower, things like CDR and resistances tend to come in hand. Perhaps a manaless equivalent of Frozen Heart?","replies":[{"poster":"Willahelm Fulber","date":"2014-08-17T06:20:16.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now I'm thinking of the old Aegis of the Legion when you speak about that, for those who don't know here's what it was like:\n\nCloth Armor + Null-Magic Mantle + Rejuvenation Bead(x2) + (some) gold\n\nIt gave a base amount of armor, MR, and hp/10, and on top of that did the passive aoe granting armor, MR, and hp/10.  It did not build into anything.\n\nFor some reason, it was automatically delegated to supports to get the item, mostly because of the cheap little pieces used to buy it.\n\nI still think a lot of my item could be used somewhere, mostly the bonus stats and building out of a \"passive\" gold income item (Return Heart of Gold to us plz rito)","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-08-17T06:27:23.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All gold income items but avarice blade have some sort of anti-csing mechanic, specifically so that only supports can take them. Any item that builds off that is going to be relegated to a support item (and therefore goes counter to your idea of an item for when you're a solo laner losing lane).\n\nWhy don't you build it off avarice blade, which is a gold item intended for AD champions, and it's really good at helping you when you're behind in gold?","replies":[{"poster":"Willahelm Fulber","date":"2014-08-17T15:21:05.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because just like Aether whips, not everyone makes use of Critical Strike.

Who exactly would buy it, when, and why? Is it a support item? Is it for ADCs? It has quite a few underwhelming or flat out wasted stats for both roles.\n\nSupports and AP champs have almost no use for the rage passive, so an alternate phage path needs to be focused purely on AD. Maybe give it a more tanky upgrade (like frozen mallet was before), to give bruisers a more appealing alternative to trinity force.\n\nTo ShadowKnight's point, maybe it could build out of Phage, Null-Magic Mantle, and Cloth Armor. That way it provides HP, armor, MR, AD, and the rage passive. Then balance those stats to keep the upgraded item cheap, but highly gold efficient.\n\nI also like this items potential to be an alternate option to Guardian Angel.\n\nIt would be nice to work in some CDR on the item, but I don't really see a way to do that without either jacking up the price (building from Brutalizer) or replacing the resistances for health (building from Kindlegem). That or just randomly tacking on 10% for no good reason other than it would be a nice stat to have. If only there were a basic item that granted CDR...","replies":[{"poster":"Willahelm Fulber","date":"2014-08-17T15:41:42.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright call me crazy but this sprung an idea, something that may ruin the entire game if it's put in, but an idea all the same.\n\nI don't have an item name for it, but it'd make a nice mid-tier item especially for this:\n\nCloth Armor + Null-Magic Mantle + 450g\n\n+20 Armor\n+20 Magic Resist\n+10% Cooldown Reduction.\n\nThis item is more on the gold efficient side, and I think it'd be a nice item to include into the game for several other reasons:\n\n-something to build against champions that force you to build split resistances (AD nidalee comes to mind, as her spells all do magic damage and some scale with AD)\n\n-something to build against lanes with similar problems (duo lane caitlyn/AP tristana support or something of the likes)\n\nI also feel it might be another item to put with Chain Vest and Negatron Cloak to make Guardian's Angel, allowing it to be readjusted but keep a similar role still.  Becoming Jesus every 5 minutes should be more expensive, IMHO.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dandere Express","date":"2014-08-16T23:18:00.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"hi","replies":[{"poster":"RitoPlsBuffAdc","date":"2014-08-16T23:29:20.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Chinese\n你好\nnei* ho/lei ho (Cantonese)\nnǐ hǎo (Mandarin)\nDutch\nhallo (informal)\ngoedendag (formal)\nEnglish\nhi/hey (informal)\nhello (formal)\nFrench\nsalut (informal)\nbonjour (formal, daytime)\nbonsoir (formal, evening)\nGerman\nhallo (informal)\nGuten Tag (formal, daytime)\nGuten Abend (formal, evening)\nHebrew\nshalom\nhi (informal)\nItalian\nciào (informal)\nbuonguiorno (formal, daytime)\nbuona sera (formal, evening)\nJapanese\nおはよう（ございます）\nohayoou (gozaimasu)\nKorean\n안녕하세요 ahn nyeong ha se yo (formal) 안녕 ahn nyeong (informal)\nPortugese\noi, boas, olá or alô\nRussian\nPrivet!
