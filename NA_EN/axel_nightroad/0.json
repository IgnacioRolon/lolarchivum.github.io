Your health measures how long you can stay in a fight, how long you can dive a tower, etc. So in this sense, No champion is truely Resourceless.","replies":[{"poster":"Celeste Benal","date":"2015-03-17T18:51:57.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I don't disagree that sustain is relevant, the sustain granted by innate HP regen is completely outclassed by every other form of healing in the game.\n\nFor example, Warwick's HP/5 at level 18 is a mere 22HP, while his base HP is 2259. Its less than 1% of his base HP pool. So it would take 513.4 seconds to fully regen his entire HP pool. That's 8.55 minutes.\n\nNow lets look at Braum, someone that builds HP and regen as a matter of course with Face of the Mountain, a recommended item for him. At level 18, he has 2055 base HP and a regen rate of 25.2 hp/5. Add {{item:3401}} for +500 HP and +100% regen. That puts him at 2555 and +50.4 HP/5, which is about 10HP/second. That comes to 253.47 second to fully regen. 4.22 minutes.\n\nAdd in a {{item:3065}} . +400 Health, another 100% regen for a total of 200%, which is then multiplied by 20% for a total of 240%; and you get 2955 and 85.68HP/5 or 17.136 HP/sec.\n\nThings get a little more interesting when you stack a {{item:3083}} because of its 3% of max health regen out of combat. Also +800 health. Add that in and we're getting 3755HP. Redoing the math we get 200% base regen (75.6HP/5), 3% of max health (112.65 HP/5), and all of that multiplied by 20% for 90.72+135.18=225.9hp/5 or 45.18hp/s.\n\nHP regen is a joke in all but the most heavily HP-stacked builds. {{item:3153}} 8% HP shred completely counters those. Riot could remove every instance of it from the game and no one would ever notice, with the sole exception of ability heals.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-17T17:58:57.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol someone is very much underestimating the hp regen stat","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Der Lindwurm","date":"2015-03-17T18:08:03.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes I think they really need to just nuke everything and start over.
