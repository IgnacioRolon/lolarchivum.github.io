I had gotten the infinite loop glitch. Where its says its trying to patch but then goes to an older version, and it then couldnt do that. I then closed out of league of legends and said my file had been corrupted. So i was like ok. So I uninstalled it, and Reinstalled it. Hoping that it would work. Well that was a mistake. Because when i booted it up. It came up with the words. THE CLIENT UPDATE HAS BEGUN. Once I clicked play. The game completely shut down. I tried this multiple times but ever time the game shutdown. I tried using the HexTech Repair Tool but that didnt seem to help. All im sad about is missing the Urf weekend. If anyone knows how to fix this bug. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-14T22:48:55.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, no worries about missing ARURF. It's up throughout the week as well.\n\nWhen that client keeps disappearing upon clicking Launch, it sounds like it might not have all the right admin privileges in order to launch the updated client. Run through our guide on [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) and let me know if that gets you back on the Rift.","replies":[{"poster":"XinoHusk","date":"2017-08-14T23:43:27.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It didnt work","replies":[]}]}]}
