I&#039;ve been on a 6 game win streak with him and honestly he&#039;s so bursty and has loads of survivability and mobility in fights. And there&#039;s barely a situation his ult won&#039;t secure a kill or even save his life with the knockback. Even then if you can&#039;t team fight, he&#039;s a pretty viable splitpusher with how hard he clears waves and takes turrets.","replies":[]}
