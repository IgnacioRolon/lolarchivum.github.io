Hard CC.\n\n> once he has PD you are not going to ever fight him again.\n\nThat's why you camp a Yasuo during laning phase, to keep him behind from getting PD and whatever early on in the game. Not even that, when he does have PD, if you're having a difficult time dealing with him, just have your team rotate to your lane and just push. If a teamfight breaks out, hard CC the Yasuo and just delete him. I've said this time and time again. Yasuo is all about high damage output along with high mobility.
