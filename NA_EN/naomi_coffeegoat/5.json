Akali according to champion.gg has a 53% winrate among people who've played her for over 125 games. 52% if it's mid akali. The point is that being skilled at akali sadly doesn't make her particularly good. \n\nEver try playing her in team ranked?

She's better in low elo, true, but she's not exceptional. I have yet to see an akali that does much more than get a bunch of kills. More often than not they starve their team of kills instead of going for objectives.\n\nHence, she's not all that amazing in low elo; she's not freelo in low elo like people assume.","replies":[{"poster":"xShiNjiNx","date":"2015-12-28T03:22:41.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again you are basing this off of your ability to play her..","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2015-12-28T03:32:18.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xShiNjiNx,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lrmLOLQX,comment-id=00020000000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-28T03:22:41.996+0000)\n>\n> Again you are basing this off of your ability to play her..\n\n47% winrate, 52% winrate with 125+ games in plat+, 1.28% playrate.\n\nI think all of these are purely my own ability yo play her amirite.
