Its been around 5-6 weeks, and I realize that it will take time but I was hoping that we could get an update on when you think transfers will be back? I haven't spent any more money on Riot Points due to the currency difference and such which is really unfortunate given I seriously wanted the new Jinx skin. Would a riot member give us an update on when the transfers could come back up?{{summoner:12}}  {{summoner:-1}} {{summoner:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-10T21:18:51.946+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does look like HollyMonster was able to give another update in the [**Transfer Service Update**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/rlu6awv4-transfer-service-update) thread recently!

Their most recent update stated that it probably won't be here until late January to early February, and that it would have a discounted price for a while when it does become available.","replies":[]}]}
