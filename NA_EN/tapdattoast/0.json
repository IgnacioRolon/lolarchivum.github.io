It also will get about 60% through or so, and then will just randomly start over. It's starting to get really frustrating, and i dont know what to do at this point. I've tried using the Hextech repair tool, just to try, and still the same problem persists.\r\nPlease Help,\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-02T20:55:40.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this the first time you're installing League or is this a patch you're trying to download?
