The problem comes from Adobe flash and the hardware acceleration feature and I need to know how to turn that off somehow. About a week ago I noticed whenever I would try to put a youtube/twitch/etc. video into full screen, or load into a game of league (everything else in the client works fine) it would crash my system and give me the black screen of death. Now, I have fixed the issue with youtube and I did that by disabling hardware acceleration via chrome settings, however the problem is still there with league, obviously.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how to fix this? Any ideas are welcomed.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-04T17:12:07.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Flash doesn't have any impact on the game itself, and wouldn't be causing this issue.  Unless you're getting a specific error when you say crash, the black screen problem is usually a network failure that can't download any assets for the match.  In this case, you should go over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your network is able to reach the game server without issue.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Penalty","date":"2017-04-04T17:28:51.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I managed to fix it! For now atleast. I did a few different things so im not sure exactly what did the trick. I turned off that game bar thing, I uninstalled a few windows updates, and I also messed around with adobe flash.\n\nThank you for your help though! I appreciate it.","replies":[]}]}]}
