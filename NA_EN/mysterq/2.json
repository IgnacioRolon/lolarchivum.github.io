It's actually a very simple concept if you can think about more than what is directly in front of your face.  The point of a round-robin style tournament is so everyone plays everyone and the ones with the most victories advance.

It was all up to if SKT wanted to win or not. not just simple c9 won more or lost more games.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"fox only fd","date":"2017-10-16T00:14:34.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been wanting SKT to win for a while now.
