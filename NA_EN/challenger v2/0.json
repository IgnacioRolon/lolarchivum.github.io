Ever since I got the 14 day suspension I made it my life goal to make others experience what I had to go through all this days.. So I did the same as those other trolls who purposely did certain things to bait you.. I manage to 14 day ban or possibly permanently banned other players accounts. This is your perfect system riot. This people that I got banned are most likely innocent players who got fked over by trolls. Now that same troll will play again and get others players banned abusing the same &quot;Im a bad player and ACTING nice in chat while baiting a player to flame them when they are clearly inting on purpose to force someone to rage&quot; I have done my research on youtube and google on how players get banned in the first place.. I notice that trolling is allowed. The system doesn&#039;t pick it up..\r\n\r\nTrolling = Makes your team rage = Report team mate raging at you with toxic 99.9 percent of bans = You banned an innocent ally for your trolling. That&#039;s what happened to me. And you guys made fun of me.. Now look at other thats I successfully got banned. In my eyes they are innocent.. I just BAITED them out by using methods such as ping spamming and not playing at my optimal level and acting nice in chat while barely talking in chat at all.\r\n\r\nFix your System riot. Or else you might create more players like me.. I ain&#039;t the first. Pretty sure there is thousands of players doing this method.\r\n\r\nThanks for putting me down Forum players. Now I&#039;m doing Riot games a favor by baiting bans. then you guys will blame the guy who got banned for being Toxic and letting the troll get away as usual.

I report players who are talking to their friends. And get them banned as well. It's so easy to abuse this system is not even funny.  And I'll never become bad. When I took the challenge of playing rank all I did was go up.. Still to this day I have never ever being unable to climb. So technically I can hit Diamond - Master - Challenger tier if I dedicate more time. I already played enough games to develop insane mechanics. In which most of you won't see because I'll play at a bronze V or Plastic level. To make sure people on this forums who are usually bronze and silver to rage even more. And hopefully get their accounts banned. I'm not breaking the rules.. Than again is hard to detect a troll.\n\nI highly recommend you guys watch videos on how to do this stuff. You will get a huge laugh getting a message that you successfully fucked someone over. That 3 man duo probably had a blast suspending my account after inting and cursing at me. So I obviously curse at them back. But they ended up winning due to me not reporting them for everything they did to me. Awesome system right.  \n\nI'm pretty much a Jensen type player. Minus the DDOS part. But I play solely to win and not play for fun as most of you people play this game for. I don't care if it's a normal game. I can tell when someone is bad, in which I would avoid toxic behavior. Unless I obviously know I'm getting trolled heavily and being cursed at by other players. \n\nThe player that got banned reminded me so much of myself. His words were \" I'm getting trolled by this Orianna (true)\" I was infarct trolling and got his account banned when he couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't help but laugh at his misery that I had cause. We in the end suffer the same fate. He will probably become one of me. Until I eventually phase out and move on to destroying rank games. And fully committing myself to the ranking life like most pros.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-12-10T15:19:50.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Challenger V2,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=BW6vZmIk,comment-id=0003000000010000,timestamp=2017-12-10T06:37:13.901+0000)\n>\n> Not only that.

That doesn't make any sense. If you are saying that I won't see you playing like a challenger player because you are intentionally playing worse, then what I said before holds true. It takes consistent practice to play that good for long periods of time otherwise your muscle memory begins to decline or fail to keep up with those around you.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Challenger V2,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=BW6vZmIk,comment-id=0003000000010000,timestamp=2017-12-10T06:37:13.901+0000)\n>\n> I highly recommend you guys watch videos on how to do this stuff.

Awesome system right.  \n\nThe proper response to someone cursing at you is to mute them and report them at the end of the game. The natural response isn't to curse back, if it were then you would see a significantly higher percentage of the player base being banned. And again, if you can bait someone into raging at you then they would have done it eventually over someone who is simply a lower skill level than the person you are getting punished, meaning all you are doing is getting them punished a little sooner.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Challenger V2,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=BW6vZmIk,comment-id=0003000000010000,timestamp=2017-12-10T06:37:13.901+0000)\n>\n> The player that got banned reminded me so much of myself.

He probably won't do the same thing you did because it is a fairly rare thing to happen. If it was even a remotely normal thing for people to do I probably would have come across someone doing it by now (besides the people like you who talk about doing it on the forums).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Negativity","date":"2017-12-10T09:31:50.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Challenger V2,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=BW6vZmIk,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2017-12-10T05:59:03.576+0000)\n>\n> You forgot the part that I now get players banned for things that I did on purpose to lower the chances of us winning the game.

Nothing better to do?\n\nBecause I have been Ban baited many many times by trolls. So I will make it my job for riot to realize that their system needs to change soon. I didn't even create this. I've learned after noticing most of my ban reports came from a guy purposely trolling.. The guy that I possibly got banned reminded me so much of me. But in the end he pays the price, even though he in ways is actually innocent just got baited. But according to riot I'm a nice guy doing the lords work.\n\nSadly he said a major key factor as \"kys\" those were the words from my last current victim. I knew that word will get him in big trouble. Personally I didn't want to do it. But I had to just to change riots rules. They don't understand that people like me and others or possibly the majority come from players who DO NOT CARE ABOUT THIS GAME. While extremely competitive players like me get banned for try Harding and being to communicative and serving a 14 day suspension for that. Maybe you send a ticket to riot to help them fix this broken system? It's clearly unfair. And every thread I saw here related to a player being banned is usually attacking the original poster. So now I will show myself as that suspected \"troll\" who actively looks to find victims to report. I am the creator of their rage. I don't think theirs a thread about this. So I'm probably going to be the first.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-12-10T05:40:49.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"English is not your first language.\n\nSucks for you that you were stupid enough to get yourself banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nerak23","date":"2017-12-11T01:05:44.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP, I remember you !","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2017-12-11T00:56:56.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"congratz. you understand a system that i think i last saw in use 4 years ago.\ni hope you figure the actual system out faster lol\n\nps: hate me all you want but sadly he is right.\nreddit proved this enough times. remember \"killtaiwanese\"? this guy trolled over 15.000 games just straight running it down mid. if it wasnt for reddit bringing attention to him, i bet he'd still ruin games.\noh nvm... he does... he just made a new account...","replies":[]}]}
