But I did think perhaps more for each champion would go a long way, however hearing that individual stories have a word limit kinda crushed that thought. But the prospects of re-visiting champions quicker sounds like a step in the right direction, although I&#039;ll have to see that first to believe it. \n\nWhat I really don&#039;t like is the idea of removing the mandatory bio+colour stories for each champion LU. I know that there is an apparent plan to re-visit the Noxian champs this year, for both those that were missed recently and those who only had bio updates. But like I said already I dont like the bare minimum amount of lore each champion got from previous years and I really cant appreciate updating Leblanc, Kata &amp; Darius without there own colour story. Even if Darius is \"fine\" because he had the comic already (even tho that really shouldn&#039;t be a replacement)  and narrative are only holding back on Kata because of spoils for a future Du Couteau story. Regardless my point is, I really hope the tap isn't being put on permanent drip, meaning quicker updates but with less in them. \n\nAm I being paranoid and rash in my thoughts? Quite obviously yes, which is exactly why I would have hoped for a Nexus blog to clear things up. I even said in the past before even gameplay/blalance started doing blogs discussing their aspirations for season 8, there could be one from the narrative team as well. Even if narrative cant make promises, something to discuss more about would be better.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-02-14T21:10:35.165+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi!\n\nSo there is an upcoming Nexus post that talks more about behind the scenes of the writing folks, but until then (and understanding that it's a more broad post, rather than a specifically focused answer) - what do you suggest as an alternative?

With the recent Noxus faction update, we got the main champ of the update (Swain) with a bio and color story, but a selection of other champs only got new bios.

League is full of creativity and surprises but then so is my Steam library. When a champion, regardless of the dated/subpar execution of their awesome concept (quoting Reav3 on this one) is right up your alley and you end up having a history with them, that's when the magic happens. Most other things pale in comparison. A connection like that can make or break your interest in Runeterra.\n\nAnd Vlad fans (some of them have left League in recent years) have had plenty of reasons to despair for the future of their involvement lately.\n\n1) To start with, we got hit with one of the biggest retcons during the short lore update. Despite that, we got no consecutive lore that replaced the old one or gave us any insight as to why the retcon even happened. His current bio page even mentions the High Command, which is no longer canon (according to Interlocutioner). (To clarify, I'm cool with the retcon and apologize for being angry over it. But give us something to fan about, don't just leave us with nonexistent/contradictory lore.)\n\n2) We have no guarantee that the next Noxus lore update will change that. From what I judge by your and Interlocutioner's posts it will mainly focus on Swain's relationship with the Blood Brothers (as if they don't have plenty of content already).\n\n3) This is despite dozens of people asking for Vlad lore on these very boards, despite me posting questions and [stupidly intricate theories](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/TLG6WjbK-speculation-the-female-darkin-blood-magic-romanjewishwod-mythology) for two years now (and all of this getting highly upvoted). Surely George R. R. Martin isn't the only guy who considers blood mages interesting enough to write about? The dismissal and apathy makes people feel unwelcome.\n\nSorry if I wrote too much. I hope you find at least some of it useful or enjoyable. A more general point is, I think, that some champions are reader bait and their fans will be lore-inclined, so if you give them nothing else at least give them good lore.\n\nAnyway thanks for reading!

But overall the revisit seems like it will be slow. In fact, champions like Ekko took over a year to get their color stories. Honestly not a fan of some now some later, not a lot of people will be willingly to wait once they know how long it could take. \n\nIf they plan to revisit Zaun's lore and actually hit some key points like Jinx/Vi mystery or Piltover's C maybe feel enthusiastic? I just don't like how they just throw a little out there just to be relevant. It leads me to think just like you're stating in this thread; worried. But they've done it long enough now so they don't plan on changing. Things are still tied to releases because idk and lore just takes to long to be delivered. Well the actual lore we want to know, not about a new kingdom in the Noxian empire.\n\nI think you're expected to have thoughts like that.","replies":[]}]}
