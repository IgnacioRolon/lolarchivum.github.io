Victory is their currency, it hungers for sovereignty and thrives off conquest. They have been doing this for as long as anyone can remember. However Noxus isn't as noble as some will have you believe it to be, the inclusive Empire might be unfaltering but there is a presence of jealousy and rage among them. Deep down they realize that theyâ€™re not as fortunate like the rest of the world, which is why there is no freedom for anyone who cannot prove their worth.\n\nhttps://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/004/018/061/large/gabriel-yeganyan-noxus-town-gate.jpg?1479493125\n\nNoxus isn&#039;t my favourite region (as my heart belongs to Zaun) but no one can deny that the nation has so much more potential than any of the other regions. There are numerous narrative directions and options that have been pre-established from old lore, begging to be told anew. With many reasons for this, the biggest being that pre-retcon Noxus was the most established region among them all. More so the other regions from pre-retcon had very little to no world building to begin with, so it&rsquo;s no surprise that places like Piltover/Zaun, Demacia and _(when it eventually gets an LU)_ Bandle City will have vast differences from their former selves. However I don&#039;t think that entirely applies to Noxus, since the fundamentals of its old lore can be carried over into the new. If anything most of it just needs more context and/or follow up rather than re-imagining. \nAt least that&#039;s what I think whether or not Narrative feel the same is a different thing entirely.\n___\nOut of the 10 or so champs that need updating and lets assume only 6 of those gets an LU. Who do we think or who do we know is important enough to spearhead their nation into the post-retcon? - Always remembering that Swain&#039;s VGU has high potential for a hopefully not too distant future relaunch, which I would assume will come with its own LU as well.\n\nI have considered the following {{champion:91}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:69}} (_Girl still needs her bio update_). \nI pick these three simply on the basis that I would like to see Narrative properly tackle General Du Couteau&#039;s disappearance. How that story would play out is the Narrative team&#039;s issue. However I will admit a story focusing on kids with abandonment issues might not be the most ideal way to re-introduce Noxus but I have faith in Riot&#039;s efforts.","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2017-05-30T09:31:29.952+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, my heart rate speeds up every time I think of this.\n\nEvery, and I mean EVERY Noxian champ has a cult following of insanely loyal fans.

While I don't play Swain much in game anymore, he is by far my favorite champ lore-wise.  The guy is both a renowned general and master politician.  I'd like to see a darker House of Cards style lore focusing much more on the political side of him and much less on the military.  I want to see him slowly play his pieces and manipulate the other characters.  I actually think the stories of a lot Noxus' main characters can be told with Jericho Swain as a focal point.","replies":[{"poster":"SzGamer227","date":"2017-05-30T21:08:08.387+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Darius OTP, I can share that excitement. If you really know the grit of Swain's lore you know that Darius' own lore ends to the effect of 'Darius likes Swain and wants him in charge', which is more of an \"um ok\" moment than a powerful revelation, and I'm really hyped to see what Riot's storytellers do with this connection. Swain is definitely hinted at being a lot more influential than any current lore fully realizes, and us Noxus cultists and lore whores need the juicy details.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LordHippoman","date":"2017-05-30T18:50:35.691+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm...conflicted about the Noxus Lore update.\n\nI think it's pretty clear the intended direction for Noxus changed as League was developing.  They were the generic villain state in a lot of the earliest champs' backstories.  Need slavers for Alistar?  Noxus.  Want some people to murder Yi's village?  Noxus.  Need some people to toss Veigar in jail and drive him insane because \"lol, yordles\"?  Noxians got you covered.  Also, and I cannot emphasize this enough, because it is amazing, THEY LIVED ON A GIANT SKULL SHAPED MOUNTAIN.\n\nBut you start seeing a change in that with characters like Riven, and even Darius a little, where Noxus starts to get more nuances and traits regarding personal freedom that Demacia evidently lacked.  Probably a lot of reasons for that, wanting to make the story more complicated, fans latching onto Noxian characters like Swain or Kat, etc.  But there's still this canon tangling issue of:\n\n{{champion:50}} : \"We're the empire of personal freedom where anyone can rise up!  Also over here we have our Gladiatorial Slave Death Pits, the prison where we keep people of other species, and a monument to That Time We Genocided The Minotaurs.\"\n\nSo I'm expecting the Noxian Lore update to cut a lot of that.  They've already, as OP mentioned, made them very inclusive, which is a pretty sharp retcon from \"notoriously xenophobic\", as they were described in their old summary.  I'm guessing the slavery is getting dumped too.  I think that's good, to help make Noxus more of an interesting location and less of a generic bad guy zone.  It is going to be a retcon, yes, which is unfortunate, unless it's explained away via Swain being a less savage Grand General than Darkwill.  Still, though, there are a ton of good stories waiting to be told with Noxus and Noxian champs.  My personal picks for stuff I want expanded would be:\n\n{{champion:69}} {{champion:55}} 's Dad.  What the hell happened to Marcus?  Is he even still canon?  I hope so, that was a great unsolved mystery.  Cass is also a character I'd really like to see more of.  Her new short story on Universe paints an almost sort of benevolent vigilante side to her, which is something we haven't seen before and I'd love to hear about.\n\n{{champion:7}} The Black Rose has some awesome storytelling opportunities.  Secret government-controlling cult, maybe some unknown endgame, they're stylish as hell.\n\n{{champion:50}} .  Just...anything involving Swain.  He's such a good character, he's got his hands in everything.  He's apparently tricked the Vastaya, he's in good with the Black Rose, he murdered and schemed his way to the top, and he's gotta learn soon that he's sitting on Morde's old house.","replies":[{"poster":"Whren","date":"2017-05-31T20:33:27.471+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> So I'm expecting the Noxian Lore update to cut a lot of that.

Noxus is my super-duper favorite faction and I helped work on a lot of the current visuals for it (the angular brutalist thing, edgy color palette and all that). In my head, Noxus would never get rid of slavery, because it's not so much that they're now \"not the bad guys\", but at least in my head it's always been the place where anything can happen. You can be anyone or anything without judgement. If that means being able to hold down a legion of slaves and profit off blood spilled in the arena, you can do that. So to me the narrative shift has never been \"we used to be bad but now we're not that bad\", it's more of \"We used to be BAD AND THAT WAS THAT, but now we can also be opportunistic, greedy capitalist fucks if we want to\". Thus the Noxian response to slaves would be, well, they weren't as strong or as capable as I or they wouldn't be slaves. \n\nNo one in Noxus to me would actually believe everyone deserved personal freedom. But everyone would believe that each individual -could- have personal freedom if they were capable of it. Noxians aren't inclusive because they think everyone is a unicorn, but because if you're a Yordle you can fit through tiny doors that humans can't and therefore you are useful in some way. \n\n> The Black Rose has some awesome storytelling opportunities.

There's a really interesting divide between her views and Swain's, who seems to be willing to do anything and play as dirty as he wants to win.  I'm a big fan of that tension between characters inside of a faction.  Secretly pushing for a civil war here, but that's probably still my fanfic pipe dream.\n\nThat's also definitely a perspective on freedom/control I could see Noxus taking, so I'll have to reconsider my silly random guessing about what direction they'll take.  I didn't much consider the super social Darwinism thing, but it fits with a lot of their champs, especially Darius.  It also helps make them a stronger foil to Demacia's very rigid, nobility based system, and that's a good story hook.\n\nCongrats, by the way, on your work with the Noxian visuals, I'm a big fan of the way the outfits and buildings look really imposing without being over the top.  Everyone's not covered in spiked armor, but they still look pretty intimidating.\n\n(i still kinda miss skull mountain)","replies":[{"poster":"Whren","date":"2017-05-31T22:07:10.903+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me too! If there's any place for a civil war, I'd love for it to take place in Noxus. On one hand, an honorable battle is the only way you can judge objective prowess, but on the other hand, it also opens you up to a higher probability of losing. Which is the right path? I have no idea, and I doubt all Noxians would be unified on that front either. I'd imagine living in Noxus to be extremely stressful and taxing, but it's still the only place where your right to assert yourself (to your own detriment and/or success) is baked into everyone's belief system. \n\nIt should also be said that Demacians can afford to take the moral high ground because of all their resources. Noxians are generally fighting for survival all the time, externally and internally -- too many people, too much war, all the time, constantly. We wanted to draw statues in Noxus initially, but we decided against it. That's a Demacian thing, because they can afford to have effigies of their powerful people. Powerful people in Noxus either become very paranoid or don't last very long because someone else is always looking to topple them. So everything in Noxus constantly moves, whether it's social hierarchy, or armies, or the rise and fall of houses, and I think that's why I love the faction.\n\nRe: skull mountain --\n\nThis Mitchell and Webb skit summarizes our decision to scrap it. :3 \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1VxaMEjRU\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1VxaMEjRU)\n\nHowever, if you look closely at the Immortal Bastion, it's lines are supposed to abstractly represent skull parts.

More importantly, you need to establish how the region currently is and where it could go from here.\n\nFor Noxus in particular, their big thing internal thing imo has always been the struggle between the various ideals of what strength is. Katarina sees it as loyalty above all else, Darius as 'getting shit done', Swain as brilliant planning, LeBlanc as manipulation, etc etc. Noxus builds itself on the effectiveness of its troops more than anything else, so such an attitude makes sense.\n\nLet's go through the Noxian characters and see what Riot can do with them. (Keep in mind the point here is to show off Noxus as a nation/region, not necessarily to show us how cool a particular character is)\n\nCassiopeia is in Shurima, last I checked, and had an update there. If she does receive an update, I doubt it'll focus entirely on Noxus, given that she's largely cut out of public life.\n\nDarius is a sure-in. The guy is a major war general and the main man trying to purge Noxus of its main problem: corruption in the ranks. This makes his inclusion basically a necessity, as it would give the clearest possible picture of Noxus' current political and military affairs.\n\nDraven is a one-man show, so updating him won't tell us much about Noxus. He'll probably get updated alone to show us about the combat arenas he holds entertainments in (see Fiora for a comparable example). I could see him getting an update alongside his brother Darius, but other than that I don't see a pressing need for an update.\nAlso, we already know he will be getting touched up in the Draven update. His ego requires another patch; it's still too small.\n\nKatarina is another sure-in. She's THE Noxian champion in the old lore and imo the current one. Hot blooded and strong, but loyal to an almost fanatical degree. I've always said she's the Noxian ideal. Noxus promises its citizens the freedom to work as they choose (which Kat does) but it also wants them to have an eye for the health of the empire as a whole (Which she does). Updating Noxus without her and Darius would be like updating Demacia without Jarvan/Garen.\n\nKled is already updated, and if he needs changes it'll probably be with the full Bandle City/Yordle update.\n\nLeBlanc's got her hand in basically everything in Noxus. So she'll be updated, though it will probably center largely on the black rose rather than LeBlanc herself. It'll probably also give us some insight into Noxus' history, much like Galio's did with the introduction of petricite. If not, reference will certainly be made to her.\n\nRiven, as much as I love her, probably won't be updated here. She's very much the Exile, so she won't be anywhere near Noxus. Her update will probably come with Ionia, since her lore is probably gonna be tied with Noxus' invasion of the region.\n\nSion's already got a color story, but he has no bio, and that's a major problem for his lore page.\n\nSwain will probably be updated. He's the de facto leader of Noxus from a political standpoint, and the main figurehead for a major faction in world politics. We NEED to know what he's doing.\n\nTalon's lore is very limiting in what it can show us about Noxus.\n\nUrgot is getting a full VGU soon anyway, so yeah.\n\nVladimir...

Neither have any lore and nothing about them has been canon since before the retcon, essentially the two don't exist. Plus Morg & Kayle are integral to each other, one cannot receive lore without the other getting some too. And since the topic is of Noxus specifically it wouldn't make any sense that kayle feature in the update. Personally I wouldn't hold my breath at all.\n\nCan I just say, the fact that Morgana ever \"lived\" in Noxus is another example of the hogwash that was the old lore.
