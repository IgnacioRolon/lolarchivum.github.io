Example:  [Taliyah](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/HKcjkHjr-for-miss-maddy-taliyah-questions-answers) and [Kindred](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/rxzko0ME-kindred-spotify-playlist). Figured I'd throw my hat into the ring for the Agony we all love and desire.\n\nMost of these song choices are intended to be from the perspective of Evelynn herself, others would be more from her victim&#039;s. But keeping in mind the ideas of ecstasy and libidinous desire. The first song is probably the most accurate to new Eve that I could come up with, I&#039;m pretty proud of it TBH. SOOO looking forward to what awaits us with her lore update!\n\nOh and I don&#039;t know if I need to mention this but **some of the songs are explicit. **\nBut fuck it, we&#039;re talking about Evelynn here, of course shit is going to get explicit!\n\nAlso feel totally free to share your own thoughts on the subject as well as criticize my choice in songs, if you&#039;re so inclined to. Since it&#039;s not like a lot of these songs are going to interest everybody.\n\nhttp://68.media.tumblr.com/31c8dc645f9365595814dec9205f1fc8/tumblr_owr7k40M3p1tltr42o2_540.gif \n\nhttps://68.media.tumblr.com/654bca20de4a0d87bbaad18d3cee5493/tumblr_ownzw2J4zH1qd3oebo1_500.gif\n","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2017-10-05T18:51:29.483+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The previews are so cool, I might have to sign up for Spotify now. {{sticker:sg-kiko}}","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2017-10-05T21:47:30.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"With that in mind, perhaps I should have written up a small preview for some of the songs I chose. Give a better understand behind my logic. Keeping in mind that I still don't fully know how Evelynn works and operates within the lore, so I'm doing my best guess and I could make changes post LU.\n\n1. **A little Death- The Neighborhood:** “A little death” is the English translation of the French phrase “La petite mort” – a popular reference and euphemism for an orgasm. Obviously we're not the ones who will be enjoying ourselves. But the song is about fulfilling deeper desires in order to feel like a person, that euphoric feeling of being alive.  I would recommend checking out the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHcvtstPcto) but **BIG FAT NSFW** warning!\n2. **Black Car- Leon Else:** This is about a slick sexy figure that is enticing you in and clouding your judgement. I highly recommend checking out the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YsB_V-0aMY) for this one too, but the video is still equally as explicit as the last recommendation. The car is symbolic of alluring bait, that you can be blind to the danger you're in, and something at face value can have a whole different story behind it.\n3. **Desire- Meg Myers:** Much the same as the first song, it's about dark romance and twisted impulses. Nothing much else i can say other that it has a really sick guitar solo at the 3:40 mark (it's the best I've heard in a modern song).\n4. **Kill of the Night- Gin Wigmore:** It's just a dirty old style song about killing someone basically, again it's about luring someone into a trap.\n5. **You don't get me high anymore- Phantogram:** Metaphorically, it’s about addiction. The idea of wanting to feel something strong and doing whatever it takes to feel it again, because you know it feels good and you miss it.

I especially like the implications of track 5, since Evelynn mentions a few times in her VO how she needs _us_ to feel...\n\nHopefully Ev's official lore will be out soon!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
