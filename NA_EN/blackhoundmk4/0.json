Level 3 Team Builder always felt very positive to me.\n\nLow-level accessibility of Team Builder was apparently just a limited-time experiment that accidentally got turned back on, though.  I don't have insight into why the decision was made to bring it back to 25, but I'm sure that someone more qualified than I would be happy to answer that question.  I'll try to find one.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-05-30T02:38:39.565+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been above lvl 30 for quite some time, but I can understand why under lvl 25s would be upset.. Especially when a new champion is released it's extremely hard to get a chance to play that champ. And even if you are the lucky guy who autolocks blind pick, you risk the chance of being flamed all game.\n\nIt only makes sense for new players to get to use team builder.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-05-30T02:43:10.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shush rob.\n\nYou dirty n00b","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-05-30T02:49:48.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ih8ucuzurtoxic","date":"2015-05-30T02:25:40.737+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be really nice to have a low level team builder.  It's just really frustrating to be stuck in certain roles because you can't spam fast enough or you need to pick a certain role due to draft positioning.  I think it lends to a less rounded leveling experience and sets MANY players at a disadvantage when they get to 25-30 and ranked games.  They end up only knowing one role.","replies":[{"poster":"The Scutter","date":"2015-05-30T17:15:44.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe I don't wanna play ranked.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ubiquitous42","date":"2015-05-30T02:03:25.179+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found a pretty awesome response that Lyte posted a couple of days ago on Reddit.
