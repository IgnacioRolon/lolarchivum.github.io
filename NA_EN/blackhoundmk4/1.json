AR.P needs levels to get your champs base damage up, and items like last whisper to scale to the point it outscales AD. It is kind of niche. As a jungler you are best with AD to maximize your early game clear.\n\nIt is true jungle mobs have armor tho so it is not useless.\n\nBasically AD for early game, AR.P for scaling. (scaling AD runes do not get used ever)\n\nAs Rengar you should prefer the cooldown mastery over attack speed. 5% cdr is higher gold value than 5% attack speed. And as Rengar you are free to spam skills; besides one of your abilities gives you an attack speed steroid. That is the reason I might suggest CDR quints, even though attack speed quints are more commonly used especially as a jungler.","replies":[{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2015-05-26T12:24:06.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i used ArPen runes last season in the jungle, but this season the jungle camps are so tough that only a few junglers can get away with using them.
