Ever since then, I've been using it.\nAlthough, recently my ward skins have been acting weird.  My wards use a skin that I don't own. This little bug can be seen in the screenshot below.\nI placed two wards, side by side and one of them is a bouquet ward. I DON'T OWN THAT SKIN.\nI never even bought it. What is happening? How did I get it? What makes it even more interesting is that it only works when I upgrade my trinket to the pink ward. I honestly don't understand why it's happening. I'm just confused. A lot.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-22T17:31:53.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a known issue, and we're working on a fix!
