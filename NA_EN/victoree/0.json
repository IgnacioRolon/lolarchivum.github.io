I've had this issue in the past and it has always either gone away with time or after a few force quits and trying again. But just wondering if anyone knows the cause of the issue? I've just repaired and also reinstalled the game fresh recently and just played a few games last night on the current patch and haven't changed anything on my computer since then. So not sure what it could be. Also when I open the task manager there seems to be a few LoL processes running so maybe the GUI just isnt popping up?\r\n\r\nRegardless any help with this issue would be great. I'd hate to just have to wait it out every time this happen.\r\nThank! ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-18T17:51:40.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the patcher launches, your OS needs to give it permission to open.  If your settings are blocking access, then nothing would appear.

On further inspection I might have just got lucky again. I changed all the permissions and I'm still getting the same result at times. It's really hit and miss. Most of the time it does in fact get to the login screen but on the times it doesnt and my friends are waiting for me to play, it can be really frustrating.","replies":[]}]}]}
