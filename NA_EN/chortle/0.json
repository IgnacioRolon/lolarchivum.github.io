Like Udyr with 4 stances and Sona being able to change into 3 different forms. Well my idea for Zyra&#039;s ultimate skin is that she has 4 forms that have to do with the 4 seasons in nature. (Spring, Summer, Autumn/Fall, and Winter). Much like Sona&#039;s ultimate skin Zyra can change her form whenever she wants while she is not in combat. Zyra&#039;s appearance and particle effects for each seasonal form will have colors that go with that form; Spring: reds, greenish yellows, greens, pinks, light purples Summer: yellows, dark greens Autumn: browns, oranges, dark purples, blacks Winter: white, grey, light and dark blues\n\nAlso, Zyra&#039;s model and spell effects will NOT be the same for each form and just recolored, but each form will have different appearances.\n\nThis is my idea I have for a Zyra ultimate skin. Please give me some feedback if you think this sounds cool, would be a good idea, or just needs some tweaking.

This skin would transition based on a sort of stack system based on how many seeds she's planted. The more seeds she plants, the more the Spring skin flowers. This could be from like 0 to 10 seeds planted the transition. Then she would slowly transition into autumn with leaves progressively falling off her and her plants. Then from there it would transition into winter, with a frost effect and so on. After that it could transition back into spring with buds and leaves growing.\n\nA quick summary:\n\n0 Seeds planted - Spring\n0 - 10 Seeds planted - Zyra and her plants begin to flower\n10 - 20 Seeds planted -  Zyra and her plant's leaves change colours\n20 - 30 Seeds planted - Zyra and her plant's leaves start falling off as a frosty effect begins\n30 - 40 Seeds planted - The frost slowly dissipates and buds begin to form on Zyra and her plants, which turn into leaves.\n\nI really love Zyra but currently none of the skins really connect with me. Other champions all have at least 1 or 2 cool skins, but I feel for Zyra currently her base skin is the only one I like. An ultimate skin such as this would truly be awesome!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-05T23:13:53.430+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I can get behind this.

I feel like for Zyra's splash if you went with the seasonal theme it would be somewhat reminiscent of DJ Sona/Udyr/PFE. Here's an example:\n\nSeason Zyra Skin Splash (4 splashes). It would basically Zyra with her Thorn Splitter and Vine Lasher plants beside her. Possibly in the setting of a ruined town or city, long forgotten and overgrown with vines and nature. The setting and the positioning of Zyra and her plans remains the same in each splash.\n\n* Spring - Zyra and her plants bud and grow leaves\n\n* Summer - Zyra and her plants flower and bask in the sun\n\n* Autumn - Zyra and her plants change colours and lose a few leaves\n\n* Winter - Zyra and her plants have no leaves. Wintery landscape, with Zyra and her plants frosted\n\nThe animated splash would transition through the seasons in a loop. Alternatively, if that would be too intensive you could have each season be a loop on its own.\n\nIn terms of a final form, if you compare it to Pulsefire Ezreal, it could be as simple as more details and particles being added to each of her seasonal forms as she progressively upgrades her ultimate","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-08T19:29:24.963+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The animated splash would transition through the seasons in a loop.
