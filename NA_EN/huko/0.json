There's no set amount of time it takes to get into the PBE. Getting chosen really depends on if you meet the criteria our team is looking for at the time. We typically send a batch of invites out when we're looking to test something and will typically look for players that will familiar with that thing we're testing. For example, if we're testing a new tanky support champ, we may send a batch of invites out to some Taric or Leona mains so we can get some great feedback!\n____\n2. You can get a better chance to get into the PBE by *actively* playing the game and being a *positive* influence on the community.\n\nCheck out our [PBE FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top) for more details on how we select testers and how the system works.

So it was locked when the new PBE account system was launched. So the account is locked and I cannot demand an access to the PBE since my PBE profile already says I can go on the PBE and test.\n\nThe support guy (or girl) said that my account was add to exceptions and I'll get a new PBE account soon.
