But them didnt got punished of course. I explained to your customer support dude that he can have whatever opinion he wants about me but unless he shows facts and evidence of me being toxic or inting etc that will only be his opinion and cant support his argument of me being soo toxic that needs to get permaban. \n\nHe said i got past restrictions and i should have been reformed where i agree that in my past restrictions i was calling trollers idiots ,silvers etc but that has to do with my current ban that i never flamed?,?\n\nEither show real proof and not opinions that im sooo toxic that needs to stop playing league and have his

You are negative/harassing in over 25% of all your games.\n\nYou were 14-day banned not long ago, and warned that the next would be a perma.\n\nI can certainly post all of the games were in your reform card here, but you've already seen them all.","replies":[{"poster":"Almal1bre ","date":"2017-06-21T00:05:54.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"Well i did receive one only in my email, thus why i posted only this one. What my 14day has anything to do with the last one? i said in my 14day even though i still disagree since they were again trollers premades i can admit that calling them idiots silvers,trashes etc wasnt cool so i can understand somehow the 14d ban (not that these comments are any hard core rampage swearing or anything and since there is mute button they could avoid my comments pretty easily if they wanted, but they were trollers thus logical they wouldnt care about the game(nor i would these comment if they didnt troll) and only how to waste everyones time involved)\n\n But in my last ban that made it perma i didnt even use any insulting characterisms , i only typed the truth of what was happenign and as u know truth hurts. So if i got banned because of simply negativity then all players  in that game should be banned as well since i wasn't talking alone obviously. Not to mention the justice behind this \"negativity\" and how it is determined since from your system i can tell that calling someone 1 time idiot seems way more logical for permaban or 14d than  the troller that comes to your lane and goes intentionally 1-12 destroying the game for all. ( and since the trollers that hard inted the game and wasted our time then in terms of your logic and system they should be even harder punished or at least get a 14d for start, which seeing by their accoutns they are perfectly fine and free to troll even more as long as they play premades and report their teammates that just try to play the game.)\n\nP.S i updated the chat logs i saw in my banned acc. Still no flame ,How are these chat logs even available for a permaban>? All i see are just troll flamers premades wasting all of our time and group reporting me after game.(as well as maybe a few buthurt enemies that couldnt handle that trollers wasted their time)\nYou could simply said then don't use chat at all in your last warning  before the perma, since i didnt flame and only typed what i was actually seeing and the  whole truth nothing else. Yet i get permaban for typing  to troll inters that didnt even get a penalty for wasting our time.

What my 14day has anything to do with the last one? i said in my 14day even though i still disagree since they were again trollers premades i can admit that calling them idiots silvers,trashes etc wasnt cool so i can understand somehow the ban (not that these comments are any hard core rampage swearing or anything and since there is mute button they could avoid my comments pretty easily, but they were trollers thus logical they wouldnt care about the game and only how to waste everyones time involved)\n> \n>  But in my last ban that made it perma i didnt even use these characterisms. So if i got banned because of simply negativity then all players  in that game should be banned as well since i wasnt talking alone obviously.Not to mention the justice behind this &quot;negativity&quot; and how it is determined since from your system i can tell that calling someone 1 time idiot seems way more logical for permaban than  the troller that comes to your lane and goes intentionally 1-12 destroying the game for all. ( and since the trollers that hard inted the game and wasted our time then in terms of your logic and system they should be even harder punished or at least get a 14d for start, which seeing by their accoutns they are perfectly fine and free to troll even more as long as they play premades and report their teammates that just try to play the game.)\n\n\n\nI agree with this guy. Bans are being given out for simply being not super duper nice to people that try to annoy you intentionally.

It isn't that hard to avoid getting banned.  All you have to do is not say anything about how someone is doing.  Giving advice is always fine, but saying \"you're bad\" and \"elo\" continuously isn't helping anyone.  Instead of calling someone trash just ask them to change their play style or tell them what they are doing wrong.  If they don't change after that then just move on.  What I have noticed is that the chat logs of people who are banned are always really long.  After the first 3 minutes of the game you shouldn't really be typing at all.  You can't last hit when you are typing.  Bottom line is, if you don't have anything useful to say that contributes to your team's chance of winning like strategy talk or calling out cooldowns then don't say anything at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Almal1bre ","date":"2017-06-21T07:10:41.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"wut ? and wut and wut lol , i agree in what you say but here we talk about something else. and we have cover the topic of typing, why is it permabannable material to type in chat if you dont flame? if it was like that then the chat should have been deactivated or limited.

It isn't that hard of a concept.  If my whole team gangs up on me I just mute everyone and afk farm until we lose.  I don't understand how it is possible to have such an issue with this that you get reported so much that you go through 4 different punishments.  I've only ever had like 3 games that when I had to mute everyone and afk farm.\n\nThis is a game I specifically remember because the mute button likely won us the game.  Evelyn came for a gank at level 3 when I was farming with Nasus.  I didn't have wither yet and the wave was close to my tower so I just ignored the gank and she ran through the enemy minion wave to give Illaoi a free kill.  I typed something like \"why\" and then she started flaming me for not helping on the gank.  It became a pissing contest for about the next minute so I decided to make use of the mute button.  Immediately after I muted her we both started playing considerably better and were even able to help each other out a couple times.  If someone is flaming you do everyone a favor and use that mute button.\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2419008730/209287161?tab=overview","replies":[{"poster":"Almal1bre ","date":"2017-06-21T15:20:15.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You keep saying to press mute and im telling you since i didn't flame why shouldnt i use to just type in chat to tell the truth?
