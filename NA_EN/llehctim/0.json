They&#039;ll stop trying altogether because of the psychological deterrent of simply having Zhonya&#039;s possibly off cooldown. \n\nIt wont gimp your damage that much, being dead gimps it a lot more, and the enemy ADC will be vulnerable to being 100-0&#039;d by your own team. \n\nCheap. Armour. CDR. An active that solves their one major weakness. Even the AP isnt wasted since they usually have at least 1 AP scaling ability. \n\nAm i missing something or is it simply because it&#039;s considered taboo for no real reason? \n\nEdit: Apparently this attracted the wrong audience. It was aimed at the people who think ADCs are weak (lol), the rest of us know they're still mandatory and have been for 6 years straight.

Most mages can unload their spells, zhonyas, and provide almost the same amount of damage since they did their burst up front and needed the extra few seconds for their CDs anyway.\n\nAnd while many adcs have some AP scaling somewhere in their kit, in many cases it's not in something they'd be using as a primary source of damage (which is usually AAs anyway), so while it's not 100% useless, it's very impractical.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-15T21:29:15.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it is a total waste of gold, and assassins can be negated by proper positioning.
