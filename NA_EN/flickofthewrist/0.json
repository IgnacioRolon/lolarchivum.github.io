Well, here's your chance! To celebrate the release of Xayah and Rakan, we're highlighting some of your best plays in a unique montage video that will be featured in the client.","url":"http://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/re/play?utm_source=LeagueClient&utm_medium=OverviewTier2Pos1","image":"https://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/pages/2017/april/eu-replay/banner.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I logged in League today, I came across the \"RE/PLAY\" news. Basically - people can send their best plays for a Montage which would be featured in the Client.\r\n\r\nMy question is - who will be the video editor? Can a bunch of enthusiasts hop in?\r\n\r\nI'm a recently-graduate Motion Designer with high experience in game montages (have created the official Game Trailer of S4League + a bunch of CS 1.6 videos while I was in the most successful Kreedz studio at the time) - if there is any opportunity for me to create an edit which RIOT would feature, I do not want to miss that chance!\r\n\r\nI searched for RIOT's e-mail, but the best way for me to contact them so far is this thread.\r\nDoes anyone know where I can contact those in charge of the video project?\r\nWhich discussion would this thread apply to? \r\n\r\nReally would appreciate the help!\r\n\r\nPS: Obviously, I am aware that a video editor has already been assigned. I'm simply eager to join any further video-editing projects, in case there are any.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-24T04:47:05.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's pretty awesome bro, congrats on graduating!!!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nHonestly, I don't have much info on where you should go or who to speak to, but you might be able to get a start by hitting us up via e-mail at info@riotgames.com. We do some work with our Summoner's here and there, and who knows, maybe you'd be a great addition to the team sometime!","replies":[]},{"poster":"elduris","date":"2017-04-23T18:24:02.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would suggest looking at their [Careers page](http://www.riotgames.com/careers), as chances are it'll be an internal Riot team working on this project.","replies":[]}]}
