It’s been a while since we last shared what the team’s working on, and now that we’re wrapping up Tristana’s update I’d like to preview some of our current projects and the thinking behind them.  \n\nIf you prefer the tl;dr, we’re currently working on a visually-focused update for Kassadin as well as a more general Ryze update.  We’re also still cranking away on Poppy’s comprehensive update.  Read on below if you’d like details straight from the designers!\n\nTHIS IS THE DISCLAIMER - Keep in mind the following does not represent a comprehensive list of what’s on our radar or even being worked on. Everything mentioned below is tentative, not tied to dates, subject to change, delay, cancellation, obliteration, etc. \n\n**Tristana**\n\nIn case you missed it, [Tristana’s update](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-update/tristana-update-rocket-jumps-live) is now live! As with all our projects, we’ll be monitoring Tristana past her release for any final tweaks we may need to make. She’ll also be getting a new splash sometime in the next few patches. \n\n**Kassadin**\n\n*Art thoughts by Riot Tokkelossie*\n\nConfession time. I've been a massive Kassadin fanboy since the first time I played him. The misunderstood hero who turns the dark power of the Void back on itself, fighting fire with fire, standing alone against a force that could threaten all of Runeterra - how awesome is that? \n\nI think we can all agree though that Kassadin's visuals could do a lot more to live up to his awesome premise.  As one of the original 40 champions, he's been left behind as League’s visual quality bar has continued to rise over time.  \n\nUnlike some older champions, Kassadin has always had a distinct personality and theme to his visuals, and we definitely want to maintain those traits in the course of this update.  Our approach has very much been to take what Kassadin is, identify the most important elements in his visual design, and then refine things to match LoL's current standards.  Kassadin's latest splash did a great job of following that approach and served as a useful reference point for our work.  \n\nWe’re also focused on improving Kassadin’s in-game read.  His original model has such a strong contrast between the black costume and its white trim that details become difficult to discern at in-game scale.  Nudging his color scheme in ways that improve his in-game read without changing his identity will allow us to really highlight Kassadin’s key visual elements and make him pop on the battlefield.  \n\n**Ryze**\n\n*Art thoughts by IronStylus*\n\nRyze lives in a very unique space within League of Legends. He’s not a standard fantasy wizard with white hair and a robe. He doesn’t cast magic from a wand. He doesn’t cast spells from incantations. We want to make sure his update communicates these traits and reinforce his uniqueness. With that in mind we plan to keep his major reads (blue skin, big scroll, spell book) while streamlining and update some of his details.\n\nWith Ryze’s update we want to better convey that he’s a master of his magic (and running) in a way that’s kinetic and physical, almost punching his magic out in the same way an expert martial artist expresses his skill. Communicating the runic element is also important, so glyphs, runes, and other forms of character-based effects are key factors. \n\nSince we’re solidifying Ryze’s identity as a solitary and nomadic mage who’s on the run, we want to make sure that’s reflected in his appearance by playing up a more rugged feel to his gear and clothing. Again, we want to remain faithful to his major reads while injecting a little more grit that shows off his resilience as a hardened spell-slinging battlemage. \n\n*Gameplay thoughts by RiotRepertoir*\n\nRyze’s kit has a strong identity, but it’s pretty binary based on his distance from you. Get too close and you’re getting hit by the full force of his “always on” kit, every time. This limits our ability to tune him as he’s an absolute terror when his numbers are too strong. Thus, our overall goal is to preserve his particular identity as a \"tanky, in-your-face mage\" while focusing his power into windows that create more relevant decisions for both Ryze and his opponents.  \n\nEssentially, we want to increase the highs and lows when Ryze is in a scrap - bigger wins when he’s skillful, as well as better opportunities for his opponents to interact with his gameplay. To do that, we have to build more unreliability in to his kit. Skillshots are one way to do that, with his Q the obvious candidate to become a skillshot in return for longer range. We do like Ryze’s brand of close-range mastery, so rather than turn everything into skillshots we’re building clearer power/timing windows into the rest of his kit.\n\nFinally, we want to better visualize and clarify Ryze’s power as well as what exactly he’s doing to his opponents. Some examples include better presenting his rapid-fire casting and making his E’s behavior more controllable and understandable (again, for both Ryze and his opponents). \n\n**Poppy**\n\nFear not, we’re still working on her! Check her section in last year’s [Champion Update dev blog](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-update/dev-blog-champion-updates) for the early details.\n\n-----\n\nThat’s it for now. We’ll be back with more updates as these projects (and others!) move closer to completion!","replies":[{"poster":"Hellhammer","date":"2015-01-30T23:10:58.871+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yay Poppy gets a mention!!!, I bet the team assigned to her rework is burning the midnight oils trying to come up with how rework her.\n\nI check the news twice a day and the boards constantly for anything about poppy.\n\nhurray!{{champion:78}}","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2015-01-30T23:27:20.797+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"She's currently in pre-production, I may or may not be personally working on her.. cuz.. ya know, armor.","replies":[{"poster":"Lockbox","date":"2015-02-02T18:10:53.759+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think my biggest question about everything changing with Poppy is \"Will she still be the 'serious' Yordle?\" Will her over all tone as the Iron Ambassador still be \"Jokes?

When the Karma rework was released, so much of the original champion had changed (removal of her fans, completely new voice over and altered background lore) that the original champion was considered \"gone\" by her fans.    The Traditional skin was used as a way to keep those fans (as it were) from poo-pooing on the entire rework.

The projects can take months to do (maybe a year). They're heavily comprehensive. They're often used for the worst offenders in our game, often characters that need complete gameplay, art and thematic rebuilding, sometimes one of those aspects, sometimes all. The Sions, Tarics, etc. We slot and fantasy slot these far in advance.\n\n**The opportunities** include lower scope Model & Texture Updates (MTU's) which aren't planned quite as far out, and are usually jumped on when we see an open slot, or a new gameplay update has been cracked, or we have the ability to borrow art resources from another team. Also when they're themeatically \"safe\". Nasus was done in this way. The legendary skin enabled his VU. These MTU's are usually built on what we have, existing rig, tweaked animations, etc. The reason being is that if we made them as high scope as full large-scope projects, you wouldn't see them for a year or more. We simply can't accomodate doing 8 Sions a year. \n\nWhile yes, a lot of these champions could benefit from complete tear-downs, we have great opportunities that present themselves. In Kassadin's situation, Tokkelossie, being a big Kassadin fan, had made a completely new model on his own time. So boom, we had a start. Additionally, we started working with an outsourcer that has proven really, REALLY effective in making quality models, and we've begun to leverage them on skins, especially existing skins for VU's. The fast ramp-up can be attributed to having the existing new base model, some work the skins team had been doing, his VFX being in a good place, and a 3D external partner able to handle both reconcepting and remodelling the existing skins allowed us to jump on this.\n\nWould it be nice to burn everything down and rebuilt it from scratch? Sure, if we can do that in an optimal time. We could knock down the house, re-pour the foundation, build a new frame, etc. But sometimes, because the opportunity to save time and resources is there, we build on top of a workable foundation with the frame intact.","replies":[{"poster":"9Q1IMGTQP3","date":"2015-01-30T22:55:46.465+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":13,"body":"I wanted a simple **yes** or **no** answer.

Your champ updates, are BADASS. You did an AMAZING job on nasus, and a very good job on tristana, sivir, sion, etc. Whats the one thing that all of them have in common? They all had visual updates. Now its time for me to be not so nice.\n\nThis is NOT a visual upgrade. This is a MTU + slight ability changes. \n\nFirst up, the model: You guys didnt do bad on this. You made him more updated, and look better. But, you did stick to the classic look of him. Which is not a bad thing, but I think due to that, there was no \"Wow!\" factor or \"Awesome\" factor. You guys didnt do anything to him that made him look like what he is, a void badass. He is actually quite small if I should say so myself.\n\nAbilities. Abilties mean a lot to me, they show the power of the character. And, to be honest I see a TINY difference. Like the slightest bit.\nQ: His q is his 2nd \"main\" (Besides riftwalk) ability, and yet I see no difference. Its slightly darker than before.\nW: I actually do think you did a good job on nether blade. A cool animation. Even though I think the stabbing could really use some sort of effect on them. Like a orange/purple wave goes over the target he attacked.\nE: This was the most fail part of the abilities. The Q at LEAST had some after effects when it hit the target. Force pulse literally didnt change, when it has potential to look like a cool ability.\nR:Being his \"main\" ability, I think you could have done a little better. Its his main part of his kit. I dont have any suggestions as to how, but come on its an ultimate ability. Do something.\n\nThe animations (attacking, moving etc.) I have mixed feelings about. You did good on the normal attacking animation, I liked that. Moving looks a bit better, but like most of the kit, you could have done a bit more. When hes moving, the guy isnt intimidating to me.\n\nAnd those of you who respond \"kass looks so much better now not a blob of blue\". You literally just described a MTU. Because this is what I see it as. Nasus for example. Looked just as bad as Kassadin live. He got a Voiceover, Completely redone abilities, Major model update, and to top it all off, got a legendary skin.\n\n\nPlease riot if you have ANY respect for ANY Kassadin fans, I would take this project back in and do a little bit more work on it. Kassadin DERSERVES IT. 3 years without a skin, Constant nerfs on abilities (Oh and I mean constant.), and has just been looking godawful for a long time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2015-01-31T10:09:45.795+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the champion update schedule on the support page is irrelevant again?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BabyBaluga1118","date":"2015-01-30T23:26:40.586+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought Poppy was next in line to be re-released? has that changed? can we expect her before summer?","replies":[]}]}
