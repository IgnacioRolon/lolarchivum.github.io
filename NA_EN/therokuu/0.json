I recovered my password and everything seems fine here on the website and forums but when i go to login to the game client it keeps giving me \"Username or password\" is incorrect. I have updated to the newest client and have restarted it multiple times. I went thru the link in the client and did a password reset it sent me too but I am still having no luck. I am also on the NA servers. if anyone else has had login issues and has a potential fix it would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-12T04:28:30.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only time you'll see that message is if your username/password combo isn't correct for the server you're trying to log into. It looks like you were able to get signed into the support site alright since you were able to post here, so let's first make sure that you have the NA region selected on the client when you try to sign in. \n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/5daf3bb2990b5a0507aaa7cfa2f8be58.png","replies":[{"poster":"TheRokuu","date":"2017-05-12T05:20:18.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aye! Didn't even know I had the option to pick the region. Just assumed it was picked up by my IP. All good now. Thank you so much for the quick response!","replies":[]}]}]}
