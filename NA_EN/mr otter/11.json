Been playing the game since Season 2. Bring alot of in-game knowledge to the table. I am trying to climb efficiently and I've just recently started taking the game alot more seriously and playing to get better. If you are interested in having me on your team feel free to add me \nIGN: Mr Otter\nI have a very versatile champ pool for the top lane. I specialize in tanks/bruisers. But can also play AP lanes like Rumble, Liss, Kennen.\nAlso I know in my op.gg it doesnt look like I play a whole lot of top lane But I was an adc main/top secondary for awhile in season 6-7 But have changed to top lane main / adc secondary. :) ","replies":[]}
