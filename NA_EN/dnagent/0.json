Does ARAM have one yet? If not, why? Sure it's random but so is TFT. TFT has more of a RNG factor to it than skill yet there is more skill in ARAM than RNG. These auto chess games are even heavier on RNG than card games so I don't see why TFT would get a ranked mode but ARAM wouldn't.\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} Gonna use this zombie nunu because he looks like a sad Pepe in a wheelchair.","replies":[]}
