If anything, I&#039;d prefer the delay be reduced to open up more options with the ult, rather than restrict them.\r\n\r\nThis small change sublty lowers her skill cap, something I disapprove of. Food for thought.","replies":[{"poster":"Yandere Moe Girl","date":"2015-06-10T00:39:13.095+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think rather than this chage, Ori needs her allies with the ball to have it's range indicator.

I can see this being a thing for Orianna as well. Not to mention the travel speed on Q and E is pretty dang slow, so going out of range can sometimes be a faster way to get the ball back.","replies":[{"poster":"ShinTwist","date":"2015-06-09T23:11:33.506+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, the timer only exists in the first place because many people were accidentally flubbing her ult. A .25 second timer would be enough to prevent this in most cases as it is, since the average ping is around 100 or so in Silver and lower as divisions go up, it's only in bronze that a longer timer would really be needed to prevent miscasts of her ult. (I say, having flubbed her ult with the current .5 timer, report ShinTwist for bad)\n\nThe current timer is okay, I guess, but .75 feels like it does nothing but restrict options, and I don't like that. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Reikken","date":"2015-06-09T23:34:53.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In fairness, 0.25 isn't enough because average human reaction time is 0.25.

So assuming a player has any ping at all 0.25 wouldn't be long enough, at 200 ping the absolute minimum reaction would be 0.45 sec, so 0.5 seems reasonable.\n\nPersonally I feel like a self only click-back sound would be a better solution, as people can react more quickly to sounds. The average auditory reaction time is only 0.17, so if there were a sound on the leash range being exceeded people would be able to react more quickly and not attempt a late ult.","replies":[{"poster":"ShinTwist","date":"2015-06-11T17:56:00.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ping already accounts for the trip there and back from the server.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-06-10T09:24:58.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:61}} is easily one of the most balanced champions in the game. She has a high skill base, high skill cap, you can carry with her but it's hard and you can shut her down. She has very defined strengths and very defined weaknesses and I don't see a reason to touch her. Maybe they could give her like, 575 from 550 range so she can poke with her passive more easily but other than that she's not by any means an underpowered, overpowered, broken, gimped, etc champion and shouldn't be touched aside from her range a bit. The range wouldn't be a huge buff but it would definitely make it feel safer and more reliable to use your passive outside of straightforward combat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-06-10T12:47:24.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can \"master\" ori all you want, but if some overeager tank runs 2steps too far while you activate that perfect ult you still will be punished for it. a skilled ori doesnÂ´t run into situations it would be favourable to cast the ult on herself in the firstplace, and if that situation somehow occurs you need to shield yourself anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"ShinTwist","date":"2015-06-10T16:04:08.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Neg, there's already a grace period in place to prevent that from happening, and sometimes moving back is faster or E is on CD.\n\nThe change in the patch notes isn't a huge one, but it does nothing except dumb Ori down for no good reason.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShinTwist","date":"2015-06-10T00:36:51.448+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bump for visibility.","replies":[{"poster":"ShinTwist","date":"2015-06-10T04:22:20.582+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"buuuuuuuuump.\n\nMeddler pls.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-06-10T14:34:56.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumping does not work you scrubbydubdub \n\n<3","replies":[{"poster":"ShinTwist","date":"2015-06-10T16:01:47.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It certainly does if you browse by most recent, pleb. :p","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SmurfOfYixuan","date":"2015-06-11T18:02:16.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All they need to do is make it so if you use your Q again before 0.75s ends it will immediately reset the ultimate cooldown. 2 birds in one stone.
