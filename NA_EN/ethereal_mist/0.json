Idk how bad some people have to be to even lose to a yasuo, let alone think that he's op anymore. Honestly, he was fine when he had warlord's  but of course the bronzies had to step in and overeact to yasuo being good again. The main problem with champions like riven and yasuo is that they do really well against bad players and something like 70% of league players are silver or below. It's extremely annoying that one of the highest skillcap champions basically isn't allowed to be seen in high level play because the noobies will flip shit if he ever gets anything resembling a buff. He has a 47% win rate right now and people still continue to complain about him... I just don't understand these people...","replies":[{"poster":"I AmNot A Person","date":"2016-01-17T02:34:57.780+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fuck Yasuo.

The ONLY problem with yasuo is that bad players can't exploit is massive weaknesses which leads to him not being able to be buffed for high levels of play which really sucks for the actually decent players.","replies":[]}]}]}
