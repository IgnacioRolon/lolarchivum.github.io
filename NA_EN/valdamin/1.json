I reset my password, and log back in, and today i received a notification that a gift had been received by another account. I had my pay pal information saved for quicker access for payments. Is there anything I can do about the gifts that were sent out?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-07T03:10:23.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you ever think that your account has been compromised or 'hacked' your best bet is to reach out to us through our [**Account Recovery Form**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416).
