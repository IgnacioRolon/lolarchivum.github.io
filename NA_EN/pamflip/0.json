I have a 55% winrate (89W 73L) and I have started to play with silvers and mid-low golds instead of mid-low plats. Can anyone explain why it dropped and how I can get my mmr back up? Is it because I'm almost in the next division? Any help with be appreciated thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-15T20:43:16.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"MMR isn't a visible stat so it's hard to say what below or above averages might be (what you find on third party sites may not be accurate).  Also keep in mind that the borders that appear on the loading screen are from the previous season and doesn't reflect their current placement in ranked; meaning someone with a Platinum border may be in Gold today.  There could be a few factors for what you are experiencing, such as who's queuing up during that time or even someone simply having a bad day.  We have a pretty comprehensive [Matchmaking Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide) that I hope may help shed some light.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-07-17T11:05:04.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just for precision's sake, you can see the current ranking of people in your games from 3rd parties. The MMR they give may be inaccurate, but the ranking is not, at worse slightly delayed. LSI or OP.GG for instance, they show you if your opponents are in Silver 3 or Gold 4 or whatever, in addition to the MMR they estimate.\n\nSo I don't know what OP actually did, but it's definitely possible to see that you were playing against (real) Plat players some time ago -- not just people with a Plat border -- and that you are now playing against Gold player.","replies":[]}]}]}
