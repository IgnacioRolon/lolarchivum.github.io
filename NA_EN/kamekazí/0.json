Original punishment, honor lock, then honor level 0?

It makes the quest for reformation seem impossible and pointless. This could easily be remedied if it was something like....10 game restrict = honor level 1   25= honor level 0   2 week =  honor level 0 + a lock  ....just as you said.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-12-10T23:49:38.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"3~ months give or take \nto start that process up again\nfrom what I've seen","replies":[]}]}
