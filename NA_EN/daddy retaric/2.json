You seem to be implying lvl 16 or higher at that point. But at that point ho has more than 2k HP and garens q doesn't deal true damage, so it's possible with ninja tabi or guardian angel, etc that garen q wouldn't even deal that kind of damage. Also, garen can choose who is the villain and there can only be one villain. Vayne gets insane percent hp WITHOUT LIMITS OTHER THAN ATTACK SPEED, DYING, OR RUNNING. aka, she, as a super mobile, ranged champ, with self peel, can proceed that on every champ during a fight, on a basic ability.........and raheblade passive only makes it stronger. Stop ying and pretending g that garen is even comparable for the sake of your argument. To make it worse, if gp is fed enough in the late game to be villain, he's probably a decent gp with triforce and some crit, in which case he will totally kite, barrel, troll, and delete garen because garen had no outplay mechanics without flash...unlike vayne","replies":[{"poster":"aaaustindestroy1","date":"2019-02-03T23:40:06.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen cannot choose the Villain.

Guinsioo's is(was) the prime hybrid stat stick with high numbers for the gold, gated behind the stacks.\nHaveing phantom hit in that mix aswell is just to much power from a single item once it's stacked. especially be cause all the AS it gives works as an extra multiplyer for on-hit and phantomhit. It's like giveing old IE(50% increased crit**damage**) also a 50% crit chance on top of the 80 ad, and maybe throw in some AS for fun aswell...","replies":[]},{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2019-02-04T00:42:12.305+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rageblade is nerfed to fucking hell.
