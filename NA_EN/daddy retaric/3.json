Vayne players already abuse of the dumb item called Guinsoo, making her 3 hit passive almost non existent late game, can we please at least tone down the damage to it's original value ?

He have to invest in 2 item to do so wich is black cleaver and blade of ruined king and even then, he is dealable with.

Want to know something? Vayne is killing you with her regular autos way before she would with her W procs. Building armor and HP is highly efficient against a vayne. Also... if a lucian is being bullied in lane by anyone that isn't named Caitlyn then that lucian is trolling or has no idea how to play him.","replies":[{"poster":"Daddy ReTaric","date":"2020-01-14T17:56:36.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZephyrDrake,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oL7bXcLu,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2020-01-14T03:10:48.959+0000)\n>\n> If the only reason a bruiser/tank is made useless is due to a vayne I am sorry to say this but they aren't very good at it to begin with considering most tanks can just jump into her face and bruisers can easily get in range of her to smash her face in.

When you play a melee top lane and someone pick a ranger, it will suck but you can mostly itemize and out play them at a point and can still manage to win lane. Not against a Vayne. Even if Vayne is a total monkey, she will have upperhand regardless of what you do. You can stomp her but she will eventually crush you. Lucian or whoever you pick ranged top , if you stomp them , they basically dont ever become a problem. Vayne does. Fiora share the % true damage but she have counterplay with it. What counterplay we have with Vayne? Dont get in her range? Cool I get zoned for free as her W is a toggle...the damage need to go down so she go back to the lane she belong, aka bot lane.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2020-01-15T03:28:55.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iSennª,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oL7bXcLu,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2020-01-14T17:56:36.484+0000)\n>\n> I play top lane adc and support .
