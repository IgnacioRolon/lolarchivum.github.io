Normally I just ignore it and move on. But for some odd reason, me screwing up my first time in the jungle on a champ I don't play in a role I've never played just made me the target from not only my team but from the enemy team as well. I didn't leave that game, but I literally had to walk around outside for about 2 minutes and calm the hell down before I kept going. I REALLY just don't understand why people have to be so mean all the time. Maybe I'm just too weak willed for LoL now. What with college, job, rent, and , well, real life, I really wonder if this is basically a high school game now. I could play it all the time back then, but now it just doesn't seem to work as my fun time anymore. Even the normal games are filling me with dread just to play. This game has become my new WoW though in the sense that I quit for a bit just to come back. It took some SERIOUS willpower to finally realize I don't need the game. I really hope I can get some of that willpower, cause I need to realize again I don't need a video game again.","replies":[]}
