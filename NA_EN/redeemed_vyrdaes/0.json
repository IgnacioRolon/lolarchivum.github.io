It's simply that not every report has a consequence. Even if someone blatantly fed and spammed profanity, if it was an isolated incident, there won't be a punishment. The other day I straight up left a game before it began in the loading screen, I didn't receive so much as a \"Hey, leaving is bad\". Why? I'm an isolated case. I never do it. Same for your reports. The ones that go through are because that person has a history. No message, no history/offense wasn't bad enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Redeemed Vyrdaes","date":"2017-04-11T13:52:05.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was more half satirical, but yeah I understand sometimes people just tilt super hard flame for an entire game and then alt-f4 and go for a walk or something.

Seems even worse since 3's has a habit of not taking 5's MMR into account and bronze/silver face off against plats and the like. Never seen so much toxicity except for when a plat beats a bronze like 'yeah learn your place'.\n\n~~I mean, Bronze V after going 7-3 in placements is a bitch too.
