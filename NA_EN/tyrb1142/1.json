On the Alpha client, it just stays at zero until an error shows up. Even when I launch the Legacy Client it comes up with the same error (at least the Legacy Client loads to 33% before failing). \nHextech Repair tool didn't help at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-21T03:38:39.981+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the flip side for this issue, between 0-33% your client is scanning the game files to see what needs to be updating. Getting an error here leans more towards a permissions issue than a connection one. Check out this [**permission guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) instead, and that should get you patching.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-21T03:36:55.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you get passed the 33% mark, your client starts to download all the new files it needs in order to fully patch. Any kind of errors at this point is a pretty good sign that something weird is going on between your network and our patching servers. The steps in this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) should be able to help you get to the bottom of it, but hit me back up if not!","replies":[]}]}
