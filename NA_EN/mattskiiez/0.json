Since you were *techinically* afk (since you hadn't loaded it yet) your team was able to issue a remake. At that point you would have already been afk long enough to be marked as a leaver, which is why you had the LPQ applied. \n\nThis does kinda suck since you didn't leave intentionally, but you not loading in quick enough still could have ruined the match for 9 other people. I'd consider updating a couple network settings to see if we can get you loaded into those matches quicker! Update your port forwarding and DNS settings by following the steps in this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and test it out in a custom/practice game first.","replies":[]}]}
