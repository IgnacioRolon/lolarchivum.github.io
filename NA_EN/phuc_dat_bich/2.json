What about the changes to Garen is making you unhappy?\n\nEdit:\n\nI read through some responses. This won't answer all questions and address, but it may get a few of them. These aren't direct quotes, but more summaries of the kinds of questions people are asking.\n\nQ: Why the W stack mechanic instead of the 20% Armor/MR?\nA: The stacking mechanic is quite achievable in your average game (120cs), and it reinforces the value of minion kills on a champion intended to be good for beginner players.\n\nQ: Why flat resists on W instead of percent?\nA: Flat synergizes better with Health stacking, and Health is present on almost all the items Garen builds. By affording him this synergy, he'll have his baseline defenses covered (lots of Health and some resists), and be able to grab an extra offense or luxury item.\n\nQ: Why does Q silence duration need to be nerfed?\nA: Having people sit in a Judgment that deals immensely more damage than it used to for basically the whole duration is insane. Shorter silence duration means more play for opponents, but also more room to pump damage into the Judgments.\n\nQ: Why do I need to put points into W to stack it?\nA: You don't, that was removed because it was tedious.\n\nQ: Why is he slowed while hitting champions with Judgment?\nA: He's not anymore. That was removed sometime earlier this week.\n\nQ: Why are you just nerfing Garen on basically every way skill?\nA: Heavy tuning requires give and take. These changes are not intended to be net nerfs to Garen, and I am all but positive they are actually very significant buffs. Most questions like this seem to be due to change aversion or misunderstanding more than anything else.\n\nQ: Why did you take the Tenacity from W? It's so boring now.\nA: Yes, it was boring before, and it's even more boring now. However, it's important that Tanks and CC supports feel good about their efforts in peeling the tanky, high damage juggernauts, because with the changes being given to them, if they're not peeled, people start dying around them fast.\n\nQ: REVERT EVERYTHING!!!!\nA: This is so clearly not going to happen, and when people post things like that, anything important to them that they are actually trying to say easily gets glossed over.\n\nQ: Why do you keep acting like Garen is difficult to peel?\nA; Garen, though historically seen as easily managed, has a few more things going for him that he didn't use to have. First, as of a few patches ago, slows don't stack anymore. Second, Dead Man's Plate gives him a lot of chase/stick later on in games. Third, Black Cleaver stacks even faster now that Judgment ticks faster. This whole package can make him substantially stickier than he used to be.\n\nQ: Why does he deal reduced damage with Judgment when hitting multiple targets?\nA: Judgment does a real substantial amount of damage, so giving it some optimization cases for Garen and opponents to play around is good for the character. Though I'm confident he won't deal too little damage following these changes, that's easy number tuning.","replies":[{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-08-07T08:24:10.919+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":8,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4GhvvrBj,comment-id=00070000,timestamp=2015-08-07T08:03:31.577+0000)\n>\n> I am the guy working on Garen.

Yeah he feels slightly stronger in the E department outside of Lane on the PBE but everything else feels far weaker. I don't even see why his E being stronger when he builds mostly Tank or is heavily punished for it is relevant to anything.\n\nI don't really even know why you gave him slight late game power, he was never picked for that nor was he picked for teamfighting. Why lower his laning, the reason he is picked, just to slightly increase his late? I really don't get it. \n\n**The Garen rework should have been handled by whoever did the Darius rework. They clearly understood the Champion and how to adjust them to fit in the game with their specific niche.**\n\nMaybe you should actually play instead of just reading numbers. More powerful in the PBE version than on Live based on data doesn't mean shit. Oh so he has a power level of 777 instead of 775. Big deal. \n\nAnd yes you are being argumentative. You are basically saying \"you would agree with me if you played him\" which is a fallacy. \"you would agree with me if you were me\" is basically your flawed argument. Stats aren't everything. Besides, nobody likes a high winrate banned champ because you guys just gut their strengths and leave them to rot like Olaf.\n\nI don't think you understand what makes a champ 55% winrate. None of Garen's current changes or numbers on the PBE will make him that high of a wrinate or banrate. His laning phase got nuked by you guys and you keep nerfing his late game, the thing you seem to have a hard on for buffing. He brings nothing to a team and won't be picked even with these changes. **This isn't S1/S2 where people were bad and picked immobile Bruisers with no Utility or Damage and won with them. **\n\nBtw, please Stop insulting the Garen playerbase with your condescending tone.\n\n**You lowered his early game damage and his mid game damage to slightly increase his late game damage. You also took away a lot of his safety just to do this. I really don't see how you can see this as a buff.**\n\nI don't understand how you suddenly became incompetent. Your Ashe changes were insightful. You gave her meaningful strengths and reworked her 2 relatively clunky abilities to do so. With Garen you just stripped away safety and added a forced mechanic on his R.

When you seem upset about everything, you come across as someone that's just out there to rant rather than drive positive change.\n\nSorry, I'm just upset that Darius got a lot of positive changes specific to his playstyle and Skarner got a specific Niche and there is still no real reason to pick Garen over anyone else other than you like Garen. I didn't mean to come off as a hater, I just really want to see Garen get the same level of changes the other 3 got. \n\nHis R mechanic is a nice idea but the execution seems really illogical to me. He gets no benefit to why he was ever picked, Laning, and it doesn't seem to give him any real benefit in teamfights because he can't control it's power. \n\nHe still doesn't seem to do anything better than anyone else and from what I played most of his strengths on Live, early to mid game laning against hyper specific targets, is gone. \n\nHe doesn't focus on objectives, splitting, dueling, diving, teamfighting, damage, peel, utility etc., He has no pure focus. Even someone as simplistic as Wukong has a focus, another champ I love because I love the Spin to Win moves lmao. \n\n**So what reason do I pick Garen, other than I like him, over Darius/Wukong/Hecarim (other similar juggernaut top laners)? **\n\n**What does this rework do that makes him pickworthy? What does this rework solve that he had a problem with?** \n\nI don't feel like any of these questions have been answered unlike with Morde/Darius/Skarner. Not everyone likes Morde/Skarner changes but at least they have a new focus and a reason to be picked.\n\nYes Garen might be slightly better at spinning now, I really don't see how this would shoot up his winrate or really give him a reason to be picked over anyone else. He was never picked for his late game or really ever picked outside of mains that liked him. \n\nIf I were to go with something that I think Garen should be the master at, is that you literally can't get him out of fights. You can't get rid of him and he is a constant pressure on everyone. Maybe not a huge threat but he is always there. I feel like his Passive and W need to be replaced in order for this to be realized tho.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-08T09:54:36.424+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> So what reason do I pick Garen, other than I like him, over Darius/Wukong/Hecarim (other similar juggernaut top laners)?\n\nThere are a couple potential reasons that I could see to pick Garen (outside just liking him). First, he'll still be a lane bully for several matchups I imagine, and picking to win your lane can often be a good idea. Second, relative to other tanky top laners, Garen will have possibly the best combined package of sustained speed, durability, and damage. Basically, he's a good pick when you need a tanky damage dealing presence and you can anticipate fights that will move a lot. Strategically, he may be the perfect pick when you have a team that can support him (especially with speed buffs, like Lulu or Sivir) and the opposing team has only one or two damage threats (bonus points if at least one of them is a melee threat). This is the ideal pick scenario for him because the opposing team needs their limited damage dealers to get fed in order to win the game, and if they get fed, they become the Villain. Having that extra effectiveness against that Villain when the opposing team is heavily reliant on them can actually be a big deal.\n\nAnother fun interpretation of where I think Garen is a good pick, though it isn't strategic _within_ the game is when you know the opposing team relies on a certain player to get fed in order to win. This could potentially translate to competitive play, though I think it's more applicable and fun to pre-mades with friends.

However, it is intended that he'll have a huge impact if he actually manages to get to people now. Whether or not the exact numbers we have on PBE right now will perfectly accomplish that goal, that is indeed the goal, and I'll work to get him there if he falls short of it on release. At the end of the day, Garen is never going to be able to compete with champions like Irelia, Hecarim, or Riven (this isn't to say that any of these three characters are necessarily balanced either) when it comes to getting to specific targets, so he should be meaningfully more impactful than them in some way if he pulls it off.

Whether or not the exact numbers we have on PBE right now will perfectly accomplish that goal, that is indeed the goal, and I'll work to get him there if he falls short of it on release. At the end of the day, Garen is never going to be able to compete with champions like Irelia, Hecarim, or Riven (this isn't to say that any of these three characters are necessarily balanced either) when it comes to getting to specific targets, so he should be meaningfully more impactful than them in some way if he pulls it off. In his case, he's just going to deal a ton of damage to things he sticks to.\n\nDarius/Volibear seems to be a far better pick for both answers you gave, especially with the rework on Darius. \n\nIf you want the Damage aspect of Garen you go for Darius and he excels far better at it than Garen could ever dream. The dueling, peeling and being a Juggernaut thing is better handled by Volibear than Garen. \n\nI just don't see why I would ever pick Garen, unless I like him, over Volibear/Darius top and I still don't see how these minimal changes on the PBE are supposed to change that.\n\nBesides, I don't see how he has an easier time getting to people in fights or has any increased impact once he does in the PBE compared to Live. You didn't give him increased mobility or that much more damage until mid to late. You actually reduced his Q MS duration late. \n\nSo an even better question would be:\n\n**3 reasons why I should pick Garen over Volibear or Darius top outside of laning phase? **","replies":[{"poster":"sp441","date":"2015-08-08T15:42:20.684+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

First, he'll still be a lane bully for several matchups I imagine, and picking to win your lane can often be a good idea.\n\nSo, he'd be a very specific counter pick to a handful of top lane matchups?  What if the team wants to counter-pick a different lane or I'm not in a draft mode and can't tell what my opponent is playing until it's too late?  In that case, I'm playing Garen because I like playing Garen as opposed to playing a champion that might help my team win the game.\n\n>Second, relative to other tanky top laners, Garen will have possibly the best combined package of sustained speed, durability, and damage. Basically, he's a good pick when you need a tanky damage dealing presence and you can anticipate fights that will move a lot. Strategically, he may be the perfect pick when you have a team that can support him (especially with speed buffs, like Lulu or Sivir) and the opposing team has only one or two damage threats (bonus points if at least one of them is a melee threat). This is the ideal pick scenario for him because the opposing team needs their limited damage dealers to get fed in order to win the game, and if they get fed, they become the Villain. Having that extra effectiveness against that Villain when the opposing team is heavily reliant on them can actually be a big deal.\n\nSo, why wouldn't I just pick someone like Maokai, Hecarim, Irelia or Riven in this instance, all of whom benefit my team much more than Garen could after a Sivir/Lulu/Righteous Glory boost?  I mean, the purpose of this rework is, supposedly, to improve Garen's viability in competitive in addition to providing \"strategic diversity\" (whatever that means), but I'm not seeing it.  If Garen still can't get to a specific \"villain\" target in a team fight (which doesn't appear to be a goal of this rework), what good is the extra 1% damage per AA in his R passive going to actually mean?","replies":[]},{"poster":"WarWork","date":"2015-08-08T10:35:37.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, i just wanna say thanks for all your work.

I heard that it was you who was working on Garen, but I wasn't aware that you also reworked Ashe. That's confusing to me since Ashe's rework was so cohesive and right now Garen's seems very slapdash (I'm holding out hope that the final product is more elegant).\n\nI made a thread [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/i6tqkHfJ-the-garen-rework-is-unnecessary-unwelcome-and-absolutely-terrible) (granted, I made that thread before reading about some of the more recent changes), but the short of it is that it feels like there's a major disconnect between what I love about Garen (and more objectively, how he's played) and your goals for the rework; the most glaring and far-reaching of which is the evening out of Garen's power curve. Garen's biggest weaknesses are his inherent vulnerability to CC and his lack of CC, making him extremely weak in organized teamfights; thankfully, right now this balanced out by his extremely strong early game. But if you were to balance him out to make him scale more normally (weaker early, stronger later), that would completely neuter him due to the nature of his kit; he would be mediocre at all stages of the game. The fact is that I don't want a Garen who is \"strong\" (stat-wise) in the late game; he should be strong early, where his kit is at its most effective.\n\nAnyway, that's my broad-strokes take on the rework. I have many smaller, more specific issues with it... such as the W stacking mechanic being just weird and thematically inconsistent... where's the connection between killing things, growing more resistant to damage, and Courage? Does Garen get a confidence boost every time he smashes a minion's face in? That doesn't seem very Garen-y to me. Also, more importantly, the removal of his innate tenacity does not sit well with me at all given that it is almost certainly his most important stat; he needs all the CC resistance he can get in order to do his job properly. I can sort of see how the changes to Q and his increased auto range can compensate for it but I'm really uncertain about how it'll play. One of the best feelings I've experienced while playing Garen is when you wade through the enemy team to get at their carries, soaking CC and damage in equal measure; it's not about reaching them with speed or range or complex mechanics (as with your everyday garden-variety assassin), but by sheer might.\n\nIf I were to make a few suggestions, it would be to perhaps experiment with enhancing Garen's slow cleanse to also work with fears (extremely thematic) or roots or other types of CC (a more than adequate compensation for the tenacity removal); maybe even move the cleanse from Q to W (breaking CC effects is certainly more courageous than killing minions). Also, one concern I have with the Villainy system is how little control Garen has over it; I can see myself in a skirmish attempting to execute the Villain, only for another enemy to make a kill at the last second and thus allow the previous Villain to escape justice. Instead of having it interact with regular kills, make it so that it only interacts with multikills and/or killing sprees (both of which are vile and more villainous than your average kill or slaying). That would add a lot more reliability.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the essay. I also apologize for being rather caustic in my previous statements; my opinion of the rework's progress has been vastly tempered now that I've witnessed your outreach firsthand.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MasterOfTheOrder","date":"2015-08-07T09:01:33.304+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4GhvvrBj,comment-id=00070000,timestamp=2015-08-07T08:03:31.577+0000)\n>\n> I am the guy working on Garen.

He's also VERY EASY to kite and deal with, when you're playing against him. When you're playing AS him, you just play wait the enemy to push past the halfway mark in the lane, then yolo charge their face while screaming \"DEMACIA\".\n\nEveryone knows this. Garen is Garen. He's decent early game, dangerous if fed mid game, and terrible when everyone is maxed out. To make him viable and \"unique\", the change to his ult is perfect. Honestly, it's perfect. The speed buff to his Judgement was also a nice addition, and rounded of the ult change for the sake of an easy to use and simple to understand combo, which Garen never had before.\n\nThose are what should stay. EVERY OTHER CHANGE NEEDS TO GO. ALL OF THEM. If he becomes a bit too overbearing, remove the additional attack speed from his Judgement. The ult addition should be enough, if that turns out to be the case.\n\nI hope I explained this clearly.
