Keep in mind there's many people of many ages playing the game for a variety of reasons, but everyone wants to have fun. Getting angry will just make the experience worse for everyone around you, yourself included.\nIf anyone starts flaming and it's hard for you not to talk back, just be the bigger person and mute them. End of problem. If theres's someone trolling in your team, or being bad (they could be just inexperienced, or having a horrible day - being toxic only makes it worse) or it's a specially frustrating game, keep in mind it's still just a game and getting overly angry will even make you play worse. Take a break after, could be 15 minutes, could be a day, but don't go into another game when you're already mad.\n\nAgain, these are tips for Normal games, I'm sure \"It's just a game\" doesn't quite work when people start taking it seriously in Ranked, so I apologise if this isn't quite the advice you were looking for. I hope you can find the path to the Zen Gaming! :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-27T17:46:18.453+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hiya! \n\nFirst off, I think it's awesome that you're reaching out for help/suggestions on how to improve your behavior.\n\n> How to not rage in games?\n > How to not be toxic in game (Not crazy stuff stuff like \"Ok you know what you suck i am done with you\"\n\nI grouped these together, since they both kind of fall under the same category. \n\nI'll admit, there are times where I become extremely frustrated, both at myself, or not so great plays in a team fight.

This is where all start i mean this dude is 0/6 he have 40 cs at 18 and he have the audacity to type in chat that we all suck and i suck more because i dont gank his lane and all that i dont care to mute him any more at this point i care to explain him how bad he is on this game and to explain him that he is the one who have no idea how to play \n\nSolo Q its hard some times :P","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-27T20:17:32.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The flame war always start \"OMG report this Jungler he never gank top lane he suck bla bla bla\" So if you say to this person anything even the one that you suggest he will just rage again so i am like \"Dude you feed and you blame the jungler you dont know how to play top dont blame me or the mid for not roaming gtfo from my chat and start play more passive\" and then ether a shitstorm start or you get a backup from the team and everything cool off\n\nI think you're approaching this from the wrong angle, which won't help you change your attitude in the long run. \n\n*\"Dude you feed and you blame the jungler you dont know how to play top dont blame me or the mid for not roaming gtfo from my chat and start play more passive*\n\n* If someone else starts trash talking, ignore it. If you need to, mute them. \n* Telling someone they don't know how to play a lane is only going to cause tension with the team. Since it's a team game, that's not the best idea. :P \n* If you want to talk to your teammate about playing poorly, you could spin what you said into something more positive - \"If you need help top, just ask. Just play passive until we can roam top and help you out.\"\n\n> Solo Q its a weird place!!

It's challenging, and you don't always get a the role you want, and you don't always end up with teammates you work well with. \n\n> This is where all start i mean this dude is 0/6 he have 40 cs at 18 and he have the audacity to type in chat that we all suck and i suck more because i dont gank his lane and all that i dont care to mute him any more at this point i care to explain him how bad he is on this game and to explain him that he is the one who have no idea how to play\n\nI get it, it's a bad game. We've all been there. It's a crappy situation. \n\n* This is where the mute button comes in handy. \n* Explaining to people that they're 'bad at the game' won't get you or the other person anywhere. Again, try turning that negative comment into something more positive. \"Hey, I noticed you're doing x, and they can counter you by doing x.\" Or, \"Go farm bot to grab some CS.\" Help your teammates out - don't just tell them what they're doing wrong. Offer help where you can.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Raw","date":"2015-07-27T19:01:35.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol @ \"360\"\n\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/daopul5c344.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"NullDragon","date":"2015-07-28T00:13:33.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Expect To Lose**\n\n50% of games end in a loss. This is a statistical fact. Why does this matter? Because if you don't expect this, you're going to blame teammates. Some times you're just going to lose.\n\n**Learn instead of just winning**\n\nRelated to the last point, go into games expecting to learn and improve instead of winning. You are NOT going to win 100% of games, or even 70% of games. Why not try to learn something? Try new things, figure out what works and doesn't work. If your teammates play badly, that's okay, because at least you're learning to improve your own play.\n\n**Adapt to your teammates**\n\nYour idiotic amumu just engages at absolutely the WORST times? Seems to always go in when you're never there? You suspect he's actually a bot scripted to always go in whenever he can 5 man ult the enemy team no matter who's near them? Use that and change your play style. Keep aware of him like you would an enemy on the map. Figure out when he's looking for those initiates, and make sure to be there even if it's not the best choice. They might not change how they play, but you can.\n\nThis is a lot of adapting your gameplay, granted. But it works for me. The key is being in a mindset to where you don't care that your teammate is 0/8 20 minutes into the game. Who knows why they're not playing badly. But it's not really any of your business, and it almost always becomes toxic if you try to force them to play better. The most you can do is try and change team strategy to protect them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ramuhdo","date":"2015-07-28T00:00:49.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the things that helps for me is to play something relaxing in the background. Mightn't put you in the FIGHT TO WIN mood as much, but something like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMkmQlfOJDk helps me keep calm and carry on during games.\n\nI also try to positively encourage myself. \"Okay, I just got 5-man ganked mid with no missing calls from any lane. That's OK; just means I need to play more carefully, ward, and ask my team to please call missing when they can.\" I'll type in chat something like, \"5 mid\" or \"pls call missing\", then just resume play while reminding myself that dying once won't cost you the entire game (though it puts you at a disadvantage).\n\nWhen the game looks to be losing, I continue reminding myself that not even Faker wins 100% of games, so a loss is bound to happen. I'll evaluate what I could've done differently (why did I buy Abyssal when they're full AD?), and try to avoid talking with my team mates about their shortcomings. \n\nIf I'm feeling particularly graceful in defeat (and I'm sure I played well), I'll tell my team, \"Good effort, we tried.\" and hope that that little bit of positivity will carry on to their next game. It's also to remind myself everyone tried winning, even if they weren't up to snuff.\n\nSometimes, you lose because your team is terrible. Your support can't ward, your ADC doesn't kite, your tanks don't engage right and don't peel and your assassin keeps attacking the tank. Horrid. But sometimes, you lose because the enemy team was simply plain better.\n\n**TL;DR**: Use calm music to soothe yourself during combat, tell yourself positive things to keep a positive outlook!\n\nMost of all, don't play when already pissed off, and don't play after a 3-game loss streak, unless it's ARAM.","replies":[]}]}
