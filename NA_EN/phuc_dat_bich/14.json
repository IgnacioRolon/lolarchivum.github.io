(plus many people have donate him today)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"so right now nightblue3 have made 600$ (plus the daily money he will take from the twitch because of the thousand viewers he have) and he have 14 more hours so i assume at the end of his 24 stream he will make 1200-2000$ and he stream almost every day so he make almost 500-700$ average daily! So my question here what is better to be an LCS player who may not be the championship or to be a streamer and to earn 900 AVERAGE (many days he can make over 2000 because of the donations) so what its better lcs players or streamer? as i see it its better to be a streamer you play the game that you like you dont need to stress your self and you have fun!!\n\nedit: i forget that he take money from the site supporters of his stream (sites that give him money in order nightblue to give them free advertise) so that mean that his daily income it may be 1000-1100$","replies":[]}
