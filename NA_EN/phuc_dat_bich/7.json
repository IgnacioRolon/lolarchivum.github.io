They exclude specifics like tahm ken when they do this.  the reason why tahm is considered needing a nerf is because his specific skill, denying damage to his allies, is deemed WAY to powerful and impactful on the game by the community right now if for no other reason than the uptime.  If his devour ability was an ult and used only once every two minutes no one would complain.  That it is a basic skill that basically denies not only the entire class of assassins, but even a large number of champions outside it like burst mages syndra, lux, annie, as well as dive heavy fighters like shyvana, vi and J4 from doing their job is what makes people say he is op.  To make matters worse he is so inherently tanky that when he does deny you, you can't do anything to stop him so you just kind waste your skills and possibly lose the teamfight.\n\nYou're getting so wrapped up in the general idea of tanks being nerfed you arent looking at the specifics of a champion when they are brought up.  What Riot has been doing is increasingly making every single champion in league completely unique with their own distinct strengths and weaknesses.  High level play of a single champion is less and less transferring over to the entire class or even sub-class.  This is most apparent in game changing skills that determine the strength of the champion and an individual's value in playing that champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2015-11-11T12:56:19.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He denies damage to an ally, but he also makes that ally unable to do any damage, which isnt too strong at all. If it has such a high cooldown it would be really weak. I wouldnt complain if Rivens E was her ult on 1-2 minutes cooldown either, but that doesnt mean it would be fine like that. \nTahm doesnt completely stop these champs from doing their job, he simply creates counterplay against them that they can play around as well. Its not OP that Tahm can counter pick comps that rely on hitting something like a Morg or Lux Q, its a good thing. If you want to play a pick comp, ban Tahm. If you play a poke team that kites Tahm or a heavy engage team that just rolls over him, you dont need to care. Gameplay like that is what League needs. See, you say \"you just kind waste your skills and possibly lose the teamfight\" because he is a tank. If you would be talking about any other tank, people would just reply \"then dont waste your spells for the tank lel\", or if you were talking about Yasuos windwall, people would say \"then dont blow all your cooldowns into it kek\", but since Tahm magically has a global taunt and is impossible to kite as well, thats not a thing?\n\nAnd I dont think tanks will be bad in season 6, especially Rammus for example, who is way better than Tahm.","replies":[{"poster":"planters","date":"2015-11-11T22:41:10.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not disputing the strength of tanks.  surprisingly they may actually see some minor improvement, but I feel that fighters are going to be receiving the benefit from all the changes to armor more so than tanks.  I am saying that tahm's strategical value is to great.  with riot's recent change to make every champion unique they have, probably inadvertently, created two huge divides in how a champion can be OP.  \n\nthe most well known in individual asset. this is the champion just having too much raw power or something that prevents the enemy team from dealing with them properly.  Best example would be zed and lee sin who have had the issue of too much safety with all their damage. \n\nthe newer OP state is strategical asset.  this is something that has appeared in LCS more often than not.  strategically OP champions, in the case of tahm kench, have such a huge value that not taking them is almost a mistake.  In the case of tahm kench you talked about his weaknesses.  that's not the problem.  the problem is that his invalidating burst so completely and forcibly making damage aim at him is the most tank thing that you can do in this game.  He forces his oppenents to get through him which generally is not possible because he is a tank.  the answer, just ban him, does not take away from the fact that if he does enter the picture he is worse to deal with than other cahmpions.  \n\nIn the case of yasuo and his windwall that counters siege, his siege countering is not so great that it is game breaking because sieges can go on for many minutes while the skill is down.  so even if it is OP it has decent counterplay.  the problem with tahm is that because he so heavily denies going in on any champion ANY all in is alway risky as when you do all in you generally aim for the squishiest member.  his stopping that from even being possible makes it OP.  if he had a simple delay on when he could take in his ally of like .5 seconds or something more and the skill needed to be PREDICTIVE, then tahm would be balanced.  as is it is reflexive so it is deemed OP.","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2015-11-11T22:58:39.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I already knew Tahm was gonna be quite OP in lcs when he came out. but we are not in lcs.

The only thing he could do was stop an ally from getting caught but you can do that with {{item:3222}} , {{champion:25}} {{item:3140}} or... good positioning as well. Other than that he just lost to poke because he is a tank that cant initiate and he lost in direct teamfights because he is nearly useless in those. \nThats how I remember Tahm, idk what magically made him op lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ayNigerianPrince","date":"2015-11-11T03:19:50.927+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"K, take three cups of water.

I guess if tanks want to lose 20 or so base armor so they can gain 5 armor at level 1, we can give that to them... You know, I don't think that base armor which can't be reduced by the new LW is all too useful. It's only about 80-100, which is 40%-50% reduction that can only be reduced by a Cleaver, flat ArP, and abilities that reduce armor, so it wouldn't hurt to nuke their armor from 80-100 to about 50-60, right? Get them down to a lowly 30ish percent base, amirite?\n> \n> For those who paid little attention to the patch notes, LW does 30% of BONUS armor and the upgraded versions give 40% compared to 35% of TOTAL armor, so the Rammus and Braums with 100 armor at max level have a free 50% reduction that ADC's can't ignore as long as they get one armor item like a Randuin's, which reduces crit damage by 10%, an overall DPS loss of 5% with crits being a flat 50% with the basic IE+AS/Crit item. More of a loss on the ones with more crit chance.\n> \n> But, you know. It's cool.

What..? If you mean they can build more crit items, then sure. They can, but it'd be at the cost of AD to make that crit work or LS to be able to sustain at all.\n\nADC can't get 200 more AD. At all. BT got nerfed by 5 AD, IE by 15, BotRK lost 2% of its current health per AA, most AD items have been stopped at 65 AD rather than 80 and the new LW only gives 40 AD when fully built, just like the old one while it's incapable of touching the base armors of tanks, which is actually a ton of armor as my previous post has mentioned.\n\nNow we can see tank items, there won't ever be some weird 120% critical reduction. That sounds absolutely stupid and there's no reason for that to even exist. Seriously. That's stupid. There would be no increase of armor on items either since that would just make Rammus, Taric, and Malphite one shot anything.\n\nSeriously.

ADC's LOST 25 AD with a 0 defense build to gain 10% LS and less damage taken from -one- person they AA'd. Congrats. They can duel each other, that's it.
