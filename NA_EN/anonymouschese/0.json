So I thought that the discounted champs this half of the week weren't in my pleasure I would speak my mind. I would like Vi, Zed, and or Zac (ik he was just on sale I didn't pick him up) to see into the discount rotation soon. That's all my input layda (I thought this would be a support post so if I'm wrong tell me)","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-01-25T00:49:31.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most champs go on the discount sale every 3-4 months.  Zed probably won't be on sale again until short of 3 months from now (he was on sale 28 days ago) and Zac was on sale 2 weeks ago (so 3+ months for him too).  Vi on the other hand is expected to be on sale soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-25T00:23:51.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to the boards!  The free weekly champion rotation is random, but it does try to be enough diversity so you can select different roles with the roster for that week.  We don't have enough information on when specific champions become available for the free rotation, until it's announced-- [here](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/free-rotation).  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
