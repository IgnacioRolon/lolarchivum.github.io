Gotcha. Misread your comment. Thought you might have additional feedback on the Tremor Sense thing.  \n\nMy impression on the competitive vs. ranked play with Rek'Sai ultimate is that in competitive because kills tend to be a bit slower, it's used even more to just edge out a farming lead. If you feel like it's optimal to continue farming, you use it on cooldown.  See a lot more people in ranked play who set it up near objectives and lanes and use it to counter a gank or fight for an objective.  I think this is the cool thing it brings to the table.  The hope is that if the cooldown was more restricted, pro play would mimic the neater use case and use it less for generic farming advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2016-06-29T20:52:38.291+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, I can understand the vision for it with that, but 30 seconds at all ranks is a pretty huge nerf.\n\nAdd that in to the fact that you're already testing Tremor Sense nerfs, and I think it's just way too much for a champ who isn't even particularly out of line in competitive play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quinterro","date":"2016-07-01T07:47:20.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO nerf to termor sense is too big.
