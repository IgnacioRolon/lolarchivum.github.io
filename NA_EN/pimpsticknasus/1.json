I get really far ahead in lane, I try to go help other lanes, push in turrets, get kills. Then when it comes to teamfighting everyone on my team refuses to do it. We're ahead overall as a team and we win 5v5, but then every fight is a 3v5 then a 2v5 with the remaining people. \r\n\r\nWe had a teamfight that we won because everyone was there once. It was the only time we had the team grouped and the rest of the time there was always someone off farming in the jungle and someone else split pushing but leaving to farm the jungle as soon as they got the minions to tower. I tried communicating with my team that we needed to group or play as a team and I received radio silence. \r\n\r\nI have no idea why we lost, I came out of lane on top, jungle came out of laning phase on top, as well as mid. Our bottom lane was behind but not by a huge amount. But there was only one 5v5 team fight the entire game. I have no idea what to do in games like this, I want to be able to win, but I have no idea how to make it happen in a situation like this.","replies":[]}
