Then the winning top-laner said thank you (not \"too EZ n00b!\") and they got into a discussion about it. That's whats supposed to happen.

They had surrendered, without prompting or even telling us they had given us the win. Needless to say our entire team burst out laughing and that moment turned what would have been a truly miserable loss into the second best win of my life (best win being the game where I hit 30, but that's another story for another time).

But when the game is only full of casual players or competitive players, that's when people have all the fun. That's at least my opinion on things.  \n\nAs far as stories, I have a bunch. One of the ones I remember is when we were losing the early game and decided to have a dance off in the top lane.

I mean, I rage as much as anybody else in a ranked game but that's mostly because those are my skills being put up for anyone to look at. When I go into a normals game I am usually with my friends and just wanna play to have fun. I've found some really good people in this community and of course I would change it but I honestly love this community. Even the FORUMS have amazing people on it. ArmaMalum is an awesome guy, always encouraged me to do better in ranked.\n\nI've made enemies in a match and then end up making them one of my best friends because I got my head out of my ass and didn't think so highly of myself and so low of them. As an example, I was playing jungle Lee Sin and the Leona and Varus bot lane were in a duo queue. They fed the bot lane Braum and Ezreal and I got a little angry because a fed Braum in the late game is a living hell with a Yasuo in the mid lane. The Leona ended up becoming our shoutcaller and called us to do things and we came back from a 6-40 game and ended it 30-43 due to her amazing calls. I apologized to her in end game chat and we're friends now.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd like to repeat what Rito Girl said and just say we have one of the best communitys out there, no matter what anyone says. There are some amazing people in this community. Of course, there are those few who feel like being a jerk and ruining people's days but the majority of us are the ones who enjoy playing the game and meeting amazing people.\n\nI also want to thank Rito for all their amazing work on this community and game in general. They have done such a great job, and the reason I don't feel guilty putting money into this game is because they put out all this for FREE and don't really ask us for anything.

I built ap Nasus, he built more traditionally, and had far surpassed me in farm/q-stacks, by about 150. First duel is near Baron and as i'm about to kill their Nasus, their WW ults me and kills me... so we set it up again, wait for ulti's and such, but go to Dragon this time, as we're setting this one up, Lee and WW go after us Nasus and our teams melt them. so, while thy're waiting to spawn we duel. i beat him by barely 300 health because AP Nasus is weird. But this game was so much fun because even with the jerk junglers that other Nasus was just an awesome player, he'd give me pointers and we just kinda chatted while laning. We even set it up so he could TP in for a \"Grand Entrance\" and had a teammate announce for us and everything... That guy(or gal, no idea) gave me hope for our community.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slushi Simcambi","date":"2014-07-11T19:57:26.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"People are mentioning that top laners are like bros,\nsometimes when I'm supporting, the other support and I will bond in weird ways\n\"nice cc you cheeky devil\"\n\"dont feed the support!\"\n\nBut other times the adc's are toxic and spit at each other so we dont get to be buddies :<","replies":[]}]}
