In the next game, I was on the same team as them, I called top and locked my champion, and then Nasus said he was going top because of how bad I was last game and he wouldn&#039;t allow me to top. We ended up duo top lane because neither of us would budge. The entirety of the lane phase consisted of me trying to 1v2 the lane because Nasus refused to do anything btu last hit minions, and outright walked away from ganks or fights and laughed. He said, &quot;you&#039;re not my team mate and I only help team mates&quot; In response to me asking why he wasn&#039;t helping me. Then when I accused him of outright refusing to assist me in any way, he responded with &quot; Yep, that&#039;s what i&#039;m trying to do&quot; outright admitting that was his intent.\r\n\r\nI feel like I dealt with this situation pretty fairly considering the circumstances, and they reported me for simply going top, because they were a duo queue reporting, I was instantly chat restricted. This seems highly unfair and a serious problem with the report system that 2 people can report and have a player instantly restricted. Ideally i&#039;d like my restriction removed as I don&#039;t feel it&#039;s deserved, however If that&#039;s not possible some feedback on where I went wrong would be helpful, thanks in advance. \r\n\r\nHere is a copy of the restriction message. \r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nHiway3hell: you and this hec are duo huh?\r\nHiway3hell: makes sense why i was camped now\r\nHiway3hell: yuh\r\nHiway3hell: You camp top anything like last game\r\nHiway3hell: and im sure well be fine\r\nHiway3hell: Sorry jhin i called it\r\nHiway3hell: thanks for the help\r\nHiway3hell: buddy\r\nHiway3hell: yeah and you know when you report people\r\nHiway3hell: they read chat\r\nHiway3hell: right\r\nHiway3hell: my team mate wouldnt takje top after i called it\r\nHiway3hell: k\r\nHiway3hell: youre actually  treying to get me killed\r\nHiway3hell: impressive\r\nHiway3hell: report nasus pls\r\nHiway3hell: admitted to trying to get me killed basically lol\r\nHiway3hell: so go all out on llaoi\r\nHiway3hell: pls report \r\nHiway3hell: standing and watching me die\r\nHiway3hell: I CALLED top \r\nHiway3hell: nah\r\nHiway3hell: not anymore\r\nHiway3hell: idc if i dont get another cs\r\nHiway3hell: all game\r\nHiway3hell: im staying top\r\nHiway3hell: u and ur butt buddy hec lol\r\nHiway3hell: Again with this nasus\r\nHiway3hell: just stands and watches\r\nHiway3hell: you&#039;re going to get banned its k\r\nHiway3hell: well see\r\nHiway3hell: ?\r\nHiway3hell: is that english?\r\nHiway3hell: yeah what for?\r\nHiway3hell: I&#039;d like to know\r\nHiway3hell: That&#039;s not a report unfortunately :(\r\nHiway3hell: try again\r\nHiway3hell: You saw nasus sit by and watch me die multiple times\r\nHiway3hell: so yeah\r\nHiway3hell: :(\r\nHiway3hell: sorry i called top\r\nHiway3hell: that means i get top\r\nHiway3hell: youve sat by and watched me die lol\r\nHiway3hell: multiple times\r\nHiway3hell: thx hec\r\nHiway3hell: good gank\r\nHiway3hell: appreciate it\r\nHiway3hell: :(\r\nHiway3hell: I just wish youd quit feeding\r\nHiway3hell: I&#039;m not trolling?\r\nHiway3hell: What are you talking about jhin\r\nHiway3hell: I couldn&#039;t help you there was 3 and you were low im sorry\r\nHiway3hell: nasus is the one trolling unfortunately\r\nHiway3hell: he says im not a teammate so he wont help me\r\nHiway3hell: and calls me bad but hes 0/2\r\nHiway3hell: :(\r\nHiway3hell: lol\r\nHiway3hell: Thats okay\r\nHiway3hell: reports don&#039;t work unless you do something to get reported for\r\nHiway3hell: I&#039;m sorry nasus you&#039;ve been the toxic one here not me\r\nHiway3hell: but you know that\r\nHiway3hell: thanks :) good luck to you too\r\nHiway3hell: no please\r\nHiway3hell: we can win guys\r\nHiway3hell: focus\r\nHiway3hell: ggwp\r\n\r\n\r\nI understand that towards the end of the game I was a bit sarcastic in my remarks, but understand that this is an entire game of frustration and I still feel like it wasn&#039;t outright rude or hateful what I said, the Nasus and Hecarim&#039;s comments are FAR more disgusting, however I can&#039;t view them to post them.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-05-26T10:10:28.482+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was the only game provided?","replies":[{"poster":"Hiway3hell","date":"2017-05-26T17:33:31.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes sir, only game provided.
