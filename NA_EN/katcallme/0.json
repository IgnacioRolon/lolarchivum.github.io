I'll just point out a few.  But 1st since the MODS like to remove these type of posts I want it to be clear to them that I am not shaming. Just pointing out how your claim of %99 of loses are due to junglers is clearly a exaggeration. \n\n1st off you are a Kat one trick. %58 win rate on her but EVERYTIME you have to play a different champ you lose. You havnt one 1 game with any other champ. \n\nLook at your avg. KDAs when you have to play other champs\n\nYasuo - .67\nHecarim - 1.06\nDiana - 1.33\nEvelynn - 1.07\nNautilus - .77\n\n%36 of your losses are just from not being able to not feed when you cant play Katarina. Not to mention the games on Kat that you also play badly. I wont list them but you can see them in your match history. yeah you play good on her and win a lot but you do have bad games where your junglers play well. So no %99 of your losses are not the junglers fault as i clearly pointed out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KlydeFrog","date":"2020-01-21T06:27:05.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ikr well people feel the need to get drag however people dont understand that first drag say is mountain second say is ocean the next several drags will be either infernal or cloud . I'll sac ocean cause 1 ocean is doodoo . 4 straight oceans is good . Basically what I'm saying is get 1 of the first 2 drag if it's not ocean then get the next couple cause more of the same drag is better","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2020-01-21T06:29:41.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weird.

If you win too much, you get degenerate scum.\n\nHow else do you think they keep that 50% win chance within 1% stat? You think because they designed such an insanely good matching system??\n\nFuck no, they force it. Duh. By giving you tardomungos.\n\nRiot fucks you when they want to fuck you.

Lower points gained per match. Or just make it Slant so you need over 50% WR to even climb.\nKeep more player out of X rank? change its MMR range. Its a population curve for fucks sake. They can adjust what percentile of player can even achieve a rank  LITREALLY AT WILL!\nMake promos harder? Swap the MMR on the account out for the MMR  mean value for the next rank if its not at or above that. Remove promo helper completely.\n\nRiot has multiple options that will function at 100% reliability Every single time for every single player that never have to rely on RNG pray to god some players behave as expected with statistical interference that's not currently even achievable via modern tech.\n\nIts insanely easier to target 1 player then to try and account for 10 individual variables, like this should be self evident.\n\nProactive systems are harder to make then reactive ones when dealing with automation. Subjective judgment is also hard to automate.\n\nHere is the funny thing, the only people who stand to gain if there was rigged or Forced 50% are the people who tell you their Ranks don't match their skill. Cuz riot has full control over their MMR system and its variables they can make it accomplish what they want at way less effort.\n\nBet for the sake of argument lets say you really wanna fuck over Player X?  Guess what you can do to them during a soft reset?","replies":[]}]}]}
