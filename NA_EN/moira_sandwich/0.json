I saw one person say \"Lag, can't move\". After waiting about 5 minutes I exited the game to reconnect, however, when I go to reconnect I continuously get an error saying \"Failure to Connect...Unable to connect to the server. Please check your network connection and attempt to reconnect to your game...'Retry' 'Cancel'\". I first try the retry button, same thing came up. I closed out LoL, checked my internet and all is fine, I open up my browser and do an internet speed test and about at 12+ Mbps download and 4+ Mbps Upload. I open up League of Legends again, this time I can't even log in, it was saying my password was wrong (no capslock wasn't on). I close and reopen it and I'm able to log in, so I hit the reconnect button and I get the same error message. At this point 45 minutes have gone by and we were like 15 minutes into the game. I'm still getting the Reconnect button, and I can't connect to my old game or start any new games. Can I get some help?\n\nSame thing is happening with me","replies":[]}]}
