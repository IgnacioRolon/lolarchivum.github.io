But every time I use CTRL+ 1,2,3 and 4 I get no voice coming out of her taunts. However the only one that is working is the sound from her dance to &quot;Get Jinxed&quot;. I found that all the taunts are working when I play her with her classic skin. Also all of Mafia Jinx&#039;s movement lines seem to be working alright, it only seems to be the taunts, although I haven&#039;t tried the taunts with the chat commands so I&#039;m not sure if it works there or not. \r\n\r\nI also saw that other people have reported her voice taunts aren&#039;t working on other servers, I hope it&#039;s not just me. I hope Rito can fix this :)","replies":[{"poster":"Jotunheimr","date":"2015-11-06T02:36:49.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also noticed something similar with Mordekiaser, but only if I use a voice command in succesion. He does the movement, but no sound. Gotta wait a little bit between each one.\n\nIs that also some sort of bug?","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-06T00:46:20.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Akira Heroga,\n\nThanks for the report!
