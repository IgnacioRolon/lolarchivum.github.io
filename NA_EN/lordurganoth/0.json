Ganked non stop. My mid was trying to tilt me flaming me for my score. But I barely said anything this game. I understand it is unlikely that this is the sole reason I got my 14 days account suspension,but I&#039;d like to see the rest. When I login to see the suspension notification,there is only this game displayed where I got reported. Any way I can see the others,if there are any?","replies":[{"poster":"RallerenP","date":"2018-06-07T19:04:16.608+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hate speech gives you an instant 14 day ban.
