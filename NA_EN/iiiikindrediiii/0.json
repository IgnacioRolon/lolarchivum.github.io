These two should be re-examined to be fixed. They are way too squishy for their roles even with a professional hand. Please note that yes proper builds can enforce them they are almost useless when it comes to sufficiency for team fights of any kind. I&#039;m not sure if I am correct as many others may have a different opinion, but why make characters that are almost useless. Ashe is considered &quot;squishy&quot;, but at least she has proper stats. Just please consider in remaking the stats. I hate to see great character concepts go to waste. The meta isn&#039;t even helping the situation for them either. I know and understand that the balancing team is making hard decisions for this, but they need to be a bit better if they want to make this game better. Yes a decision can lead to another mistake, but that&#039;s where trial and error comes in. Don&#039;t release something that you haven&#039;t properly tested out yet it makes no sense in the long run. Finally, I must repeat myself when I say fix Kindred and Evelynn. I can&#039;t stress that enough although there are many other characters that aren&#039;t even properly fixed yet, but these 2 I think have the most problems.

If I remember correctly, it got stated that they are thinking of a way to buff them by giving them a new interaction with the stat crit chance. Like they did for other marksmen in the marksman update (Quinn Passive cd scales with crit, MF ult is able to mini crit). Interaction with the stat crit seems to be a new design concept for marksmen and I am really interested what they are able to think of for Kindred.\n\nEvelynn on the other hand is receiving a complete VGU soon. The team currently working on Galio will start to rework Evelynn when he is going live. So it just would be wasted effort to do alot of changes to her now. She probably gets pushed more in the direction of an assassin and away from her current diver identity, like her fantasy is intended too.

So I play Eve alot and just started playing Kindred. Here is my take. Eve is a pretty balanced champ. Sure her early clear is weak, but if you know how to use her passive and mobility for early banks, she can snowball really fast. Kindred has a bit stronger early Jungle clear but her marks are the only thing that really allows her to snowball. Kindred is much easier to counter simply by denying her marks. Eve isn't as effective against tanks or bruisers if she goes all in, even if she is rolling hard. Kindred can shred anyone if she gets her marks. But is way squishier than eve. \n\nI miss the old Eve. I finally started enjoying the current Eve. I hope they don't take the fun out of her and change the general game play of her kit. It's very different than most other champs. \n\nKindred is a cool character that needs a more realistic focus on her wolf and lamb idea and even a small bit of sustain in her passive could help make her feel a bit more viable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2017-02-06T00:23:37.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Evelynn is in the process of being gutting by the rework team as we speak.\n\nRIP Eve.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Segius","date":"2017-02-05T01:21:17.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason for this is because riot is pushing out off meta junglers, junglers with weaker clears are not very viable anymore\n\nThe part that sucks is that Kindred and Evelyn don't really have anywhere else","replies":[{"poster":"IIIIKindredIIII","date":"2017-02-05T09:50:42.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Segius,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9xy5EkhZ,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-02-05T01:21:17.797+0000)\n\n> The part that sucks is that Kindred and Evelyn don&#x27;t really have anywhere else\n\nWell that's not exactly true.
