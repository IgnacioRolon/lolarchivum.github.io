If you are against a lane that has terrible waveclear and/or Csing under tower you are going to hard push the waves then harass your laner under tower. you can also move your turrets pretty far up in a Triangle to keep pressure if you are sure you can either take a 2 v 1 or get away. Now if your opponent can wave clear or hit your turrets from far you want them middle of the lane or back a little further and as spread as possible to eliminate the chance of getting 2 or more turrets at a time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-11-12T19:09:56.251+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try to keep your turrets in a wide-ish triangle set up so there's overlap between them. If enemies approach and enter your turret field, land your rockets or your stun bomb on them and your turrets will power shot them. They'll also be pretty much eradicated if they're stupid enough to walk into the hell point in the middle of your triangle where all turrets can shoot them. Also, don't rush the lane either. Heimerdinger is a slow push, so just creepy the lane up with your turrets when you can.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheCrusher742","date":"2018-11-12T21:32:04.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheCrusher742,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XKgmjVLy,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-11-12T19:00:35.255+0000)\n>\n> so I recently started playing the donger and I was wondering how to play him correctly to not get countered easily by the jungle or the laner that is with me on the lane, plz help explain how to properly play Heimerdinger. {{champion:74}}\n\nthanks for helping :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beatrice falls","date":"2018-11-12T20:34:11.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think about zoning them mostly.
