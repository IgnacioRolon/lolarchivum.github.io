Its been awhile since I last visited this place~\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I'll go straight to the point, on this rig of mine, I've used to play League on something like 120-140~ FPS constantly, teamfights would be somewhere around 100&lt; and being idle in the pool was in between 250-300. Meanwhile, now I seem to have a 100 constant and >90 in teamfights.\r\nI have everything on max, just the shadows are on medium and I've got anti-aliasing with vsync off (which didnt seem to impact the framerate at all anyway). I know it doesnt matter if you have a 100 or a 1000, anything above 60 doesnt chaneg anything, but then again, if I've used to have more then what might've happened? The browser whit my music that I always have on doesnt seem to impact the game at all, I tried with and without, even if its using quite abit of memory and stuff like Steam or Torrents are off whenever I play. May that be the recent patches or is my rig just getting older, and that impacts it in a way? Also, my friend has the same exact computer and uses the same graphics options, he seems to have a constant 120fps.\r\n\r\nSPECS:\r\nGTX 750 Ti\r\ng3258 proc\r\n8gb ram\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-23T22:08:22.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iiiiinteresting. Even if having an FPS higher than 60 doesn't *really* matter, we definitely want your system to be running as strong as it should be! After one of the patches, you may have needed to update some graphics drivers possibly to make sure your card is working as well as it can, so be sure to check for that first. If there aren't any driver updates, check out the other steps in this [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) to cover the rest of your bases.","replies":[]}]}
