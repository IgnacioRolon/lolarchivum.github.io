Why is it that certain things can't stack but jungle builds like this crap can? I just, I don't understand why this is even a thing and its just so annoying to deal with, I prefer to actually have a jungler that does work, its as bad as when Feral Flare came out.","replies":[{"poster":"Burgee","date":"2014-10-23T22:32:40.850+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"You're the teammate I hate having when I jungle.\n\nPlay your own lane, be appreciative if the jungler helps, if he doesn't help then you need to step up and play smart.  \n\nIf a jungler is farming flare he's playing for late game, so get on his page and extend the game as long as you can.  Just because you're not getting fed and set up to hard carry doesn't mean the game is a loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Aids cuz League","date":"2014-10-23T22:41:05.576+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"And you're the jungler I hate having, its not about winning lane, its a team based game, winning lane or losing lane having someone help is better than both of those two, besides you can get feral stacks off kills and assists, theres no point in strict jungle farming if you can clearly get a kill which more than not there is one in my lane, the fact of the problem is that I bitch because nobody pays any attention to the map, so be mad at me all you want, at the end of the day its a team based game, not self obsessed \"Im gonna farm and win\" because it doesn't work without teamwork. So good luck with that. Also, there isn't a point for going to late game if the jungler doesn't help early enough so everyone can make it to late, by the time late game comes around, the jungler is still farming while everyone else is struggling to get kills because of: Counters, lag, d/c and other issues. It is your job to help lanes out. If everyone gets fed, because you helped, the other jungler that is mad stoning, will die off because he'll die so quickly. Likewise for you as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Burgee","date":"2014-10-23T22:42:44.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"K.\n\nI'll be at golems while you over extend and die for the third time and then blame me.","replies":[{"poster":"Aids cuz League","date":"2014-10-23T22:45:36.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never overextend.

Are you under halfhealth? are you not warding? There's something happening that is your fault.\n\nWhile their jungler is top ganking you, your madstone jungler just took dragon and more than likely ganked bot (they don't all just farm, only the bad ones.)","replies":[{"poster":"Aids cuz League","date":"2014-10-23T22:54:49.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always keep my bushes warded when I have the gold to buy ward, I even ward the jungle when I get the chance, the problem I have is more often than not, my jungler is only farming, they won't gank, even on request for one. I get dived because of the enemy jungler being able to gank other lanes and get assists/kills, while all my other allies are requesting help too, but the jungler won't listen, pretty soon that one jungler is who we have to rely on to do anything and thats bad considering unless the enemy team is 100% incompetent, nobody can 1v5.","replies":[{"poster":"DadimPregnant","date":"2014-10-23T22:58:59.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I always keep my bushes warded when I have the gold to buy ward, \n\n1 quote to demonstrate the nubbery","replies":[{"poster":"Aids cuz League","date":"2014-10-24T10:07:25.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I refuse to buy sightstone.

You don't need sightstone to give vision, and even if its a team effort to ward, you have to make the effort to ward even if your team isn't.","replies":[{"poster":"Aids cuz League","date":"2014-10-25T21:36:54.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always ward for my team no matter where im at, I always have the gold to buy wards, I buy the wards, sometimes forget to place them cause im being spammed by pings by people who haven't warded. I just hate mad stoning because I do enjoy teamwork, mad stoning to me says: \"Let me be self obsessed so I can \"try\" to carry us through the game.\" More often than not, they don't because the enemy jungler actually ganked, and 5 fed people is stronger than 1 farm heavy mad stoned person. To me, its literally crap way to play, and although playstyles vary, this is one playstyle im highly against. Even if I am winning lane, or our whole team is winning lane, the jungler should be getting jungle creep, and ganking, yes, but not spending the entire game in the jungle. I've lost so many games because thats all they do.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nucleophilic atk","date":"2014-10-23T22:34:16.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.
