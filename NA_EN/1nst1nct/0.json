Please riot fix this the skins feel so much better with the effects. I used to could install them myself but it was considered a custom skin and as we all know it is rip. Please and thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-04-03T17:20:20.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey 1NST1NCT!

Watch when he autos there is a brown line that follows the sword tip. Also on the classic skin the particles are all there. Also this issue has been on reddit for awhile now.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKmtjZ4jTA\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/YasuoMains/comments/4la0wp/yasuo_particles_fix_guide/\n\nAlso the best way to see the difference is use bloodmoon OR classic yasuo in the practice tool and compare it with high noon or project right after. There are VERY obvious differences such as:\ne q circle missing\nauto particles missing\nsome q differnces\nmini tornado underneath a knocked up target missing.\n\nI love the high noon asthetic and it just feelsbad that this issue HAS been known forever and I cant fix it myself.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-04-05T22:52:41.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a bunch! :) I'll dig into this and sync with a VFX artist. ^^","replies":[{"poster":"1NST1NCT","date":"2018-04-07T00:56:45.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey man I know this isn't the place for this.
