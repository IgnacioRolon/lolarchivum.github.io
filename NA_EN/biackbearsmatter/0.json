They have now banned two known accounts with no Good reason and with no chance of appeal. when you contact support for any reason they just love to permanently ban your account. here are two examples (personal and a friend)\n\nCase 1: contacted support due to account being hacked and region being changed from NA to EU West. after about two emails they determined there was account sharing or attempt to sell the account and permanently banned the account and will not reverse for any reason.\n\nCase 2: Contacted support due to no longer being able to access old email and would like to change email to a new updated one. with a few emails back they decided to Permanently ban this account and when attempted to appeal was told there was not enough info to reverse and is permanently banned. previously before he played with no issues \n\nHas anyone else experienced this?\n\n\nIs there any other Riot employee who would review this?\n\nhttp://i67.tinypic.com/2e2ic2h.jpg[/IMG]\nhttp://i65.tinypic.com/2mhaple.png[/IMG]\nhttp://i67.tinypic.com/28tulc.png[/IMG]","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-14T03:08:15.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I'm not an accounts specialist, I cannot review these for you.
