Akali's energy cost on the q was main problem, since it let her poke out basically every melee champion which was the reason she has seen so much play.\n\nThe fact that the q spam hasn't been nerfed until now is really sad.\n\nPersonally in my opinion I would of like Akali to have gotten a shifted in power and now just nerfs and Riot has done a horrible job of what gets nerfed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2020-02-05T21:59:04.408+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=3xtrat3rr3strial,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3K4tPLck,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2020-02-05T21:50:46.949+0000)\n>\n> Go away hater.

Let me guess, you have a Riven challenger account that you totally have but arenâ€™t going to show but totally have to back up your claim?\n\nNo, you are saying this because Riven historically beats you so you ignore all evidence supporting any statement that doesnâ€™t fall in line with your view of her. Do you know what Rivenâ€™s Win rate has been at your elo? 44 to 46 percent, not counting current patch because it has only been a day, but let me guess Iâ€™m not allowed to use those numbers.\n\nMy point is that people here never consider the flip side, they never consider others mains. They just whine based purely off nothing but conjecture, look for an echo chamber for people to whine alongside them, ignore every piece of evidence against it and ESPECIALLY never put their money where their mouth is and actually play these OP champions because they would rather sit in their squalor and be right then risk playing the champion and learning they are wrong. \n\nIâ€™m tired of it, this place doesnâ€™t want balance, it wants fun so if this place wants to ruin champions based off such, so be it, I just want people to remember that when it is their champion on the chopping block.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"McDonaldsTrumpet","date":"2020-02-05T21:52:39.474+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Agreed!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Janakin","date":"2020-02-05T22:13:51.053+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> one of the coolest champions in the game\n\nthis is when i started vomiting and had to downvote","replies":[{"poster":"Scarlett Gray","date":"2020-02-05T22:18:04.758+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Janakin,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3K4tPLck,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2020-02-05T22:13:51.053+0000)\n>\n> this is when i started vomiting and had to downvote\n\nWhy exactly did you feel the need to type that?
