The game would then Reopen, and bugsplat again at the same moment in launch. I tried a fresh reinstall, along with a repair, I've updated my graphics card drivers, virtually everything I could do, yet I still cannot open the client without a bugsplat. It crashes before the login screen even loads, and the bugsplat reports keep piling on. Please help me, and thank you. :)","replies":[{"poster":"ßööm","date":"2017-09-23T22:10:52.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Start league of legends with the \"Run as Administrator\" option.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dubito","date":"2017-09-23T21:22:45.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue. The only way I can stop it from reopening is by ending the task via the task manager before it crashes.
