{"poster":"Blanxz","date":"2016-08-04T17:22:41.846+0000","title":"Frame rate is TERRIBLE after 6.15","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I've been playing league on my recently built gaming pc for a while now, and right as I downloaded 6.15 I've been experiencing some frustrating issues that have to do with the frame rate in game. I have an AMD RX 480, Core i-5 quad-core processor, running on windows 10 64-bit. Now you may be wondering, what is this guys problem he has a sweet setup, well, when i first downloaded the patch the frame rate has been really wonky. If i leave it uncapped, it goes to like 440fps my character teleport around as i try to move back and forth in a fast way. So I capped it at 80 to see if it would fix it, it did. Once the patch came out, however, even if i leave the fps uncapped, the game will still perform at 30fps or lower. The number on screen stays at either whatever i cap it at goes higher if i leave it uncapped. Last night i tried to restart my computer to see if that would fix it, it did, for about 3 minutes. This has been very frustrating because if has been severely affecting my play becasue the screen has a really bad delay from when i move my mouse to when the screen moves (it also doesnt help im playing on a tv instead of a monitor). I've done everything, followed directions from the league support page, repaired, even uninstalled and reinstalled but nothing is working. If any of you are having similar and found a solution please tell me so i can finally get back to playing league. Thank you!\n\nTLDR; After 6.15 my fps on screen says its at whatever i cap it at like 60, 80, 100, etc. but its actually performing at 30 fps or lower, I've done everything including repair, uninstall and reinstall, and followed all the directions on the riot support page, please if you have a solution tell me, Thanks!\n\nEdit: So it turns out I actually wasnt running most of my games in 60 fps, when I first build my pc, the edges of the screen were not matching the actual edge on my monitor, so I used the AMD settings and turned HDMI scaling to 5% to fit the edges of the screen. This was what was preventing me from running some games in 60fps. So I switched it to 0% and the edges didnt fit again, but my tv has a way to change the aspect of it from normal, wide, zoom, so I put it at full 100% setting and it fixed all my fps problems in all my games. I'm sorry but I wasn't having the same problems as you guys, I don't know the solution if this doesn't fix it for you :(","replies":[{"poster":"Miamenta","date":"2016-08-04T18:46:54.867+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, \n\nI had the exact same issue after updating to 6.15.

I don't have a high end machine, but i can actually play the game at +60 FPS. These days, i can barely see 30 FPS, i mean, it goes down to 1, 2 or even 0 FPS at the point it's impossible to play, and in top of that, it stutters and freezes my screen :(","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-04T23:47:18.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the troubleshooting so far and trying the support page article.

I wish I had a solution, but I cant figure out what it is. Another weird thing thats happening is if I change the resolution, it just goes back to the fps I'm normally at, but obviously it isn't the right resolution so it looks horrible. What is also weird is that the recommended resolution is something like 3260x2000 ish or something. But still the recommended resolution isn't 1920x1080, which is what my monitor is using. Whenever I turn my computer on after resetting or waking it up from sleep mode, League runs at the same fps it was before the patch, it works at the desired fps for about 2-4 matches depending how long they are then just goes back to 30.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Failekanos","date":"2017-06-25T00:02:45.377+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DGChrisman,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=TTrIw26l,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-08-04T17:22:41.846+0000)\n>\n> So I&amp;#039;ve been playing league on my recently built gaming pc for a while now, and right as I downloaded 6.15 I&amp;#039;ve been experiencing some frustrating issues that have to do with the frame rate in game.
