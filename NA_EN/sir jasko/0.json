The increase in quality does make some of the older content appear outdated. \n\nWe (skins team) have released more skins than ever this year, and at this time, we're focusing our efforts on newer content. Champion Update also has their hands full with some large scale reworks such as Poppy and Taric.","replies":[{"poster":"Hiemdol","date":"2015-09-11T21:14:14.870+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"I know that you are not the Rioter who is making the decisions about the pricing of a champions skins, that being said do you know about any discussion about restructuring any of the pricing of older once legendary skins.\n\nCho'Gath is an excellent example. He has two skins of a legendary tier in both Gentleman Cho and Battlecast Prime Cho. The former being of a glaringly lower level of design. A real shame as I think Gentleman Cho is one of the coolest skin in terms of concept despite the lack of execution when compared to Battlecast. \n\nWith the apparent disparity in quality which according to the official Riot price guidelines is the primary consideration for the pricing of skins why is a re-pricing not on the table similar to older Champions? Is it more Riot feels unwilling to tell players that have already purchased it the skin if not of a 1820 RP quality?  Is there fear that this is a bad precedent? Is it on the table and players are not in the loop yet?\n\nAs I said I know the skins team is not likely the team that decides these things but since you are available I thought I would ask for any insight on these kind of things as your post seemed to imply that the updating of skins is not a high priority at Riot at this time.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-12T00:36:36.439+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":3,"body":"Unfortunately, that's not something I can really speak to, as I'm involved with the development of the skins, as opposed to the pricing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2015-09-12T03:38:01.254+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"they have touched on this in the past actually.

They do not want to create a bunch of confusion and unnecessary fallout with those that have already purchased the older legendary skins by reducing their price even if they do refund the RP.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ArticFever","date":"2015-09-12T05:01:09.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"WAIT WAIT WAIT so your telling me the gems man is gonna drop the waffle feet and get a new shine to his dusty old rocks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tomatosx","date":"2015-09-12T02:52:05.845+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't forget Cassiopeia*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir Jasko","date":"2015-09-11T23:56:26.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your time, I hope this makes it on the agenda sometime in the next year or 2, perhaps in the off-season.
