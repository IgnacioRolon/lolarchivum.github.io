So I was wondering, and I know I probably won&#039;t get very far, where do I have to go to submit a skin concept, because I was thinking, Garen is basically the antithesis to Darius (Or vice-versa), and I Darius has his dunkmaster skin. I think it would be soooooooo awesome to give Garen a skin parallel to Darius&#039;s. And the skin that I was thinking would be an American Football themed Garen skin, and on top of that, you could build off of it by also having a Lux Cheerleader skin. Like I said, I know you guys at Riot probably won&#039;t ever think of doing it, but it&#039;s just something I wanted to say.\n{{sticker:garen-swing}}","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2018-03-19T13:04:49.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59fz2cuvXG4\n\nby the way, its funny that people associate garen with darius, because theyre so similar in their roles to their nations, and in playstile.\n\nbut {{champion:86}} original rival is {{champion:55}} \n\ni dont think it was ever mentioned in the lore of either garen or darius that they even once met.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDongerstarr","date":"2018-03-20T03:41:07.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you have a point, seeing as Kata was Garen's og rival, but now she's come to be like a forbidden love interest to Garen, and still I think it would be an awesome fit for him! :){{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-19T03:24:53.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Egads why.\n\nGaren is already annoying enough.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDongerstarr","date":"2018-03-19T03:45:02.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But you gotta be honest, it could be a really fun skin concept??{{champion:86}}","replies":[]}]}]}
