Note that each server, website or game you access resides in a different geolocation, so you could have issues with League while not having an issue with other sites/services. I recommend checking out our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for a list of steps that may resolve this for you.\n\nLet me know if those steps helped.","replies":[]}]}
