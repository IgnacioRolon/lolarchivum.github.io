The change made is purely for crit building ADCs (something that is objectively weak right now without a massive AD steroid) and nothing else.\n\nIf you want to make it on-hit focused, go all in on it. Make it 40% aspd 40 + 6% max health, and remove the AD. Lower the CD of the active on champion attack, give it 20-30% on-hit leech.\n\nWhat makes on hit weak right now is that they don't hurt towers. Same thing for crit. Everyone is building lethality because it offers on-item multiplicative scaling to all targets, including towers, AND it affects the power of abilities. Crit does nothing for towers, and most of the items are terrible for stat scaling.

I like to have a build that will zone anything away from me. Without the passive I'll get dived by the fed tank. And with the extra AS you can get atleast 1 extra hit in.\n\nAs for early game you don't need that much AD when it's paired with the passive even if the opponent has 500 health it's still doing a considerable amount of dmg when combined with the base AD of champs. For adcs it's a better all around pick than crit which can get stomped by a fed tank and a bad start to the game. But in games in which the tanks aren't fed then crit is better. As for melee champs, only the ones with good AD Scalings benefit , BUT tank shredding won't be nearly as good and to get to the backline often you can't ignore the front line.\n\nOntop of that the extra 20 AD when put up against damage reduction will only give you a couple more points of dmg vs a tank with atleast 2K health and around (40% dmg reduction a tank with about 600 gold lead) your only gonna deal about around 75 dmg per auto. Assuming you get Bork 1st item at around 15 minutes.\n\nChamp lvl at 15 mins is about 10-15 (if someone could tell me that would be awesome) but even at lvl 15 at 15 mins with Bork as first item for irelia fighting a tank with 40% dmg reduction she will only deal 65 dmg per auto. And she has higher AD per level and base AD than many adcs who on average have a base of 55 AD and 2.4 AD per level. AND they are duo lane so they are atleast a level behind the top laner and mid.
