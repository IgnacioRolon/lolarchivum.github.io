Now that you get revealed by being close to enemy champs and you still get revealed by wards, at least shave 0.5 seconds from that thing. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s already gonna bevery hard to pull of stealth escape, so a somewhat smaller activation timer would alleviate this a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-10-22T19:22:18.614+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've got a change along those lines in already for testing at present. Live Twitch's stealth takes between 1.5s and 4.5s to kick in based off damage taken. The Twitch update drops that to a flat 1.0s given the available counterplay of 'stay near him'.","replies":[{"poster":"Adalvar","date":"2016-10-23T03:05:25.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has it already been implemented, or will it be implemented in the next PBE update?\n\nAlso thank you for the reply Meddler","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-10-23T04:12:39.066+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should be on there now.","replies":[{"poster":"Adalvar","date":"2016-10-24T02:35:31.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the reply Meddler.\n\nIf i could still catch your ear, are you planning any changes to anti tank itemization such as Blade of the Ruined King?

I play a lot of Twitch (not on this account, but I do) and two of my favorite things are juking around people to make creative escapes and diving deep into the enemy team and ulting point-blank. I don't even KNOW of any other ways to play him. I've never seen anyone who does anything different with his stealth. How can you justify basically just gutting his entire playstyle like this?","replies":[{"poster":"Adalvar","date":"2016-10-23T15:57:23.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His stealth is much longer, the cast time is much lower, his W-E combo is much stronger now.\n\nYou can roam better and you can still go for the assassination combos...except now won't be able to go point-blank, which is wrong way to play Twitch anyway. Now you'll have to keep some distance, position better and kite back, which is what high level Twitch players do anyway.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CrazyBear1987","date":"2016-10-22T02:53:09.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i assume it's to stop the \"SUPRISE MOTHER F***ER\" when {{champion:29}} runs away only to hide in a bush and then \"spray n pray\" with the Q buff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bootleg Gay","date":"2016-10-22T02:50:30.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah, it's already hard to get away, but with the changes, it would be even harder to stay hidden. \n\nI'd love to see the total time reduced to 0.5 seconds flat.","replies":[]}]}
