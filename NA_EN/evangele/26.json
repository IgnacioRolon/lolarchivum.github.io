There&#039;s a bit of disconnect between moderation and posters here in GD and it&#039;s founded but also annoying. I&#039;d like to open it up a bit, involve you guys a bit more here and this is a good first step. Keep in mind, there are some things I wont be able to speak on for general privacy and user privacy, but I will answer everything to the best of my ability. Also please keep in mind, you might not like my answers, but I am not here to be abused or harassed and I likely wont answer to any of those types of situations, and they will likely be moderated (not by me). Criticism of me isn&#039;t harassment, so do not worry, I will not see it as such.\r\n\r\n**That being said, please feel free to ask about:**\r\nModeration\r\nTheories of Moderation\r\nModeration Team\r\nPersonal philosophies on Moderation\r\nGD Moderation\r\nUniversal Rules and GD Rules\r\n\r\n**Personal stuff about me**\r\nPersonal questions, but not too personal :^)\r\nLeague related BS about me\r\n\r\n**Please note I will also accept:**\r\nFeedback relating the program (well thought out non-asshat feedback)\r\nOpinions on what we can do to moderate GD better\r\nOpinions on what we can do to moderate everywhere better\r\nOpinions on how to train moderators better for dealing with GD\r\nGripes you might have\r\nThings that really grind your gears\r\nPosting Nami pictures\r\nPosting Mercy pictures\r\n\r\n**Most importantly, the ONE question I have for all of you:**\r\n\r\nWhat is something you think moderators should know about GD Culture?\r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\nThanks everyone, your participation is appreciated and NEEDED.\r\nEva","replies":[]}
