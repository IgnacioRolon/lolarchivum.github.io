I&#039;m on skype at the time talking so I know there&#039;s nothing wrong with my internet. \r\n\r\nFinally it lets me into the game, I buy items and go to go to my lane (bot) and instead, it heads me straight up mid lane to the enemy nexus.  I click everywhere bu there, but it keeps walking me up an through so I die to the turret and Fizz (effectively giving him first blood and losing mid for our Ahri). I quit and load in again, it happens AGAIN. It shows the line as if I clicked there and told my champion to move there, but I did not. I close out and exit the game so that I dont feed another kill and try one more time.\r\n\r\nThis time it works, loads in and I can move my champion around, but it&#039;s extremely slow and I have higher ping.\r\n\r\nCan&#039;t stress enough that my internet is fine during all this. Speed test fine, everything else fine. Husband is on his computer and nothing lagging nothing bad happening.\r\n\r\nSo strange, and effectively lost us the game because Im low elo and my Ahri couldnt fight against the fizz with one kill and my lane partner was having problems bottom without me trying to load in and being so slow. Sucks to lose a ranked that way.\r\n\r\nAnyone else have this issue or know of it? It almost felt like the game was hijacked, but seems impossible. Either way it was a horrible experience :(","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2015-04-18T17:23:32.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} :( Cannot edit the name to fix it -.-","replies":[]}]}
