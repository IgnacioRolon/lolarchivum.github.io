GD Wardens talked about this thread for the entire time it was up. Disagreements happened and GD Wardens decided to leave it up for the time being and monitor the comments.\r\n\r\nOn it&#039;s head the thread already put itself in a precarious position when it brought in feminism, but some of the GD Wardens believed that it seemed to be more along the lines of the social issue of what does and does not constitute harassment. For a while the thread focused there but with the undertones of feminism. Wardens thought perhaps if the thread catered more towards that side of the conversation it would be generally ok but as we all well know, sometimes things don&#039;t work out the way we want them to. \r\n\r\nWardens spoke about it this morning and still could not come to a general consensus. It was brought to me for a decision. I decided the thread should go. Not because I want to stifle your guys&#039; opinions on these types of things and not because I do not believe in your ability to have these conversations but because the general discussion rules do not allow for the discussion of gender related social issues.\r\n\r\nFor those that believe we took to long to act on this one, we apologize, it was a very contentious issue for GD Wardens and it took a lot of discussion, a lot of disagreements. Wardens wanted to do the right thing here.\r\n\r\nFor those that believe the thread was fine and should remain, I apologize, I believe it goes against the GD Guidelines and it was an unhealthy discussion. Please direct your disappointment in my direction.\r\n\r\nIf there is any concern about this decision, you are 100% free to let me know here or to come to the Boards discord and talk to me about it. I am currently recovering from a 104degree fever from some fun tonsillitis so I might be a bit slow on responses but I **will** respond.\r\n\r\nThanks for your ever understanding nature guys. \r\nEva","replies":[]}
