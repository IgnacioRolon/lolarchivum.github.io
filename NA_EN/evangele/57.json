More Marai would be preferrable and it could be that Nami manipulates it for them, or perhaps they have a way to transform to appear more humanoid in some ways and spells push them into Marai for (think Gnar's transformation but more slinky and wateresque).\n\nI think there's a lot of ways they could manipulate it to make it work, but they are such a cool idea set/species/race of champions that I think it would be a waste for it to JUST be Nami (no matter how amazing she is).\n\nWho knows with the retcon of the lore though, lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-05-09T20:04:52.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Evangele,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=RuQUUpWE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-05-09T19:56:33.073+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:267}} Yeah, I think it's been said that other creatures live with the Marai and in the oceans of Runeterra (see Fizz) and I would really love to see some more along that vein.
