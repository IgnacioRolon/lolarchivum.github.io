Doublelift has been a major influence in this wonderful game and community for an incredibly long period of time and it is with sadness that we have to offer our condolences to him at this time.\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/TLDoublelift/status/980626955878969344\r\n\r\nWhile we understand this is very surprising and shocking news for many people, we must also remember that this is a very private and sensitive matter for those who are closely involved. We ask that Boards respect the privacy of Doublelift, his family, and his friends.\r\n\r\nThis post will only house condolences and well-wishes. Any other comments posted in this discussion outside of that will be deleted. **We will tolerate absolutely -zero- jokes, insensitive comments, or making light of this situation.** Doing so will result in your **permanent** suspension from these Boards. Please do not post any further links or any speculative comments, these will also be met with removals.\r\n\r\nWe understand that you all may have mixed feelings about this decision, and if you wish to speak to a Moderator at any time about it, please join us on our Moderation Discord.\r\n\r\nThat being said, our deepest sympathies go out to Doublelift.\r\n\r\n_The NA Volunteer Moderation Team_","replies":[]}
