What makes it/them special to you and what do you hope for the role or champion in season 5?\r\n\r\nI play support because I love being the one that stops my carries from being incinerated. I love the feeling I get when I save someone from Akali or Zed. I love the duality of bot lane and the teamwork involved in being alongside someone for the entire duration of a game. As for a champion, I've loved Nami since the day she was announced. There's posts on old GD of me obsessing since then it hasn't stopped yet. She's interesting to play, she is strong, and her skins are gorgeous. She's an interactive support and you cannot just sit back and do nothing. Love love love Nami :)\r\n\r\nHow 'bout you?","replies":[]}
