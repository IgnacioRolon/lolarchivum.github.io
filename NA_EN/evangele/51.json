Ultimately I made the decision to agree and come on as one of the first moderators brought on during that time (though Arbiters existed before I). I was encouraged by the outline sent to me of why Riot wanted a user-ran moderation team. My strengths were not supposed to be in moderation actions themselves (though I did a damn fair amount of them) but in community support (mainly GD) and optics positioning for Boards changes and internal PR “analytics”. I was encouraged by the way Boards was spoken about, about creating a community and growing what we have into something better and effective and *fun*. People who could talk to the other Boards users and find out what was wanted and needed. \n\nThese are all things I want/wanted to do. I’ve been around posting on Riot’s forums (in both iterations) for a long ass time. From parchment yellow forums to the new barely functional beta boards. I found some amazing new friends here. I have art hanging in my child’s bedroom from the talented people that make up this place and who I have had the pleasure to get to know only because this community existed. I wanted to help foster that community in a way that would see it grow and continue to help others find what I found here. \n\nI want everyone to know that the majority of the time the Volunteer Mods have been at work here it has been because we wanted to serve the community and because we believed in the concept of a place that could be built. Most of us have folders and folders on our computers or shared google drive with outlines, code, suggestions, photos and infinite breakdowns of ways to help and improve what we can. There has been so many positive implementations and effects from these but many are still there or have not been acted upon not because the team doesn't wish to or doesn’t have the time to, but mostly because we…..just couldn’t. Either it is out of our scope of ability alone (ie we need Riot support to get it done- example being contests or Riot-led posting) or the Boards structuring wont allow it (ie: ability to move threads to another sub-board without deletion). There have been so many volunteer devs that have devoted *so so so so so SO* much time to just creating FUNCTIONAL tools for Boards users and for the moderation team in order to do the most basic of things. I am not someone who knows how to code at all so this stuff impresses the hell out of me. Every time they come up with a new way to add something that you would think would be standard on a forum but isn't on Boards, I just can’t help but be so appreciative of their time and effort in order to do that as *volunteers*.\n\nWhile I am 100% willing to take some of the blame for the situations we find ourselves in, I *personally* feel the main crux of a lot of it is Riot’s investment in the forums. I felt if we could create these spaces that Rioters wanted to include themselves in through moderation as well as community involvement then the Boards had a shot at becoming something truly great. When I joined on to do this damn thing, I really believed that this is something that Riot wanted as well. I believed that they were making an effort to reach out and let the community help forge something. Now, however, I'm not sure that Riot ever believed the same, or was willing to put in the amount of effort that would be needed in order to create that space. I will note that I am using Riot as a placeholder for the company as a whole and not for individuals. I -KNOW- there are individual Rioters who really did (at least at points in time) care about Boards and the community that exists here. I feel that as a person, and in all aspects of the things that I do, I try to look for positives and the positive way to feel about something. I feel that has probably shadowed a lot of the way I feel underneath about what I felt was happening but wanted to believe that what I was doing mattered to someone.\n\nBoards existing outside of a reddit like moderation screen was important to me. We were not made aware of certain decisions until extremely late in the game. Losing access to moderation messaging to Boards users was a surprise to everyone and personally a complete blocker for my moderating, as I will not shadow moderate. I know people will scream and shout about moderator bias or high levels of inhibiting their “freedom of speech” when posting on Boards, but the vast majority of mods were strictly against any sort of “no negative posts @ Riot” mentality. Of course, we had to moderate posts that were insulting as that violates the core values of Riot’s Universal Rules, but criticism that was done in a way that was respectful (can still be passionate without insults) was welcomed. We did have direction regarding certain things, but we were never told that we should not allow anyone to criticize Riot, and if we were, I would never have stayed on the team.\n\nI realize I am babbling, but really I just wanted to thank you all for existing and apologize that I couldn't personally do more to help in the time we were allotted. I believed at the time that we were working with the support and inherent approval of Riot and....maybe we were at the beginning, but we all now see how this Boards experiment has turned out. I know I could have done more, and I believe the team as a whole tried but just did not get to the places we needed to be ultimately. \n\nThank you to the other moderators and other volunteers on the team (our Specialists included) , past and present, for the time you devoted to something that you were passionate about. I am forever in awe that so many people with so many different heads on their shoulders were able to work together and the friendships I made with you mean so much to me.\n\nThanks to some Rioters, who know who they are, who posted on these Boards, who engaged with the community, who made a genuine and real effort to include this place when it would be so much easier to ignore and move to more positive-central forums as many have done. Thank you for those that we were fortunate to meet and work with on the Support Team. Some of the sweetest people I’ve met in the customer support business.\n\nAnd last, but not least, thank you to the community for existing and always being who you are, for better and for worse. I learned so much from you all, and I call some of you some of the best floppin' people Ive met. I encourage everyone to save your favourite posts and go back through old old GD incarnates to find those ones as well. Preserve the history for the next generations :^) For now, farewell but not goodbye. You all are amazing and I am grateful for the time spent with you. Well, most of you. &lt;3\n\n*TLDR: RIP Boards. Sry couldnt do more. Fkn Rito y u no support. Love everyone. Flop, floppity flop flop.*","replies":[]}
