I posted it a very long time ago and it got a lot of amazing posts in it from summoners(players?) and Riot members about the great things that happen in their games. I bump it when I have something exceptional happen and I will continue to do so here.\n\nTo outline my old thread, until Oct 6 it can be found here: **http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4275468**\n\n*\"*Give your shoutouts to those summoners that have made a difference for you in a positive way.\n\nI am getting super tired of seeing all these posts complaining about a player in a game or whatever else may have happened.\n\nI would like to give a shoutout to the jinx in one of my last ranked games. Thank you for following up on my support playing. Thank you for being smart and cool under pressure, forgiving when it was needed and agressive when the time called for it. Thank you for making me feel like the best support in the world because it made me play better and made me one smooth mofo when I flashed in front of you to save you from that Cait ult. Thank you.\n\n\nYour turn GD.\"**\n\nGood luck in future endeavours and much love to you all &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3","replies":[]}
