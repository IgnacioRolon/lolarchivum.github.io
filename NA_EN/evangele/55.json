We have opened up the rules a little bit more to give leeway to certain aspects of GD, including the Golden Rules on critique threads, the Rank Shaming qualifications as well as giving the Mature Content rule a wider berth for appropriate material without being as confusing as it used to be. Also tbh we made it look a little nicer and more in line with the new look of the Boards overall.\n\nAs always, we are around for questions and concerns, which you can post here if you wish to or join us on the [Moderation Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification).\n\n&lt;3\nNA Moderation Team.\n\nAlso including GD Ambassadors - 2nd Chance and Chickenwrap :)","replies":[]}
