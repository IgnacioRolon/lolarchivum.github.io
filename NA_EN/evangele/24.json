{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2014-10-07T21:50:47.868+0000","title":"@Riot, @Tamat, @GD","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":60,"down_votes":6,"body":"**{{champion:267}} I've thought about making this post for a while now, and I figured after what happened last night (that I was blissfully sleeping in bed unawares of) it might be the right time.\n\nI am going to make it very clear that this is strictly my opinion and as such, I do not expect everyone to agree with me and I definitely am accepting and tolerant of other viewpoints other than my own. I love open discussions and I will never tell you that your opinion is wrong, so please, feel free to engage with me and discuss this as well. This may be a long one, and I really do not believe in tl;dr's so if you do not want to read it, you do not have to. There will plenty threads to this same point that are shorter, it's just not how I express myself.\n\n**The GD vs New GD Debate and Why It's Important**\n\nThere has been a lot of talk since boards were the community beta, and even more since it was announced that yes, GD's new home would be on the boards and well, we better get used to it. I'm relatively new to the GD scene, probably coming up on 2 years since I even started glancing at it and about 1 since I've taken up active posting and made a few friends (I wont be offended if you do not know who I am.)\n\nGD has always been, from my experience, a world of it's own. It was generally League related but it cultivated a community of all sorts of ages, attitudes, and posting styles. While not always on topic, the majority of the posts alluded to league in some way and if not, were usually some sort of community \"enhancement\" (ie: circlejerks).  While GD has never been perfect, it certainly had become home for many posters.\n\nNew GD is foreign. It's a little of the same, a lot different. While still offering the bare bones ideals of what GD was to posters, Riot wanted to cultivate something different and have a more stable framework. It's a new system, a new core that can be expanded upon whereas old GD was at the point that there was nothing more that could have been done to make it better tech-wise (according to Riot).\n\nTo get to the over-arching point: *There seems to be a bit of a disconnect from what old GD was to what new GD wants to be.* Most posters seem to be on a scale of faint distaste to outright hatred. There are plenty of supporters, and plenty of folks who want to help make it better, but the loudest cries seem to be coming from those that are unhappy (as often happens). \n\nThis discussion is important, old GD members and new members alike, because this **IS** our new home and to help make it what we want it to be we need to make clear, concise and effective feedback. \n\nLet's take a moment and think about what made GD, GD (for a lot of people).\n\n**Legitimate, League Related Posting**\n\nHere are your normal, everyday posts.  This champion this, that champion that. Balance this, balance that. They made their home on GD as it was the board more or less frequented the most by active members of the forum community. Often these were insightful, meaningful and well thought out....sometimes not so much. They often requested help and advice. They often complained about elo hell. They quite often had amazing champion art and champion concepts! These we needed more of, that's for sure.\n\n**The Disguised Hentai Post**\n\nThese were lame. Lots of people like hentai, Im not one of them. I have no issues with people wanting to look at it, but I agree with Riot that it does not belong on the forums. There are people that may disagree with me here, but it's how I feel. That being said, they were a part of GD (often late night).\n\n**The Circlejerk**\n\nThis topic is one of much contention. There are people pro-circlejerk, people vehemenently against it and often people who couldn't care either way. Personally, I have never minded the circlejerks and I think they are kind of cute. They solidified the posters who frequented the forums, were often fun, sometimes illuminating and often hilarious. I saw them more as a \"this is us, we live here, let's celebrate it\". \n\nThe problems with the circlejerk occurs when they are:\n1. Way too many (spammed)\n2. Become rude in nature\n3. Are hurtful\n\nThere are ways to monitor our community to keep these from becoming displaying on of (in my opinion) the negatives of the circlejerk and it's our responsibility to help weed out that badness and replace it with the positives of the circlejerk.\n\n**The Sh!tpost**\n\nHere's where you'll find a lot of sour debate about old GD. The sh!tposters, those who post, often misleading on unclear threads that have little to do with league, or perhaps more than they should (looking at you sexy story posters). Those posts that are not meant to encite proactive, thoughtful discussion but instead some random viewpoint that often the poster does not even believe. There are your shock and awe posters, your \"Why did ______ champion crossed the street? To get to the freelo!\" posts. Your \"Nami is OP\" posts....;) ok maybe not that last one, but you know what I mean!\n\nThere is a fine line with sh!tposting. Most of the problems with sh!tposting do not come from the threads themselves but rather from the frequency, the spamming and the often demeaning nature of some of them (see: Diamond Overlords). While I understand the joking tone of a lot of these, where they aren't necessarily meant to inflict stress upon others, often they do and that is not truly acceptable. We are a community, from bronze to masters, we all are here, we all belong and we all have the right to talk about whatever we please. If you think Nami is OP, you are more than welcome to troll like that. ;)\n\nI think we can all agree that it is hella annoying to see 10 posts on the front page about Lissandra being broken, or supports being useless, or us low elo plebs not being able to talk, etc, etc. This is where the next item up for conversation arrives: Moderation\n\n**Moderation: From 0-100 Real Fast**\n\nOh Mods, you get so much hate, and your job is so thankless and hard. \n\nListen up GD, we like to complain about mods, their tactics, what they do, how they do it, the fact they have no face, the fact they do their jobs too well, their shoe choices, etc, etc, etc.  If there's something we can hit them for, we will. Think about that kind of pressure! It's a rough situation and I mean, as much as I love the community, Riot would have to pay me a lot of freakin' money to sit and read through all of your BS all day (but seriously Riot, hit me up). This is not to say you guys are perfect though.....\n\nThe singular fact is, old GD had crappy moderation. I don't know why, I don't really care why. The point is it sucked. Too many people got away with too much crap, too many people got threads closed or moved to GD graveyard (Off-Topic) for no reason, too many bans went out on people who did not do anything (as could be seen) that was outrageously inappropriate, it was inconsistent and it sucked! I don't know if there was some issues with training (as was alluded to) or there just wasnt enough clarity on ettiquete, Whatever it was, it wasn't working.\n\nLet's take that to the boards and new GD. We are taking people, forcibly, from an environment with excessive freedom and already engrained customs and placing them into a situation where you take away their perceived freedoms and where there are strict, restrictive forum mods who are more frequently present and more determined than ever. Seems like it will work, right? ;)\n\nThere's going to be a lot of pushback these first few weeks. There's going to be lots of hentai. There's going to be a lot of forum smurfs unbanned and ready to troll. There's going to be a lot of anger and a lot of misunderstandings and a **LOT** of tension. What the mods need to do here, is be clear, concise, fair and accountable. I have a feeling a lot of the posts that are so...out there against the rules are going to be by very few individuals...those individuals need to understand that this behaviour is not appropriate and they need to be warned and banned if it continues. \n\n*The community as a whole should not be punished for the actions of a few. *\n\nRiot made the decision to unban everyone who they previously banned. That was an active choice that was made by Riot, not by players and as such, I believe it is THEIR responsibility to clean up the mess that ensues.  Do **-NOT-** remove GD from the front of these boards because you cannot handle what happens because of choices you actively make. Do **-NOT-** place MORE restrictions on those of us posting here normally because of a few trolls. There are exceedingly more community members who are **NOT **posting this kind of stuff than there are that are actively breaking the rules. The blanket approach will not work here, and it will not sit well with those community members who are posting within the rules and guidelines you have already layed out.\n\n**Clear, Concise Rules and Guidelines**\n\nThere's a lot of \"huh?\" going around on what's ok and what's not. These need to be more clear, more concise (these words are a running theme) and definitely reworded more effectively.\n\nI recently saw a thread where this was being addressed, so I will leave it at that.\n\n**That Layout Tho**\n\nThere has been a lot of unrest about the layout of the boards and the colour scheme. I think this all comes down to personal taste. I like the colours. I do not find them hard to read or hard to look at for extended periods of time (omg I look at this way too much). I also have perfect vision, glasses specifically crafted for computer work, amazing eye health coverage (all benefits of my job at an Optometrists office) and I like greeny bluey black.\n\nI can understand why some people may not like them though and I think it is a valid complaint. I think Riot should work in a way where you can change the colour scheme without adding in something such as FEK to do it for you. Some people are not computer savvy enough to deal with FEK (as easy as it may be) and some people may just be uncomfortable using something like that in general. It should come standard with any extremely professional forum.\n\nThis boards list on the left hand side of the screen is what annoys me personally. It's big and bulky and as pretty as it may be, it is mostly just black space when Im scrolling down.....but I can get over that.\n\nReturn to top button would also be nice. It might exist and I might be blind (hey I got coverage for that!) but I would love it.\n\n*Taking a moment to thank the creators of FEK here. For those of us that use it, it is a godsend and it is a lot of work that you didn't HAVE to do, you dont CHARGE for and I know we all really, really appreciate it.*\n\nLet's wrap this up Eva...I know, I know.\n\n**Can New GD Be Old GD?**\n\nNo. It's not old GD. Old GD is archived and gone. \n\nYou know what? GOOD.\n\nNew GD is now. New GD is here. We have a responsibility as the new denizens of GDtropolis to make this place the best we can. We need to work WITH Riot to achieve this. We need to respect the rules that were put in place and we need to help Riot fine-tune those rules to fit in with the community and culture that GD represents. There are non-negotiables but there is also lots of room for that negotiation on what GD is to us and how to make it our new home.\n\nRiot needs to open it's ears and eyes as well. I know old GD might not have been your most favourite place to post Rioters, and I know sometimes it's easier just to say, \"No, you guys are wrong, a community should be this.\" but that doesn't change what this community actually IS right now. You need to work with us, communicate your thoughts and ambitions, work at making it a fun place for us AND you. We want to talk to you guys! You folks are living the dream, and while we dont always appreciate your decisions, we do understand that they are hard to make.\n\nWe all have a responsibility to make this place what we want it to be. We are all accountable for this new community and new board!\n\nLet's make it the best it can be, and work together to achieve it. Let's give CLEAR AND CONCISE (there they are again) feedback and let Riot know what is working and what is not. \n\nI pledge to do that. Can you pledge to do it?\n\nCan Riot pledge to offer us the support we need and respond to well thought out threads? \n\nWe can do it you guys. :)\n\nGood luck in all endeavours, and much love to you &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3\nEvangele.\n\nP.S.
