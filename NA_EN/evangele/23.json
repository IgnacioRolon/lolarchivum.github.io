This includes updates for Gameplay, as well as for some of the smaller sub-boards, including Memes &amp; Games, which is what this post will be detailing and requesting feedback on. Unfortunately, because we are a volunteer team and our schedules can differ, it sometimes takes longer (much longer) for certain things to make their way down through the tubes to becoming actionable change. \r\n\r\nI wanted to first apologize, as I had originally in June of 2019 given some boards users a tentative date for this update of approximately end of July 2019, however, I had some personal issues come up where I ended up solo parenting for the majority of June and July 2019 as my husband is military and he was off doing military things more than we had expected. As I was pushing the lead on the Memes&amp;Games rule updates and made myself responsible for them at the time, it's my fault  I did not ask someone else to handle it or devote to it the time needed while I was alone. My fault entirely, but here we are.\r\n\r\nI've worked on these rules through most of August, gotten through a few iterations and changes to them in order to clarify some positions and add in newer guidelines for certain types of posts, but I feel we are currently at a place where we can put forth these rules to you guys and get some feedback before the update. Please keep in mind that rules cannot actively have notations for every situation that COULD appear on a sub-board and they will always be guidelines in general and not completely hard and fast (outside of rules about hate speech, inappropriate content such as porn, etc etc). Moderation discretion will always exist for fringe cases and for certain things that may ride the line. \r\n\r\nThat being said, please keep responses and feedback here courteous and respectful. While I can understand frustration at the length of time that these updates have taken, I will not be responding to any vitriolic posts or off-topic commentary about other Moderation actions or team members.\r\n\r\nI will post the new guidelines in the first comments here and pin them. Please response in new comment strings with feedback, questions or general discussion about these updates.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help and feedback,\r\nEva","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-08-31T20:22:24.338+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"####**_~~Overview of Memes and Games~~_**\n\n\nMemes &amp; Games is a sub-board dedicated to the following four categories:\n\n* Memes\n* Jokes\n* Forum Games (Contests, D&amp;D etc)\n* Obvious Satire\n\n>Any thread whose core purpose and intent does not match one of these categories will be removed and redirected to a more appropriate sub-board. This means simply including a meme or gif does not inherently make the post appropriate for Memes and Games. The main idea behind the post must itself be appropriate.\n\n\nPost must adhere to Memes and Games Format Guidelines:\n\n* Written Content, Images, Gifs, and Videos are appropriate\n* Videos must be no longer than 1 minute maximum - if your video is longer than this, you should instead post on the [Streams and Videos](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/league-videos) sub-board \n\n>Threads must not rely on readers going to an outside source. This means if the image/gif does not link correctly, the thread will be deleted. \nIf you need help with Boards functionality regarding posting images/gifs, please review this [User Guide](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/LwiE97JE-user-guide-posting-images-and-gifs-on-the-boards)\n\n\n\n\n\n####**_~~Rules and Guidelines~~_**\n\n* All posts on Memes and Games must adhere to the [Boards Universal Rules](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/ITFIpNUE).\n* Posts that do not follow these guidelines will be removed, and punishments may be issued. Memes and jokes which rely on insults or sexual vulgarity are never appropriate.\n\n\n_**~~Forum Games~~**_\n\nIt is acceptable to run a contest, but the coordinator will need to create one main post that players will then post their submission in. Separate standalone posts will be removed and redirected, so make sure as the contest creator that you're providing proper guidelines for posting in your contest thread.\n\nForum-based RPG - It is acceptable to run a D&amp;D-style campaign fully on the Boards; however, you will want to have the DM create the official post, and then all interaction will need to be done inside that post and not in separate posts.\n\nComments derailing and ignoring the topic or flow of a game thread will be removed to preserve its fun and fluidity.\n\n\n_**~~ Satire~~**_\n\nSatirical posts are allowed on Memes and Games. However, the satire must be *abundantly* obvious, and the core point of the post must be humor. It is a good idea to state in your post that it is satire to avoid confusion. If a moderator doesn’t recognize it immediately as satire, it was not clear enough and will be removed.\n\nSatire can sometimes be hard to convey, but for the purposes of the Boards, satire will be considered:\n\n* Making fun of champions, Riot games, other players, balance decisions, etc,  by using silly or exaggerated language.\n\n* As per the Cambridge Dictionary: “a way of criticizing people or ideas in a humorous way” or a “humorous way of criticizing people or ideas to show that they have faults”\n\n    \n_**~~ Community-centric Posts~~**_\n\nPosts made directly to or about specific users are allowed, so long as the post does not contain harassment, and is appropriate for the M&amp;G section.\n\n* For example, a Meme about a user would be acceptable (\"Evangele playing Garen\")\n* A meme directed at a user would be acceptable (\"@Evangele: You when you play Garen\")\n* A non-meme post directed at a user is not acceptable (\"@Evangele: Want to play a game later?\")\n* A meme post insulting a user is not acceptable (\"@Evangele: You are a jerk\")\n\n\n\n> **Please be aware that while positive intentioned memes or satire related to other users or Rioters are appropriate, there can always be a line where they become hurtful and offensive, even when not intended to be such. The Moderation team will take this into consideration when moderating threads of this nature and action may be taken regarding posts we feel step over that line. The safest bet for making posts like these are to err on the side of positivity and respect and always follow the Universal Rules.**\n\n\n\n\n\nAs always, if you have any questions about these Guidelines, you can contact the Moderation Team via:\n\n* [Discuss the Boards](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation) sub-board\n* [Boards Moderation Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Credit due to Melledoneus and Laughing Fish for previous iterations of the guidelines that have been adapted into this edition.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2019-08-31T21:12:05.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have a number of thoughts on M&amp;G.\n\n* I don't think posts directed at other players should be found there.

I'd also like to hear from community members if \"playful banter\" is something they want.\n* Why are we being specific with a \"D&amp;D-style game\"? Would any RPG be allowed? I would think [Amber Diceless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Diceless_Roleplaying_Game) could be modified for Runeterra and the results would probably be awesome.\n* Has anyone actually ever run a RPG in M&amp;G? Given that M&amp;G is ostensibly the home of League-related roleplaying other than the play-by-post versions found in the Roleplaying Board, would it be okay for people to \"advertise\" for League-related roleplaying Discords or online tabletop formats like Roll20? My feeling is that such things are probably better for GD.\n* I feel we should be explicit in that anything which is inherently insulting is not funny by definition. We would tolerate stuff that might be found on America's Funniest Home Videos, but that would be about the limit.\n* Have we asked the community how they feel about removing downvoting on M&amp;G?","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-09-03T12:43:30.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ulanopo,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=j5HvaVxK,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-08-31T21:12:05.756+0000)I don't think posts directed at other players should be found there.
