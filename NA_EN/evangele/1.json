What did you enjoy the most and why? Doesn't necessarily have to have come out this year, but something you discovered.\r\n \r\nWhat would you recommend people pick up and play? Last few days of the Steam Sale (and Origin, etc) so might as well see what's worth it!\r\n \r\nAlso what were your biggest letdowns?\r\nWhat are you looking forward to trying out?\r\n \r\n**I personally loved:**\r\n1. Dragon Age: Inquisition (story, characters, environments, etc beautifully done)\r\n2. WoW: Warlords of Draenor Xpac (lots of fun, one of my favourite WoW xpacs)\r\n3. Dustforce (fun platforming and has amazing music as well)\r\n4. Far Cry 4 (pretty much identical to 3 but still loved it)\r\n\r\n**Disappointed with:**\r\n1. Watch_Dogs\r\n2. Sims 4\r\n\r\n**Looking Forward to:**\r\n \r\n1. Wasteland 2 - just picked it up on a Steam Sale, heard it was great :)\r\n\r\nLet me know your guys' picks :)","replies":[]}
