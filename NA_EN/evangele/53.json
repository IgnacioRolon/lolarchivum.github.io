The whole situation has made me a little sad and so my best solution was to look at some amazing Nami art and some great reasons why you love Nami!\r\n\r\nIf you don't love Nami, please let me know what champion you do love and why! Also give me some art of them for my folders.\r\n\r\nAs per usual, please keep it GD appropriate (keep in mind new GD rules that are being adhered to).\r\n\r\nMuch love &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3\r\n\r\nhttps://33.media.tumblr.com/dadedef9d5528e666c7a23197d69defe/tumblr_nczc8aUpZ41ts5shio1_1280.jpg","replies":[]}
