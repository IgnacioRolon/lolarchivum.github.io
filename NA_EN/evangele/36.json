I main support and I love it. Wouldn't want to go to any other lane or have any other job, it's just who I am, but lately I have been getting BEYOND frustrated with all the Annie's bopping around in bot lane.\n\nWhile I understand what she does, in theory, I am currently trying to understand what to DO about it. It's not that I am personally having an issue with her in my play, but there seems to be a lot of people who are not understanding the amount of burst she has and how she does it. Whether she is in mid or bot lane, the flash Tibbers stun is murdering the crap out of my team. \n\nI don't know enough about balance (silver/gold elo) to really make a call on if there is something out of line with her, but she feels so damn OPPRESSIVE when she is in a game. It seems as if she can single handedly cause her team to win, even if you have them on the run and they are very behind.\n\nWhile I cannot control others and their actions, I am just looking for general advice on how to handle Annie in games, be it mid lane or bot, just to see if there are any ideas out there.\n\nI could also be crazy and it's just me having this issue. Any advice is welcome.\n\nThanks, much love \n\nedit: Jesus, I didn't see the 900 Annie threads today, apparently I am not alone.....","replies":[]}
