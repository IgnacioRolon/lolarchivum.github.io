Is there any of them that you would modify to better suit the champions over all feel?\r\n\r\nI personally think that Miss Fortune's kit isn't 100% there for me. While I like her passive and her ultimate, I think the other abilities lack a personality that ties them to her. I can kind of see it, but I think there could be something more. I like that double up provides some fun but perhaps I'm just missing something.\r\n\r\nAnyone got another champion that just doesn't match up for them?","replies":[]}
