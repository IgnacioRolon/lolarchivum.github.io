Is it complete garbage? Is there something worth saving? Are explosions and loud noises all it really needs to survive and be good?\r\n\r\nWith the new movie coming out I chose to sit and watch the other ones over a few weeks just to try to get &quot;caught up&quot; on the &quot;story&quot;. Im a pretty laid back person when it comes to my movies but I found myself distracted pretty often by almost anything else happening in my vicinity.\r\n\r\nDo you think the new movie will be worth it?  What do the previous movies suffer from (other than Shia LaBeouf)?  Were you a fan of the original cartoon and toys etc and now are just crushed by this trash (my husband&#039;s opinion).\r\n\r\ngenerally discuss pls.","replies":[]}
