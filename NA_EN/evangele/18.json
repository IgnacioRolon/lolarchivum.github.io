This would obviously only be for your team and would be very helpful in A) helping dodge if you are going to get trolled and B) legitimately be able to tell someone YOU DONT HAVE A KEYSTONE PICK ONE if they forget.\r\n\r\nI dont see how it could hurt and it only seems beneficial considering the type of things Ive been seeing non-stop in BS silver where all the newly placed accounts and trolls head to.\r\n\r\nJust a thought.","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2016-04-11T11:26:42.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Random down vote with no post about why you disagree.
