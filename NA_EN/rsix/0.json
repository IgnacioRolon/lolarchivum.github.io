I can play a game perfectly fine and not have this happen once, but the very next game could have this happen multiple times. When this happens my lights on my router go out and my internet drops completely. This has been happening for over a month and it is very frustrating losing lp to whatever this is. And it's not like I can tell if its going to happen in game before I queue up or not, I have started to use ping tests before games for this very reason and everything could be fine but 2 minutes into a game boom 500ms and I'm dead or lost 3-4 waves and really far behind.  I've called my internet company (mediacom) multiple times and they've sent someone out to check connections and replace my router and they continue to say everything should be ok. Please help. Tired of losing lp due to 500ms.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-11T23:34:14.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mention a router in your post; does this mean you're using WiFi? If so, can you try switching to a wired (ethernet) connection and see if anything changes? If you aren't on WiFi and still have this issue, ensure your network settings are up to spec by using our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). \n\nLet me know if anything changes.","replies":[]}]}
