STOP","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","embed":{"description":"Hey guys, we're back with the final Champion Roadmap of the year. This season, the Champions Team has been focusing slightly more on VGUs and slightly less on new champs, so I won't be mimicking the last couple blog posts exactly. Instead, I'll be focusing mostly on the upcoming VGUs.","url":"https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/08/champion-roadmap-august-2018/","image":"https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/LOL_CMS_225_Social_1200_fb1tppkkk8o5of7pzy0w.jpg"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":28,"body":"Look, there have been way too many reworks recently that don&#039;t need to happen, or at least don&#039;t need to happen to the extent that they are. For example, reworking Aatrox from the ground up didn&#039;t seem necessary. Also, when you do that it just feels like you&#039;re shitting on the efforts of the people who initially created the champ. I think a big problem with this game right now is... overproduction. Like one of my favorite things about League is how dynamic it is, but Riot is making it impossible to keep up with itself. I read in the new Champion Roadmap that they&#039;re giving Nunu more of a whimsical feel. Why? Who wanted that? And how could it possibly be necessary? Did you ask players at all, Riot? And who said that Kayle&#039;s abilities need to be reworked at all. WHAT WAS THE CRITERIA YOU USED WHEN DECIDING TO DO THESE THINGS. It&#039;s like when they turned Varus into a douchebag without telling anyone. Honestly, Riot should just stop making new champs altogether, for at least a full season. How about fixing the things that need to be fixed, that everyone knows need to be fixed, instead of just adding more variables to the equation through new champs and reworks, forcing everything to go farther off course than it already has been for some time now.\n\nEDIT: For anyone who says Kayle is old and unpopular, she's been S-tier in 3s for years, and quite popular there. I understand that the Treeline community is a fraction of the overall league population but to call Kayle archaic or weak is a stretch.\n\nEDIT: People still don't understand the message of this post. I'm not saying that there's an inherent problem with reworks. My MAIN point is that, in League's current situation, there are WAY BIGGER PROBLEMS to focus on than changing champs that don't NEED to be changed. If Zoe was fine, and damage wasn't an issue, and turrets weren't a joke, and on and on and on, THEN sure, maybe let's see what's good with a Nunu rework. And then the champs that they add and the reworks they create just EXACERBATE the problems that they haven't dealt with.\n\nEDIT: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/FPZwWoeG-know-what-think-ive-had-enough-for-this-season \n^^^\n\nFor anyone who still doesn't understand my point, click on that link and look at all the problems being discussed and hopefully you'll have a better understanding of what I'm trying to say. It isn't the time for reworks. It's just not.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2018-08-07T18:44:46.904+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I read in the new Champion Roadmap that they're giving Nunu more of a whimsical feel.

That's a different team and department. You're complaining about game health and balance in a board about art and stories.\n\n2.) Riot took a pass at turrets and how they operate a few seasons ago.  Remember how inhib turrets use to hit you with a constant laser beam? Yeah...that didn't last long.  Or what about the fact that they changed the cold to where, now the turrets attack you if you damage it's ally champion...period.  Before both of you have to be under turret.
