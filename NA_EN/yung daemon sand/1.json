Imagine if they made changes as dumb as the ones they&#039;ve been making, in season 4. It would look like madness. Because to me, back then Riot seemed like a fair government: they weren&#039;t perfect, but they did what they could to make the most people happy. Now, it seems more like a corrupt dictatorship run by a person on all the drugs 24/7. Now, we see +100% ratio yas buff (I know it got reverted) and it&#039;s barely even insane. Why? Because we&#039;re used to seeing stupid stuff now. Why? Because they&#039;re sabotaging the game. Like a dude posts a video of an mf taking 80% of a xayah&#039;s health with one Q, and it&#039;s not even addressed? It makes sense especially when you consider that they&#039;re developing other projects. It&#039;s not just a possibility; it&#039;s literally the only _rational_ explanation.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-08-09T12:15:25.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I Don't like arguing one point when theres a broader picture, but:\n\neven since the seasons 6 miss fortune update, she has always remained like this, its only with the intruduction of lethality her abilities went downhill.\n\nbut miss fortunes damage is not something you can address, becuase its part of her essential laning kit, to remove it is like to remove all of sorakas heals, or have kled dismounted forever, they lose their selling point.\n\ndamage can be nerfed, but a large pecentage will make her too weak in lane, a small percentage won't change her winrate.\nthey already indirectly nerfed her, by nerfing lethality and buffing Assassins, the people who SHOULD build those.\nits just the fact that adcs this day and age don't rush thornmail 3rd item like i used to, an adc can't be tanky while doing damage at the same time(look away from urgot everyone), its usually better just to practice your prediction as opposed to playing urgot against MF.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-08-09T11:51:53.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The things that laid up to most of these changes were asked for.","replies":[{"poster":"Yung Daemon Sand","date":"2018-08-09T11:57:32.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea but there's so much dumb shit that people didn't ask for... nothing done about Zoe, nothing done about Yas except almost buffing him, 10 people in a game with ignite, super weenie hut jr. turrets, etcetcetc","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-08-09T12:09:19.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yung Daemon Sand,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qxjJoMuB,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-08-09T11:57:32.282+0000)\n>\n> Yea but there&#x27;s so much dumb shit that people didn&#x27;t ask for... nothing done about Zoe, nothing done about Yas except almost buffing him, 10 people in a game with ignite, super weenie hut jr. turrets, etcetcetc\n\nZoe , I agree with you, Yasou, meph, depends, high elo he is still seen as subpar, 10 ignites, meph, weaker turrets, also inadvertently asked for as people whined about how horrible long drawn out games were.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
