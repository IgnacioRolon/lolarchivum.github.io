My connection is fine everything else works.. Btw it takes a long time to login as well and then when i'm logged in sometimes for the news section i get a thing that says something like \"please retry news is down\" or something like that and i can't lock in my champion until like 5 seconds before the timer runs out!! I have contacted Support but I haven't gotten anything yet and i'd really like to know if anyone else has had this problem! Thank you!!! - Karley :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-27T02:18:02.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you're describing are fairly common symptoms of *Packet loss*, which occurs if your connection to our servers is *poor or unstable*.
