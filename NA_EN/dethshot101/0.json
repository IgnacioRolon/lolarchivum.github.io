I locked in and waited for the game to start. Once the timer hit 0, I was kicked back into the lobby and got a dodge timer. I don't know what caused it. My hands were off the keyboard, off the mouse, and only a youtube video was going on in the background (on a second monitor) \r\n\r\nThis has happened multiple times now and it getting really frustrating cause dodge timer keeps going up. (currently at 30 minutes) \r\n\r\nI would make a bug report, but when I try to submit those, it just give me an error with processing the report.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-13T04:18:30.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The symptoms you're experiencing are pretty typical to that of an **unstable connection** to our matchmaking servers.
