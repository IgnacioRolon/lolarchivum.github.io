I had fun because there were 9 other &#039;toxic&#039; players in my game and everyone was having a blast. Everyone was calling each other cucks and we were all shakin each others d&#039;s after the game. I was told to suck ahri&#039;s dick. My support told braum to shove that OP sheild up his ass. Our lee sin kicked braum&#039;s sheild into braum&#039;s ass. The enemy blitzcrack brought teleport and only tele&#039;d to deep wards and said that she was gonna fist us. It was great.\r\n\r\nI lied because most games its just people spamming all chat &quot;report x player for being x reason&quot;. Why can&#039;t we just go back to when the game was actually fun? When anyone could lightly criticize their teammates and not have that player afk in fountain just bitching all game about how they are morally superior than one another and can get &quot;riots ban hammer&quot; to ban whomever they want banned.\r\n\r\nBut u know, ban us for trying to have fun.\r\n\r\nPS. Please don&#039;t misinterpret my post as thinking racism and saying &#039;kys&#039; is cool; it fucking isn&#039;t.
