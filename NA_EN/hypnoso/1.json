I can even log back into the client and start the match up again but when I try to load into the rift it still says can't connect to the server. Funny thing is this only happens some games! After it happened one game I tried to test out my connection and loaded perfectly into a custom match. I play on my university's wifi too! Any help is greatly appreciated as if you look in my match history i've, i guess deservingly, lost a couple of my placements matches as I can't load into the game and then there is a remake.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot to anyone that can help with this issues!","replies":[{"poster":"hypnoso","date":"2016-12-12T02:16:26.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also is there a way for me to be \"reimbursed\" somehow for the leaver buster and remake defeats in my placements since it technically wasn't my fault? \n\nThanks and open to any feedback","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-14T02:29:36.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, we cannot modify any Leaverbuster penalties or revert the losses, as we're locked out of making these changes in order to maintain the integrity of the game.\n\nAre you certain the issue you're experiencing is not the known issue mentioned in the client ticket at the top left (next to Home button) and on the [**Service Status Page**](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na)?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kenzatron42","date":"2016-12-12T05:45:24.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also having this problem.
