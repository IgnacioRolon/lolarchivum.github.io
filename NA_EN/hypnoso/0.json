After running down some lanes some more, the Darius actually called him top to keep dying to him (which he did). He taunted things like &quot;Vlad give me 4 items b4 20 mins&quot; and &quot;I&#039;m going to honor you Vlad&quot;. We begged not only for the Vlad to stop intentionally feeding, but the Darius to not kill him. \r\n\r\nLong story short, It is not only the person who is intentionally feeding that is ruining the game for others, but it is also the one that keeps purposely killing the feeder, knowing that it is intentional. If we are all supposed to be sportsmanlike, how does killing someone you know is purposefully trying to die to you demonstrating this behavior. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I reported the Vlad and Darius and unsportsmanlike conduct.

He shouldn't be reported. He was just playing the game. IF the intentional feeder did not exist, he would have nobody to kill, unless he simply won the lane. The intentional feeder should be the only one who was reported.\n\nIF you want to report the person who was killing the feeder, that's just being salty. It's an anomaly, it doesn't happen all the time.

Or do you think that his team was calling him bad, down-talking him and making him feel bad about himself?\n\nEither outcome results in the same thing, he intentionally fed. Darius didn't make him feed, Darius didn't make anybody beg, Darius just capitalized on Vlad's poorplaying and intentional feeding to end the game sooner. He made a single comment that was quoted here. He was stating a fact. He was going to honor Vlad, and he got 4 items before 20 minutes. Vlad ruined the game, why should Darius get punished for it?\n\nI get intentional feeders all the time, but I don't complain. I just say: \"Okay, go for it. I don't really care, either way. It's just one game in the grand scheme of things.\" \n\nI then proceed to report them and move on to the next game.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2016-10-04T20:19:08.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Vlad ruined the game, why should Darius get punished for it?\n\nBecause Darius was encouraging it via honoring the feeder and rubbing the easy victory in the enemy team's face.\nIt's essentially like saying \"gg ez\". And just like \"gg ez\" it's a very minor offense, but nonetheless reportable negative behaviour.\n\nJust to be clear, I'm not saying Darius should be permanently banned from ever playing League of Legends again.\nI'm not even saying he should get a chat restriction based on this incident alone. But I do believe it should ultimately be considered in, as you call it, the grand scheme of things. If he acts like this frequently, I think a chat restriction is a good way to remind him of the Summoner's Code: **Show Humility in Victory**, and Grace in Defeat.\n\nYour attitude when it comes to feeders is definitely more healthy than the attitude the OP seems to have... but that ultimately doesn't translate to whether or not something should be reportable or not.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"hypnoso","date":"2016-10-03T19:50:48.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm super late but thanks for your input and clarification!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DHZ","date":"2016-09-25T22:16:35.288+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't blame Darius.
