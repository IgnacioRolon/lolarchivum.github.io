I forgot about the fact that I can't search for champs in english...\r\n\r\nIs there a list of champs translated from english to the korean characters (words) so I can copy and paste them to pick/ban my champs? I'm just looking through the list for now, but it'd be much easier to do it that way.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for the help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-16T23:08:09.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't support modifications or language packs for unsupported regions, so I wouldn't have a list to offer.

Is it a problem for me to have it in Korean, other than the possible issues?
