However, each time, before the last turret shot, he regained his shield, and was thereby executed. I think this has something to do with the damage history being reset when a shield is regained like that. This heavily affects the game, because of the gold imbalance that is caused by that result--the team with yasuo gaining +300 gold each time, while nothing being gained for the team without. I&#039;m hoping to share this result so that it may be investigated, hopefully replicated to see if the same result occurs, and, if so and not intentional, fixed in a patch to come.\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Luminier","date":"2017-05-08T20:40:08.749+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If he doesn't take any damage from you because all of the damage has been absorbed by his shields, then it's working as intended. Getting a kill works as soon as you damage the enemy champion. If the champion takes no damage from you, in the form of a shield, then they will execute. If they take damage from you without any form of shielding, then they will be killed by whoever killed them.\n\nIf he takes actual damage from you and THEN still executes, it's a bug and needs to be addressed. \n\nI only say this because I've seen people get turret dove by Yasuo, but what they fail to realize is the fact that if you only end up damaging his shields he gains, then it will be a justified execute. Yasuo also gains an immediate shield when he ults, so you can basic attack him once and he will still be executed because he took no damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-08T20:07:28.548+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I will just mumble something about the ancient bug where his E cancels your autoattacks, the thing every yasuo player insists is an intended feature.","replies":[{"poster":"Wylderthanu","date":"2017-05-15T17:29:50.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If a champion goes out of auto attack range before a certain period of your auto attack then yes it will cancel it.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-15T19:35:24.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is as it should be. The problem is his E frequently makes it happen at point-blank range, for some reason. It only seems to happen on specific champions (regularly).
