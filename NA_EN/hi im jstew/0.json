I have tried turning Virtual Refresh/Sync on and off to no avail. Nothing stops the random (and now more frequent) FPS drops. My ping does not shoot up at all, but when I check my Network Logs for the affected matches, all of them reference the phrase \"Network Thread stall\" quite a few times. The first major occurrence of this is right around the 6th, so 3 days ago. I have done nothing else to my computer in the meantime. I've tried System Restore, reinstalling and repairing League, resetting my router, updating my graphics driver, updating my network drivers. NOTHING works.\n\nIt just so happens that searching \"network thread stall\" in search engines gives results on the old League of Legends forums from 3-4 years ago, all with no solutions.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-10T15:05:30.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recommend reaching out to our tech team for further assistance since you've seen no change after following our FPS guide.
