I&#039;ve been training so hard just so I don;t have to rely on my friends to carry me each game. However my skills in league have not improved one bit since I had picked up league. Coming from playing mostly fps my hands are filled with muscle memory for only wasd and league&#039;s qwer really messes me over. I&#039;ve tried relearning my hands to get used to qwer but no matter how many times I practice, I always mess up my buttons. I always end up pressing r instead of e and my hand moves up and I start pressing the number buttons and even if I were to remain in qwer hand position I become so hesitant of my actions that you would&#039;ve needed Dr.Phil to sympathize with my hand&#039;s life decisions. In addition to that I can never ever get used to moving the camera while in combat, I know that theres a locked camera but the speed of it doesn&#039;t attend to my desires. I play katarina because I really love her style of play and abilities however because of my hesitation and terrible camerawork I am literally carried each game and I have no pride in that. If you&#039;ve read this far I would like to thank you so much and I hope you can provide information that can help me feel more better about playing league. I don&#039;t know whats causing this but sometimes my character would automatically turn around and face the opposite directiom when I&#039;m trying to run away from someone and I cant believe to tell you how many times i&#039;ve died to this issue. I&#039;ve tried turning off auto attack and the checkbox where it says it will automatically lock onto enemies but it still happens. Thank You!","replies":[{"poster":"Venfru Magnánimo","date":"2016-11-16T10:20:13.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can custom key the habilities.\nQ=A\nW=W\nE=D\nD=Q\nE=R\nF=F\nIt may feel like nonsense.

This champs are easier for the boton pressing.\n\nThe rest is just something that will come with more months","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ego Killer","date":"2016-11-16T10:15:04.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well what's causing you to turn the opposite way when running from your opponent is most likely a misclick on the mini-map, you can turn this off in your ingame options. It could also be certain abilities like charms and taunts that make you walk toward the enemy champion regardless of where you click. \n\nYou've only been playing for a month or so, don't focus on your mistakes so much. Even if you're having issues with hand-placement and whatnot you should still be in the phase of actually learning the game. No one I have ever met or ever heard of was good at this game in only a month's time. \n\nA few tips:\n\nIn regards to your issues with hand placement, I suggest keeping your hands on the keyboard at all times. When you start using active items, things like zhonyas, mikaels, frostqueen, etc. you may find it easy to bind them to different keys. Personally I use 1,2, 3 and 4 (for my trinket), then I use extra buttons on my mouse for 5,6, and 7. It is unlikely, though, that you'll ever have more than 2 active items unless you play support (like me :]).\n\nAs for your camera issues, an unlocked screen is the norm. You can hold a certain button (I think it's F1) to lock onto your character as long as you hold it down. \n\nPlay other roles in NORMALS to learn the basics of those roles. Things like jungle clear times, teleport timing in the toplane, warding as a support, csing in the lanes, etc. Then when you get a basic knowledge of all roles, find the one you want to main. I HIGHLY suggest avoiding playing more than two roles with the intent of getting better at this game.\n\nOnce you find a role you really like and an off role you're at least average at I would suggest narrowing your champ pool for ranked. This may seem like bad advice at first, but you'll find the easiest way to climb is to main one or two champions in one role. I can easily climb from bronze to plat playing a single champion, regardless of if that champion is bad at the moment or even if I get counter picked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-11-16T10:07:27.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, basically the answer is in your story. Muscle memory, just play the game until you get use to it. most people don't get instantly good after just a couple of months. \n\nNow about the champion turning backwards sometimes... I honestly don't know unless i saw it happen in realtime. Do you spam click as you go out through the game, it may have been the autopathing screwed you over as it has many a person before.\n\n\nNow about the camera, i feel im reading the sentence wrong, maybe because im tired or just stupid... or both, but, heres an idea i want you to try.\nWhen you start fighting with someone, instead of moving your mouse to move the screen over which may mess you up, Tap the spacebar which centers the camera, as you keep kiting away or to someone, tap the spacebar as you go or even if need be, hold it down.","replies":[]}]}
