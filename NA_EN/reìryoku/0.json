Could it be packet loss or is it not because i used the \"log\" you suggest usually to see if i have experienced something of the sort all of them say that i ahve minimal packet loss and a stable connection about 30-36 ms and up to 2% maximum packet loss but i doubt that 2% packet loss can cause such freezes for up to 5 to 10 seconds sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-23T21:40:48.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even 2% packet loss can be enough to cause some pretty weird game interactions. Even though it's a really small amount, there is still some data getting lost or corrupted before it hits our servers and goes back to your network. Most of the time it happens when your ISP routes your connection in a really weird way, but our tech guys might still be able to help in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vicious CycIe","date":"2017-06-23T17:09:15.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here, i am waiting from yesterday i did everything that they said but nothing helps... i cant play from 2 days its too laggy...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Èmperor","date":"2017-06-23T16:58:12.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having the same issue today dude, just randomly freezing and not seeing the minions health.","replies":[]}]}
