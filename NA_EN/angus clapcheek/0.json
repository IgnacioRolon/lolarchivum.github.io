As your first step, I recommend resetting your configuration settings to default:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nI also recommend disabling any third party programs that interact with league as well.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"angus clapcheek","date":"2016-11-12T01:51:41.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks, ill try that and hopefully it doesn't happen again","replies":[]}]}]}
