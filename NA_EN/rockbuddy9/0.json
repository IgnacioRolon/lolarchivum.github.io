Meaning I had to give it permission to install everything, allow access into firewall, all that annoying stuff.\r\n\r\nSome updates went in and came by in January of 2018. To which I sent a report to riot seeing if they could help me.\r\n\r\nThe problem?\r\n\r\nIt prevented me from connecting to any internet based service that was not Google Chrome. It would hardlock my system because the hardware would try to open something  that CIS (the software) was preventing from opening. \r\n\r\nI had later found out that it had changed many registries upon my first attempt to delete CIS. I found that out because the change date in my registries page was about the same time I uninstalled the program. \r\n\r\nDuring about a 3 week period, I couldn&#039;t play any games, League of Legends included.\r\n\r\nUpon contacting CIS official support website, I cited the problem and **immediately had my connection terminated**.  \r\n\r\nUpon refreshing the page **I was unable to reconnect and deduced that I was blacklisted** from their website and I don&#039;t bother checking If I can&#039;t reconnect.\r\n\r\nI was luckily saved by BitDefender&#039;s support team who found downloads and software to remove the damage CIS did to my system.\r\n\r\nThe moral of  the story here is: don&#039;t trust CIS and use something else.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-01-16T04:28:50.027+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Komodo is malware, so is McAfee, others are mostly trash.\n\nBuilt-in AV and common sense will give equal protection without crippling performance and breaking software.
