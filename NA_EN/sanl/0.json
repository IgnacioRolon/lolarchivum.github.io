Yes, i know they travel, like when cowsep lived in Trick2Gs house and played on NA, ofc his ping is fine. But as mentioned, FAKER was streaming games played on NA and EUW with very low ping, but he was still in the SKT artificial human producing facility. Or others like... dunno for example GoodGuyGarry, played on NA, good 30 ping, played on EUW, same good 35-40 ping. When i try wont go bellow 100. And i have optic 250mb/s net and i checked that my internet provider doesnt block stuff becuase its overseas too.... so whats the secret behind this?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2017-08-24T22:36:52.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, someone playing on NA who then goes to play on EUW, it is physically impossible to get 35-40 ping.  Within a country or continent, the speed of a connection is entirely dependent on the countries infrastucture for broadband and how long the connection needs to travel.  This infrastructure is like railways all across the country that connect computers together.  [Something like this](https://airebeam.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NetworkMap.jpg).  \n\nIn Korea, not only is their infrastructure extremely modern, but it is a much, much smaller country.  Therefore, Koreans can sometimes get around 10 ping when they play League of Legends.\n\nWhen you play cross continent, Your connection needs to travel along very specific routes, as shown in this [map](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/09/21/article-2039974-0E04451900000578-849_964x581.jpg). Anyone who wants to connect to a server located in a different continent needs to go through one of these connections.  Therefore, pro's do not get crazy lower ping compared to others, because they all need to travel along that same route.  It is possible for some variance in ping, due to how good your ISP is (Pro players in gaming houses usually have enterprise level ISP plans).\n\nI hope that explains a bit!  If you have any follow-up questions, let me know!","replies":[]}]}
