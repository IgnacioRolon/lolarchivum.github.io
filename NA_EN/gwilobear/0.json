An extremely powerful melee bruiser with massive KO potential but other than flash has absolutely no mobility, probably the easiest champion to kite in the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"PlsCheckThisBush","date":"2017-04-15T04:00:07.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pick a ranged champion or slow him.  If he doesn't Flash -> Q/E into your entire team there is literally nothing Darius can do to close the gap.  His Ultimate only hurts if he (1) Has a ton of AD, (2) Has Noxian Might up from whacking somebody 5 times (don't trade like that with Darius), or (3) has a 5 stack of Hemorrhage on you (see point 2).  He's a very flashy Pentakill machine if you let it happen, however kiting him makes him incredibly useless.  He has no dashes, he has no ranged abilities, and as such is usually built Black Cleaver (Health + INCREDIBLE synergy with his Passive) into full tank.  Similar to how Hecarim builds a Trinity Force and then full tank.  Both champions are walking balls of stats that provide very little in regards to utility.  He works great in solo-queue as people underestimate the power of his Passive and healing from Q.  There's a reason he's not seen in competitive play.\n\nCheck out this video to see Darius being Darius - incredible presence but completely useless when kited:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zGgWPntGUEQ?t=4m14s\n\nI specifically started it at 4:14 so you can see the pain of what it looks like for a melee champion with no gap-closers to walk around desperately looking for a target.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-15T04:02:47.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"All the things you could be salty about, and you choose darius?","replies":[]},{"poster":"CoasterSky","date":"2018-09-19T22:08:57.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just lost to a Darius and he just went tank but still was able to take out our entire team despite not having much offensive items.
