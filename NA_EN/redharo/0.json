Also I'm pretty sure warding comes into play for the mastery, and he didn't by a single pink ward. His team didn't take a single baron and only got 2/4 dragons, depending on how much objectives matter for mid lane, that could have been huge. Biggest thing was definitely the cs though, he could easily have had at least another 100 cs or more.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zacktootall","date":"2016-11-06T05:58:18.805+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah average viegar fun stuff","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-11-06T05:19:15.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are being compared to other veigars, so missing that much farm will destroy your score.
