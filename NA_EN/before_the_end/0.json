But now this is a bigger issue. I spent probably 300 dollars on this game throughout my whole League Career, and i was the idiot that clicked on that stupid link for \"free rp and skins\" And of course there was nothing. But as SOON as a bought PROJECT Ashe, I was about to start a game and show off the skin, and then i log out because it said someone else is logging in from another computer. **I DONT HAVE ANOTHER COMPUTER.** And once i tried to log back in its saying that I changed region, my password is changed, and idk where my league account is now\r\n\r\nPlz riot fix this. I had over 5000 RP in my account, and god forbid someone is actually spending the money i spent.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-03T17:13:25.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like someone else may be accessing your account.
