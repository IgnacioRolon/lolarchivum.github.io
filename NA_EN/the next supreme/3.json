Sometimes his Q will fizzle basically since it has a brief channel time if it cancels at an awkward moment either because the target died or he lost vision, then the ability goes on cooldown without going off , no crimson rush stack or anything. Maybe removing its channel time or shortening it would help. Thanks","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
