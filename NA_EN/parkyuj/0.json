Really sucks that you're getting this lag now =\\ .\n\nSince you only mentioned having that lag in champion select, we should be able to smooth that out pretty easily! Head into the client options using the gear in the upper right corner and turn on **low-spec mode**. That will reduce some of those new flashy animations and give you a smoother lobby.","replies":[{"poster":"Parkyuj","date":"2017-06-03T17:16:15.767+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I turned on low specs mode and it is still laggy.  My mac has OSsierra and used to run really smoothly on the old client, but on the new client everything is a little laggy.  When I try to go to look at patch notes from profile it lags and that happens to other things too. For example, when I look at my collection and try to go to shop my screen freezes sometimes and I have to wait a little for it to start going again.","replies":[]}]}]}
