The reason for that is free hard cc is hard to balance so cutting down their time a tad would make it more fair.\n\nBut I like them! I play a lot of ap bruiser mages (probably my favorite class) so it would be cool to see ideas like this.

Taking away 0.5 seconds of cc on both of them and increasing the cooldown on Phreakish Grimace to something like 30 seconds might have been better.","replies":[{"poster":"Phieldworker","date":"2019-03-17T16:22:54.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man I hope something like this comes into play within this year. I would be so happy. It would give champs like Galio, Gragas, Sylas, Morde etc will have more of a selection. Right now it feels like if you wanna play bruiser mage you just gotta stack all the health mage items which makes you extremely squish.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"wolvius","date":"2019-03-16T23:07:51.338+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"These seem like pretty decent ideas, although as Phield said free hard CC could be hard to balance especially psychotic grin 12 second cd per target is low. You would probably either have to change that to an active effect that persists while in combat and on exit combat a cooldown starts before it can be activated/triggered again or alternatively an active that last a set time before going on cd.\n\nThe only other issue I can think of is as with all potential AP bruiser items people have come-up with is can tanks abuse it. Sublime Soulflare Crown looks like an all-round better sunfire cape only losing 5 magic damage (actually thought it was 50 instead of 43) from the static aura for a scaling as well as two additional passives that negate the minor cost difference and could boost other tank items effectiveness making it a tempting item.\n\nAnyway well done the effects show promise the Icey grasp one sounds great it forces them to delay an attack for the root or take the slow instead. Sorry if I sound like an asshole, its far easier to pick faults from someones idea than create one so don't be discouraged and once again good work.","replies":[{"poster":"Eranell","date":"2019-03-17T09:23:29.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's okay, you dont sound like an asshole to me. I see your issue with Phreakish Grimace. The numbers could need some tweaking.\n\nRegarding their effectivity on tanks, I felt like I kept the ability power on them low enough for them to not be so overly abusable, since AP tanks normally dont have the best ratios (I think). You barely see any AP tanks atm anyway, which is a bummer because I loved playing them (Nauti, Mao, etc.). So if they get some love with these as well I wouldn't mind that :P\n\nSSC seemed okay to me because it doesn't give any resistances and even though it's aura has an AP scaling it's \"Sublime Presence\" Passive would give the incentive to buy tank items. This way the aura wouldn't deal to massive amounts of damage in (frankly) Thresh's AA range (since immolate is supposes to work with sublime presence) but rather just expand the range of teamfight oriented items. The affected items are all tank or support items. Locket, Frozen Heart, Randuins, Glory, Shurelia's and Abyssal. I think that's all of them. Maybe Zeke's and Redemption could also profit from it, didn't decide on that yet. Well, and of course Phreakish Grimace.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Probs feeding","date":"2019-03-16T22:26:58.829+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The one thing I really like about this is it would also open up some tanks to attempt an ap brusier build the same way some tanks can go a bruiser build.

Hard cc on an item seems like too much for League, having resistances on bruiser items seems like a very odd choice when regular bruiser items are notable for having health without resistances. And most importantly I feel like it does nothing to address two of the main issues for ap bruisers: Being able to get 20% cdr on an item that isnt full damage, and being able to get percent mr shred/penetration from an item that isnt full damage like Void.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-03-16T23:33:43.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice Idea\n\nHowever, I think that the Pyschotic Grin passive should have a 55. 831 second cooldown on it and the fear duration should be decreased to 1.8927614273 seconds since CC is very cost effecient and final cost increased to 3120 gold.\n\nIt is nice but might has nightmarish interactions with champions like:\n{{champion:517}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:9}} ","replies":[]}]}
