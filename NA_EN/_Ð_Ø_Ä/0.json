Why does the 5th term outweigh the 1st???","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"@RIOT Just curious as to why bans are handed out for speech BEFORE they are handed out for \"illegal\" accounts? Ie. accounts created breaking the VERY FIRST RULE! \r\n \r\nRULE # 1.1. Am I eligible to use the Riot Services? (You must be at least 13 years old and an adult must accept this Agreement.)\r\n\r\nOnly people ages 13 or older may create an account or use the Riot Services. If you’re at least 13 years old, but not yet legally considered an “adult” in the country you live in, you must ask one of your parents (or other legal guardians) to read this Agreement and accept it on your behalf. You may not create or use an account or use any of the Riot Services on behalf of a legal entity or for a commercial purpose. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI guarantee there are millions of accounts which are currently and in the past breaking this rule. While I understand the dilemma in banning these accounts since you have no real way to tell if they are in fact valid or not. It IS after all YOUR first rule and as such you should stand by this rule even MORE so than the \"Code of Conduct\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE #  5.1. Can I troll, flame, threaten or harass people while using the Riot Services? (No. If you do, you might get banned.)\r\n\r\nWhile using the Riot Services, you must comply with all laws, rules and regulations in the jurisdiction in which you reside. You must also comply with certain additional rules that govern your use of the Riot Services (the “Code of Conduct”). The Code of Conduct is not meant to be exhaustive, and we reserve the right to modify it at any time, as well as take appropriate disciplinary measures including account termination and deletion to protect the integrity and spirit of the Riot Services, regardless of whether a specific behavior is listed in the policy as inappropriate. In addition to the Code of Conduct, please review the Summoner’s Code for additional guidance on exemplary gameplay behavior. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a daily basis you hear of accounts banned purely on speech, when there are tools already in place to circumvent any possible harm done by said speech. \r\nMany of the accounts that are breaking 5.1 should have never been allowed to be created in the first place. \r\n\r\n\r\n@RIOT if you can't even enforce your very FIRST RULE you need to ease up on the FIFTH RULE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have the means to not have to read others language, I can mute said person, I can /mute all /pings /emotes , I can keep my chat filter ON like it is by DEFAULT, I can leave my ALL CHAT OFF like it is be DEFAULT. So as long as it is ONLY speech I can deal with my own emotions or just censor it myself, I don't need you telling me what I can say or read.\r\nWhat I can't do is choose to NOT play with children 13-17 who do not have their parents permission to play this game or children that are UNDER 13 whom are technically NOT allowed to play PERIOD. These accounts that fall into these categories need to be terminated immediately OR ALL accounts which were banned purely for speech need to be reinstated. (Now I already know neither of these will happen) It is merely to show how you enforce only what you choose. Since you can show \"proof\" of \"toxicity\" with one sided chat logs which have ZERO context, you get banned. But since  they can't prove  the age of the account creator nor the validity of permission granted by said parent nor even the validity that there is in fact a parent who gave said permission, then no ban. There are countless invalid accounts running amok. Since there is no actual way TO enforce this rule.\r\n\r\nBecause you sure as hell aren't getting my social security # to play your game like they have to in S Korea.\r\n\r\n\r\nMake up your mind @RIOT you can't pick and choose which rules of  the \"ToU\" you enforce. Especially when you enforce a rule (5.1) so much further down the list than rule (1.1)\r\n\r\nNow I know this is going to be tons of heat, but I would have to argue you have a learning disability if you think #5 precedes  #1.","replies":[]}
