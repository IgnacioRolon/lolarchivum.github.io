There where a few skins and i re-rolled 3 for blood moon Kalista. It said it was in my inventory. I also spent orange essence for blood stone taric and it said that was in my inventory. When i started a and played kalista adc with the skin the skin wasn't there. After the game i checked and it said i didn't have it. Also i checked the blood stone taric wasn't there either. Then i noticed my wards were gone as well. Even ward i didn't get from hex tech. I paid real money for were disappearing. This is really tilting. Can rito tell me whats happening and fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-16T17:51:44.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds strange that you wouldn't be able to select crafted content, so I took a look into this for you.  I see that you opened an Augment Cache to unlock a shard for Blood Moon Kalista.  Shortly after, I found that Blood Moon Kalista was actually disenchanted (not crafted) to grant you 325 orange essences.  Similarly, it looks like you disenchanted Bloodstone Taric for the essences.  This brought your current total to 2439 Orange Essences.  \n\nUnfortunately, we're unable to restore disenchanted shards.  It's especially important that you review the confirmation before proceeding, so you know that you are crafting content and not actually disenchanting it.  Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
