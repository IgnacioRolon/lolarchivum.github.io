This is awesome! It reminds me of when my elementary school would have us do Flat Stanley. (This is way cooler.)\n\nFor those unfamiliar, [this](http://bearessentialnews.com/images/flatStanley.gif) is Flat Stanley. You'd color him in and take him on a vacation with you and take pictures with him.

I was hoping someone would recognise Tibbers and approach us but nobody ever did. But wearing the 2014 Championship jacket was a bit of a give-away for a fellow summoner and I was hoping to get one with another player to prove Tibbers has fans.\n\nIn general, i'm just so happy I found him a Scottish costume. We went into a Build-a-bear looking for a hoody that might fit him and found a full costume that fits perfectly and made all of the days photos a bit more awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-09-05T01:37:11.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Scottish costume was really cool.
