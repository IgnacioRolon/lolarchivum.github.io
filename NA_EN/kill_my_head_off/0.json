Elise visually goes up but in reality her position is the exact same due to no Y axis in league (much like trist can't jump over cait traps), there's not jumps or leaps its just simply \"untargetability\" and blinds aren't canceled by it.\n\nBut hey, at least volatile spiderling ignores windwall so its not all bad.
