Another idea is, if electrocute does adaptive damage based on your primary stat AD or AP, dark harvest can instead be made to do whichever type of damage would deal more damage to the enemy factoring in resistances. So on high armor targets it would do magic damage and high mr targets physical damage.\n\nElectrocute is simply more reliable and does more damage for way too long until dark harvest can compete.\n\nIt is true though, not needing 3 hits to proc it makes for much easier picks on low health enemies or with abilities like Jinx R, ezreal R, lux R etc.\n\nStill hardly ever see it.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-14T04:41:47.111+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue is that there are too many runes that are just \"extra damage!\" and they can never all be balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Barso55","date":"2019-10-14T05:03:44.135+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Uta4QZUs,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-10-14T04:41:47.111+0000)\n>\n> The issue is that there are too many runes that are just \"extra damage!\" and they can never all be balanced.\n\nWell damage runes are meant to give extra damage...so your point is a weird statement.\n\nLack of balance is one thing and a) theres no reason they cant all be relatively balanced b) this isnt a lack of balance but a complete lack of viability between two competing runes\n\nAll runes serve a niche:\n\nHail of blades - proc 3/4 auto effects like xin Q or kled W super fast\nlethal tempo - auto attack based champs that do sustained auto damage to multiple targets (yi, tryn etc)\nconqueror - champs that frontload multiple spells and/or/autos and/or to deal with tanks\npta - champs that can auto multiple times then use their burst (volibear, kled, etc)\nelectrocute - early game 3 seperate attack/ability burst\ndark harvest - the only purely scaling rune, obviously meant for snowbally champs who can get enemies low or poke champs that can get enemies low, meant to keep them relevant as the game goes on.\n\nProblem is, electrocute keeps you more relevant for longer than dark harvest right now because of its insane scaling with AD/AP (40% bonus AD is a lot...its almost like having a 5th ability).","replies":[{"poster":"Eonslegacy","date":"2019-10-14T06:56:22.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is dark harvest is actually the reset rune. Designed for champions that put damage over time effects on multiple people etc.\nIt resets down to 1.5 second cd on a takedown. So its weak for people that dont get several kills quickly but strong on those that do.\nProblem is that if you get multiple kills quickly you pretty much win the game regardless.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sinister Anubis","date":"2019-10-14T10:02:48.545+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue with current dark harvest is it gives nothing in lane right now. You would need to trade until they get low enough to get 1 stack and the little bit of damage it gives. Yes electrocute is better it is reliable and isnt gated by HP to get it off. Dark harvest only really seems to work on champions that can safely get the procs off during game to even make use of it aka karthus jungle and his ulti and maybe a few other champions with niche builds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Åšhunpo","date":"2019-10-15T02:52:46.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:55}} I like Dark Harvest though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smyrage","date":"2019-10-14T17:50:29.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When it first appeared it was basically a jungler rune, because it enhanced the ganking/clear potential of champions. Then it got reworked into a really oppressive rune, which basically outshined Electrocute in every aspect (there was a period, when Electrocute was never taken). Then it got balanced into something like this. It returned being a jungler rune, because gank heavy champions can stack it efficiently. It's a feast or famine rune, because if you get ahead it is better than Electrocute, if not then it falls extremely off. Considering that Electrocute is harder to proc off an the stackable nature of Dark Harvest, let's just keep it this way. Currently those champions can take this as well, who want to enhance their poke potential, however they can't reliably use Arcane Comet or Aery, because the Comet without some sort of CC is only useful until they start buying boots and Aery is only good as a damage source until mid game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2019-10-14T10:06:54.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's not.\n\nI don't want Karthus Jungle to be relevant again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GravenFear","date":"2019-10-23T16:02:34.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, so I've had two opponents today that even though they were destroyed in lane they could 2-shot the adc with dark harvest late game.
