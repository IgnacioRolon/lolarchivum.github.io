They are undervalued because they aren't very visible and they tend to be weak because of their 100% uptime.  Allies and enemies can't really play around them very well because they can't see their radius or whether they are effected by them.  They also can't be too visible without cluttering up the game if they have 100% uptime.\n\nI think {{item:3110}} would be better if it had an cooldown-limited active effect or mana-costing toggle that would allow it to create a stronger and more visible blizzard aura around the user.  Because it would have either a cooldown or a cost, it could be much stronger and more visible.\n\nI would also like to see something like the old Zeke's Herald come back, as an item for the marksmen to buy if they want to buff their teammates.  It could have an inspire morale effect, where the user gains a ramping up buff as they autoattack enemy champions or epic monsters.  After 5 stacks of the buff, they would inspire the morale of nearby allies, creating a buff aura effect.\n\nI would also like to see a new tank item with a lightning rod aura effect, somewhat similar in purpose to the old {{item:3105}} aura.  It would protect nearby allies in the aura from some incoming AOE magic damage, but it would redirect some of the intercepted damage to the owner.\n\nAll of these would be very visible effects, so it would be easy for players to recognize their impact.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Josh Sand","date":"2019-10-08T17:14:56.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its going to be impossible to make strong defensive support items as long as other roles have access to them. \n\nSupport items are constantly under threat of solo lane abuse.

I'm not trying to contradict you -- just ask about possible ways to try and prevent that and whether it would work._\n\nWhat about an item like:\n\n(Generic Named Item)\n+ garbage stats, first or second back gold cost\nUnique Passive, Selflessness: Every 10-30 seconds, you gain a stack of Selflessness, max of 3-5 stacks. Last hitting a minion removes a stack of Selflessness.\nUnique Passive, Virtue's Reward: + good stats on yourself and one target of your choosing, or some sort of cool support-y active effect. **If you have no stacks of Selflessness, this effect is disabled for the next 60-120 seconds.**\n\nIn theory, afaik, it wouldn't be attractive to solo laners because the actual base of the item would be absolute trash stats, even if it was available on the first or second back. The entire value of the item would be in the Virtue's Reward passive, but if the item owner's job includes last-hitting minions for gold, they wouldn't be getting much value from the item. (However, this would still allow for occasional last hits -- e.g. if the ADC dies and the support needs to cover lane for a while, or for use with that one support item that rewards both players gold for last hitting on a stack-based system -- ideally, the timer on Selflessness would be designed around a minion or two extra beyond that item's stacks.)\n\nBut I admit my game knowledge is not the highest as I'm just coming back from a long hiatus. What do you think though as far as preventing abuse with that kind of \"punished for significant last hitting gameplay\" mechanic?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2019-10-20T15:49:42.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss when there was several aura items, but riot removed most with the excuse of 'hidden power', despite they all clearly added some ring graphic around the champion in question.
