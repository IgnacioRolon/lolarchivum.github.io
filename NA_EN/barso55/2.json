He needs a lot of safety to go with his squishy base stats, squishy build and the requirement to be right in a teamfight.\r\n\r\nTryn has his ult, w and E to catchup with enemies and to survive skirmishes and teamfights. Yi has high movement speed, cant be slowed, and the resetting mechanic on his AoE untargetable ability. What does yas have to survive through outplay?\r\n\r\nWindwall. In fact, compared to these other 2 this champ is much harder to get the job done with against non-braindead enemies.\r\n\r\nYi and tryn dont require teammates to pick around you. If you want to guarantee teamfight knockups with Yas you abolustely must pick AoE knockup such as Ali, Naut, malph or gragas. His only way to get to you (his base ms is pretty meh) is to dash (lategame with no minions to dash to during a teamfight). Thats quite situational and ruddy. If he didnt have the burst, armor pen and CC on his ult, his whole kit would have to change because single target Qs and low damage Es along with autos are obviously not enough to do the job as a melee carry in a teamfight.\r\n\r\nIssue is, all these requirements to make him function make him busted in lane.\r\n\r\nHe has one of the strongest level 1 (against melees), strong level 2 (even against ranged) very strong level 3 (especially against ranged).\r\n\r\nUnless you are udyr, double Q + tornado + ignite at level one is more dps and cc than anyone else can dish out, given that Q can be used as an AA reset. \r\n\r\nIf he wants to harass you, which a melee carry should be punished for, after level 2 or 3, he can do so quite easily. Dash into your minions, trade as he feels like, absorb some of the burst with his shield, and dash back out through his minions. No resource cost for doing any of this.\r\n\r\nEnemy is forced to: Eat a q and an auto as they retreat from their own wave, or stand and trade in which case yas has hard cc coming up in just a sec and can keep beating you down harder than you can because of AA reset on Q. That is very toxic and unfun to play against, especially when you know that allowing him lane dominance means that he will end your team even faster (not about whether but when).\r\n\r\nThats the other issue. If you do manage to shut down yas in lane somehow, he is highly gold efficient, double and triple dipping into specific items.\r\n\r\nPassive doubles crit rate and gives flow based on movement. Zeal item gives MS, c rit rate and AS. Q cooldown scales off AS. \r\n\r\nEasy to build full crit even when behind, and a well landed ult gives him 50% bonus Arpen also against your whole team for a whole 15 seconds. Impossible to shut this champ down because of how gold efficient he is with just 2 items. \r\n\r\nThis champ is way too toxic and unfun to play against and can never be balanced. He should straight up be deleted. Riot made a mistake with this one.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-29T04:38:32.493+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Apart from Yi and Tryn, hes the only other hard melee carry in the game.\n\nSo much wrong with this..\n\n> Unless you are udyr, double Q + tornado + ignite at level one is more dps and cc than anyone else can dish out, given that Q can be used as an AA reset. \n\n_Udyr?_\n\n> This champ is way too toxic and unfun to play against and can never be balanced. \n\nYeah, this i can understand.

Right as minions crash into each other at level one, before you can kill a minion, even if you keep autoing it, you have to back off because his tornado is ready.\n\nnothing weird about any of it and have yet to see a valid response addressing anything I have said.\n\nShit brained americans","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-30T20:46:31.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> sounds like your family is a bunch of weird nonsense.\n\nWhat does this even _mean?_\n\n> Shit brained americans\n\nTIL Yasuo is an american, or OP is drunk and upset?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zed genius","date":"2019-09-29T23:01:46.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The last time he was OP was when the tank yasuo top build was a thing, and that was like ...season 6?7?","replies":[]},{"poster":"macspam","date":"2019-09-29T04:21:43.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think he would be balanced if they took something away from his kit.
