Q, auto auto ult they are simply dead.\r\n\r\nAdditionally he has 2 hard cc - both aoe, non ult, short cd. one knockup, one silence, and both are game changing ccs unlike root, slow.\r\n\r\n5.5k hp at least, if not 7k+ from stacking champs if hes dominating. with 1 armor and 1 mor item + aftershock he has more than enough resistances.\r\n\r\n2x non ult aoe hard cc, easy mana and hp sustain in lane, 1350 point and click true damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyeah hes immobile, but so are a lot of champs. righteous glory or shurelyas will fix that, and its not like he has a lack of slows and hard cc.\r\n\r\nchamp needs to be looked at. I think his playstyle is a little different and diffulct to pick up, one reason hes not that popular. \r\n\r\nif he can do so much burst, sustain damage and utility cc, and be basically the strongest tank in the game, he needs some significant drawback. tank that can burst squishies in 2 spells is ridiculous.\r\n\r\non a side note, malphite needs to be looked at also. \r\n\r\nfull ap malphite with zhonya still has like 230 armor and can one shot all squishies pretty much where he lands his ult. tank malphite has like 500+ armor and still does high damage and very disruptive. played garen into one and all he had was sheen after first back and still had like 170 armor at level 6 because of his passive. impossible to get through even for garen.","replies":[]}
