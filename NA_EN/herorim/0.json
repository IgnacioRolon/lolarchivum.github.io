When you compare this game to others, this game is absolutely sad. The concept was amazing in the pass seasons, but season 8 is an absolute joke. I can't play an adc anymore because games are so quick. The purpose of ADCs is to be a powerhouse late game, take objectives, and kill tanks. How can I do that when the game ends between 20-30 minutes. Most games are decided by one lane. Also why do you lose lp when dodging? Why punish the player for leaving the client when you get a soraka top and jg taric? there should be a system where you like 3 dodges a day or something. the reason is because for some reason if you end up dodging one game while climbing you will get stuck at 99 or 98 lp. What is that? Dude really... Just because you dodge games with trolls you're going to punish them like that? Honestly, there is no point of playing league of legends because the chances of you getting 4 other people who won't troll your game is so unlikely. Out of 4 games the chances of you getting someone thats a douche bag, or a cry baby is 75%. The community is so bad because you need to rely on 4 people. This game is dead, you rework champs that don't need reworks. I'm sorry but the only reason why I come back to this game is when I'm bored. It only takes one game to realize that this game isn't the game that I loved. Your game is not fun. At first I thought fortnite was a garbage game, but after playing it for a couple hours, I see that It's better than league of legends. No wonder why streamers are dropping league for that game. It isn't just better watching, the game is much funner as well. Bye league of legends, I'll come back once you bring out a new champion that doesn't fly across the map with low cooldowns.","replies":[]}
