I'm just wondering if there is a limit to one mastery token per day. They were both in blind pick so it's not due to being a weekly rotation game mode. Anyones thoughts on the matter would be helpful. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-27T15:49:05.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you already have the max number of tokens for Darius, so you can't get anymore.  You can use the tokens you have now to begin with the upgrading process per our [champion mastery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide) guide.
