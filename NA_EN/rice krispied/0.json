It has been happening for a week or so now. I check my internet every time it happens and its fine. What usually happens is whenever i launch new client first time every day(does not happen with old client) or even i previously launched the old client. I have had ping of actual 1000's or higher b4 and that is not as bad as this.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-03T03:47:12.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for providing a video! It looks like you're experiencing bursts of *Packet Loss*, which explains why you're seeing little bursts of things falling out of sync and catching up. This may be caused by certain routing issues along your path to the servers, but we'll need to ensure your local settings are fine before we investigate further.
