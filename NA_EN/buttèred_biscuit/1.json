The only time in she'd have to expand her full wing membrane would be her ult, which goes too fast for most people to really look at. There's also the fact that she is an older champ, so it's likely that they didn't give her a full membrane to easy the animation and rigging process. Honestly, I don't mind it, even more so because she seems like she'd not be the flying type in dragon form, her movements and attacks remind me much more of a dragon who is better at climbing through and around mountains then a Wyvern like Rathalos, or Rathian, two Wyverns who use their flight in the way they fight a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Sancre","date":"2017-08-19T13:56:20.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why I suggested the Gore Magala approach, those wings not only look majestic and menacing (something like that would look great on mid ult Shyv), but that guy is well known for being able to smash and climb with those big claws.\n\nI'm not sure if Shyv should fly, as she is a human/dragon Hybrid, so it would be strange if her dragon form just resembled a normal dragon or wyvern, while her human form is already quite different from a normal human","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainSeto","date":"2017-08-19T14:06:34.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sancre,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=OPwGBXZ2,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2017-08-19T13:56:20.156+0000)\n>\n> That&#x27;s why I suggested the Gore Magala approach, those wings not only look majestic and menacing (something like that would look great on mid ult Shyv), but that guy is well known for being able to smash and climb with those big claws.\n> \n> I&#x27;m not sure if Shyv should fly, as she is a human/dragon Hybrid, so it would be strange if her dragon form just resembled a normal dragon or wyvern, while her human form is already quite different from a normal human\n\nGore Magala is one of my favorite monsters in MH.

Ryze collects the World Runes because they are too powerful, but a small fragment that its also in hundreds of other dragons? there is no danger or way to fully recover that Rune, so there isn't any need to do it.\n\nThe thing about Shyvana being purple skinned is probably the mixture of magics, the red of the fire dragon magic and the blue of the arcane magic","replies":[{"poster":"Epicurus","date":"2017-08-20T10:15:50.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair points.
