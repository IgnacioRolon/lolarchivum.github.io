Essentially, my understanding from what the Riot Expert said was, Curse (the voice app) is causing a bug splat at the moment. They don't know why its happening, as it hadn't been an issue in the past, but they suggest you uninstall it. \n\nI haven't tested this solution extensively yet, however it honestly perfectly lines up with my experience since its fine when I play by myself, but it crashes when I duo with friends and use Curse. \n\nThey also said that if that doesn't help, then run the Hextech Repair Tool, open a ticket, and attach the logs from the repair tool. Let me know if works for you!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BrookeSamaira","date":"2017-03-13T03:10:53.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im having the exact same issues....
