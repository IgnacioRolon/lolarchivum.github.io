I have a decent computer; Lenovo T430. I´ve always played LoL on this computer flawlessly.\r\n\r\nThe problems start when I am trying to install the new patch. Suddenly, at a random moment, the patcher completely crashes, causing my computer to crash; even ctrl alt delete isnt working. I have to turn the computer off and on manually to get it working again (with the power button).\r\nWhat can cause this?\r\n\r\nFyi: i´ve updated my drivers, I have windows7, I´ve reinstalled the game 5 times. I´ve done stuff with my firewall. Nothing works. \r\n\r\nI really want to get out bronze so pls halp\r\n\r\nthanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-09T17:48:16.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be a pretty serious issue if your pc is just crashing while patching.
