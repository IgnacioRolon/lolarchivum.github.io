Catch them in your stun? they use qss or banshees is popped, where now your stun is on cooldown from trying to catch them and they just dash onto you and instantly kill you while taking only ~500 damage from your ult.

Just to get another read...\n> \n> How does everyone feel about the above statement?\n\nIf I had to choose one, I'd say \"burst mage\" over \"mage burster\". His post-DFG \"compensation buffs\" turned him into much more of a poke mage than a burst mage, and I think it would be good to consider some further changes that might make him feel bursty again. (Mostly, I think his ragecage needs to do something more interesting. I think Riot's underestimating how fundamentally the changes broke his kit and reduced his strategic decision potential, but that's a topic for another thread.) I mean, sure, he's still got a \"bursty\" R, but it's a very uninteresting burst ability: push button, delete enemy. That's how non-Veigar players might have *parodied* old Veigar, but it differed sharply from actual old Veigar. With new Veigar, there's no double-or-nothing question of whether or not to split ult and DFG (because DFG is gone), or whether to use the stun to pin down an enemy squishy or use it for the team (because the new stun is more \"toss it on the ground and hope somebody accidentally walks into it\").\n\nReally, though, I think he's both. I think he should retain his \"anti-mage\" tone with his ult. At least historically, a big part of Veigar's very flavorful theme was that he was an extremely weak laner who got kicked around all lanephase, then took his vengeance later on. It was very satisfying, and thematically appropriate, for Veigar to get an extra power surge when targeting the enemy mid that terrorized him for the early part of the game. It also synergized nicely with the itemization situation.\n\nFor example, a somewhat common pattern was \"enemy mage beats the hell out of Veigar early on, enemy mage gets really cocky and builds pure glass cannon with visions of pentakills dancing in their head, Veigar's team rages at Veigar for feeding, and then, suddenly, BLAM! Veigar incinerates the enemy mage with one shot, quite literally killing them with the AP items they bought with proceeds from tormenting Veigar in lane. BAHAHAHAHA! The tables have turned, and Veigar shows NO MERCY!\" It really brought a psychological, even lore-informed element to his playstyle. You could just imagine Veigar's rage amping up the spell. It also presented a real choice for the enemy mid: double-down on their early success and build glass cannon, with the understanding that they had better be careful about their positioning, or build more defensively, resisting the temptation to buy four deathcaps and try to carry the game single-handed. In effect, it asked the enemy mid, in Veigar's screechy yordle-voice: \"Do you feel lucky? Well, do you?\" Perhaps more pointedly, it asks: \"Do you think you beat me up in lane because you're just better than me? Then build glass cannon and rely on your superior skill to avoid an EWQR. Not sure about that? Then take the safe road and build some defense.\"\n\nTo be honest, new Veigar feels like \"pretty okay mage who passively farms all lanephase from relative safety, then in the midgame does some moderate poke damage to the enemy team and maybe bursts someone if they're low\". I'm pretty :\\ about that.","replies":[{"poster":"WhiskerWow","date":"2015-08-15T03:34:58.213+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think it should be anti-mage, but more anti-power.

I do think enemy AP scaling works reasonably well for the most part, even after (to borrow Renekton Bot's phrasing) Riot decided that \"AD\" meant both \"Attack Damage\" and \"sometimes also Ability Damage\" and created the AD caster mid.

I don't care about the ult scaling off the enemy's AP *unless* they're significantly ahead of me. If an enemy's contributing 1/2 - 2/3 of my Ultimates damage output, then I'm really behind, but the Ultimate serves as a come back mechanic to level the playing field once again.

If they amp it up, he might be strong, but not in an interesting way. With old Veigar, there were some strategic decision-points on the way to bursting someone:\n\n* Positioning: The dance of \"when can I move forward to throw my stun without getting killed by their front line?\" (I suppose this is still somewhat relevant.)\n* Damage splitting: Whether to stack DFG and ult for a sure kill, or go double-or-nothing and split DFG and ult in the hopes of killing two squishies. (DFG isn't around anymore, so this doesn't come up.)\n* Stun usage: Whether to use stun to lock the enemy mage down, probably with the outer edge, and make sure everything hits, or to save it for when the teamfight really begins, stunning multiple lower-value targets to help your team. (His stun is now a \"throw somewhere and hope somebody walks into it accidentally\" ability, rather than an ability that can be landed or missed.)\n\nSo I'm a little wary of just giving his ult more power without fixing these deeper problems. (That said, I was pretty annoyed that these nerfs were announced as \"compensation buffs\" for losing DFG; a real form of compensation for losing DFG would be to amp up ult damage.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-08-15T03:56:18.196+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like Yasuo's more of an Anti-Mage between his shield, dash, and wind wall than Veigar.

Limiting. It feels like a waste to ult an Ashe or a Zed, but you don't usually have a choice when the enemy APC has less than 200 AP and more MR than their tank. (Obvious exaggaration here, but you get my point. I'm also not actually at the point where people *realize* veigar will wreck them if they don't build MR yet, but as a Veigar main, I dread when I will have to cross that border.)\n\nDo note; that is not to say it doesn't feel utterly AWESOME to nearly literally 1-shot a full-AP Nidalee, whom proceeds to All-Chat about how Veigar's damage is \"Broken.\" I still find that absolutely hilarious, and few things feel as satisfying as watching 98% of an enemy's health dissipating in a single, undodgable spell (Which, mind you, is only truly a realistic possibility if the enemy buys all the big AP items and no MR or health.)\n\nTL; DR: I wouldn't mind a change to Veigar's ult, swapping out the enemy AP scaling for more reliable, universal power. And I also consider Veigar to be THE Burst Mage, not the Anti-Mage. He really just feels like he's supposed to be able to just insta-burst nearly anyone.\n\n(Also, sorry about the little rant in the first paragraph. It's just a trace amount of salt leftover from Veigar's... Compensation buffs.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trídent","date":"2015-08-15T03:44:55.362+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with the statement, and thanks for being so friendly and active on the boards Rep :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"WhiskerWow","date":"2015-08-15T03:38:15.347+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I never really felt or liked the anti-mage identity.

His unique Anti AP made him feel sooo rewarding to pick against AP champions, but is also problematic since it takes away from his abilities because once he get's ahead, the enemy AP champions aren't allowed to play because he can just press R on them and delete them instantly.\n\nIf it meant large AP increases across the rest of his kit, I'd be completely okay with Veigar being Burst Mage that is incredibly strong against AP champions being changed to Burst mage that obliterates anyone who stands in his way (albeit slightly less effectively)\n\nAs such, please, at least test the changes to Veigar in the PBE for patch 5.17 or 5.18 and see if it makes veigar healthier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JMoormann","date":"2015-08-15T08:38:00.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree.

But he only peaked among a tiny group. Other burst mages felt more rewarding because you don't have to hope the enemy foolishly stacks AP so you can kill him, and other characters perform anti-mage roles far better while also being competent in other areas, whereas Vivi gives us one strong burst against an enemy mage and an awkward stun ring.\n\nI'd be much happier with him if instead of a niche role that nobody is stupid enough to line themselves up against, he had a viable, well defined role as a mage that got stronger by feeding off kills.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rrett","date":"2015-08-15T06:02:11.807+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually, I'd probably say I was the first to mention it, though not on the forums.\n\nI was talking to Sadistic veigar about it, and we both agree on it.\n\nAs for my veigar background, I went from p5-d5 with a 70% winrate when I played veigar only.\n\nI don't play him anymore since the compensation gut, but when I did I never factored in any of enemy ap. It was actually at a point when I played more against ad mids than ap mids, and his ult still worked fine against them. \n\nBasically what I'm saying is that you never actually factored in enemy AP when using his ult anyways.\n\nI also want to re-iterate, when i still played veigar precompensation, as far as ability with veigar went, there were a very limited pool of people better than me. I mean, I was on par with faker as far as playing veigar went. Obv he has better game knowledge and decision making but you get the point.\n\nSo yes, this is actually a perfect change to him and one that probably should have been done ages ago.\n\nAlso just out of curiosity when are you guys planning on reworking veigar properly? You guys kind of ruined the best veigar play style(roam and extreme aggression) and forced him into the crappy farm one only the bad veigar players used at the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Crett","date":"2015-08-15T08:03:31.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"your name...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Trundle Bundle","date":"2015-08-15T07:29:21.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Veigar's singular antimage quality has never been a fantasy fulfillment like with the others.
