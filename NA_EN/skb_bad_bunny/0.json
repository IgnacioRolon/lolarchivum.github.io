There obviously was some fight in the chat as in every LoL game but it wasnt nearly as harsh for it to be considered extremely toxic, I was called useless all game long and I obviously defended myself, I said clearly in chat that I dont feel like playing and that I&#039;d rather surrend if all the team would ignore my calls because I was apparently &#039;&#039;useless&#039;&#039;. Now the best part of all that is I got banned right one sec after the game ended.\r\n\r\nDid a Riot employee check the chat logs in a second and decided I was toxic enough to be banned? I doubt. LoL&#039;s ban system is a meme in itself and obviously the guys that called me useless all game long didnt get punished at all because there was only one report for them which I sent myself. \r\n\r\nAnother good question would be, am I too toxic? Sometimes, yes. However this time I got for that exact game since the only chat logs that appeared on the suspension notifications were the ones from that exact game where I didnt go out of the limit at all. Actually I&#039;ve been pretty pumped lately and trying to do my best in games. \r\n\r\nAlso there is a mute button (which is true I didnt use, dont really know why), so why would you ban people for talking crap in the chat when you can mute that one person and disable their pings too. If that system is worth nothing just remove it and ban every player that says &#039;&#039;fuck you&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;kys&#039;&#039; on chat, lmfao, and let all those people that actually troll games and throw on purpos get out unscaved.","replies":[]}
