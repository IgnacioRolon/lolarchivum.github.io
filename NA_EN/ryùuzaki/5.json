Demacian's take great pride in maintaining their honor to the death, and thus are unafraid of dying. As it states in Kindred's lore, true Demacians will *always* take lambs arrow. While everyone around him would still feel profound sadness and loss at Garen's death, they would be required by Demacian custom and honor to maintain composure. I think the artist did a good job at portraying order, while showing the darkness is closing in. The peace is hanging by a thread.\n\nAlso, Katarina would not be allowed anywhere near Garen's funeral. Garen is the poster boy for Demacia, and thus his funeral and burial would be attended by thousands of Demacians (especially Jarvan III and Jarvan IV), and would be surrounded by the kings guards. Katarina is good, but no mortal is *that* good. She would be killed if she tried to attend.
