(verifying the ownership of the account) \nbecause I've sent them details about the account from the past 3 years and i can provide them with way more but i need to be kept updated about what's going on exactly because as i said sent sent over 5 messages with various questions and none of them were answered. \nthanks again for the reply, i'm a bit worried because this is the first time i encounter such a problem and i do hope it gets solved as soon as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-06T20:12:14.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The information provided may not have been enough, so you might be asked further questions to help you out.
