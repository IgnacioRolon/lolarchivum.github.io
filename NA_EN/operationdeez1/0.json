The completely nerfed lane Fiddles to shit. The reason I think he needs a rework is because of the people that bitch about him to get him nerfed. You know, Zed is allowed to be stupid strong because \"lolz Qss\", yet Fiddles gets nerfed when Qss countered him about 10x more than Zed, along with the tit ton of other counterplay he had. His own abilities make enemies run away from you, on a champ that you have to be close to do damage. Nerfing everyone of his abilites, including his passive, have made him in a very meh state to play. But, he can't be in a good spot because \"omg rito nerf fear cuz it counters my 100% damage build on Tryn so OP\".","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Voidac","date":"2015-05-23T23:33:15.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any chance of a Brand ability particle update?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hobbsgoblin","date":"2015-05-24T19:07:38.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps they haven't scheduled an update for the update schedule.","replies":[{"poster":"OperationDEEZ1","date":"2015-05-24T20:05:33.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://static.ylilauta.org/files/4l/orig/4v9ajmcx/give-that-man-a-slice-of-ukraine.png","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cochumi","date":"2015-05-24T02:36:19.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:83}}  love?...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ramuhdo","date":"2015-05-23T23:43:27.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"More interestingly, Poppy is listed on the schedule, Ashe isn't, and Ashe got a rework sooner. :( Where's the Poppy love!","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2015-05-24T18:54:35.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ashe's rework project was quite literally something they could do because they had a bit of time (A week or two?) to relax, and they thought they could give ashe some love.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-05-24T09:40:58.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aktuelly Poppy got the rework sooner, it's just that Ashe is already done, because there wasn't as much to do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chocolate Waifu","date":"2015-05-24T08:43:49.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much as I'm dieing to see the new Poppy VU and GU, I wanna say Ashe was..
