I went to go ping(alt) to show how much more gold I need, to get a certain item, and League freezes. I’m like “Okay.. it must just be League since I can still hear my friends in discord, so ill just wait it out.” I couldn’t alt+f4 nor could I ctrl+alt+del, and nor could I alt+tab or windows. A couple of minutes later my laptop’s sceen goes black and I can no longer hear my friends. Not knowing what do, I decide to turn off my laptop and turn it back on (which was probably a bad idea). What I was left with was another black screen. My laptop refuses to start up and I can’t even reach the log in screen to sign into my personal account. The screen is just black and nothing is popping up, for the past 10 minutes now.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-20T05:17:51.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"O_O that sounds rather worrisome....\n\nFirst off, and I know this sounds silly and I'm sure you've already checked, but let's check one last time that it's connected to a power source and that the laptop battery is fully connected by taking it out and back in.
