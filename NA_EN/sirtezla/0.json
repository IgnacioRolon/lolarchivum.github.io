When I saw them in concert a few times I just showed up in plainclothes, but really got a kick out of the constumes everyone was wearing.\n\nLater I started playing around with steampunk as a place to do some light hobby game design in my spare time, and came up with some airship captains and their backstories. There was the proper society lady with a hidden life. There was the guy who was constantly inventing crazy new technologies. A few others came along, and I was always able to come up with a name that felt right. The one that fought with me, though, was the ex-military captain who runs a really disciplined ship.\n\nAs I was playing around with some different scenarios/stories, I eventually came up with the idea of making that captain into my steampunk alter ego, at which point it was an easy choice. My middle name is Randolph, which totally fits a steampunk world, and I decided that he kept calling himself by his military rank, even after he left to start a career of piracy. Thus Lieutenant Randolph, shortened to LtRandolph. Since I came up with the name, I've assembled a full steampunk costume that I sometimes wear to Cons.","replies":[{"poster":"Leon Hinomoto","date":"2014-05-02T20:48:34.396+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just jumped a billion rungs on my ladder of awesome Rioters.  <3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cerbearus","date":"2014-05-01T22:51:27.439+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Started my PC gaming on a little gem known as...

This name is slightly more interesting to tell the tale of. So, to start it is a combination of Macklemore and Doge and I made it my name because of the amusing quality and the fact that my group of friends really liked it. I have a dog and he's afraid of thunder, so we have a thunder shirt for him and also a winter coat. Well one day it was storming and in the winter, so to get him to go outside we had to put both the coat and the thunder shirt on him and he looked so ridiculous but also had a weird Macklemore sort of style going on, so I labeled him the MackleDoge. My friends and I had a good laugh about it and shared the various pictures of him back and forth and eventually one thing led to another and it became my name.\n\nSo yea.....I'm named after my dog.","replies":[{"poster":"Inciflahrdus","date":"2014-05-02T22:51:53.530+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just like Indiana Jones! :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-05-02T18:29:37.074+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought that the idea of a cupcake-baited snap trap set to maim hungry little Teemos was marvelously dark and funny.","replies":[{"poster":"MackleDoge","date":"2014-05-02T18:43:11.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hard to argue with that reasoning.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rhyto","date":"2014-05-02T13:41:57.435+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I began my MMO gaming years I was heavily influenced by TWGOK (The World God Only Knows) I used the ingame name KamiSama007 but growing into playing League of Legends I outgrew the name as I deemed it childish on my part and decided to make a name similar to Kirito from SAO (Sword Art Online) as my own kind of name in which I decided on Rhyto (Rai-to), it was similar in a way and I liked it and I just realized after coming back from Japan that my name means \"Light\" or as an example for those who played Final Fantasy XIII and the sequels, Lighting's Nickname is (Rai-to) So I found it amusing and this name is pretty much my dominant gmrtag currently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-05-01T21:09:54.650+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was wondering when this would come up :P\n\nTo start I was 'ArmaMalum' first. I had just started Latin class in middle school and I wanted be all fancy with total understanding of the Latin language (I was playing WoW at the time). So I proceeded to think I was clever and broody at horribly batching a name literally translating to \"Weapon of Malice\". Later I learned the more appropriate ~~(although probably still not exactly right)~~ term was ~~\"ArmumMalos\"~~ \"ArmumMali\" with proper declension and gender, but I already had the first one on several games and characters at that point and it stuck.\n\nThe 'Sir\" prefix was actually much more recent, and so far is only a LoL thing. A few of my friends had a ranked team going and most of them also had a \"Sir\" prefix to their name as a gag. I thought it was funny, but didn't even think about changing my own name until after our first league tournament almost this time last year. We weren't (and aren't) that good by any means, but I bet them if we did made it to the finals I would spend the earned RP to change my name to \"Sir ArmaMalum\". Needless to say we did, much to my surprise. Granted, we proceeded to get crushed horribly by the winning team (it was actually mostly my fault -_-) but nonetheless I had fun and learned a lot. As well as earned enough RP to keep my promise with a little left over. I have not once regretted that bet ever since.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-05-02T00:47:02.444+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're a feminine weapon of malice, it's OK.\n\nArmum Malos...

In the squeal to Ender's Game the protagonist is considered the Xenocide (killer of aliens) for wiping out the only known alien race and the 'alien' from the Alien movie is called a Xenomorph (changing alien).
