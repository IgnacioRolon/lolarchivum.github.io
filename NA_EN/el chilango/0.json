Shoot me a screenshot where I can see the current time you've been in the queue (which should be under that reconnecting box). Right now it looks like your queue is just getting interrupted from losing the connection with the matchmaking servers, which you should be able to fix with the steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).","replies":[{"poster":"El Chilango","date":"2017-11-22T21:21:49.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I already did that, \nhttps://imgur.com/a/ZfSk3\n\nNothing changed, i tried also on a friend PC and Network, same problem.\nThis is my main account and i have it since Season 2, so please help me unlock it.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/MfnSf\n\nI spent 6 minutes in the low priority and the timer reset to 20:00 minutes again. \n\nTIME REMAINING \n19:38\n\nFINDING MATCH \n6:05\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/m3XKB\n\nAfter wait for 7 minutes more now im not longer in queue....\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/WS3aV\n\nCan i have a real solution please, this is frustrating, i have 1 week like this...","replies":[{"poster":"El Chilango","date":"2017-11-24T20:08:18.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Warweak,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=Ovs8niwE,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2017-11-22T21:21:49.523+0000)\n>\n> I already did that, \n> https://imgur.com/a/ZfSk3\n> \n> Nothing changed, i tried also on a friend PC and Network, same problem.\n> This is my main account and i have it since Season 2, so please help me unlock it.\n> \n> https://imgur.com/a/MfnSf\n> \n> I spent 6 minutes in the low priority and the timer reset to 20:00 minutes again. \n> \n> TIME REMAINING \n> 19:38\n> \n> FINDING MATCH \n> 6:05\n> \n> https://imgur.com/a/m3XKB\n> \n> After wait for 7 minutes more now im not longer in queue....\n> \n> https://imgur.com/a/WS3aV\n> \n> Can i have a real solution please, this is frustrating, i have 1 week like this...\n\nHello?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
