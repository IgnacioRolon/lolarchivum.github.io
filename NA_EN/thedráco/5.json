The recent nerf to his tether on the PBE made me reflect that Riot has the same balance strategy with many champs. By far the most problematic aspect of {{champion:9}} is his ultimate paired with zhonyas. Riot nerfs every single ability on {{champion:9}} BUT his ult and even BUFFS the ult to boot. Fiddle could have been easily fixed by tweaking his ult to either reduced range or less damage. For other examples ill go down the list of champs im aware of where Riot used this same balance.\n\n{{champion:105}} Playful trickster is the most problematic aspect. Riot tweaks everything else.\n\n{{champion:79}} Low cd dash is the most problematic aspect. Riot reworks the champ and buffs his dash\n\n{{champion:55}} Easy skill resets are the most problematic aspect. Riot tweaks damage.\n\n{{champion:64}} High damage, High tankiness, High mobility, Low energy costs. Riot removes attack speed debuff... just why?\n\n{{champion:236}} Long rang poke is too strong and mobility is too high. Riot nerfs poke range and buffs mobility.\n\n{{champion:25}} long lasting easy to land snare is the most problematic aspect. Riot nerfs everything else.\n\n{{champion:76}} The spears where obscenely powerful. Instead of simply nerfing spear they rework her and make EVERYTHING too powerful.\n\n{{champion:107}} Free stats from kills and assists, doesnt lose any on death. Riot completely ignores this and tweaks everything else.\n\n{{champion:92}} Tanky shield that scales off of ad. Riot nerfs damage.\n\n{{champion:91}} Damage is a tad too high. Riot removes silence. WHAT?!?!\n\n{{champion:44}} Stun is too powerful. Riot gutted everything else but stun.\n\n{{champion:412}} Hook hitbox is way too easy to land. Riot tweaks everything else.\n\n{{champion:254}} Ult lacks counterplay. Riot tweaks everything else.\n\n{{champion:62}} Ult is too powerful. Riot nerfs his lane bullying.\n\n{{champion:157}} 50% ARMOR PEN ULT. Riot nerfs Q and E\n\n{{champion:238}} Strong poke, Strong escape, Strong damage, all on low energy cost. Riot reduces attack speed.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-02-12T05:17:44.922+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nerfing the strengths of every strong kit makes them all feel more samey.\n\nRather than reducing strength, accentuate weakness.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-02-12T10:09:01.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have valid points but I'm going to Agree with this guy ^ Keeping champion identity is the reason they make some of the tweaks they do.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talamare","date":"2015-02-12T05:09:35.393+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you are wrong in some examples however overall you have a point\n\nRiot has said it before \"they nerf around what makes the champion cool\"\n\nWhile that isn't really the worst idea, sometimes they really do need to nerf a little of what makes the champion cool","replies":[{"poster":"1 Wing","date":"2015-02-12T05:32:59.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like \"nerfing around what makes the champion cool\" is only what they do when the champion is first released.

Riot has nerfed every single one of Fiddle's abilities, except for his ult. Certainly the most powerful feature of Fiddle is his ult, so Riot wrecks his early game effectiveness on a champion that virtually can't even get kills early game to begin with.\n\nIt does create a kind of \"single critical\" scenario where landing one ability right, wins the teamfight; if the enemy disrupts it somehow, then that champion can't really do anything else that battle. Many champions are like this. .","replies":[]},{"poster":"1 Wing","date":"2015-02-12T05:30:19.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My problem with their strategy is that, after nerfing powerful champions, they release even more powerful champions, and then everyone whines about how strong they are.\n\nIf they had left powerful champions in the first place, then there would be something to fight these OP abilities with. \"Oh, your champion can do this stupid troll poll? Well, mine can kill you if you land slightly out of position\" \"Oh, yours can kill one of my team if they're out of position? Well once that ability is down, one of my team can go in and assassinate your ADC.\" \n\nBalance doesn't have to mean \"nothing kills you quickly,\" a powerful ability can be balanced by other champions having equally powerful abilities, too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reynard the ƒox","date":"2015-02-12T05:08:10.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:134}} Q-E was too easy too land.

Her nerfs probably made sense in the old world.  Systems changes happened, most notably to Grail and DFG, and those would have been enough to make her balanced.

She's quite fun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DisasterSola","date":"2015-02-12T05:19:41.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is called \"Flash and flare reactionary nerfs\".\nWhen a champion has a cool looking ability, they keep it and just shift power from other skills TO the flashy skill.\n\nRiot is largely to big for their own good...\nI think they would benefit from starting a new game. Like... a new MOBA but with an entirely different balance and design philosophy.","replies":[]}]}
