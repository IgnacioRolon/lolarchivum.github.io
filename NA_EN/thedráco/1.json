Hell this will take a steaming heap on all ganking junglers in general. Seriously this game doesnt need any more catering to those who cant position and ward correctly. We already have {{summoner:21}} {{summoner:7}} {{summoner:4}} {{champion:412}} lanturn . Ive never said this about any game before but if this ward makes it in I will be uninstalling.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-02-19T15:38:43.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is more of the trinity problem.\n\nPower Creep ~ New champions get stronger and do more damage than older ones. (Riot has don't mostly great on this)\n\nMobility Creep ~ New/Reworked champions just have tons of mobility. (Riot is doing poorly on this)\n\nand finally\n\nVision Creep ~ More and more vision items/skills/spells/ect... (Rather new issue)\n\nThe thing with Vision Creep is how it ties so hard into Mobility Creep. As more and more vision is on the map, players must have champions that can dash over walls and have quick gap closers to AVOID the massive amounts of vision. So Shaco might still have a spot here or there to gank from. Eve is just straight out screwed. But that's Riot for you. If it's on the PBE it's already going to happen so no point in complaining. They really don't care.","replies":[]}]}
