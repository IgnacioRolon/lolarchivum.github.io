He's just known OP.  \n\nMundo maybe?  Wouldn't call him OP... wouldn't say his initiate is incredible either.\n\nWhatever.

Sure it hits hard, but that's only gonna hit once every 10/8/6 seconds. It's not his damage that kills you if he builds tank, it's his ability to stick to you and keep you where he wants you until his team gets there because, honestly, he isn't dealing a whole lot of damage outside of that.\n\nAm I saying he deals no damage at all as a tank? No way. I've come to love Jarvan because he fits my style of offensive tanking, I'm not much for those passive sorts of tanks that are just kinda *there*, but he is in no way dealing tons of damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shıma","date":"2015-01-22T11:21:15.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll take Elise for $400","replies":[]},{"poster":"mirAcIe","date":"2015-01-22T10:45:38.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vi?
