The most notable ones are {{champion:122}} {{champion:76}} which may have been frustrating to play against but they had clear counterplay and I always felt like its my skill level that determines the win against them. The same cannot be said about {{champion:127}}.\n\n This champ is the most infuriating thing to play against. There is no counterplay with her. You beat her up she ults you die. You farm under tower she ults you die. You get a jungle gank, she ults herself blows up one or both of you flashes away. Late game she one shots a carry unless you focus her which she then ults herself then {{item:3157}} and then you lose the teamfight because you blew things on a champ that can never die. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT LISSANDRA.","replies":[{"poster":"youngjake93","date":"2015-02-18T07:43:08.129+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheDraco4011,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Fx9bFUiQ,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-18T07:37:02.747+0000)\n>  and then you lose the teamfight because you blew things on a champ that can never die.\n\nMaybe use your cooldowns on the vulnerable sustained damage carries rather than the burst mage that spends a good 7 seconds of the fight in stasis.","replies":[{"poster":"Zmuecat","date":"2015-02-18T07:45:07.604+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?

Unleash enough AOE burst in a team fight that she's forced to go into stasis and proceed to ignore her entirely. \n\nShe has excellent matchups versus melee champs due to her amazing crowd control but she's not the only champ in the game to murder melees top lane and one-shotting a carry really doesn't happen.
