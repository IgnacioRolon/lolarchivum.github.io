A large number of games have devolved into easy or impossible. Ive had great premades that basically put the game on auto pilot and present no challenge. On the flip side ive had premades so bad that they are squabbling with each other whether to surrender or not. In the old system with just solo and duo there was a lot more room for varied games and games which you could carry 1 or 2 not so great players. The premades make this near impossible.","replies":[{"poster":"B00B00","date":"2016-01-29T07:20:02.369+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"good thing there bringing out soloq then for people, where you cannot run premades.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tribunalLOSERS","date":"2016-02-01T03:16:21.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"premades in ranked is completely awful.
