There&#039;s no longer a penalty for players ranking together, so the benefits of grouping up will always prevail. You&#039;ll still need to be of similar rank to your queue-buddies, and the system is designed so that groups will almost always play against similarly grouped opponents (so if you&#039;re in a premade five, there&#039;s a 95% chance you&#039;ll run into another premade five), but now you&#039;ll be able to compete the way you want to.\n\nRanked teams will still be available for players who want to form a team of any skill level, as teams are judged on the skill of the static group rather than the sum total of the individuals. That said, this season we&#039;re also going to be improving the path to pro, with less ranked team grinding and more focus on performing when it counts. Details to come! \"\n\n\n\n\nThis is a horrible decision for those that play solo queue. This would completely dump on proper matchmaking and MMR. Why would I queue solo when in high likelyhood the enemy will be premades on skype? Isnt that the entire point of separating solo and team ranked? So we dont end up with horribly one sided games? Throwing a faceless 95% chance this wont happen isnt gonna cut it for the times it does.","replies":[{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2015-11-04T06:37:39.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On top of that I frankly don't believe them with that 95% number.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDráco","date":"2015-11-04T06:56:18.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AtheosisX,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xeuu0AUI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-04T06:37:39.816+0000)\n>\n> On top of that I frankly don't believe them with that 95% number.\n\nNah its totally legit just like how only 1% of the playerbase is toxic right?
