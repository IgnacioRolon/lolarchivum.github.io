They fixed this by nerfing her q and w and buffing her charm so you need skill to land cc before you can spam damage. Now they've reverted that change and gave her a speed boost to boot. What gives?","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-02-03T07:09:25.658+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That wasn't why they nerfed her.  Also, it isn't even an accurate description; Q was not nerfed in the 3.12 charm rework and ended up being buffed twice in subsequent patches.\n\nAhri had enough damage with DFG to miss everything and just R+DFG+W+R+R to kill squishy targets.  That's why they nerfed her damage unless she landed a charm.\n\nNow that DFG doesn't exist, this whole line of reasoning is void.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-03T08:10:22.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So now instead of 100-0'ing people, she kites the entire enemy team like a mage Lee Sin.

Before now she had two basic roles: that of a somewhat guerrilla fighting kite mage and the superior build as a DFG based assassin, a role that several others could fit better, and ignored much of the mobility in her kit as her ult was relegated more to a juking/escaping position than to be the icing on the cake of a combo because DFG gave the rest of her kit more than enough to kill someone.\n\nMost people were ignoring one of her design aspects to play a style that relied entirely on a single item, part of the reason that DFG was removed and one that I agree with.\n\nWith this change Ahri has found a stronger identity. Instead of one of several high damage, 100-0 nuking champions Ahri's finding a niche role as a mage who perhaps does a little less damage but over a more consistent amount of time, and who can succeed by using her full kit *wisely* instead of just trying to burn everything on one person and if it doesn't work to just ult back to safety.","replies":[]}]}
