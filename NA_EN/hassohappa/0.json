It isn&#039;t actually what I usually build but it also didn&#039;t seem like a terrible idea to me, and now I am tuned into the Riot Games steam of SKT vs KSV and Bang is building the same items in the same order. Just kind of funny to think about this dude in Gold 3 or something trying to explain to a top player in League that their build is trash.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-04T03:13:31.958+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing new under the sun.\n\nRemember it takes meta about 6 months to trickle down to mid/low ELOs, and it is often poorly understood when it does.","replies":[{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2018-04-04T03:26:31.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like miss fortune support","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hassohappa","date":"2018-04-04T03:22:44.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hah, I do remember people having conniptions when ADC started building Youmuu's on Lucian back in Season 3 because the active lasted longer on melee so ranged people were not allowed to build it.\n\nThe more I think about it though the more I like the idea of doing Reaver -> Rageblade -> Runaan's.

Or people being all, \"you need to upgrade it\" when upgrading it only gives 1 extra ward, 200 hp, and like 15 ap for 1000 ish gold.\n\nPeople will insult you for anything they can.  I had an All for One game as Zed, a champion I have never played before.  Told my team that, and one of them gave me pointers on what to do.  Shortly in, my top lane partner decides to leave and go farm the jungle for no reason (no jungle item), leaving me to 1v2 top lane.  I took Relic Shield too so we'd have some healing from their poke, so I'm doubly screwed by him leaving.  I'm half HP due to us being against Jhin, and teammate who went into the jungle starts pinging he is going to gank since he's 6.  Well, I'm still 5, half health, and don't know how to play my champion, so I'm staying as far away from them as possible.  He goes in dies, and they both hit 6, and ult me to death.  He goes on this huge long rant about how I'm horrible, no map awareness, can't listen to pings, whining \"how are we losing top tower at 3 minutes\", and such and such.  Luckily one of the other Zeds says, \"cause it's a 1 Zed vs 2 Jhins with a Zed who doesn't play the champion.  Not his fault.\"  I honestly did not expect someone to defend me, because I'm just used to people blaming instead of looking at the situation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KlydeFrog","date":"2018-04-04T15:05:35.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well getting 40% cdr right off means more ults and such.

She gets to use it once per fight pretty much regardless. Even at 40% CDR a level 3 ult has a 42 second cd, and it's not really an ult you want to just burn casually at the start of  the fight. I do like Essence Reaver into Death's Dance into a Zeal item which gets you 40% CDR but it's hardly the only way to build her.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-04-04T05:54:00.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's because everything you do is considered wrong and/or trash until a pro does it in low elo.\nfeelsbadman","replies":[]}]}
