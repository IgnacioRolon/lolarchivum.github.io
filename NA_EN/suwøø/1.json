I have reported the bug a couple times now and it's been around a month since the first report. I have seen no change and in that time I also have had Loot problems with getting nothing from opening chests. Whenever I change my pages and try to save; it says my runebook is corrupted. I have no problems on the Old Client and I would have no problem switching to the New Client if it wasn't at 75% functionality.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-23T22:53:00.096+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those corrupted rune pages have been a little bothersome, but we can get it fixed pretty quickly if you hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). \n\nIt looks like a couple of chests you opened gave you some Summoner profile icons, which don't actually go into your loot. The most recent one I'm seeing was about a month ago when you got the Super Galaxy Shyvana icon. Check you icons for that one if you didn't realize you got it!","replies":[{"poster":"SuWøø","date":"2017-04-24T16:14:20.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have submitted a ticket and forgot that you could even get icon's.
