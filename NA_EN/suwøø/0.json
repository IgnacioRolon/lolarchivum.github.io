Also, I feel as if getting to higher Honor is a little unfair for us Support players. Most likely people will honor their friends or someone who carries really hard and goes 10/0 and I feel like besides your ADC's choice it's rather hard to get honors.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-15T17:47:58.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll be eligible as soon as hitting Honor 3.  It's still a chance based drop, but will substitute out one of your 12 key fragments per ~28 days rate.  If you've already reached that limit, you may need to wait a bit.  Don't fret, even if you're not getting Honor your level will still continue to increase.  Receiving honor won't also increase the drop rate of capsules dropping.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"SuWøø","date":"2017-11-23T22:14:31.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just for clarity there is 0% chance to get an Honor Capsule till we hit Honor 3 correct?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuWøø","date":"2017-09-15T19:10:18.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you don't get capsules till Honor 3? Also, my understanding was the higher the Honor the higher chance of drops. Is that not true?

As your Honor levels grow, your emblem does as well but not drop rate.\n\nSlight correct- our developers just posted about increasing drop rate over time if you haven't been receiving them- but it should still be limited to the 12.

(And I'm an Honor 5, Top main, Support secondary.)\n\n* When people don't know who to Honor because everyone was more or less neutral, and just want  to Honor *some*one to get the Honor Progress Boost, they usually tend to Honor the Support.\n* Your ADC is most likely to Honor you before anyone else if you actually deserve it the least amount, simply because he was the most likely beneficiary and was always here around you to see your good work.\n* Pre-made don't always Honor each other because they know it's not really useful. And even if they did, a lot of people aren't in Pre-mades.\n\nAll in all, it's just as easy earning Honor as a Support as from all other Positions.","replies":[{"poster":"SuWøø","date":"2017-09-15T19:07:52.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really want to start a long conversation seeing as this is a support/help page, but maybe that is how it is on EU servers, but not NA.
