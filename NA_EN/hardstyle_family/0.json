In my opinion these chat logs are not toxic at all.\n\nGame 2 - We had a friendly teemo suport that decided to hard feed bot and then ganking top as teemo suport, guess what, he int feed my lane and his own costing the intire team the game. I was tilted, because is hard to focus and win when someone in your team does not put effort and decides to have fun ruinning people promos. \n\nGame 3 -  This one is a joke. In the previous patch i had a Error due to the patch 7.10  that stopped me from entering games ( DirectX Error), it was afecting tons of people in the league comunity, i manage to fix it later after a while. Then when i update the client to patch 7.11, i start my first game and guess what i could not play because Lol was freezing randomly in game every 10 seconds ( Yes, it was not the FPS or Ping ), that have never happened before. I died because i could not move or control my character. I was forced to close the client and reenter the game. It took like 7 mins, costing me the game and my team. Ofc it was realy pissed of because i couldnt do anything to prevent that. Im 80% it was error due to the new patch. \n\nI look at my own chat logs and tought about it. In my opinion this is not that &quot;toxic&quot; and perma ban worthy, but i can see that i was tilted and wrote a lot.\nI reconize that i was not friendly or positive, but In my opinion it doesnt look fair to perma ban cases like these. i think the punisment system and rates should be updated or bring back the tribunal. \n\n\nTell me what you think.\n\n\n\n-Hardstyle Family","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2017-06-08T01:29:18.914+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you ever recieved a 14 day ban before?","replies":[{"poster":"Hardstyle Family","date":"2017-06-08T01:32:49.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes...","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2017-06-08T02:05:13.195+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, there's your problem. Punishment works in tiers meaning every time you get punished, you go to the next tier from 2 chat restriction to the afore-mentioned 14 day ban to your perma.\n\nGranted, there are exceptions. Homophobic slurs, threats, telling people to kill themselves, those things can make you jump straight to 14 day or perma ban.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-06-08T03:25:31.695+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly, while you are certainly not the worst of toxic players on League, your communication is still overly negative.\n\nYou use the words \"noob\" et al. in a negative manner, even if it's joking. You say \"gg\" in the beginning/middle of the game, making other players think you've given up. You call people a joke, accuse them of intentionally feeding, and tell them to go home. You take one mistake by someone, refuse to accept anything other than them being a troll, then hold a grudge for it the rest of the game and don't let anyone else forget it.\n\nHonestly speaking, and I don't mean to be rude or crass with you, these three chat logs would potentially warrant a permanent ban even if it has been a while since your last punishment. It's this kind of targeted, continual abusive chat that makes League games unfun for many people.\n\nConsidering you've had a 14 day ban before, you were duly warned that your next punishment was likely to be escalated to a permanent ban. You failed to heed the warning and improve greatly, and so you are now here. If you do choose to make a new account, I implore you to please only use in-game communication (chat and pings) for important *future-oriented* gameplay related information. Don't dwell on the past, and don't target specific players, target strategy.\n\nTo comment about Tribunal, I participated in it while it was a thing a long time ago. The punishment system had two options: \"punish\" or \"not punish\". When enough players selected punish, it was escalated to either an automatic punishment *of the next level* or to a Rioter for a manual punishment in borderline cases. People were permanently banned by Tribunal all the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-08T01:44:09.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you've have a 14 day ban before... and you're logic is to come back and harass people... ok.\n\n\nEven if they are messing up, oh well. you're a better play, big whoop.\n\n\nEven if they are flaming you, mute and report... don't talk back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, you constantly harass people, so yea, it's not extreme language toxic, but it's toxic to riot's standards since you do this consistently","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2017-06-08T03:25:11.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Way too much socializing.

You've said you had a 14 day ban. At that time you were informed of the next punishment, a permaban.\n\nYou did deserve a punishment, in my opinion. Very little of your chat is dedicated to helping your team. You also suggest giving up in every game that was in your report card. Further, you harassed a teammate in every game.\n\nBecause you deserved a ban and had recently had a 14 day ban, you deserved a permaban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warhammer Titan","date":"2017-06-08T02:17:53.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesnt matter what your team was doing, if you show constantly your toxic you will get punished","replies":[]}]}
