To specify it works perfectly fine when I am in full screen mode, the 4k graphics are solid, and not taxing at all on my gpu. I like to monitor various vitals through MSI Afterburner, and (as stated) I do not like using my full tv as a monitor. So I can either run full screen for 4k or dull it down in order to see MSI Afterburner data.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-26T19:40:44.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"This is what happens when you become an early adapter of poorly-supported, completely overkill next-gen technology.\n\nIf this is windows 10, it is probably one of the many glitches involving window scaling on large screens, not league.","replies":[{"poster":"Redsky","date":"2016-09-10T23:03:10.348+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2pAgK3d4,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-26T19:40:44.086+0000)\n>\n> This is what happens when you become an early adapter of poorly-supported, completely overkill next-gen technology.\n> \n> If this is windows 10, it is probably one of the many glitches involving window scaling on large screens, not league.\n\nNo it is 100% leagues fault, cause their UI is programmed in a very bad way (aka no resolution scaling). WHICH IS BAD DESIGN! Also 1440p (a very common resolution now a days) is way too small to play decently on! Stop whiteknighting riot when they are at fault!","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-11T00:44:14.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"UI is all rescalable.\n\nIf you have it at 100% and it is too small, you have bigger problems to worry about than screen size.

Most people dont play PC games on a TV, especially competitive ones - far worse input lag and compatibility issues, plus scaling.\n\n4K is about a 1500$ overhead between GPU and monitor, and gives more or less zero benefits, especially in a competitive game. The vast majority of custom systems are under the 1000$ mark, and OEM machine sales even lower spec. Most \"gaming\" computers struggle at 1080p 60hz in demanding games.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-08-26T19:44:03.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"FirstWorldProblems.dll","replies":[]}]}
