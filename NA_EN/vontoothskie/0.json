Is there a reason to gut the small flavor text things people enjoy about champs when reworking them?  does this design team not understand the references the champion was built on?  Is it necessary to remove a champions soul and flavor when rebuilding there kit?

Old Mord was based on the character Iron Man from the Black Sabbath song, in both his look and kit, and all his abilities were named after songs from the genre. His whole creation was a love-letter to heavy metal and it was awesome. I scrolled over Mords bio and instantly got it, as did tens of thousands of others. the new ability names are not only not famous heavy metal songs, they are just random words that sound cool, same as every other champion. they have nothing to do with referencing metal.  to wit:\n\n1) There could be dozens of bands/songs called obliterate, but as a lifelong metal head with decades of interest in the genre I can comfortably say the word is more likely to make me think of Starcraft Archons than Metal.  it just isn't an in-joke to the metal scene.  Even a google search only pulls up a Ukranian band that none of the metal-heads in my scene had heard of. \n\n2) Disturbed is not a Heavy Metal band. they are radio friendly nu-metal/emo band, which is not only a different genre entirely but is generally disliked by metal heads.  not a heavy metal reference\n\n3) Pentakill is not a Heavy Metal band, they are an in game power metal band. Power metal is basically orchestral Heavy metal, so it sort of works?  Still not a heavy metal in joke\n\n4) I have a Judas Priest tatoo and it didn't even occur to me to put this together.  Maybe that's on me, but I'm pretty sure the dev team named his R without knowing it was similar.\n\nI mean 4 of Garens abilities are Hardcore bands, but that wasnt intentional.  Although Garen is sort of a straight edge avatar","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XJ99999999999999","date":"2019-05-29T02:52:33.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"the character was modeled around real life things instead of the world of runeterra. so, riot choose to expand their own lore instead of double downing on it.","replies":[{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2019-05-29T03:04:49.940+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XJ99999999999999,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YQykazIz,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-05-29T02:52:33.093+0000)\n>\n> the character was modeled around real life things instead of the world of runeterra. so, riot choose to expand their own lore instead of double downing on it.\n\nRight, which they did by giving his Q the ever-creative and lore-expending name \"Obliterate\" lmao.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BrightWîngs","date":"2019-05-29T06:39:55.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"how could you say this and not think there would be a metal song named Obliterate or Indestructible come on guy XD","replies":[{"poster":"VonToothskie","date":"2019-06-08T07:38:19.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BrightWîngs,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YQykazIz,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-05-29T06:39:55.536+0000)\n>\n> how could you say this and not think there would be a metal song named Obliterate or Indestructible come on guy XD\n\nAlmost all of every champs kit is the name of a song by coincidence.
