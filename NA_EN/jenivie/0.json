I noticed that her orb doesn&#039;t have the dark shades in it anymore and is instead all blue. Also her orb on the challenger skin looks quite smaller than the orbs for her other skins. I&#039;m not sure how to include a screenshot lol, but If anybody else noticed this please feel free to post any pictures about it because I don&#039;t know how","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-02T18:55:38.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eeep!
