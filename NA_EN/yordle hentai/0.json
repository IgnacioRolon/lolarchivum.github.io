However, during the times I interconnected, I checked if I could still open my browser and for some reason I could. I could also check my skype messages during that time so, I know my connection was pretty much fine. Anybody have any idea on what this was about since that did not happen in any other games that I played today at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-11T22:09:32.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not aware of any server issues that happened during this time.
