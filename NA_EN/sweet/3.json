I've had a lot of pies that are far heavier than most cakes I've had and vice versa. A large factor in how heavy a cake is typically is dependent on how much frosting the creator chose to use, and how heavy that is, rather than the cake itself, as well as all the other stuff put on top of it. I myself am very fond of a classic cheese cake as well as Chinese fruit cake (which isn't heavy at all imo). The only pie I really like is apple, so I voted cake.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kyrio Dynami","date":"2014-06-10T16:13:39.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pie has way more texture, tastes so much better because it isn't so hefty, and pie doesn't make you feel fat after.","replies":[]}]}
