TITLE. EVER. But i don&#039;t know how else should make a topic that&#039;s asking a question.\r\nBut my real question:\r\n1- Why exactly the big hatred?!?\r\n2- What are the mistakes he did?\r\n3- How the hell did a marine biologist end up in developing games?!?!?\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t hate/blame people without a good reason, i admit that. I mean, like those plants in the jungle (which was from Ghostcrawler, if i&#039;m not mistaken), were good add ups to the games, and people called it trash? Like why even? Red plant for escape/ganking potential, Green plant for extra sustain so you won&#039;t back, and the blue to make sure enemy has no vision. Like HOW IS THAT A BAD THING FOR THE GAME?\r\n\r\nSo...somebody please do explain, thanks.\r\nNote: no need for essays. hahaha XD","replies":[]}
