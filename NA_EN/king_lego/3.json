There is no reason for its existence in the first place and yes, it is toxic, you are rushing Zhonyas for reason and now you get one either for free and it is also component with same active, but doesnt share cd, so you can use stopwatch, back, get Zhonyas(or new stopwatch) and use active again...\n\n10% cd on item is unnecessary, build path should be armguards + 2 tomes and combining cost should grow up.\n\nJust imagine if there was similar item for Archangel, Stoneplate, Gunblade/botrk(oh), Locket, hexdrinker, Redemption, Steraks, righteous, Protobelt or GLP.
