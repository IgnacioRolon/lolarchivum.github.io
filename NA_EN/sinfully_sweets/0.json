My fps is **just fine** but the MS just randomly spikes all throughout the game. Not once but twice where my whole team... yes **WHOLE** team dc'd. So explain that to me before questioning my internet or device I play on. If anyone else has this issue, then why is Riot not working on it? I mean, I love playing League, don't get me wrong. But if the issues continue.. I'm gonna have to find another Moba to play, unfortunately. On a different note, I **have** reset my modem/router. I **have** restarted my laptop. But the issues still persist. Can **_ANYONE_** shed light on this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-06T18:12:33.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could be a local ISP issue or a regional backbone provider issue. I haven't seen a ton of reports of connection problems specific to latency (ping), but we can definitely take a look. Before we dive further into something like a traceroute, we'll first need to ensure your local settings are good to go, by having you work through our [connection troubleshooting guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nIf you still have issues with inconsistent latency in-game after trying those steps, let me know.","replies":[]}]}
