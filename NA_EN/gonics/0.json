But what the hell is wrong with the ranked system? I find it impossible to play a game not have some troll or afker. I am bronze, yes. But it still isn&#039;t fair to lose a game and lp because of it.  I put time into this game only to find out someone going to troll. Then I lose, get mad, a don&#039;t want to play your game anymore. In my opinion, riot should spend more time banning these people instead of toxic players, you can&#039;t control toxic people but you can control trollers. I try hard to win, get out of bronze, and hopefully climb. But how is that possible with people from the left and right are just plain down dumb. Without a team you can&#039;t win. This is a team game not a solo game. So please spend more time banning these people. \r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-03-04T19:55:29.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MMR reset, flex queue accidents, and matchmaking changes effectively deleted (serious) ranked and started a chain reaction of ongoing clownfestival.\n\nEveryone who was plat V (0 LP) is now in bronze V for no real reason, is mad about it, and is trolling to A; show their displeasure and B; stay in bronze V.\nMeanwhile the broken matchmaking and RNG of climbing ranked is giving us wonders like the diamond vayne that goes 0/3 by 5 minutes in a silver/gold game (normals, luckily).\n\nAnd that which is bronze V is still unfortunately bronze V, just mixed in with everyone else more or less randomly.","replies":[]}]}
