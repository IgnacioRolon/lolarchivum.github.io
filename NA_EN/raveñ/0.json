His ultimate was a no cost SUPER high reward and was like giving away free candy.\n2.) Some of his scalings were a bit too high.

He is drastically item reliant.  When he misses his q he misses out on so much damage.  His e  gap closer puts him in as much danger as a sitting duck don't lie and tell me his ult was to high reward.  I could only fight people who are melee most of the time. When people see me w They run like a F1 car vroom vroom. People only complain because they feed Ekko that's every character in existence as well. Example my team feed blitz kaboom no one could 1 v1 him ... he was fing support for crying out loud Riot please you Nerf him so hard.  Every person who has played Ekko has given up on his difficulty he seems like he was intended to be a support like Bard.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2016-06-03T15:19:45.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://thefederalistpapers.integratedmarket.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/levelstupid.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"atomicwit","date":"2015-07-06T20:20:37.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ekko sucks everywhere but JG now.

During that 5 seconds you can dodge Q's, call for back up, FIGHT BACK etc\n\nFeed Talon, and unless you stay FAR the fuck away from him, he can kill you with E+Auto+QWR in 1 second 100-0 and the only thing you couldve done was stay out of range.  Hell if he is full build he will kill you even fast, my last talon game I hit 6 items and jumped on a 4-5 item Azir.  I killed him with E Auto Q instantly, before he could hourglass.  He died that fast.\n\nEvery other assassin will basically fucking delete you with little chance of response, but ekko who takes multiple rotations of his spells to do so over a decent chunk of time still does too much damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LaceUp23","date":"2015-07-06T19:42:57.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">u guys nerfed Ekko too hard he wasn't OP\n\n.\n\n>is thas what you guys do? make a op champ so ppl will spend rp on them\n\n\nDo you even know what you want to say?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snug  Buck","date":"2016-06-03T15:05:35.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I completely agree!!! i have been an ekko main since he came out and i just for mastery rank 7 on him.... then i read this nerf they put on him thinking \"ahhh it cant be that bad right?\" but no! i have gone on a massive loosing streak and it just feels so uncomfortable playing him now... the satisfaction of ekko has gone for me... to the point that i might just drop him as a main and  hope that oneday he is brought back to normal...and like Xanderzs said \"People just dont know how to counter him\" this is so true! i have seen so many people that have just walked straight into my ult and then cried that they could do nothing to avoid it... i mean all you need to do is keep an eye on it and.....well......walk the other way??? its just so easy to avoid people just need to use their brain.... PLUS his passive...so many people that have the two procs just walk straight back into my thinking i will just do a normal auto attack then call him broken when they die to the passive damage....THESE THINGS ARE SO EASILY AVOIDED!!! Three things to keep in mind when facing an ekko....1.Watch his ult 2.try to keep your distance when you have his passive stacked on you 3. just be ready to dodge the W.... I mean its so easy to predict when its gonna go off and you get plenty of time to react and move out....sooo in a nutshell im just saying. ekko did not need a nerf at all!!! people just needed to wise up and learn how he works and how to counter.
