I've had my eye on Varus, but I already have multiple long ranged pokers, so I'm going with Nautilus. He seems like a sturdy champion and I need at least 1 good tank.\n\nAlso, just because Riot is willing to do that for their players makes them my favorite company. I don't know of any other company that would do that.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-04T17:45:52.119+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We do help out when it comes to small amounts of RP.
