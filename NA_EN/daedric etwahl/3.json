ADC right now is a frustrating role to play - and I can understand why I am seeing so many tilting ADCs at the moment.  The role is no longer as clear as it used to be.  \n\nBy way of illustration, is the ADC the best and main:\n\n* **Turret taker?**  No that's more for the top lane and the odd midlane split pushers now.  (Case in point: the rise of Ziggs \"ADC\")\n\n* **Scaler with coin better than the others?**  Again no.  Quite a few assassins and top laners do that better.  A Yasuo or Tryndamere, for example, is off and running with 2 items - most of the ADCs need about one more item to get to that status (didn't use the word \"level\" here because the ADC is typically about 1-2 levels behind that same top laner at about the same time in the game).\n\n* **Ranged damage dealer?**  Actually that's better done by most of the AP midlaners right now.  Hard to compete with them.\n\nLiterally, the ADCs have become \"jack of all trades, master of none\" because Riot just doesn't know what to do with AD damage and the botlane role.  It's really a mess.  Truth be told they should be the ones used to push the turrets quickly and be the one's to best scale with items purchased - not the Tryndameres, Yasuos, Camilles, etc. That used to be the main job - but the desire to de-tank top lane has had a nasty trickle-over effect.\n\nPlus, in solo queue, it also does not help that most of the ganking types have started looking at botlane as a 2-for-1 meal deal.  If **either** one of the two botlane players on the other side is a bit weak, then it is like an open invitation for a free menu.\n\nIs it any wonder that players don't want to play either support or ADC?  Please Riot start making the roles a bit clearer.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Narvuntien","date":"2017-04-26T12:05:49.681+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I have been doing plenty of that, I am actually very good at it.\n\nThe issue is when you and your random ADC have no synergy.\nFor example I am a naturally safe player, I almost always plan some kind of escape or disengage from a fight, but about half my adcs... are agressive risk taking players. If I back off or don't go in at the right times I can severly tilt them... Or worse I hesitate, then join in thier madness getting us both killed instead of just letting them die (I have less issue letting people die when I am not support). \n\nThere is also jungle synergy or warding help that I stuffed up early last season that landed me in silver. I am quite the obessive warder but I kept getting caught warding, now I really need adc or jungle help to get some of the warding I need done safely. If they just don't get it then we are left without the wards.","replies":[{"poster":"The Mini Mermaid","date":"2017-04-26T16:32:16.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you. \n\nI am also a very safe player, I'll go in when the ADC \"somewhat\" engages or when jungle pings.
