It's very monotonous in the color? Also, the eyes look too human. :/ or at least in my opinion. The eye is the window to the soul and especially in picture, it's always certainly true. The old Ahri had pale skin, blue hair in a very green and foresty background. This just about made every part of her stand out. Like her hair, her clothing, the perfectness of the skin, her eye lining, her orb, even the faint whisker slash on her face. But in the new splash art, the colors are all dark and indifferent. Truthfully, the only thing I looked and observed first was the orb because that's where the burst of colour stood out. Perhaps, you can make her pale skin show out more when it's facing the orb, rather than the vice versa. Make her hair a lighter tone, but darkened by the background, but stands out in the orb area. Show the initial Ahri whisker. make the ears stand out more, perhaps in a cute seductive way. Making the area where the orb lighter and the outside darker can drastically make her stand out and make her look way different, well at least in my opinion. Also, her eyes should have like a middle-east or perhaps Egyptian eyeliner instead of a anglo-saxon everyday girl make up eyeliner. It would also be cool if her hair kind of circled around the orb, just the faintest, and make it a very straight-yet purmmed hair and have a little braid at the end of her hair that gathers it all together in a clean Eastern hairstyle that usually is braided in a manner to show a woman that's seductive to men, but doesn't try to be. And perhaps making her nails longer and tilt her head in a way to look as if she's just about to swiftly run and leave, in a leading manner. But I think that this is a good skin, overall. Just needs some more thought and consideration to make it either really perfect or a complete buster of Ahri's image.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahris Secrets","date":"2014-10-23T16:21:48.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If faker says no then its no.
