When faced with an update, the patcher scans the installation looking for any corrupted or missing files that need to be replaced.  The best step to take is to simply let it scan as many files as it needs to.  As long as you don't get an error message, the patcher should patch normally.\n\nIf you do get an error specifically when scanning files, it may indicate a problem with your OS Permissions.  Your OS might simply be blocking the patcher from scanning as many files as it needs to.  In this case, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Permissions Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104).  \n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sgathach","date":"2016-05-18T19:22:50.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently experiencing the same thing.
