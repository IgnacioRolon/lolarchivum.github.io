I currently am having issues during gameplay where my FPS will randomly drop from a smooth 60 FPS to lows sometimes as bad as 9-20 FPS for several seconds during teamfights and things like that. \r\n\r\nCurrent specs are:\r\n\r\nNvidia GTX 1080\r\nI7-6700K (4Ghz)\r\n32 GB 1866 Ghz Ram\r\nSamsung 950 pro SSD\r\n\r\nI have been experiencing this issue for a while now, and so I did a full computer wipe and restore to Windows 10 to see if it would help the issue. Even on a clean install it's still doing this. Any help anyone could provide would be appreciated. I have already updated all the drivers on the computer as well. I'm stumped. It makes no sense at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-21T21:04:49.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's interesting that your frames are dropping after a reformat.
