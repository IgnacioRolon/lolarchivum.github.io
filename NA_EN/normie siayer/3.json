Saying Vlad has a high skill ceiling is kind of like saying Garen has a high skill ceiling. It takes a knowledge of the champions strengths, weaknesses, capabilities, etc. and a lot of practice with decision making to succeed with champs that don't have any mechanical demands, which gives them a higher skill ceiling then at first glance, so champs like this can be harder to play effectively than a more mechanically complex champion. (How do you play against a team of players that know you want to run straight up to them and fight them from close range?)\n\nWith champions with a lot of mechanical possibilities, the skill ceiling comes from exploiting advanced mechanical techniques. There is still a learning curve when it comes to knowing how the champ performs and making decisions based on that, and in order to get a sense of that you have to also be playing that champ to their highest mechanical limits, which is why they're seen as having higher skill ceilings. Once you reach that mechanical mastery though, the decision making element becomes less demanding because there's so much you can do with the champion, versus champs who are limited by a lack of mechanics and are wholly reliant on decision making.\n\nOn a side note, for the champion that requires the most skill without having any mechanical demands, I say it's Singed. [Just watching through this Singed guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WAdszfTerM&amp;t=19s) the kind of map awareness and judgement you need to have good strategic decisions while playing Singed makes my head hurt.","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2017-03-25T00:45:49.429+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too add onto that, the difference between Azir and Other champions is that imo, he has WAY too many tools to justify how \"hard\" he is too play.\nBefore the nerfs it was not hard to succeed as Azir.\nYou summoned your shoulders, Q'd and then poked down the enemy.\nRun away with E if you ever get ganked. \n\nNothing about Succeeding as Azir was ever really difficult (talking pre-dumpster) because he had a tool in his kit for EVERY SINGLE Situation in the game. \n\nThere's nothing actually that hard about a champion who is prepared for everything. \n\nMy point is that playing Azir when he's not garbage tier is not really that hard, if anything he's on par with Orianna honestly. \nHowever making massive outplays and utilizing EVERY tool he has is quite difficult,  but only because there is simply so much in his kit to use. Using all of it, especially in one teamfight is quite hard to manage as Azir. \n\nThere's a significant difference between mechanical skill, and strategical skill. \nAzir has so much in his kit to justify having the highest mechanical skill floor in the game, but Strategy-wise that honor falls onto other champions like {{champion:163}} or {{champion:35}}, Their kits don't have tools that apply to every situation, so making their kits work in a way that DOES, is what makes them so deceptively hard to play.","replies":[{"poster":"SzGamer227","date":"2017-03-25T01:27:02.701+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly what I'm saying.

Without much knowledge about this champion and stuff you will be useless whole game long because of his atrocious laning phase and how hard it is to utilize your damage in teamfight due to telegraphed, delayed, close ranged abilities and the thing that you can be peeled off anytime and if your timing and positioning is shit you will die. All he brings to the table is unreliable damage dealt in close range.\nEven in one of the patch notes if I remember correctly it was stated that Vlad is one of the hardest champions to play (if I'll find it then I will post it below).\n\nAzir in my opinion has lower skill floor because of number of the tools and safety that isn't hard to utilize. Of course his tools, how to use them properly in any situation is hard but it says more about skill ceiling (just like in Zed's case). All you really need to contribute is make your laner feel miserable because you're lane bully and then use impossible to miss ult as disengage or in Anivia's fashion blocking the backline from fight. His damage output is also much more reliable, safer and anyone can utilize it.\n\nFound it: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-73-notes look for Vlad section.\n\nWhat makes champion hard is their skill floor. As a newcomer you will be total useless garbage as Ryze, Taliyah, Vlad, Riven, Bard because how high their skill floor is. You need to play several games to at least mean something in game.\nGaren (i'll ignore the fact that he is weak ATM) has really low skill floor, probably the lowest in game after Warwick's rework. Newcomers will do some meaningful actions. His skill ceiling is probably only animation cancel with Q and E.\n\nAzir before his gutting had in my opinion medium skill floor and ridiculously high skill ceiling. There is much to learn to become better with this champion but due to being ranged with decent gapclose, tones of zoning, self peel and reliable damage he wasn't so hard to use somewhat effectively once you got used to autoattack-soldiers synergy.","replies":[{"poster":"SzGamer227","date":"2017-03-27T00:00:51.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the distinction between skill ceiling and skill floor, your argument makes a lot more sense.
