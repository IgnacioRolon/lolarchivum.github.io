So I wouldn&#039;t be able to do much multitasking with it open. When in-game using the new client, it is better if I close the client and leave only the game open otherwise I get fps lag from it trying to run the client and game together. Which means I would be relogging after every game. If this is going to be the new client, will it be closing like the current client does majority of the time and reopening at the end of matches? I love the new look but damn, I&#039;m sacrificing a lot of resources when I personally care more about the gameplay than how I am getting into the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-10-19T00:12:49.893+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are in our minds. Ideally the client would shutdown automatically when a game starts and start up again when the game ends. It is not there yet, but we want that just as much as you do. Give us some time!
