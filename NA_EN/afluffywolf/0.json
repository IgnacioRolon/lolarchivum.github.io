That, is the question.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, It&#039;s been a long time since I experienced a day on the league like today. It&#039;s been like 1 week that I played and went with agreable teammates AND opponents. But today, I kept going with completely annoying people, destroying the fun out of the game. Let me tell you an exemple.\r\n\r\n1) I went on ARURF (with a friend) and got {{champion:254}} . A shoot, never played that champion before but I&#039;ll do my best. We are laned against {{champion:22}}  and {{champion:63}}  (Friend got {{champion:143}} ). I don&#039;t like to be pessimist, but it&#039;s pretty much a lose lane. We fight as best as we can, but the damage are too much, we die, die and die. Then, my friend disconnect and disapear from the Discord. I&#039;ll skip the details, but he has some huge problem with his computer currently. So, and in all honor to them, my teamates want to report him after the game. But I&#039;m like &quot;Jeez, he already have a hard time with his computer, I wouldn&#039;t want his account to get report&quot;.\r\n\r\nSo I try to defend him. All I get from my team are insults, spam of &quot;report Vi&quot; and &quot;report zyra&quot; in the /all chat. Now that I look back at it it&#039;s only normal that they reported my friend. He went AFK, even if it wasn&#039;t on purpose. Understandable. But then, I feared for me. Three of the enemy team says &quot;Will do&quot; as to say they will report us. But all I did was defend my friend !\r\nBTW. The reason to report me was because I was bad. Well, of course, that was my first time with the champ, you couldn&#039;t except much. I heard about people only responding to toxic people and get banned, so I really didn&#039;t want to get reported. Ah and of course, because it woudn&#039;t be fun if they didn&#039;t done that, the Brand kept spamming &quot;EZ&quot; every time he killed us. That kind of tilted me hoenstly at that moment.\r\n\r\nGG if you went so far in my crazy adventure trough the rift but my point here is : &quot;Should I report them ?&quot;\r\nSince they most likely did report me, if I &quot;counter-report&quot; them, Riot will ignore it, or sanction me aswell ? In the end. I still did report them. I always did mute those people before, but this time I felt like to try to resonate them, but hey. You can&#039;t succeed everytime.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Another point I wanted to ingage was : &quot;If an enemy spam his emote, says EZ in the chat, and completely does everything in their power to tilt you and show how much greater player they are than you. Can you report them ?&quot;\r\nFor anyone you could say &quot;Heh, just ignore them, it&#039;s the best&quot; but I just can&#039;t.\r\nI&#039;m not good a this game I must say. I&#039;ve got like 165~ masteries point ? So when an enemy is better than me, because well, of course you do encounter player that are better than you ! I just wish when they kill me they say &quot;gg nice try&quot; instead of &quot;EZ OMG YOU NOOB DELETE THIS GAME&quot;\r\nYes I&#039;m a noob, thanks for the reminder {{item:3070}}  I just hope there would be more...sportsmanship in this game.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading this ! Feel free to share your thoughts afterall I&#039;m here to discuss !","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2017-08-27T07:09:57.401+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Asking to report someone without just cause/lies is harassment, and they WILL be punished, responding to the begged report saying will do without a thought is also a count of 2nd hand harassment for being a unreasonable pathetic sheeple and can be reported, being toxic for spamming EZ in a unfriendly manner is also reportable.\nIt's honestly a harsh trial, you gotta defend yourself and your friend with evidence while being reasonable and not sound like a ahole before the judge. You shoulda said something about being your first time playing {{champion:254}} and that you are a complete noob, scrublord, what does q even do?? Is Vi good in this mode? etc, and be like hey don't listen to my toxic lying backstabbing teammates, they just jelly of my mentally challenged mechanics because I don't play longer than them and that your friend is playing on Windows XP with aol messenger on Internet Explorer and the land lord has to talk on the phone so he has to dc lul, it's only 10 min games so be gentle k ;^)","replies":[{"poster":"AFluffyWolf","date":"2017-08-29T18:44:02.763+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did told them it was my first time with this champion ^^\nBut yeah, I guess I was in a bad mood that way, I usually mute these people anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2017-09-02T10:50:35.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, better have some experience with people like that instead of muting them because you'll always meet people like that, who knows what they will do to your teammates.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2017-08-27T07:17:32.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't report either of them, but I very rarely report anyone anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Drugoth","date":"2017-08-29T19:01:28.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm the same way, it usually has to be a pretty extreme case for me to fill out a report form.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2017-08-24T23:55:23.034+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm. Basically report and just let Riot determine. You definitely don't want to try defending anyone, since that can be perceived as retaliation that is toxic. So really it's about HOW you defend someone. You really don't seem the toxic type so I get the feeling you didn't say anything nasty. They are right to report your friend, but to then go to all chat to ask for reports against him AND you is sort of harassment. But even then, maybe it's not, if you were engaging them aggressively. That's why I say just report and let Riot handle it.\n\nAs for them trying to tilt you with taunts and such, yes that is reportable. They can use the champ emote taunts all they want, but typing EZ consistently is a reportable offense. Obviously, it is best to ignore them and mute, but that doesn't mean you can't report too.","replies":[]}]}
