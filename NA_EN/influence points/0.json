Now, I&#039;m not certain whether this is a to-be-fixed issue, but I figured I&#039;d report it anyways.\n\nThe client is very small, so you can&#039;t even see the numbers properly. When the &quot;Updating bar&quot; filled up, it went outside the patcher, so you only see a portion of it.\n\nI installed the client in a &quot;PBE&quot; folder on my desktop where PBE is installed.\n\nTried running as an administrator, but no difference.\n\nAlso pretty sure something is supposed to be displayed in the black area.\n\nWould be awesome if you could expand the window like you normally would by placing the mouse on either side or in the corners.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-09-19T16:58:46.784+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just fixed this last week.
