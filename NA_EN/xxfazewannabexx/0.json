Whenever my laptop is plugged my charger, my league is fine. But when I unplug my charger from my laptop, my game starts freezing constantly in between 30-60 seconds. My only solution is to keep my laptop plugged in but I would like my battery to last as long as it can. I already downloaded Hextech Repair Tool but it didnt help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-29T23:33:33.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be a few reasons for this happening like hardware issues, but your drivers could be causing frame drops too.  The [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide would be a solid first step towards ruling out possibilities and getting this resolved.
