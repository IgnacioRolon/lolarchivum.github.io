With the use of stopwatch, this can make it extremely frustrating to play against either mid or bot side. Once Zhonya's is completed, it is essentially a get-out-of-jail free for making mistakes, especially come late game. Often times, the stasis from Zhonya's is enough time for cooldowns to reset by late game (e.g. Vlad).\r\n\r\nMy thought is that cooldowns should also be frozen when in stasis (would also need to apply to Bard's ult?). Thoughts?

I only used late game as an example because the cd on zhonya's late game is short enough in between team fights to potentially have a huge impact fight after fight. There's early-mid game, especially with stop watches, where games can outright snowball just because of a bad dive, good gank, etc. I'm not advocating to remove the item or take away its basic function of avoiding damage. I just think it's too favorable in covering up mistakes in this meta.\n\n\"league of stopwatches\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The thigh guy","date":"2019-10-02T21:51:35.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Issue being.

If they are fed, well your team maybe did something wrong, but to have 1 item straight up counter someone who likely outplayed others to get to that point, doesn't make much sense to me.
