If she is Q-ing then running back you are able to zone her. Her Q costs a lot of mana so she will run out of it and eventually have 0 Kill pressure. Try and keep her below 40% mana, I believe that this is the minimum amount required for a full combo. The reason Leblanc and Talon have favorable matchups in those lanes is because they have minimal skillshots and are mostly targeted abilities with a lot of burst damage and mobility. Ultimately targeted abilities counter Ahri at all stages of the game because of how squishy she is. \n\nAhri is completely skillshots while talon and leblanc are all targeted. The way to win lane is just to zone her and not make mistakes, such as being ganked because you are over extended or not standing behind minions. Sure an Ahri who plays correctly and wards their lane can never be ganked, but that goes for literally every single other champion in the game.\n\nAn Ahri match up is completely skill based, which means the more skilled player will always come out ahead. Need I mention how easy it is to zone her? I can go into a game as a 3rd time swain against an Ahri main and come out of the laning phase with 7 kills and 0 deaths by simply dodging her skillshots. If you are hit by a skillshot in lane it is completely your fault and not the champion being \"OP.\" Her charm is telegraphed and has such a small hit box to the point where even if you are late on the reaction you should still be able to dodge it. Her Q is an easy side step, and even if you are hit by one proc you can easily dodge the return.\n\nIf the Ahri is running up, throwing Q-s and running away she isn't winning lane. Unless you suck at farming, you will come out of that lane ahead. If she makes a mistake like staying near the wave or missing her charm, you jump on her regardless, targeted abilities don't miss. Also calling mia is an important way to win lane, Ahri generally has a hard time winning lane and tends to roam to compensate for it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2015-08-31T02:17:26.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ReshiKillim,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PdkK8plv,comment-id=000a00010000,timestamp=2015-08-30T22:34:17.535+0000)\n>\n> Not an Ahri main, just someone who's played her since her release x3 (I'm actually a Shaco main)\n> \n> I just wanted to clear up the clarity issues people who haven't been familiar with her in the long run have, as Riot isn't sure what they're doing with her kit.\n> \n> Back during DFG times and Assassin meta, Ahri players did tons of damage more but were always worried that the enemies might pick Talon.\n> \n> By the way, Talon is still an Ahri hard counter.

Ahri's charm and Q are not as dangerous for an experienced Talon as you may think, as they're both pretty easy to dodge if you're familiar with her ranges.\n\nIf he plays like someone who knows what they're doing, he can dodge poke and CS safely while punishing any attempts to dive him. (Not tower dive, just laning defensively for a little bit then she get's out scaled unless he does something stupid)\n\nMany Ahri players (Including me) often fall for the old Talon leap bait where he act's like he's going to leap to you, but doesn't immediately which wastes a combo on the air. It's also extremely easy to fall for it, which is a problem which even plagues Plat/Dia players.\n\nLeblanc has more mobility and her chains, which is an advantage that is underestimated. One single chain can force Ahri to either blow her ult/flash, or die. If Ahri doesn't get out of the chain tether range fast, that's often a death if it snares her.\n\nDo note that an Ahri main will always beat someone who's new to Talon, although he's a counter he's not a Rammus press W to counter ADC style counter.

Sure by all means Vayne is more than likely stronger than she should be, but what about all other ADCs?\n\nRight now most ADCs aren't that strong, not necessarily in comparison to each other but in comparison to other roles. They NEED their team by their side all game long regardless of how fed they are. If you don't position perfectly, know how to build perfectly, and have a really strong team behind you at all times including a really good Support, you're going to be so ineffective since nearly any Mid, Top, and now Jungler can instakill you with almost nothing you can do about it. There's no \"oops i messed up\" button like a lot of Mid or Top laners have. Mobility, CC, sustain, and the few ADCs that actually do have one of these components are the only ones ever played in the LCS. If you mess up, you die. Even then your self peel tools rarely guarantee your survival.\n\nI don't think just saying nerf Vayne and forget she ever was an extremely powerful pick is a good idea (not saying you said that either, but most people seemingly are) and instead using her to help look at the Marksmen role in general would be better.

Vayne is the exact opposite. She prefers to fight on her own and can protect herself, but lacks the wave, team fighting (her team fighting is actually pretty weak unless she's nearly full build or fed) and doesn't take towers very quickly. The weakpoint of many ADC's is the delay it takes to be relevant. The need the expensive, hard to build (fuck you bf sword), then the need attack speed, then they need armor pen, and now they can dish out damage before getting jumped on by everyone in the game. Vayne can just get bortk and be K, especially after the item got buffed (which is around the time all the Vayne hate starting rolling in). \n\nVayne has less hard counters since her hard counters aren't very meta anymore.

I agree with that, they could use some tweaking. But not the large-scale nerfs people have been asking for, not to mention she got a big impact on sustain due to this patch's nerf.\n\nThe reason why Ahri is too strong vs Non-counters, is because Riot won't make up their minds on how she is to be played. She was designed as a high mobility high damage caster assassin with some heals for utility, however Riot isn't emphasizing any one facet of her kit.\n\nIf they either went all the way with mobile assassin caster or sustained kite mage, she'd be very well balanced. But currently, Riot has her in a position where she has a bit of both which has made her strong against all non-counters.\n\nSo in recap: She's currently in a bit of a mess. When she's not against a counter, she's overall a very safe and good pick no matter the enemy team comp. But when countered, she's in a very dangerous place.\n\nWhat Ahri needs most is not a nerf, but balancing her kit towards either being a sustained kite mage by lowering ability costs and damage or  increasing damage and costs by making her the high mobility cast based assassin she was designed to be.\n\nIf her kit was refocused instead of nerfed, the majority of the complaints would be gone. She'd excel at one field, while being decent at the rest.

Not what a bunch of people who claim to know what they're talking about. \n\nHere's the raw facts.\n\nAhri's ratios fall well below most other assassin based AP champions.\n\nAhri's mobility and ability to stay safe are her strongest assets.\n\nComplaining that her crowd control has a low cooldown is idiotic. Her hit box on e was lowered, and damage lowered. If you can't get out of the way then learn to walk sideways. \n\nTaking away her cooldowns will destroy her ability to compete. Reduce her mobility and she'll hit low pick rate in an hour.\n\nJust deal with the fact that she is a champion who can destroy someone 1v1 who get's caught by her only sense of crowd control. And if you don't have the intelligence to either dodge it, stand behind a minion, stand behind your tank, or to build some magic resist so that her kit doesn't melt you, then I don't think that she's the problem. (And for those of you who are talking about, \"ERR, BUT SHE DOES TRUE DAMAGE YOU KNOB GOBBLER\" well, tough nuts. Yes, she does true damage. On a return of her skill shot. So yeah, moving to the side.\n\nIf she's too safe, well harsh. Learn to farm. You have an entire lane of minions to make sure she can't but poke with her q and maybe her w.  And if you are too afraid of her e, well.. guess what, there's a wonderful new lane called top lane. It sounds perfect for someone who does the following. A: Is a chicken to any type of cc. B: Hates when people escape under tower because you can't calculate your damage. And C: Won't get shutdown in the game because you're stupid. So yeah, grab garen, go top, take teleport, and do nothing the whole game. Let some mid laners who can counterplay counterplay, and let the Ahri's be ahri. If she's so powerful, play her. And if she can't be counterplayed, then congrats, you win. Bet it isn't even that easy.

For one, she doesn't have the true damage early game, her only reliability is her mobility and cc. Some decide to play her passively or aggressively.  There's no point to tune down her q when so many of her enemies can simply dodge her pokes. It's already a struggle to poke your enemy guessing which side they might take in order to q them UNLESS you fall into her charm but even so, taking away her cooldown? Her passive? What more can she do? Also, she isn't an easy mage to begin with, she does take skill. Yes, her q and e must land on the enemy cause if not all she's got is her ult to escape while her skills remain on cooldown and mana drains therefore you have an easy kill on her. Reminder, mid laners usually play ranged champs and if assasins, you've got a good chance to counter her.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kneel on Ice","date":"2015-08-31T01:51:23.346+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Even after nerf you keep hating on ahri , pff chill please","replies":[]},{"poster":"TyroneWatermelon","date":"2015-08-30T19:55:31.584+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"and riven","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baby Ghoul","date":"2015-08-30T21:41:25.467+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"All these toxic Ahri players saying Vayne and Riven need to be nerfed with the rest of us, but not realizing who would be next on the chopping block.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2015-08-31T02:38:58.358+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"? how are Ahri players being toxic?

Learn what hypocritical means.\n\nMost of it was in a joking manner, but Ahri mains were notorious around here for down voting anything that hinted at a slight nerf. That's why I'm glad people are starting to have a more honest conversation about her. Nobody is QQing about her, and trust me I wouldn't be trying to climb without learning about other champions. The fact of the matter is that Ahri has been at the top of the pack for so long now, and she could use some balancing because she is way too good right now. By toxic I meant that Ahri herself is toxic in her current state because of how reliable and safe she is when she's an assassin.\n\nNobody is saying gut her. However she's been a God tier pick for a lot longer than most champions, so you shouldn't be QQing that people are starting to ask for some changes concerning her. OP was talking about how she's not far behind Vayne in the win and pick rate, but we were never aloud to discuss that until very recently.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2015-08-31T03:27:08.553+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"No I'm not QQ-ing, I'm just slightly annoyed that people are asking to gut her.

The joke may have gone over my head in the post TBH, sry if anyone got the wrong impression. I think a good nerf for her is to lower her ult's damage by making it do less damage to the same target, like how her W works. In my opinion the Q ms is necessary because it compensates for the cast time so kiting is safer. It also helps her avoid bad trades because she can only trade with her Q (while most other midlaners trade with 2+ abilities) The reason she is so safe and reliable is because people never target her in teamfights, her range on Ult and W has been nerfed to the point of being targetable in a teamfight. Her Q ms could scale with ability level though, I wouldn't oppose an idea like that.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Budupops","date":"2015-08-30T19:51:51.444+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":7,"body":"its because of the toxic ahri players","replies":[{"poster":"MCBiggah99","date":"2015-08-30T19:53:26.575+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'm not sure whose fault it is, but I know that I dislike it.","replies":[{"poster":"Budupops","date":"2015-08-30T19:54:29.825+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"yep. same thing with jinx","replies":[{"poster":"MCBiggah99","date":"2015-08-30T21:27:52.313+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Dunno about Jinx, her ult and Q scalings got nerfed pretty harsly a while ago.","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2015-08-30T21:40:12.146+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh man the irony of this post lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hullabaloo907","date":"2015-08-30T20:26:24.128+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"I thought they just nerfed ahri","replies":[]},{"poster":"powerbats","date":"2015-08-31T03:45:26.706+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue isn't that's she's over powered like she was with DFG or Lb with it or any other mage assassin with it.

I am also not an ahri main but have enjoyed playing her often since lvl20 which was a long time ago\n\nSo, at the moment Ahri is indeed a very safe pick with decent damage numbers and good kiting ability. However I'd be very hesitant to make an serious changes to her as a champ because her playstyle isn't toxic. With all her skillshots counterplay can oftentimes be as simple as dodging well.\n- A simple example of this is Ahri vs. Leblanc (which is btw my favorite lane matchup of all time) where Leblanc's damage is way more consistent so it's all a mindgame of the Ahri player learning her opponent's patterns and predicting the dash forward with a charm. If Leblanc is good at dodging and being unpredictable Ahri loses. Now it won't always be that cut and dry but the same principle applies to any Ahri lane. It's a complicated mind game which I feel makes the game more fun for either side\n\nSo Ahri is a bit strong in this meta, it's interesting because with very few to no changes to her over time Ahri's viability has always fluctuated on the edge up and down. Which in my opinion is the mark of a well made champion because it's pretty low maintenance. It's also kind of a delicate balance, do too much and Ahri might just end up broken.\n\nTLDR: Ahri is currently on the strong side of things but not so far out of line she needs to be beaten back, maybe neatly trimmed by a careful gardener","replies":[{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2015-09-02T04:07:10.931+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahri is on the strong side of things because tanks aren't there to eat her charms for their team.
