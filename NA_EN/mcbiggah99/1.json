Deal with it.\nIf you want actual in-game ideas and creative proposed changes instead of complaints and PJSalt, I have this thread for ya:\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/IHZiYyrM-some-ideas-on-how-to-fix-veig-morde-and-co\n\n- Revert every Veigar change and think this through more. You were supposed to give him a buff after he lost his DFG, not gut him more. Do you know the difference between changes and nerfs? Do you know the difference between buffs and nerfs? (Same reasoning as point 4, your contradicting behaviour is starting to make me feel betrayed. Promise me buffs, end up nerfing. Promise me Zed nerfs, then stay silent about him...)\n- Revert the Kassadin nerfs. I think this one's obvious, stop Olafing champions. No, the 15 mana reduction isn't shit compared to the 250 range nerf, even if it's exponential. That's just an attempt at convincing with pretty words. You've been getting good at that. (EDIT: I was really salty when writing this, but I just really love Kassadin. I've started maining him in preseason 5 with great success, I finally found a champion I could outperform just about everyone on. Then this happened and, well, you shattered it.)\n- When you give Azir buffs, make them matter. I can already imagine you guys giving him 5 more base damage on his Q and calling that a \"buff.\" If you're able to nerf hard, you should be able to buff hard too. I actually used to play Azir a bit, it's really sad to see this stunning pinnacle of innovative champion design go to waste under the mountain of nerfs he's receiving. I want to feel strong while playing Azir again, a champion that used to be one of my favourites.\n- I should've included this in the Veigar section. You were supposed to compensate the champions who got their DFG removed, not change them slightly or even nerf them. We're not blind, everybody can see that you nerfed them. Give them back what they lost in some way or another. Yes, all of them, not just Ahri who you made mother-of-all-that-is-holy-tier in a single patch, and is still god-tier after her nerf patch. I'm looking at you, my buddy Morde! The main reason I hold a grudge against you (whoever is in the balance team) for this is because I feel lied to and betrayed. If you promise me something and you end up doing the exact opposite, I'll be sad.\n- Listen to the community. This isn't 5.4-related but a lot of people hate the boards and want their GD back. You can't shove broccoli up the throat of a kid who doesn't like broccoli, you're supposed to find other ingredients or maybe a broccoli recipe that the kid likes so you can give him his veggies and he can enjoy his food ^^. We don't like these fuckin' veggies Rito. (You better upvote me for this retarded comparison). The reason I want GD back is because I miss all the trolling, having fun, just messing around. Everything's so serious and dark on here, I just dislike it...\n\nThat's it for now, I'll be back if I have anything else.\n\nEDIT:\nI got a new one!\n- Get your priorities straight. There are tons of champions who need attention (in a nerfing way) more than Kassadin. Think Nidalee, etc.\n\nEDIT 2:\nAdded reasoning for my points, you'll find em in between brackets in most cases.","replies":[{"poster":"Xelane","date":"2015-02-25T17:05:04.734+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm...I wasn't necessarily going to upvote you at first...but that comparison IS pretty retarded...so...upvoted.","replies":[{"poster":"MCBiggah99","date":"2015-02-25T17:07:52.043+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xelane,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=90tWsaJ3,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-25T17:05:04.734+0000)\n>\n> Hm...I wasn't necessarily going to upvote you at first...but that comparison IS pretty retarded...so...upvoted.\n\nThank you kind sir!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2015-02-25T19:12:12.937+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":6,"body":"Is this a wishlist thread?

I do like it in the case where she's far behind, she still has the true damage to fall back on while she builds herself back up, however, it's still true damage on a low CD.

One of my major criticisms of the new one wasn't just that assassin Ahri would die, it was that now she can just spam spells and run away before people can poke back, taking away the skill in playing her.\n\nI realize she wasn't necessarily a complicated champion, but the mindless spamming playstyle was something I was really against when I saw this is what was happening to her.","replies":[{"poster":"KomePrePongo","date":"2015-02-26T19:17:41.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More Ahri buffs?

Do you know the difference between buffs and nerfs?\n\nThis, very much so.\n\nHonestly, Riot overestimated how much \"extra\" AP the new Q gives Veigar. There is a **set** amount of minions that spawn in X minutes. Just because the Q is a double shot, it doesn't mean you get double times the AP. In some ways, your Q can be worse to building your AP. If there is an near-death caster minion in the back row, your Q can't hit them without exposing yourself (since it is a skillshot; not targeted). \n\nThe W/E are impossible to land. I was hoping that this revamp would fix how old Veigar was so dependent on his stun. Well, I got that wish in a perverted way.  The new Veigar is no longer dependent on his stun because the stun is worthless.\n\nThere can be reconciliation, however.

This leads me to think that the balance team isn't thinking their decisions through properly. They gave Zed a slight attack speed reduction and that's it, that might've slightly affected him and now they can think through what his next nerf will be. In Azir and Kassadin's case, however, they went really hard on the nerfs, too hard. No slight nerfs, mixing and matching, taking the time. Just gutting.","replies":[{"poster":"Mandang0","date":"2015-02-26T17:08:38.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't mind the slight nerfs if Riot's balance timetable wasn't already long as hell.  Kassadin's been a thorn in many players' sides for over a year now (as evidenced by his banrates in all regions over that long timespan), and we've had to sit and watch as Riot tries lovetap nerfs on Kass to no avail.  \n\nI understand that this change might be too strong and it might get this one champion's balance wrong, but what about the bigger picture?  When will I be able to play something mid that isn't extremely-mobile or extremely-ranged in mid?  Lovetapping Kassadin (and Zed and others) is getting the balance even worse IMO because it's indirectly screwing everyone that isn't currently in play.  So long as Riot kept beating around the assassin bush, we'd keep seeing assassins dominate.  Sure, maybe we'd see a *different* assassin rise to the top, but that's selling the game's diversity short.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MeesterMoo","date":"2015-02-25T22:25:43.240+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, and did you also know that 450 range is garbage to Kass players who know how short the length was already? Flash can be an extra escape for champs who don't have one. They basically turned his tp nuke into a tiny aoe hop that can barely go over the valley thing near mid and river. They could have reworked his Q instead of ruining his ultimate. The mana cost reduction is nothing. Every Kass has Mana by then. This is his ULT. It is his skill that he has to wait until 6 to get.

Those switches are what identify those champions, just like Kass's ult is what defines him.  Also his ult is similar in CD and cost to Kog's ult...should we reduce his range and put it on a 2 minute CD? \n\nAlso when Kass came out he wasn't the anti mage tank that he is now. Without his ult he not only didn't do much damage, but the only useful thing about his kit would of been his targeted silence (which is thankfully gone). The ult already goes up to retarded mana costs if you use it a few time. \n\nThe nerf  right now is unjustified, and perhaps would of been a good nerf back before they did a little rework on him...but right now he is only being played because people are running double AP comps.
