Can copy with 24 sec CD ulti. \n\nZed - 550 range, 14 sec CD, can dash to it.\n\nEzreal - 475 range, 11 sec CD, removes 1 sec for each Q he lands.\n\nRek'Sai - 250 range, 18 sec CD, has an internal CD of 12 sec per tunnel use on top of that. \n\nLee Sin - (Q) 1100 range, 7 sec CD, skillshot, after that hits he can jump with 1300 range. (W) 700 range, 14 sec CD, can only be used on allied ward, minion or champion. \n\nYasuo - 475 range (completes the 475 range dash even if enemy is 1 unit away) 0.1 sec CD, but can't be cast twice on an enemy for 6 seconds. Can only be used on enemy champs/minions.\n\nKalista - Dash pretty similar to Grave's Quickdraw, so around 400 range. Once every auto. Extra range while used backwars. Gets lower with AS debuffs (FH, Randuins)\n\nLissandra - 1050 range, 11 sec CD, if CC'd she can't teleport. \n\nNow how is Kassadin compared to these? \n\nK vs. LB - He dashes 5 times.\n\nK vs. Zed - He dashes 7 times.\n\nK vs. Ezreal - He dashes 5 times.\n\nK vs. Rek'Sai - He dashes 9 times.\n\nK vs. Lee Sin - He dashes 3 times (Q) and 7 times (W)\n\nK vs. Yasuo - Completely situational.\n\nK vs. Kalista - 1v1 dies most likely because no hard CC (learn that champs without hard CC SHOULD NOT be able to 1v1 Kalista) \n\nK vs. Lissandra - He dashes 5 times.\n\nIn most cases, he outranges the opponent by FAR. The only two who are a bit weird to analyze are Kassadin vs. Yas/Kalista since their mobility needs more than just point and click into the air.\n\nSo even if Kassadin got \"gutted\", he is still able to outblink the mobility creep champions. There is no counter-argument to these facts, honestly.\n\nAnd don't compare Vi ulti and Kassadin ulti, it's like comparing Lee Sin's ulti with Singed's ulti, or something completely un-related.","replies":[{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2015-02-28T16:05:59.860+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> So that Kassadin WILL get close to 3k mana, use it as damage on his ulti wich is on a 2 sec CD\n\nYeah, you accidentally forget to mention that he scales off 2% maximum mana (or 6% if he's expending 960 for a blink), so 3k mana = 60 damage (or 180 at a cost of 960 mana). WOW SUCH DAMAGE KASSA DESTROYED ME WITH 60 DAMAGE HE INSTA-BURSTED SION.\nYou also forget than some Kassadin's don't buy Archangel (I usually see just RoA at LCS, so he get's ~1.8k mana late game which means 36 damage, but still).\n\n> Let's compare Kassadin to some mobile champs' mobility abilities!\n\nAgain, you \"accidentally\" forget to mention Nidalee. btw you call \"dash\" to Kassadin's R when it's a \"blink\".\n\n* Also, you forgot to mention that LeBlanc, for example, has three times the damage that Kassadin has (Kassa has ~500 +2 AP while LeBlanc has ~1,500 +3 AP).\n* Against Zed you forgot that Zed's shadows represent a huge danger for 5 seconds and are a powerful zoning tool, also forgetting he can gap-close with his R and then teleport back with global range.\n* Ezreal is an ADC and thus he deals far more damage and has far more range.\n* Lee Sin doesn't even use mana ffs. He brings ton of CC, a higher burst than Kassa early game... either way, you can't compare them, they have completely different purposes.\n* Yasuo I agree it's situational, but again, you can't compare them.\n* Kalista can outran Udyr (who has hard CC) and once she gets slightly ahead, she becomes unkillable for every melee in the game.\n* Lissandra is a short-range mage with good CC and sustained damage.\n\n> In most cases, he outranges the opponent by FAR.\n\nYou \"accidentally\" (three times in a row, wow) forgot, AGAIN, Kassadin's mana costs. I will literally copy your ridiculous comparisons but add some mana costs:\n\n* K vs. LB - He dashes 5 times. [LeBlanc can, in fact, dash 4 times within a single Kassa's dash, but you \"accidentally\" forgot to mention that] (At a cost of 1,860 mana)\n* K vs. Zed - He dashes 7 times. (At a cost of 3,820 mana)\n* K vs. Ezreal - He dashes 5 times. (At a cost of 1,820 mana)\n* K vs. Rek'Sai - He dashes 9 times. [Rek'Sai leaves tunnels, she can theoretically dash 10 times in a row just from tunnels] (At a cost of 5,870 mana)\n* K vs. Lee Sin - He dashes 3 times (Q, at a cost of 420 mana) and 7 times (W, At a cost of 3,820 mana) [Lee Sin can combine Q and W for a maximum of 2,000 range dash at a 14 (or 7 if he used W on a champion) second cooldown]\n* K vs. Yasuo - Completely situational (At a cost of situational mana I guess)\n* K vs. Kalista - 1v1 dies most likely because no hard CC [Kalista can reach 2.5 dashes per second (or ~5 within a single Kassa's Riftlimp), she won't build 2.5 speed, but at 2 speed she would dash 4 times for every Kassa's Riftlimp] (learn that champs without hard CC SHOULD NOT be able to 1v1 Kalista -> Ignoring the fact that Kassadin should be able to insta-burst Kalista.)\n* K vs. Lissandra - He dashes 5 times.

You are highly biased against Kassadin and you \"accidentally\" forgot to mention a lot of facts that give some context to Kassa's Riftlimp. Like the fact that he has a weaker burst than Nami (literally speaking, the only reason he out-burst Nami late game is because he has damage items while Nami has not, but a Nami with exactly the same build than Kassa would out-burst him).\n\n> K vs. Rek'Sai - He dashes 9 times.\nSHE*\n\ntl;dr: another \"KASSA FREE FLASH GG OP NOOBCHAMP\" qq post.

If they balance Kassadin for the LCS, he gets destroyed. (like they just did) If they balance him for silver or gold players on up, he's unstoppable in the hands of the LCS players and his ban rate is 80%+ and his win rate is ridiculous.\n\nThere are probably better ways to fix it. But, that's not my job.","replies":[{"poster":"BetaDude40","date":"2015-03-01T04:01:45.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kinda think that if they really wanted to hit Kassadin's ult, they should have hit the cooldown time, not the range. Maybe make it upwards of 12 - 20 seconds (estimate, probably more or less) at all ranks. Hell, anything is better than the range nerf they gave him.\n\nOf course, fixing him isn't my job either. I really hope Riot makes an AMA after every patch, because the community just has too many questions about this issue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZGM Dazzling","date":"2015-03-01T01:28:43.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You nerf a champion like Kassadin, who is barely played in solo queue \n\nlol.............................\nSorry buddy but i ignored everything you said after that statement.","replies":[{"poster":"BetaDude40","date":"2015-03-01T03:57:05.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[http://www.lolking.net/champions/](http://www.lolking.net/champions/)\n\nKassadin had a play rate of about 8% (which has dropped to 6% since the nerfs).
