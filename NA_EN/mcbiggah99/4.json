It had been just more of the old CLG.EU playstyle...win lategame. Same for Elements right now.

Much of that certainly is on Sven playing really well with a lead (though well playing, but toxic seemed to be SKs theme that season)...i don´t really think it´s worth copying.\nH2K is better off copying SKT right now, if they can mix that up with more creative drafts (prollys main strength as a player) to add some unpredictability they will grow into a very strong team.
