It is better to just give the drake up and get another objective instead of wandering around the dragon pit aimlessly or feeding them kills on top of the drake they just got. So stop QQing when &#039;omg team not here for drake fking noob&#039; and then going in 1v5 because &#039;omg we need dis drake to win&#039;. No you don&#039;t, just give them the damn drake and move on. When your team&#039;s down on men, don&#039;t go in. When your team&#039;s not close to the drake, don&#039;t go in.\r\nTY","replies":[]}
