With that kind of loss, you'd probably notice some slight issues with stream videos or other online games as well. \n\nI know it's not the best answer, but have you attempted contacting your ISP at all yet? All of those \"Request time out\" lines mean that something just isn't responding the way it's meant to. Take this traceroute to show your ISP, and let me know what they say!","replies":[{"poster":"Bryanx","date":"2017-10-05T01:54:29.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have not contacted my ISP yet but am planning on once i figure out the acc info on their website, i will get back to you when i get more information, thanks.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KaotikOnslaught","date":"2017-10-04T09:33:07.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing just started happening to me to yesterday last night.
