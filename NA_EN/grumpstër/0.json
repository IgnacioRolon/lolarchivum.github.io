Usually it's something anti-gay, or racist. Or telling someone to kill themselves will do it. That, or you've been getting reported frequently for frequent toxicity, and they finally reviewed them and decided there was enough games to warrant a 14 day ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-07-26T07:52:04.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The punishment system works in a 4 tier system. It goes:\n10 game chat restriction\n25 game chat restriction\n14 day suspension\nPermanent suspension.\n\nYou can skip tiers in cases that involve gameplay related toxicity, racism, hate speech, telling people to harm themselves, or other zero tolerance behaviors. Typically these put you automatically on 14 day suspension, but they can escalate you strait to permanent suspension.\n\nIf you would like me or someone else to review your logs to show you what caused your punishment, you can post your logs here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TiltoverEnforcer","date":"2017-07-26T07:38:59.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe next time you'll think twice before flaming.
