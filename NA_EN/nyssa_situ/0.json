If you are still experiencing issues, it's likely that your network is having trouble staying connected so it can't communicate what's going on between you and others during the match.  I suggest going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help get that fixed up.

The enemy team was perfectly fine. \n2) We did all reconnected right after we were disconnect, only to find out that we all died.\n3) Also yes, there was one point where there was indeed a remake. That was me, everyone was 100% on my loading screen, but the game didn't start.","replies":[]}]}]}
