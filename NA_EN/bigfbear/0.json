This will also be a little bit on the lower end of priority things. \nIt's not always a time issue, more of a cost of resources or who can actually fix it. This is an\nengineer fix and will take a bit of time before they can look at it.

We do want to fix\nevery issue that pains our players, like this shaco clone bug.\n\nI know this probably wasn't the response you wanted and I wish every post I made was,\nIt's fixed, looking clean!

Do you have some, or is she placed along with Mordekaiser? I don't think her bugs are so hard to fix like the others (other than her E ones). For example there is the one that blocks the tentacle from attacking for 1 seconds if Illaoi W-s while the tentacle is spawning. This shouldn't be a hard fix right?
