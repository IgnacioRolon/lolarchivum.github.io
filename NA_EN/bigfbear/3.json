My winrate actually INCREASED after i hit Dia from 48% to 52% (its changes very slow because i needed a LOT of games to get there).\nAnd that is the point. If you dont play a meta hyper carry but maybe an off-meta brusier or tank. You need A LOOOOT of games to hit higher elos because you are related to your team and the teams are uneven.\nIn Dia+ its actually possible to carry with tanks as you can see, because people know how to assist you in junge/at scuttle and they follow if you engage and because teams are even.\n\nBut to get there... pure agony!!","replies":[{"poster":"ChrisBrownze","date":"2019-04-08T06:00:34.395+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":52,"body":"Youre literally the problem.

Volibear is not a good champion to take towers and push waves so it's hard for him alone to close games. Also games lasts longer in lower elo\n- He is used to play with teammates with a decent skill and mecanics and he expects his gold partners to do the same (following well on ganks and dives) unfortunately it doesnt work.\n- He was lucky recently (After all he played 352 games with volibear this season and got 52% winrate, so his last winstreak is just \"something that has reasonable chances to happen over a large number of games\".)\n- Volibear is not a good champion to hard carry and 1v5, so when he plays against another smurf who took a hard carring champion, this other smurf can just roll over a lane, gets extremely fed and crush the game, while volibear is powerless.

If you are not feeding and getting good player dmg, you know the same stats to get S's for champs, and are continually doing that even when losing you should not lose as many points because you are not the problem. It would have to be based on all stats since people could just turtle all the time and not help team out to not die. You would need to take in dmg to players, minions killed, gold, as well as positive kda or at least a decent one. Those people should continue to move forward or not get stuck until they start to feed and not get gold or those other things. Once you are doing bad all around constantly you are out of your league. Basically a buff to how many points you can gain all around so that 1 rank (silver 4 to silver 3) doesn't sound like such a grind when your playing with a bunch of crazy kids who don't care to improve because they think they are already done learning or brand new players.

I see my ADC pick Ezreal while the enemy goes Twitch, the game is already hard as hell. He can be really good on Ezreal and is still useless by comparison in teamfights. They generally don't do much in lane either. The better the ELO, the less you need to be raw DPS but it's very frustrating atm on a smurf. Without a 1v9 champion skill doesn't seem to matter much and I can't outcarry the coinflip even when I'm doing great individually.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-04-08T17:10:52.824+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it took some time but I eventually learned that the only way I could carry low ELO is with hyper carries \n\nhttps://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/3016113992/242976320?tab=overview","replies":[]},{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2019-04-08T14:18:31.169+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are good but not great, Low elo is far harder bc it isn't hard it's impossible.  While intuitively being good should make lower elos quite easy.  The rank system is counter-intuitive, which is bad, so adjustments should be looked to be made.  Maybe too much is done to protect bad players?  Whatever the case, things would be better if good did not play with bad.  The first step at becoming good is being effective without feeding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-04-09T22:45:06.778+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep the system FORCES you to lose at lower Elos.  Especially if you have a old account.  Riot does not let your Improve over time.   It says nope you are trash and we will make you lose by putting trash on your team.\n\nI have two accounts, This one is suck in Bronze and can not climb because I get 2/15 players in almost every match.  My other account just got out of Bronze and is climbing because I actually get team mates that have brains most of the time.  The matches are even(ish).\n\nI play the same champions in the same roles the same way. \n\nSo the only factor is that Riot is MAKING my teams such trash you cant carry if you are close to that rank.","replies":[{"poster":"BigFBear","date":"2019-04-10T02:37:21.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wouldn't say it forces you to lose.\nIt's just uneven games.\nI mean I had also games where I was in the stomping team. In the end it was pretty 50/50 i guess. Stomp or get stomped.\n\nIt's just that you can't really influence it.\nYou can play shit and win when you in the stomp team. Yo can play like a god and lose when you are in the shit team.\nMaybe you can influence every 10tht game or so with a non carry champ.\nThat means you climb very slowly with a winrate of 50,5 or so.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MichaeliabDtAy","date":"2019-04-08T19:41:30.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Matchmaking is a curse, it's literally trashing the game.
