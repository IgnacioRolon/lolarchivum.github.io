This is a simple concept that even an auto-filled player should know. They then might be put against someone like a Fiora or Tryndamere and think that they have excellent late game and so they need to fight them early to prevent them from becoming such monsters, only for them to learn the hard way that they are very capable of fighting and winning early game under certain stipulations. \n\nThe reverse is also true.

And tell you.\nYou ask a top laner about wave control on mid lane, and they might now.\n\nYou ask a top laner to play support, you're fucked. Likewise for support to top. Or worse, jungle.\nHowever, just because you ask a doctor what an ekg means, doesn't mean you should expect an actual answer.\n\nLike, I'm a software developer, but i don't know the definitions to most things, so if I'm asked about \"gimme the definition of static\", \"tell me the characteristics of classes\", \"what does encapsulation mean\", I got no flipping clue.\nBut when something has to be done, and i understand what has to be done. I can implement it and make it happen in a pretty efficient manner.\n\nThat's the thing about specialization.\nAnd this is what happens in Lol. To a large degree with roles and to a pretty high degrees with champions.\n\nThat's why there are so many \"one tricks\" (or people that play 3 or less champions) at higher elos (above gold).\nBecause they specialized into learning a role, learning how it works, and how to play their champion in that role. How to trade, when to roam, when to gank, when to engage, when to disengage, etc. \nAnd most of that is learned subconsciously, as most of us don't make it an active part of their day to get better at this game.\n\nAnd that's why, back to the initial point. Someone that might be diamond or challanger in mid lane. Is most likely to suck as support.\nEven if they are amazing on lets say Yasuo or Zed mid. They will most likely be much weaker on Annie for example.\nWhile my peak was only plat, I was able to play stuff like pre rework malzahar, diana and pre rework akali on mid at a pretty high level.\nBut if I were put to play lets say Zed, Yasuo, Talon, Fizz, Annie, Vel'Coz, reworked Malzahar, etc. My skill level would drop to gold tier to low gold tier. And I wouldn't be able to win lane or carry games.\n\nBecause specialization is a thing.\nYou know how to play against X doesn't matter THAT much. Like lets say:\nYou play top and you are mid or support or adc main, you know darius has a grab, a slow, a heal and an armor shread. And if he attacks you to much, you will blead and his ult will do true dmg. \nWhat you do NOT know:\nwhen can you trade with darius?\nhow many auto attacks from him can you eat before you HAVE to back out?\nif he does grab you, do you flash right away, or you trade with him?\nwhat do you build as first item, should you go defensive or offensive?\ndo you take tp or ignite?\ncan darius tower dive you?\ncan he freeze the wave?\nwhat the fuck do you do when the wave is frozen?\nand more.\n\njust because \"oh wow, i know how the enemy champion plays\" isn't enough.\nAnd the discrepancy of someone that knows all the little details is muuuuuuuuuuch higher and punishing at higher elos (high dia+). Because those small details make the difference between who is dying and who is surviving.\nIts a game of who makes the least amount of mistakes wins.\nIn bronze, silver and gold people make mistakes all the time. Even in plat and dia mistakes happen at like at least several times per game. I don't know if i ever had a game where I could say \"i played this perfectly, there was nothing i could've done better\".\nSo ofc, when both of you make mistakes, then, the \"gap\" doesn't matter as much, as when a mistake is large enough, you can turn the tide. But the higher elo you go, the less mistakes are being done.

Or worse, jungle.\n> However, just because you ask a doctor what an ekg means, doesn&#x27;t mean you should expect an actual answer.\n> \n> Like, I&#x27;m a software developer, but i don&#x27;t know the definitions to most things, so if I&#x27;m asked about &quot;gimme the definition of static&quot;, &quot;tell me the characteristics of classes&quot;, &quot;what does encapsulation mean&quot;, I got no flipping clue.\n> But when something has to be done, and i understand what has to be done. I can implement it and make it happen in a pretty efficient manner.\n> \n> That&#x27;s the thing about specialization.\n> And this is what happens in Lol. To a large degree with roles and to a pretty high degrees with champions.\n> \n> That&#x27;s why there are so many &quot;one tricks&quot; (or people that play 3 or less champions) at higher elos (above gold).\n> Because they specialized into learning a role, learning how it works, and how to play their champion in that role. How to trade, when to roam, when to gank, when to engage, when to disengage, etc. \n> And most of that is learned subconsciously, as most of us don&#x27;t make it an active part of their day to get better at this game.\n> \n> And that&#x27;s why, back to the initial point. Someone that might be diamond or challanger in mid lane. Is most likely to suck as support.\n> Even if they are amazing on lets say Yasuo or Zed mid. They will most likely be much weaker on Annie for example.\n> While my peak was only plat, I was able to play stuff like pre rework malzahar, diana and pre rework akali on mid at a pretty high level.\n> But if I were put to play lets say Zed, Yasuo, Talon, Fizz, Annie, Vel&#x27;Coz, reworked Malzahar, etc. My skill level would drop to gold tier to low gold tier. And I wouldn&#x27;t be able to win lane or carry games.\n> \n> Because specialization is a thing.\n> You know how to play against X doesn&#x27;t matter THAT much. Like lets say:\n> You play top and you are mid or support or adc main, you know darius has a grab, a slow, a heal and an armor shread. And if he attacks you to much, you will blead and his ult will do true dmg. \n> What you do NOT know:\n> when can you trade with darius?\n> how many auto attacks from him can you eat before you HAVE to back out?\n> if he does grab you, do you flash right away, or you trade with him?\n> what do you build as first item, should you go defensive or offensive?\n> do you take tp or ignite?\n> can darius tower dive you?\n> can he freeze the wave?\n> what the fuck do you do when the wave is frozen?\n> and more.\n> \n> just because &quot;oh wow, i know how the enemy champion plays&quot; isn&#x27;t enough.\n> And the discrepancy of someone that knows all the little details is muuuuuuuuuuch higher and punishing at higher elos (high dia+). Because those small details make the difference between who is dying and who is surviving.\n> Its a game of who makes the least amount of mistakes wins.\n> In bronze, silver and gold people make mistakes all the time. Even in plat and dia mistakes happen at like at least several times per game. I don&#x27;t know if i ever had a game where I could say &quot;i played this perfectly, there was nothing i could&#x27;ve done better&quot;.\n> So ofc, when both of you make mistakes, then, the &quot;gap&quot; doesn&#x27;t matter as much, as when a mistake is large enough, you can turn the tide. But the higher elo you go, the less mistakes are being done. And the harder it is to turn the tide.\n> And that&#x27;s why, specialization pays off so hard.\n> \n> Again, you don&#x27;t go to ask a doctor (ie: a top laner) how to do your legal strategy in a case of money laundering and tax evasions (support).\n> You don&#x27;t ask the ship captain (adc) how long will the surgery take and what are the odds you will survive\n> And you won&#x27;t ask your lawyer (support) how long till you reach the land as you&#x27;ve been on the see for 3 days now.\n\n If your doctor does not know what ekg stands for, get a new doctor.  That is what I am saying.  This is not a mm issue,but a player base issue.

It's a human issue.\nThat's how we, humans, were able to get where we are.\nSo, you either go with the scientific route, and this behavior of specialization is ingrained in your genes, as that's how everyone before you did anything successful.\n\nir you go to religious route, and specialization is how God or the universe or whatever have humans categorized as.\nRegardless, focusing on just one are is what we are as a race, and it's rewarding. \nThat's like saying omg, logic is so bad in math, that's why math sucks, because logic. \nSpecialization is that basic of a thing I'm still shocked how many of you don't get it","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Elohaven","date":"2019-01-29T16:14:39.246+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"That's you.
