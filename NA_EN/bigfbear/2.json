And when you in the middle of a teamfight you don't have the time to look closely. You have to react immediately. Even 0,3 seconds can make the difference.","replies":[{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2018-12-20T00:48:28.894+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"While experience and research helps.
