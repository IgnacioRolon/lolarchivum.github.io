Everything was normal but the shop was a little... odd. \nFirst of all, the items were not for the character that I was playing, and secondly, the fourth line of text doesn&#039;t even make sense. \nIt says - &quot;IF THE oTHER TEAM IS WINNING BADDLY AND U CANT WIN&quot; \nI&#039;m 101% sure that Riot doesn&#039;t write like that. Looks like a 10 year old wrote that!\n\nSo what do you guys think? Is this because a fault in the system or is this a hacker? \nThis wasn&#039;t game changing or anything like that, but I really want to know what this is. ( It&#039;s kinda funny too )\nSo is there anything you guys know? Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-09-13T17:23:49.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi! \n\nAs S2K Delirious had stated, this is a custom item set, and not something that's broken in terms of the game itself. \n\nYou can find your custom item sets by going to your profile, and clicking on Item Sets at the top. You should be able to find what you're seeing there. :) If you didn't set it yourself, and think someone else may have access to your account, please change your password immediately.","replies":[{"poster":"KurmarndaDee","date":"2016-09-16T08:00:05.488+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't remember adding anything so someone might have access to my account.
