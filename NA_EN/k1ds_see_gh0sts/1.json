Sometimes it works fine but sometimes it doesn't and it is pissing me off. I get 60 frames in each game and a bit of lag sometimes, I know my computer can handle it but I don't know why it happens. Any help can be appreciated. I have spent way too much money to stop playing the game and would like help to fix it.\r\n\r\n~Krimsonic","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-17T23:31:54.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're on Windows 10, this is likely caused by the Windows Game Bar and its *Game DVR* feature.
