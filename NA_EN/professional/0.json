I included a link from Reddit from people having a similar issue to mine. This is basically a known issue at this point, but anyone playing under the Bright House, and possibly Time Warner Cable ISP are having packet loss only on League and no where else. I can play any other games online just fine. Basically my ping is up about 20, and it doesn't move. However it feels like I'm playing with anywhere between 200-500 ping and it clearly fluctuates. Not sure what other info you'd might need. Hope it's resolved soon, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Pornstar Elise","date":"2016-05-09T21:45:10.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same issue. This is way too impossible to play with. I have bright house and i'm sitting at 82 ping (I live in Florida and usually play on 66 ping) but the actual game feels like 300 ping, at certain moments my character just refuses to use abilities for about 7 + seconds. I cant play league like this.","replies":[{"poster":"AC Aviator","date":"2016-05-09T22:28:55.135+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exact same thing.
