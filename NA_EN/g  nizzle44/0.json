The problem is, when on my laptop a lot of things in the game look smaller and it is hard to play. I know I can up scale the interface, but I am worried that it will sync the settings from my laptop to my desktop since I know all of the profiles are saved and synced. Will that be a problem, or is there any way to turn that off so I can have two separate setting profiles for two separate computers? Also quick question, is there any way to zoom in without the mouse wheel? I disabled that a while back but it seems it might help on my laptop.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-02T21:30:33.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since settings are saved server side, it will transfer between pc to pc.
