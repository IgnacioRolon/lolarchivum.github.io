(again i haven't tried these myself but i do know his kit and he really wants mana and early ap. {{item:3907}}  is also good to use as you can press it mid air right to boost damage once you know the enemies are going to get hit by it... or save it is you know you missed your ulti or the damage wouldn't kill them.\n\nalso... those buffs are absolutely INSANE, and would totally break him. if i were to buff him (which i don't think he needs at the moment, but when he _does_ need buff i would _love_ for this to go through) but would i WOULD do would be do a 50% cooldown refund if satchel charge hits an enemy, as that way you can at least use it offensively as interrupt cc without completely fucking up any escape your might need to have for the next 20 seconds. i woudl also allow him to DETONATE it while  hard CCed, to still use the movement ability. idk if my ping or my reaction time but i always have time to throw it out before the cc hits but never enough time to actaully detnoate it before the cc stops from from detonating it. also it annyes me that if i am rooted it wont move me.. it should work similar to {{champion:59}}  flag and drag that can can still use it while rooted.
