The same champs that dominate ARAM dominate there as well, but unlike ARAM you get to play a lopsided matchup twice. \n\nAscension games are fast and you can pick pretty much anyone you want and have a good chance at winning. Shaco and Teemo are the only real problem champs there and even they can be dealt with.\n\nI can't speak on URF since I've never been interested in it, but I see it gets a lot of complaints even when it is available. \n","replies":[]},{"poster":"OurLestrade","date":"2017-07-28T20:24:55.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ascension's my second favourite, after Dominion.
