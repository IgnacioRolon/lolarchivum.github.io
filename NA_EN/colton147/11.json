I thought the point was to murder the other team, screw spirits. The most anti-fun team I played against had an Ahri, Zed and Shaco who refused to fight anyone all game, just killed spirits. If you got anywhere near them they just dashed over a wall and ran away.\n\nBest games are where everyone congregates around Rift Heralds and just goes at it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2017-08-27T00:21:12.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How are you losing to that tactic?

After they have enough points, it is too late to catch up and nearly impossible to even win the game from them.\n\nIt is basically a one-sided strategy that needs to be addressed ASAP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Edge of Daybreak","date":"2017-08-26T02:18:37.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah the difference is that game is going to end at some point. also lol you guys really couldnt kill them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-08-26T01:11:23.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"?

I don't want a random game mode that is all we do - die and die repeatedly without any sort of counter.\n\nWe were lucky to even get a herald and some kills.","replies":[]}]}
