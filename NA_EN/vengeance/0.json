In game, I play on medium settings and get ~30 fps. However, with the old client I never had issues with lag. Ever.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the client lags like crazy. It lags when the Accept/Decline match buttons come up (sometimes, it lags for so long that I actually miss the queue and have to re-queue); it lags during Declare/Pick/Ban phase (to the point of by the time I can actually ban a champ there is only 10 seconds left); it lags when transitioning from Pick/Ban to in-game loading screen.\r\n\r\nOnce I&#039;m in game, the lag stops. No worries there at all - back to 30 fps. The problem is that I have missed queues so many times that it&#039;s getting out of control. Any suggestions? Is there a way to change the settings of the client?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Codebear","date":"2016-11-04T21:36:22.970+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Vengeance,\n\nThis is a great point to pick up and has been a focus for our team for quite a while now.  For the next patch going out we've made a fair amount of updates to the client to allow it to run smoother for everyone.  Hopefully the changes that come with 6.22 will make the experience better for you as well. {{summoner:4}} \n\nAs we're constantly trying to improve performance day to day, it's great to have players like yourself post here on the boards and submit feedback whenever you feel something is going wrong.\n\nJust for clarity, could you PM me your computer specs so I can follow up with some of the engineers on my team?\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"CoolDaemonX","date":"2016-11-21T02:18:20.548+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm on 6.22 and normally run around 130 fps... 100 min. Since the update I get games at 30fps quit frequently\n\nI have a feeling that the new client is burning ram and cpu power in the background even though it is just sitting there idle. Perhaps can work on some garbage collection and throwing the client into a more efficient stand by mode","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2016-12-14T22:31:06.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This client is so unbelievably laggy. It runs somewhat fine on my i7 build, but on my other computers it runs like garbage. Something's wrong if you need an i7 to run a freaking Client decently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"buppy pepega","date":"2016-11-23T03:50:51.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea the New client honestly looks amazing and i dont have much of a problem when just going around home and checking my profile and stuff but when i get into the pick/ban phase everything just becomes extremely laggy. To the point where my audio starts to click and cut out champion quotes. its very slow during that time and very annoying. ive taken the wrong spells and masteries because it wouldnt load fast enough for me to change it. which extremely sucks. I dont know if i should just switch to the old client. i would love to know what i can do to improve the pick/ban phase FPS, audio, and just everything all together.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noble Actual097","date":"2016-11-17T04:36:34.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing. I tried to ban someone and it just wouldn't let me. I kept clicking and then had to wait 5 min to queue back again. Super laggy during champ select too. And the chat takes to long to respond. Its very aggravating.

The alpha by design was designed for higher end pc's to test and some lower end ones for quality testing and future reference, but never was it meant for regular users to use on a daily basis. It it not at all optimized. Open beta(which starts very soon) is when optimization for low end pcs will start. No worries eventually the client will run even better than the current one and even take less memory :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Loco Mot1ves","date":"2016-11-03T20:19:38.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've experienced lag in chat personally, but this may not be a problem on your end that you can fix yourself. I would almost think a lite version of the alpha client that might not be as flashy may be needed so that this lag issue disappears or just tone back a few things all together that's causing it. Orrrr.... it could just be a dedicated server for the alpha client to run on? I'm not sure... No idea.","replies":[]}]}
