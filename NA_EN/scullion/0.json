I recommend going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to get this fixed up for good.  A repair wouldn't necessary fix this since it's an issue with your connection and not game files.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
