You think that [THIS](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/AnZYUfQy-do-not-let-that-sona-nerf-through) is nothing more than a \"random complaint post?\"  Rito has blatantly left Sona in an unbalanceable state for over 3 years now, with patch 4.13 as the OBVIOUS culprit.  Players have been demanding a reasonable response to this for over 3 years now.  I'd hardly call this complaint \"random,\" if anything it's been a CONSISTENT complaint.\n\nThe only way you'd create an argument in that thread is if you yourself **intentionally **instigated the argument.  You could tell people,\"CertainlyT is aware of Sona's unplayability and planning an eventual rework that he will personally oversee.\" and players would be ecstatic to hear this.  You could say,\"Rito is contemplating a full revert back to her original pre-4.13 kit as a temporary fix until her 3rd inevitable rework.\" and the main inquiry would be,\"When can we look forward to the revert?\"  You could even just tell us that you're handing Fearless a pink slip and we would at least know Rito is finally listening.\n\nYou have responses you could make that won't result in an argument, but instead you're choosing to outright dismiss a complaint 3+ years running as nothing more than \"random?\"","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cactopus","date":"2017-11-30T16:22:56.246+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":2,"body":">You could even just tell us that you're handing Fearless a pink slip and we would at least know Rito is finally listening.\n\nYou’re actually asking for a coworker to be fired here.

It became nearly impossible for all, but less than a handful of champions to survive in the jungle.  It took half the season to fix the jungle.\n* Season 6 jungle rework?

Wizards of the Coast frequently fires entire teams of employees for far less than that.  I believe Blizzard does as well.

They're super important for improving your craft. We did weekly group critiques where 5-6 people would evaluate a drawing/painting/whatever (they made me take a lot of fine art stuff at the beginning lol) and talk about what you did well and what you could do better. Tbh it was often pretty brutal, but in a good way. \n\nThere were 2 rules that were strictly enforced for good critique sessions: \n\n1.) Those offering critiques never made personal comments (\"I've noticed you suck at perspective, Jackie\"), they only could only talk specifically about the work (\"The perspective looks a little off here where the horizon line meets the statue\").\n\n2.) Those receiving critique couldn't take comments on the work personally. You are not your work. You're not allowed to be butthurt when someone tells you honestly that they think the perspective is off in your painting. The fact that the perspective is off doesn't make you a bad person or a bad artist. Art's also fun because some things are wholly subjective (\"The flowing shapes in your composition feel melancholy to me\"), so you can also personally disagree with someone else's assessment. That was part of the agreement between critique-er and critique-ee. Critiquer will give feedback and opinion, critique-ee will actually listen and then decide if or what to do about it. \n\nSo to answer your question with that anecdote in mind, I think you can talk about the work and definitely the body of work  for sure (I don't feel like champion X has good counterplay because reason Y. Champion Z also has this problem for reason K). As soon as you're pointing the finger at a particular team or dev though, you're *making* it personal (add to that the fact that the person you're pointing at may actually not be the right one necessarily, cuz we all do a lot of work collaboratively). This means you're not following rule #1 any longer and the person receiving the critique can't reasonably be expected to do #2 (if you're pretty practiced with critiques you actually probably can, but not everyone is). \n\n**TL;DR** You can always critique the work and definitely the body of work. Themes you can see between champs or items etc. totally cool. Talking about a PERSON or PEOPLE is a different thing however, and moves away from the rules of reasonable critique IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-11-30T22:21:36.934+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"So we're allowed to say 'Yasuo is obnoxious to play against, as is Zoe, Thresh, etc.' but we're not allowed to say 'these champs are all designed by the same person, btw'?","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-11-30T22:30:44.123+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think at the very least saying that a person should be fired is a dick move.","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2017-12-01T02:09:55.797+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah that's really the difference, innit? \n\n \"Yasuo is obnoxious to play against, as is Zoe, Thresh, etc.\" is a perfectly valid  and respectful critique statement IMO (even better is \"I feel\" before that statement, making it clear that obnoxious to play against is *your* feeling specifically, which it is). \n\n\"Yasuo is obnoxious to play against, as is Zoe, Thresh, etc. fire CertainlyT\" OR \"Yasuo is obnoxious to play against, as is Zoe, Thresh, etc. CertainlyT is a complete idiot\" are not. \n\n(I actually think he's very smart, this is an example :D)\n\n**EDIT:** Folks if your question has a name in it for a person or team OR includes a possessive pronoun (his, hers, their) you're doing it wrong lol ","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-12-01T02:33:18.819+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"So how is 'Yasuo is obnoxious to play against, as is Zoe, Thresh, etc. I really don't want him to make any more champions.'?","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2017-12-01T03:17:29.975+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"That brings in the personal aspect again, albeit in a slightly nicer tone.

Riot can't answer every single board and if the OP is attacking riot why would they want to give that person fuel? People that hold riot responsible need to not attack them.

No they give us a free game to play and don't owe us that. Also, quite frankly I do see riot responding to customer complaints. As long as they aren't attacks on riot saying certain rioters should be fired, etc. I commend riot for responding to these boards. We take it for granted. Not every company does this customer interaction. It's not that riot ignores certain boards they read all of them. It's that they don't want to respond to the person essentially \"yelling\" at them because who would? Sure it would be nice of them to do it but odds are that person that is not ready to have a civil conversation over the boards obviously doesn't want to have a conversation but just wants to complain and yell at riot. Hence why they don't respond to them and I don't blame them. We as a community take so much for granted then are never satisfied with riot. Media is always so negative. Nobody ever talks about the good thing riot does and there are a lot of good things that they do. Why is that? Why is everyone so focused on the things that riot doesn't do correctly that we take away from the good things they do. It's just sad is all. Frustrates me that everyone only wants to target the negative. Riot has done a brilliant job with this game and no not everything is perfect but come on we need to stop targeting and attacking riot for the few things that they do wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2017-12-01T05:52:22.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"“Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning” - Bill Gates\n\nIt's the attacks and negative critique that are the most valuable for Rito to listen to.  By blatantly ignoring complaints and making the same mistakes repeatedly, Rito is only creating more unhappy customers and more complaints.\n\nIf Rito actually listened and acted on problems brought forth to them by customers, they would have fewer angry complaints in the future.  Their customers would be less likely to instantly jump to blame if they actually had positive interactions with Rito.

Each angry complaint that goes unanswered is lost revenue from nth customers and potential customers.  When those customers have negative interactions with Rito, that means nth more lost revenue once again.\n\nThis is ESPECIALLY **MORE **true because LoL is a free game.  Customers aren't paying a subscription to play, there are no \"real\" pay-2-win features for players to take advantage of.

Customers are allowed to hate Rito, hate League, inform their 10k Twitter followers of that hatred and still log on when their 4 buddies need a 5th.  There's no pressure to buy the game, like Overwatch.  No pressure to subscribe like WoW.  Just a game they're allowed to hate and publicly express their hatred for without in any way hindering friends' desire to play as a group.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Insp","date":"2017-12-01T11:48:33.024+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"You do realize that Riot  doesnt HAVE to do anything because you want it to?

Without customers, a business cannot exist.  Like you said, if I don't like what Rito is doing, I can leave.  So can literally their entire customer-base.  Each time Rito alienates a customer, that customer tells his friends and followers and Rito loses 6,000 customers.\n\nFurthermore, blatantly ignoring customer complaints and especially publicly announcing that you're blatantly ignoring complaints, the way Cactopus admitted to committing, directly violates the common sense of business ethics and customer service.  Choosing to ignore complaints just breeds more complaints.  Angering your customers just leads to strained customer relationship.\n\nhttp://winthecustomer.com/4-reasons-customer-always-right/","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Insp","date":"2017-12-01T12:38:01.215+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"See if you are quoting a guy from 1904, no matter how fancy it makes you sound, it doesnt mean the quote is still relevant nor that it ever even was. \n\n\n\nA few quick reasons why customer ISNT always right. \n\n1: It Makes Employees Unhappy\n\n2: It Gives Abrasive Customers an Unfair Advantage\n\n3: Some Customers Are Bad for Business\n\n4: It Results in Worse Customer Service\n\n5: Some Customers Are Just Plain Wrong\n\n\nEven just putting \"the customer is always right\" in google will mostly throw you results how the customer is NOT always right.\n\n\n//// EDIT\n\nAnd one more thing, companies decide what they deem is best for them, what kind of business and customers they want.  \n\nNo company can always satisfy ALL of their customers, and if some decision will mean they will lose some of the customers, that doesnt mean the decision was bad or that they didnt think this trough and knew some people will stop using their product because of it. \n\nAnd guess what, they are OK with that.
