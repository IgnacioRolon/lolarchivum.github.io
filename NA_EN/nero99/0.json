The problem is that i'm stuck, of course i feel that with my current skill level I'm right where i deserve to be. I'm not feeding but I'm not carrying either. I wanted to ask higher elo players, how did you improve your mechanics? I already try to ward as much i can, look on the mini map as much as i can etc. The problem is definitely in my mechanics, as I'm usually getting outplayed. This is even more apparent when I play 1v1 on customs vs plats, where I'm usually getting destroyed.\nI main supp btw","replies":[{"poster":"Ashe mage AD","date":"2019-11-30T19:46:44.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go make your own custom keys, the defaults are dog shit lol. Then it'll take you some time to re-learn playing with them but it'll be worth it.

Top and Mid are more or less freelo right now.  Pick a strong champ, farm till 11, roam and destroy ~~peasants~~ lower level enemies with rank 2 ultimate.\n\nYeah, better mechanics are never a bad thing, but I would say you can pretty much face-roll (in a solo lane) to about plat 3.","replies":[]}]}
