I've done EVERYTHING that was asked and havnt changed anything. I'm at my wit's end I just don't know what to do. Before anyone says anything about my vid card going bad or temps are to hot or I'm getting corrupt files, I can tell you none of these are the problems this whole system is bearally a year old and I only play 3 days a week the rest of the time my PC is off. So it doesn't get a butt load of usage time.\r\n\r\nSomeone after a game told me Riot had a write up on Reddit about it and after roughly 2 hours of looking I couldn't find it. So if anyone has a link to this write up please link it cause I just can't find it.\r\n\r\nThanks, Ozag.","replies":[{"poster":"Ozag the Mighty","date":"2016-08-21T15:22:30.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do I find that windows update ( not tech savvy I just play games) and I'm not using win 8 I'm using 7 ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-21T17:58:18.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As *Oloferno* mentioned, rolling back recent windows updates may be a good place to start.
