We won't be able to give you back that IP since the gift did go through. \n\nIf your friend meant to gift you Rakan instead of buying him for himself, he should be able to hit us up through a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we can help out as long as the champion hasn't been used yet.","replies":[{"poster":"minimo1000","date":"2017-04-22T02:30:34.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But my friend already had rakan,maybe it showed I only gave it to him and he didnt buy it because I gave he received it a couple of seconds after.
