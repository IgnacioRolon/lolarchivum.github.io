The game crashes at the loading screen or doesn't even load at all (black screen with a loading mouse icon) which made me lose a lot of games because my opponent gained 5 levels ahead of me or marking me as a leaver since I cannot reconnect in time. I have ran every test on my computer and still I'm the last one to connect to the game. Note that this not happen all the time, but when it does it's kinda unfair losing games like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-02T20:05:38.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is strange!  The issues you're reporting like the black screen suggests network problems, but the title of your post indicates a bugsplat as well.  If you are receiving a bugsplat error, then something could be failing to render your game properly.  You should run through each step of the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to fix that up and get back in game.  I suggest testing this in a custom game though to prevent any penalties!","replies":[]}]}
