LOL is a game where i come to cool off and have fun, i generally dont lose my calm, i am honored many a times and if not honored,  other people i am matchmade with love to play with me, even though i might not be a good player. \r\ni admit that i have been previously punished for  going afk, which was because my internet connection was not stable at that point of time. but i have got a new connection just because of this game, so that i can keep my record clean, yet i am banned for 14 days!\r\n\r\nif someone can, please help, and i know there is this policy that i am responsible for anything that happens on my account, but if i am banned the others who actually were the real deal, must be punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-24T20:10:53.058+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is of the opinion that certain words, such as the word you used (that begins with f), are **never** acceptable. This includes quoting them from other players in almost all cases. Hate speech such as that shouldn't be used in the first place, but if it's used, there's absolutely no reason for you to repeat it.\n\nFurther, later in the chat, you utilized that word to direct it at someone with no provocation.\n\nTake this as a stern warning that hate speech, telling someone to harm themselves/others, and other *extreme* toxicity is not tolerated in League. Keep in mind that since this was a validly placed suspension, you risk being permanently suspended at your next punishment *no matter the level* of the toxicity.\n\nIf you'd like more input, you may wish to head over to the [Player Behavior boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation) - you're more likely to get more input from players there than here.","replies":[{"poster":"NeoWolt","date":"2017-09-24T20:50:47.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"okay i understand, but i shud correct you one thing, there was heat on both ends. riot should understand that it is a game, and as soon as the pressure increases language like this, is bound to be used. riot shud deploy actual persons to see who the real problem was. \nif squeaky clean chat is something riot wants, riot should know what it wants is far fetched from reality. it might as well disable the chatting as a whole itself. \nANYONE WHO IS READING THIS MESSAGE, TELL RIOT WHAT IT WANTS CANNOT HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE. \n\nit has been like 2-3 years since i had started playing league, although i think i will stop playing it, due to this inadvertence.\nand i still believe the JUSTIFICATION riot gave is totally UNJUSTIFIABLE.\nif people want to stop seeing cuss words, go ahead and enable the language filter. \nif riot gets a report of HATE SPEECH, dont look in the chat of the guy who was reported, see the whole chat. that's what you should be using ur resources on.\n\nPS: i am still calm as a monk from tibet :)","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-09-25T02:31:50.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you say it cannot happen in real life, about two thirds of my games have no raging.

I was flabbergasted by this, yet those trolls are still in the game and continue to play, and i am the one who made the game toxic by using the f word xD xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T01:44:08.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We do put human eyes on some of these reports, but there are still some things that simply aren't okay. Yes, that part where you said \" who called us %%%gots?\" was simply asking a question, but that wasn't the part that got you punished. From what I can personally see, it was most likely the bit where you started calling Twisted Fate names that got you punished. Also, regardless of who started what when the pressure increases, you always have the option of simply not fighting back.\n\nEven still, Help & Support can't lift bans at request. You're free to hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to open up that discussion with our player behavior agents.","replies":[{"poster":"NeoWolt","date":"2017-09-25T04:14:58.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sir, exactly my point here. We always have the option of not fighting back, yet it is very difficult to do so, i understand we can mute the person who gets toxic, but when the in game pressure builds up, it is really difficult to do so, coz people are already getting bogged down by the fact that they are being killed, and the next thing that they are calling u the f word, that doesnt justify it. \n Although i did open a ticket in that page, and got a reply a few moments ago. Yet i am not satisfied as they said that i was punished for using the f word twice. The one where i asked, and the other i used when telling tf that he is the f word. I understand if i am punished for using the f word once, but 14 days for one f word? I think that's unjustified.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
