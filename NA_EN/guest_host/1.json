We could do this in a number of ways. I think it would be really cool to be able to play champions before their rework. This includes relatively new reworks like {{champion:83}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:41}}{{champion:98}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:78}}  as well as older ones like {{champion:14}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:4}} . We could also bring back old items, spells, and even jungle monsters. \r\n\r\nBy no means am I saying that the old users are dissatisfied with the current state of the game or that the changes it went through were negative.

The point is to bring back the old stuff. For instance, we could roll back all the changes that took place in the champions for a year (while keeping the new champions). We could do the same for items. It would probably be chaotic to bring back everything, so we probably would have to focus on certain elements.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Guest Host","date":"2016-09-18T17:06:56.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Marshbouy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=m7efhivb,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-18T16:59:07.098+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible with the current game client, although i do wamt to play old taric sometimes.\n\nI do agree that some of the things I mentioned won't be easy to do.
