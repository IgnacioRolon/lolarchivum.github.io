I have tried everything I could think of to fix it ( repairing league, running as admin ), but to no success. I have had so many queue timers due to it. So, if someone could help fix it that would be amazing, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-14T21:13:58.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frequent crashes in champion select are often the result of the client experiencing an unstable connection to the servers. There are often local network configurations that can cause this issue, so I recommend working through our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step to resolving this.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[]}]}
