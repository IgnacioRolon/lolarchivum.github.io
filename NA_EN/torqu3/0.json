It's not that I am tabbed out and accidentally click decline, it declines it right away. Sometimes when I queue with friends I can see that it will decline because it will change their status from in queue to online, before the queue even pops for me. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-13T22:27:52.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This can happen with connections issues struggling to transition from matchmaking to champion select.  it's important to get that fixed, otherwise you're going to start seeing [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) penalties.
