I've sent logs to Riot Support, but to my knowledge they haven't replied, and it's been a few months. Anyways, I know it's packet loss, and I've added firewall exceptions and am using public DNS, but nothing it working. If you want my logs I'll do that when I can.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-01T04:26:58.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it was almost a month ago, but it looks like you're still having the same kind of packet loss issue I was trying to help you with before.

In game I have a tiny bit, but ever since I changed to Public DNS, I haven't had ingame input lag. Should I take the same logs?\n\nUpdate: Just put it through the log reader. Says ping was 33 stable with a few spikes to 36. Packet loss was 0% the entire game.

Now that I've lost a game to an AFK toxic jungler, a toxic support, and a toxic mid laner, I very much want to not play this game. Thanks for fixing this issue while I wanted to participate in this game that obviously needs a few matchmaking kinks worked out. This is the 5th game in a row where people have flamed me. Thanks, Riot.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
