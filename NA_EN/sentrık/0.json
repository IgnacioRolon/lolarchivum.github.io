There's no no frame drops. There's insane input lag. My Mouse works fine, and my computer is fine, it just takes a hell of a long time to scroll through things. I can't view post game results either on the new client. Also on the new client it sometimes just likes to crash while I'm in champ select. Luckily I'm in call with a duo that can tell me when they've started because I can't join back into champ select after picking my champ without dodging. The old client also just black screens when entering champ select. I'm pretty sure this is a problem on the new client too. Honestly if there were an old client that was actually stable or a new client that looked good (In my opinion) and was stable, then I would use that over legacy or alpha any day. Even if it meant taking away hextech crafting from the legacy client. Prices to pay to play the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-25T20:21:48.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Input delays and black screens can indicate an unstable connection that's failing to download assets or suffer from packet loss.
