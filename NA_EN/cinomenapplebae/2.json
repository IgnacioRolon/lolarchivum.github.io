Can you remove the ward jump on katarina? This makes her really unkillable, comes from bush do a lot of damage and kill the carries then ward jumps away. This gives her too much mobility as far as i'm concerned. For example lee sin, yes he does have a ward jump but he doesnt have resets like katarina does and have the dashing animation which we can deny the ward jump. Maybe i'm asking for way too much but her jump lacks counterplay, instantly dashing from one place to another and can do it again if you kill someone. :D Sorry for long post, here is a potato","replies":[{"poster":"MeilinII","date":"2016-11-03T20:41:37.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude...
