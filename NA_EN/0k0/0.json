Just looking for any counters or tips for playing against him and I would like peoples&#039; opinions on whether they think he is broken right now or just really strong. In my opinion he makes me want to uninstall the game until he&#039;s nerfed, lol.","replies":[{"poster":"ReshiKillim","date":"2015-08-23T17:09:00.757+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's just really strong. So far, the best options against him is kiter champs or champs that hit like a truck.\n\nThe real key to his dominance, is his synergy with his support. If you can force the support out of lane, Morde loses 50% of his laning power in botlane. He'll be forced to farm under turret until support gets back. Otherwise, it won't be hard to kill him.\n\nMorde tends to work extremely well with initiator supports, so I suggest having someone like Tahm, Thresh, or Bard as a support. Someone who can get you out of their painful CC-Burst combo.","replies":[{"poster":"0K0","date":"2015-08-23T17:25:46.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He seems to be a very good counter to riven.

You're more likely be winning if you have a morde on your team so when he gets dragon he can get a 4 man push on to a turret and down it very quickly.  The enemy team who doesn't have wave clear are f***ed. This rework is horrible, I don't see how nerfing him would make him any better. He has too much utility, to much bully power, too much sustain, and too much damage.

Not to mention that he'd roll a heal summ in sololane.\n\nThe difficulty with Riven vs Morde early game, is actually mainly his E. If he hits you, he gets more shield than you take by the dash stun on him.\n\nThe 15% bonus total shield per champ hit adds a lot of tankiness to him, which forces either risky all-ins or tower farming.  So he's pretty inconvenient to lane against as Riven.\n\nThe shield never decaying down past 25% is also annoying for Riven players.","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-08-23T18:39:11.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Becuase you have to lure things, if he is saving his hp with his shield he is the one luring you so he is outplaying you.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2015-08-23T20:58:32.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually, mordekaiser can tank 1-2 tower shots with his shield, so he can walk right up to a minion wave under tower and blast both the champion and the minions, then walk away without losing any hp\n\nmordekaiser's only real weakness...as it always has been...is being outdamaged to the point that he can't raise his shield (the new bottom lane wombo combo pairs prevent this so long as he shuts down either the support or adc or both)\n\nor his ability to be ganked to death in top lane\n\nhis W was actually a small but important part of his top laning kit, now equally replaced with a free even stronger than his last Q on solo hit ability\n\nhe's not optimal, but when he can chunk 70% of a tank's hp when building tanky, he has clear strengths and his kiteable nature isn't much of a weakness with the right support\n\nthen champs like quinn/teemo top, he can eat them alive because they have no durability, and that was the old mordekaiser...this one deals roughly the same damage and  even more in close quarters, so a flash initiate(well, against teemo since quinn will probably E away) or any of the other ranged tops will pretty much force them to return to base","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2015-08-23T18:06:46.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ReshiKillim,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Emczwsg2,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-23T17:56:26.429+0000)\n>\n> To be fair, Riven is actually in a pretty bad spot against the juggernaut reworks.
