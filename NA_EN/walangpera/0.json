When the game ended though my client crashed and now when I log in I can't play because the game is expecting me to reconnect to a game that's already over. And yes, I'm new to the forums and decided to log in just to ask if there were already any fixes to this issue. Thanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-18T20:49:24.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey WalangPera!\n\nThis seems to be an extremely rare bug with League of Legends in which the Game Server is not properly communicating with the PvP.net server that your match is indeed over.  Typically, this resolves itself after a few minutes, but sometimes it can take up to two hours.  If you are still experiencing this issue every time you log in after 2 hours, please let me know immediately so that we can further investigate it!","replies":[]}]}
