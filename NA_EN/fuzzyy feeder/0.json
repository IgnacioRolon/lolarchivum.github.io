I was punished so now I have to wait 20 minutes before I am allowed to queue up for 5 games. \r\nHowever, when the time is almost up, it resets, not allowing me to even queue up for a game. \r\nWhat's going on?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-09T03:24:14.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that LPQ timer is resetting it's most likely because your connection had some kind of hiccup in which the client thought you left the queue, so it started over. Try switching to ethernet to make sure you don't have any kind of blips that could make it reset, but I'd also take a screenshot and shoot it over to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They might be able to figure something out if this is indeed some weird bug.","replies":[]}]}
