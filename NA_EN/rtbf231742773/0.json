And so we didn't include it as a feature, but some other [players](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7hj6t0/introducing_league_displays_desktop_app_the_best/dqrf4ze/) have pointed out that you can use League Displays to download the animated .webm files and then use a program like Wallpaper Engine to set them as your wallpaper.
