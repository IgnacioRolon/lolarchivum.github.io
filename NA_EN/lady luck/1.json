Some of my props were damaged flying up to Seattle. So the first thing I did was head there on Friday morning in hopes I could make some repairs. I was happily able to do so and was ecstatic that there were bobby pins to better secure my wig as well (I had left mine at home). I was surprised how many different repair items were available. Even nail polish (which I used to keep my stockings from running further the second day.) If I had requests for the future: Add LCS viewing on a TV, more mirrors and maybe some skin codes available. It was amusing that a group would be huddled around a 7 inch tablet to watch LCS, but alas... It's not a good view. I was so happy to have a place I could relax and take off my wig without feeling awkward though.\nNot to mention the Rioters that were in the cospitality lounge were amazing. They were all so friendly. One even helped me paint my nails on Monday morning. I had just pulled out my nail polish to watch the LCS next to her (on that tiny tablet) and she offered to do them for me. A big thank you to her! (I forgot her name... I remember the numbers 135 and it started with an O. I think.)\n\nOf course, LCS was wonderful. I am so glad you got a bigger room this year. Though, it did get a little difficult to get in at times still. Having standing room in addition to chairs was lovely as well.\n\nAnd I loved that Rioters were 1v1ing people in the PC Freeplay area :D Winning a 1v1 against Bao as Mafia MF while dressed as Mafia MF made me so happy. It was a close fight! Thank you Bao. (Though I'm so sorry about all my issues with the keybindings initially.) \n\nRiot has been solidified as my favorite company - largely thanks to the cospitality lounge and the friendliness of all the staff that I spoke with.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\nPS - \nI love my Amumu plushie. His head makes a great pillow.","replies":[{"poster":"Sargonas","date":"2014-09-03T18:59:37.126+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"So glad you had a great time!

Address my issue please and show me how competent you guys are, because at this point I'm still out of $10 and no points.

Unfortunately your issue is not something I can help with directly, though I can at least try to pass this on to someone who might be able to. Lots of Rioters post on lots of threads on the forums, but each of us has our own areas of expertise that we specialize in and sometimes the questions or issues raised are left unanswered simply because the folks who see them are unable to assist.

It was the Summoner Fountain for cosplayers. Every time something on my costume broke off or needed adjustments, I could Recall back here and refresh my health and mana (fix costume and drink water). It was also Opus 135 who helped me safety pin my Shaco costume in place Sunday and Monday!\n\nAccording to KTGoldWolf, they did try to get an LCS TV in there, but the people at PAX claimed the stream would be choppy (yet people were watching on their laptops just fine...) And, to my understanding, skin codes were made available only in the LCS area so the peacefulness of the lounge wouldn't be compromised by general attendees.\n\nIt was a very welcome addition to my PAX experience as a cosplayer, and I look forward to attending future events with one!","replies":[{"poster":"Lady Luck","date":"2014-09-03T23:21:15.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahaha, I love your analogy to the fountain :P\n\nI can see why PAX might think that the stream would be terrible (Wifi on the fourth floor... anywhere on the fourth floor... Was atrocious) Maybe next year they'll see it wasn't too bad? :D\n\nEh, I can see the issue with the skin codes potentially... But the staff was outside telling people that it was cosplayers only. (I /really/ would like skin codes to be in the swag bags... I feel bad going up to people just to ask for stuff. And imagine how many other people had asked before me... How tired of it they must get.)\n\nBut yes, the lounge was a haven :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zelilah","date":"2014-09-04T12:25:27.213+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for sharing your awesome experience!

The quality of the cosplay - as long as it has effort - is often the last thing mentioned. It's usually an insult about the cosplayer herself. (She's ugly, she's fed, she's a slut, etc.) Comments online are so vicious... I've seen people that are a healthy weight called fat. (Not \"normal\" in society where slightly overweight is still normal but actually healthy with minimal fat... just not much muscle definition.) \n\n(Note: Although I use female pronouns I know male cosplayers are likely to get similar insults... But I don't think I've seen any slut shaming for the boys.)\n\nGiven the ridiculous venom I see...

The giant booth experience is exciting in a different way, but I've gotten to befriend so many awesome/kooky cosplayers this year through the Cospitality Lounge. It was fun (and relaxing for me!) to get to know you and paint your nails. I love doing it! Will do it for anyone, especially boyz.\n\nAs 2015 approaches, the Community team will continue to improve the Cospitality Lounge experience, and cosplayer feedback is always welcome! We did consider putting in screens for LCS viewing but for a HUGE gaming con like PAX Prime, we knew it would be really crowded and if many cosplayers stayed at the lounge watching LCS for an extended period of time, the cosplayers who really need to fix their costumes, change, or relax wouldn't have optimal space. Plus, internet connectivity at convention centers are rarely reliable :( But again, it's still a cool idea that might work for a different venue/event. \n\nI had an awesome time meeting you {{champion:21}} and all the other cosplayers who visited the Lounge and hope to see you at other Cospitality Lounges to come. <3 <3 <3\n\n...Also, does anyone know who started the giant Thank You card? A little birdy told me {{champion:36}} {{champion:16}} but I wasn't there at the time!","replies":[{"poster":"Kao Atlantis","date":"2014-09-12T07:33:25.225+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have attended almost every PAX Prime, and since Riot has been showing up there, I have always considered cosplaying a League of Legends champion. However, knowing from the experience of friends, even a simple costume can take a lot of time and effort to wear. Especially when things go wrong. Knowing about the awesome cospitality lounge this year has made me less worried about how to deal with cosplay stuff for next year. Definitely going to do my best to finally do it, just need to choose a champion now...\n\nHaving attended so many PAX Primes, Riot Games has been my highlight for the past 3 years. I have a bit of social anxiety when surrounded by large, pushy crowds, so I had a hard time standing in the mobs to get skin codes. Luckily a Rioter seemed to notice the quiet and patient people like myself and snuck us codes on the sidelines. He walked up to people, handed them cards and said, \"hold this for me.\"\n\nRiot can put on one awesome event.

On Saturday I had used the lounge to do some homework and there were times it got a little busy as it was. (If I did it outside I'd just get asked for photos, making it hard to concentrate... Even the short distance to the bathroom from the lounge I had somebody ask for a photo... And I didn't even have my wig or guns...
