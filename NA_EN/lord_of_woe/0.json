Riot and the community as a whole would rather not have someone who's just gonna switch to gameplay trolling when their chat is removed (which did happen) and besides under normal circumstance people are given at least 3 chances to reform before being permabanned (the two chat restrictions+a 2 week ban as well). If that's still not enough of a hint that poor behavior is not tolerated here then why should they be allowed to keep playing? While I agree that people should be given the opportunity to reform the line has to be drawn somewhere to remove those that don't or won't from the game and community without giving them the opportunity to ruin even more games with their poor behavior than they already have.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-12-05T18:06:26.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your arguement is \"we need a self muting method\", yes I agree with you.
