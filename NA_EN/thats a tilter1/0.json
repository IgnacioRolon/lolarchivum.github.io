Reconnecting and restarting game client doesn't fix this. Any solutions?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-18T21:43:48.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could happen for a number of reasons ranging from your volume settings or maybe drivers.  As a first step, make sure that your in-game sound options are toggled on.  The icon will toggle between a speaker icon versus one with a cross around it.  It could also be settings with other applications, for example Skype can mute other sounds if enabled to do so.  Hopefully, the issue will be as simple as that!","replies":[]}]}
