It kinda seems like this might be some kind of permissions issue so check out the steps in the [**permissions guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) first, but also make sure you go through this [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) as well. Let me know if this doesn't help at all!","replies":[]}]}
