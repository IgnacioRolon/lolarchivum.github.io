So I quickly made a support ticket and have yet to hear back, its been up since Monday, I don't mean to sound impatient, but I just wanted to know if it's normal for tickets to take this long, thanks for any help in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-13T23:13:10.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really sucks to hear that a piece stumbled out, and we'd like to look into this!  I was able to confirm that your ticket has been received and is in queue to be reviewed by our Merch team.  There's currently a high volume, so it may be a bit to receive a response.  Hang tight until then and make sure not to reply to the ticket so you don't drop to the bottom of the queue.  We'll get back to you asap!","replies":[{"poster":"chuclenuts","date":"2017-01-14T20:16:03.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very much appreciated","replies":[]}]}]}
