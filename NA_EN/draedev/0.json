This has happened before, but only lasts for 10 min or so. It's very difficult to play any games with this input lag, including league. I called my ISP and they said that it's that time of the year where there's much more people online due to them being off, work, school, etc. and that  it would return back to normal by the 4th or 5th.... No one I Know has this similar problem. the at&amp;t guy said to ask for what ports should be open for this game, or something. I have very little knowledge about this kind of stuff, I just hope this can be solved soon. Any help would be grateful, Thank You.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-28T00:41:28.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Big changes in latency do sometimes occur if there is a sudden increase in network traffic, however, there are also a number of local network configurations that could exacerbate the latency changes quite a bit. I strongly recommend working through the steps that we've included in our [**Connection Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) so as to ensure your local settings are compatible with League.\n\nShould you still experience latency problems after having taken those steps, please let me know so we can further troubleshoot this together.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2016-12-23T21:00:42.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, your ISP is right in the sense that your ping does increase when there are more people using internet in your area from the same ISP. Now, I'm assuming you live in either a rural area, or a very highly populated area for that large of an increase to occur. So yes, you will have to wait for it to go down a tiny bit until after Christmas break. \n\nHowever, there are some things you could do in an attempt to fix this. First of all, have you tried resetting your router? If not, I would strongly advise that. About once a month I have to do this with my router, since it occasionally malfunctions and starts either giving me ping spikes every couple of minutes, or just stops working for random periods of time altogether. Secondarily, if you are currently using wireless, you should get an ethernet cable. By using an ethernet cable, and connecting it from your router to your computer, your ping will become noticeable more stable and there will be much less interference. Finally, you should try looking at all of Riot's suggestions at this link. If I recall correctly, when I used to have tremendously high ping, although none of their suggestions fixed it (since I live in the countryside so my internet sucks regardless of what I do, I simply get throttled and there's nothing I can do about it until I'm in college), one of their suggestions should show you how to find what ports need to be opened up in your router for League. Here's the link to their site: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nLet me know if any of that helps, or if the ping fixes itself after a few days.","replies":[]}]}
