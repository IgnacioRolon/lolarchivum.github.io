{"poster":"Live Gameplay","date":"2014-09-11T22:25:26.672+0000","title":"[9/11/2014] Live Gameplay Forecast!","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":27,"down_votes":11,"body":"**Saludos Invocadores!**\n\nSpinning these Patch Forecasts back up as more changes come hurtling to the PBE. In the future we'll be experimenting with the forecast to see what's the best way to communicate pre-PBE changes, but for now we've got some neat things on the way that we wanted to talk about.\n\nThe overarching narrative for this patch is to reduce stagnation in the live environment by targeting highly banned champions and (finally) looking at those champs who make for a low-counterplay game (looking at you Talon). Speaking to the latter (low counter play dudes), it's worth mentioning they've *always* had low counterplay, but that we've traditionally let them be due to their low visibility and (occasionally) lack of current-meta strengths. More below!\n\nThere's also the GLORIOUS EVOLUTION of Viktor with his gameplay update (PBE friends, check that that feedback thread: http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/KiVchOFE-central-feedback-thread-for-viktor-gameplay-update) and the still-glorious-but-not-named-glorious evolution of Soraka with a larger gameplay update of her own (PBE friends, once again: http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/HitgrQNm-soraka-rework-feedback-thread).\n\nSo some forecasting:\n\nThere are a few oppressive champions out there who have been climbing the ladders in terms of ban rates, play rates, and win rates, and we've finally decided to get into the weeds to make them a bit healthier to play against. Between 4.17 and 4.18 you can expect some small changes to champs like Akali, Talon, Yasuo, and Fiora (oh man Fiora), with most focused on reducing some in their low-counterplay abilities (maybe not eliminating, but reducing at the very least).\n\nSpeaking of strong dudes, there's a few more on our radar that we wanted to address specifically:\n\n**Nidalee** - Cat lady's doing pretty well in all levels of play, specifically when she's thrown into top lane as a low counterplay bruiser-bully. We're looking for ways to reduce some of Nidalee's high AD / auto-attack focused strengths while maybe giving some love back to her AP bruiser / AP burst builds.\n\n**Tristana** - Don't really need to say much beyond this, but Trist's pretty good right now. Specifically her early / mid-game tradeoffs just aren't being made when she's got such a monster lategame potential. We're looking for ways to fix this, specifically by adding windows to actually beat her up throughout the game.\n\n**Kha'Zix**: As an opportunistic assassin, Kha'Zix's gone back to his missile-bugging days of prioritizing W to poke away at people. Given W's got tons of utility already piled on top of it (slow, vision, aoe), we're a little concerned that as missile-bug picks up, Kha'Zix will go back to losing a lot of his counterplay, especially since he can poke for high damage on grouped up individuals. **We'll be keeping a close eye on Kha'Zix as our changes develop, but if he needs help assassinating people, we're prepared to give him some love in those areas!**\n\n**Rammus** - Not really a nerf or a huge buff, but just in case anyone mining PBE files gets confused, we're making it so that Powerball and Defensive Ball Curl can now overlap by 1 second, so if you use one to cancel the other you get 1 second to consider your mistake before it actually happens.\n\n**LeBlanc** - LeBlanc changes! Since we removed the silence from her sigil of... malice, LeBlanc hasn't been in the best of places. We're looking for ways to give LB a bit more power in a healthy way, so we're talking more deception and cleverness rather than more damage.\n\nAnd that's it for this forecast! Remember that we've got champion update forecasts going on with their own separate contexts here:\n\nViktor: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/2Hxh1fnf-the-truer-evolution-3rd\nSoraka: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/BTP5uwf1-this-rework-is-going-to-be-bananas-soraka-rework-preview-and-discussion\n\nAs for followup discussions, today we'll be throwing **Riot Jag** into the mix to answer any followup questions you may have.","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2014-09-11T22:29:57.878+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":7,"body":"I am effectively commenting on myself, but I'd like everyone to agree that saludos invocadores is an excellent thing to lead every conversation with.","replies":[{"poster":"Zhugan","date":"2014-09-11T23:03:15.188+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":7,"body":"Except were aren't \"invocadores\" anymore.

Not because W is particularly overpowered but just because it is used. A leap of logic between W being prioritized again and, somehow, Kha'Zix supposedly losing his counterplay by having such a skill while providing added utility... which you gave them to compensate for the removal of his execution damage on Q, consistently good damage on non-isolated Qs and the sorely missed damage reduction taken from his ult. What gives? How is counterplay being reduced by W if \"lack of counterplay\" in Kha's history has been defined as a disregard of the isolation mechanic as a gating tool, extraordinary durability without sacrificing inventory spots for top tier damage and poor windows of opportunity to properly react to his stealth, all of which have been tended to in a long, grueling series of nerfs? How can you argue you're worried he'll somehow lose his counterplay if he's able to do \"high AOE damage\" on a skill that does 235 base damage + bonus AD when the only way that skill can produce high damage is sacrificing any semblance of tank stats --- counterplay?\n\nI don't know how sound or light these nerfs are, but I have to say regardless you are disrespecting the people who play this champ. I haven't in a *very, very long time* because you don't seem to understand in a game where obtaining and mastering champions is the product of time and dedication, continually hitting them feels like a devaluation of said time and effort, which is why people react negatively to changes to their preferred champions. If you knew that, you'd understand why nerfing Kha'Zix, or anyone, for consecutive patches with no end in sight has got to be the worst experience I, and many like me, have had as a  player and why I have long since stopped using him, and especially now that he's being targeted when seemingly he had finally hit a point of being healthy using weak arguments. It feels bad, because if you had done your job of correctly balancing this champion once and for all, the people who play it, who I can't include myself in anymore, wouldn't have to suffer through disappointment with every patch that comes out.","replies":[{"poster":"Jag","date":"2014-09-12T00:24:42.252+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":8,"body":"The direction we've always wanted to take Kha'zix is that he has to be an opportunistic assassin. To exert his power on the field, he needs to find the correct windows of vulnerability on the enemy team instead of brute forcing his way. Much like DR on his earlier versions of evolved ultimate, or the damage profile on his old Q, this version of W gives him the ability to force action.\n\nI sympathize with you that continuous nerfs to a champion can be frustrating. That said, we've tried to reorient Kha'zix's power in ways that are healthy for the game while still giving him the opportunity to be picked. We don't plan on nerfing him to the point where he does not feel viable.","replies":[{"poster":"Dear Lily","date":"2014-09-12T00:41:21.692+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is - I don't see how opportunistic Kha'zix is going to be all that healthy for the game either. He doesn't have much counterplay other than \"stay next to allies\", making him no different than an Akali - exactly what you're trying to fix.  Emphasizing his isolation range so much also feels REALLY bad, because that's pure counterplay and almost no play. You can't guarantee that someone will stand isolated - it's very hard to even force people to isolate themselves with how freaking large the range is.\n\nSo he has to have a fall-back pattern. Currently, it's his W: he has to stay midrange spamming W cause he doesn't have anything ELSE to do. ADC's are never going to be isolated even if they aren't intentionally trying not to be, because they are going to be standing super close to someone ANYWAY for safety. He doesn't have enough damage to dive in the backline without isolation, and if you buff him to be able to do that, then he turns into Talon 2.0. He's not a tank, intentionally so (and honestly, as amazingly fun as Tank'Zix was, I'm kinda glad it's gone as it was utter BS to play againt). \n\nEvery champion needs to be able to force SOME action. Maybe not singlehandedly, but he needs to do something that's not twiddling his claws waiting for enemies to step a few units outside of an arbitrary isolation range.\n\nP.S.: Any news on making the enemy's isolation indicator on base Kha'zix any clearer? Mecha Kha'zix has an okay one (DANGER!) but for a new player, it can be very confusing for Kha to sometimes be hitting you for a million damage and sometimes having wet noodles for claws. Clarity be missing here.","replies":[{"poster":"Jag","date":"2014-09-12T00:54:18.099+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"You bring up some good points. The part that is questionable to me is asserting that teams can ensure they literally never will prevent themselves from becoming isolated. I think the natural chaos of teamfights means that positioning is a dynamic state, and opportunities will always present themselves, even against top-level players. Furthermore, certain champions control space or just create disruption and isolation naturally (e.g.: Gragas), so I think teams that play Kha'zix will always have tools to make certain he'll find his spots.\n\nThat said, isolation has often been challenging to tune correctly, both in terms of range of isolation and in terms of payoff to Kha'zix. The clarity issue is made worse by the concept of isolation being difficult to understand. I wonder how you'd feel Guardian of the Sands Kha'zix feels in this regard?","replies":[{"poster":"Dear Lily","date":"2014-09-12T01:02:53.838+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"The teams insuring that they won't isolate themselves was a slight mis-writing for me :( I meant to say that they will not be isolated in most situations through standard play, and although they sometimes will, it's not a conscious thought (isolation range, in most of the cases, gets killed by minions incidentally happening to be in the area). So it's not counterPLAY as much as counterCIRCUMSTANCES.\n\nTeamfights are pretty reflex-based, so think of the gut reactions. If you see a Kha jump on you as a squishy ADC, are you more likely to think \"oh I need to stay within 500 range of my buddy buddy minion!\" or are you gonna want to GET THE FK OUTTA THERE NOW! In a pick situation, Isolation is completely unneeded, and in a 1v1 duel, it feels terrible for the Khazix player because you can't reliably force your opponent outside of the minion wave since he knows as long as he stays there he can duel you.\n\nOpportunistic assassins are great and fun - but I'd want to pick one so I can take advantage of teammates blowing their CC on the enemy's mid range damage dealers so I can have free reign over the backline, not to take advantage of their ADC stepping arbitrarily too far from the minion wave that just happens to be strolling by.\n\nI have never played against GotS Kha'zix, so I can't say in game, but from pictures his isolation indicator is the worst :( it blends in a ton with the grass of new SR (can't say for old SR unfortunately) and it doesn't actually tell you what it does. It looks like a buff on Kha, not a \"you should stand near minions!\" indicator. Maybe put the ring Khazix sees around your champion when you are isolated (You only get the ring if you can see Kha obviously; maybe keep it for one more second if you see Kha use his ulti so that it doesn't suddenly vanish and reappear, which would confuse new players even more)? Or maybe rings around minions showing safe zones (although the visual clutter would be huuuuuge)?\n\nP.S.: Sorry if I see passionate about this - Kha'zix was the first champion I ever played (I joined right after his release) and he's been one of my most played ever since, so I care a LOT about you guys not destroying his playstyle for the fourth time.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2014-09-11T22:45:25.789+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:69}} What about Cassiopeia, won't we see any numbertweaks or buffs for her?

I'm semi new to this game, only been playing a few months, but have pretty solidly dedicated myself to Kha'Zix. I love the lore, I love the concept, and even though you blatantly confuse the words Evolve and Mutate, I let it slide and enjoy playing my beloved voidreaver.\n\nI've noticed a pattern of build-killing with Kha'zix, that seems contrary to your design goals. You often try to support a variety of builds instead of pigeonholing into one. There are 3 basic builds: Bruiser, Q-Based Assassin, W-based poke. It should be noted that the last two often overlap, its just a question of which comes first.\n\nYou killed Bruiser. Whatever, that's fine. I don't think removing what I still consider to have been an off-build was necessary, but that's OK.\n\nYou've made it fairly clear you want him to rely on his Q, but the problem is you also killed his laning, forcing him to rely heavily on his W for the actual jungling process. While I am not complaining, the issue here is that if he is relying so heavily on it, he will evolve it, and use it in the actual game, as opposed to trying to split his strengths, that's simple efficiency.\n\nIf you intend to nerf his W yet again, I need to know that you're going to compensate him somehow. ATM, his ultimate is too weak to be worth leveling, and if you nerf his W's evolution yet again, he will simply have a dead evolution point. If you must do anything to it, hit the utility - get rid of the vision again or something. It's something I love, but I will live without the TF utility to prevent you from blatantly murdering his jungling and ganking capabilities early game - because that's where he really shines.\n\n\nOn Isolation In Team Fights: \n\nYou rely heavily on isolation. I know it, you know it, and the enemy team knows it. What I have noticed is very brief periods of people isolating and unisolating themselves, it's very rare to see someone stay isolated for more than a few seconds until the TF has already mostly wrapped up. The way the mechanic works currently, it lends itself to more of a cleanup playstyle than an opportunistic one. \n\nThe current W helps a bit with that, as people spread out to avoid the missiles, they will occasionally isolate themselves, lending you the opportunity to go in, and actually accomplish something in the fight, or at least allowing you to contribute with some poke.\n\n\n\nMaybe I'm not making the best case, I don't have numbers, or data, and my experience is primarily anecdotal at a relatively low skill level. \n\nBut I think Kha'Zix's kit is fine where it is, and very cohesive. His main kill potential is his Q, and his E allows him to make use of that often short window of opportunity for him to use his Q. His W allows him to have something to do when waiting to use his other abilities, and the harass can make less coordinated teams split and create the window. It is in no way allowing him to \"Brute Force\" through teams, the damage is simply not high enough, I've tried pure spikes builds and it simply isn't. His R is a decent escape/chase tool, but not the engage it used to be. \n\nYou're currently fulfilling all known design goals. Please, leave my Kha'Zix alone.

If you are gonna nerf him on one of these evolutions again (his W probably, as the text indicates), what way do you want to push them in the direction in which Kha wouldn't be in a stronger than usual? Keep nerfing and mixing up every ability and evolution doesn't seem very productive, as seen in the history of this champion. Also, wouldn't this mean a sort of cycle start again, in which Kha'Zix players are forced to play the champion, yet still he receives nerfs on the abilities and evolves that ARE already weaker/ behave different than usual?? How would you like to take him away from this path, and make him a champion which is fine in his own specific playstyle, yet doesn't seem to strong in every way they have to change him, and is a stable force with clear pro's and con's?","replies":[{"poster":"Jag","date":"2014-09-12T00:45:20.386+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The Corki note was a \"this is a world championships patch so it must be time to buff Corki\" joke that somewhat missed the mark.

Through buffs. Those things? They go on every class but assassins apparently?... sorry. Needs said. A lot.), and tying his evolutions to the amount of kills/assists he has, and/or Baron/Dragon kills. It fits his lore way better than level ups, doesn't gurantee he has all those tools every game, and is perfect on an assassin. \n\nCould keep them capped behind a level wall as well, so he can't get all 3 before 16, but needs X kills/assists/objectives in addition to the level.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Raiyn","date":"2014-09-11T22:51:02.510+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":9,"body":"1) Why are you nerfing Kha'Zix.

If he needs buffs I don't want to sit here for a month for them, because this ALWAYS happens. When a champion is op, they (sometimes) get nerfed (very slowly), but it always takes SO LONG for it to happen and it really starts to get to you after the 4th month of Nidalee dominating the scene.  I don't like how we have to wait several months for patches that say, \"ok we're doing this ONE thing to her, we'll see where she's at later\" when the problem obviously isn't fixed. Then guess what? That's right, we gotta wait until next patch for more. I know you guys don't like hotfixing unless there is literally a critical gamebreaking bug, but it really starts to get annoying having to wait so long for patches to come out for nerfs/buffs.\n\nSorry if this sounds whiny, but I just had to say it to make sure you know how frustrating it is waiting for things that obviously need immediate looking into. \n\nAlso go easy on Talon and Kha'Zix pls","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2014-09-11T23:36:23.529+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">Sorry if this sounds whiny, but I just had to say it to make sure you know how frustrating it is waiting for things that obviously need immediate looking into.\n\nJust gotta say I <3 you for the empathy.

Speaking to the latter (low counter play dudes), it's worth mentioning they've *always* had low counterplay, but that we've traditionally let them be due to their low visibility and (occasionally) lack of current-meta strengths. More below!\n\n^This is your own fault for nerfing whoever get's popular. Talon low counterplay? Maybe if he's fed sure, but everything is strong when it is fed. I don't really know where you look at for these nerf lists but I get the feeling it is from watching low elo solo queue. Talon is strong against the long-range-skillshot based champions where he can take advantage of missed skills very easily, but this is all part of champion selection. If you take lux, be ready for a talon pick, crying about it afterwards is silly when you, as a player, should be ready for counter-pick possibilities. It's only in bronze and silver where no one cares about counter-picks, instalock katarinas etc. The meta mid lane at the moment is long-range-skillshot champions, of course talon will be high priority. \nThe meta always changes as a result of nerfs or over the top buffs, rather than nerfing whatever's popular to the ground, why not strengthen something else. Very few champions truly have little/no counterplay, leblanc was one because of the silence and her re-distortion-safety combo, but talon certainly has counterplay. What scares me the most about this thread though is the mention of Yasuo. Yasuo has counterplay, but no-one seems to really care, they just jump straight to infinity edge-shiv yasuo is OP, nerf it. Lissandra doesn't give 2 hoots about yasuo mobility in lane, unless he gets fed somewhere else or camped for by the jungler....it won't be a very pleasant lane for yasuo, LeBlanc can silence Yasuo even without her silence (yes that was a joke).\nMost of your champion nerfs aren't needed, what is needed is for the players to be more respectful of their opponent and the champion said opponent is, or potentionally could be, playing. Perhaps nerfing everything really is the only way to balance things out, but something is always going to be good, confusing that with \"lttle or no counterplay\" sounds like a low elo queue player crying over katarina camping the bot lane when they have no vision, it has absolutely nothing to do with katarina's counterplay. \nWhat follows now is going to be my own opinion, so this could be a little biased: What about Fizz trollpole? This is moving more away from counterplay and more into the lee sin region, ie: \"Oops, i cant actually do this, thats fine, i can just kick and safeguard away\" Lee sin, Udyr, and Fizz have been my pet hates for this reason, they get away so often for screwing up, in most case scenarios, if you jump into a fight you can't win, you will probably die for it, those 3 just kick, troll pole, or stun-and-get-the-hell-out-at-mach 5. You often mention counterplay when nerfing a champion, but what about this. Getting away with something you deserve to have coming for you almost 100% of the time? \nIf I was totally honest, I would have to say that what you said of \"they've *always* had low counterplay\" Isn't really true. They just weren't often played so no one knew how to deal with them. Now that they are, instead of pointing out their weaknesses, they just get hit with a giant nerf bat. Things like Kassadin (with his ultimate), and the pre-mentioned LeBlanc silence, Nidalee spear width, were things that actually needed it, and were worked well. I genuinely don't think Talon needs a nerf considering how little impact he has when even slightly behind, and in all honesty, it looks more like silences in the mid lane are being targeted, both Kassadin and LeBlanc needed it (I play LeBlanc and that nerf frustrated me immensely, but I knew it was needed so I let it go), ***continuing in comments***","replies":[{"poster":"Divewing","date":"2014-09-16T07:42:15.113+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"but Talon has counterplay, and so does Yasuo. The problem with both of them is that most of the counter champions aren't very popular. I was nearly reported in a game where I refused to ban Master Yi and he was taken by the other team, and I locked in adc Quinn. I had to deal with constant toxic comments even though we were doing fine every time Master Yi got a kill, but we then won the game off a teamfight where I blinded Yi and he dealt me 0 damage, after he dropped we cleaned up. This kind of ignorance is why Talon is being banned so much. Ill put this here: http://www.lolking.net/champions/ \nLooking at the top ban rates (20% up), both fizz and zed are there, but they have less popularity. Fizz and Zed were significantly more popular as late as a few months ago, but they aren't getting nerfed, the only reason i can think of for this is that neither of them have an ability that cancels the opponent from using theirs. Is the real goal here to remove the silence? Zed can assassinate just as well as talon, and has more than one gap closer,  so what is the justification for a targeted nerf on talon other than his popularity and ban rate. I have been playing talon for most of this season, and there have been plenty of games that I have been beaten (quite severely) in lane. Talon's level 1 and 2 are atrocious, Talon is quite commonly listed as a hard Syndra counter, but I am yet to pick Talon into a Syndra, because it could quite easily be game over for me in the first 3 minutes. Talon has no escape bar flash pre 6, and not enough damage on his early w's to farm at range. If this is not to do with his silence and more the AoE shred that his ult w gives. then make cutthroat or noxian diplomacy mark its target and ult and rake deals 1/2 damage to not marked champions or something.\n\nI do apologise if this sounds rude, especially considering how vague the reasoning for this nerf target is, but I  cannot agree that Talon is a low-counterplay champion, and a silence nerf is not the right thing to do simply because he will become useless when his target flashes, and probably end up dead ie: just jumped into enemy team and adc flashed away. This would mean either ulting (another cooldown) and running out, or getting jumped on and dropping like a fly.\nBefore I round this off, I'd just like to apologise again for the text wall, and re-iterate that this is by majority opinion. I hope I am just jumping the gun  on the silence thing, I would regrettably agree he dishes out too much AoE damage on the side. But I have to ask, are you ever going to look at the champions who aren't banned, or aren't even played?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2014-09-12T00:02:46.505+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's been said, but this assassin hate BS ***needs*** hotfixed when you inevitably overnerf a bunch of champions.
