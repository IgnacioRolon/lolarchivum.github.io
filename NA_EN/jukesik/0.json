(also lost 50 LP) HELP RIOT EMPLOYEE","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey rito, Never had problems with client, and suddenly it crashes. before a game. I click reconnect 10 times or so, still didn't work. I closed the client and restarted it, still didn't work. Assumed it wouldn't happen again because it has never happened to me before, so I queue up again. Same thing happens... \r\n\r\nI repaired the client and have a 20 min wait time to get into queue... So I have to wait 20 mins to see if my client is working? On top of that I lost 50 LP,l which is hard to gain back, because for some odd reason my Lp gain is under 16 whenever my ranked record is basically even... \r\n\r\nPLS HELP...\r\n\r\nIs there anyway you can remove my wait timer or help a brother out with some LP??","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-15T00:45:34.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I can't help a brother out by removing your LPQ penalty or giving you LP, but we can troubleshoot this together. What you're experiencing is most likely caused by an *unstable connection* to our gameservers. I'd strongly recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure all your local network settings are compatible with League.\n\nLet me know if this resolved your issue.","replies":[{"poster":"JukeSik","date":"2016-12-15T01:48:51.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually. I played a norm and everything was fine. I go to play ranked and it will not load. It says i have corrupted data. Not to sound like an asshole, but this is bullshit... I have to wait 20 mins for the client to crash, which is something I can't control.\n\nThere has to be a way that you can remove my wait timer... This isn't my fault, i did everything I could to avoid this. Pls help Rito","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-15T23:51:09.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ouch, I'm sorry that happened in your first attempt at ranked after trying to fix this. As I mentioned before, I'm unable to make changes to your Leaverbuster penalties or LP. Regardless of intent, a disconnection still negatively affects *everyone in the match*. This has become a big reason as to why the system treats all disconnections equally and why we're locked out of making changes to penalties.\n\nAt this point, I'd like you to grab some system logs with our [**HRT App**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367), then attach them to a [**support ticket.**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) One of our tech specialists will be able to work closer with you to pinpoint exactly what's causing these issues. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JukeSik","date":"2016-12-15T01:15:33.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The repair function worked properly and the issue is resolved.
