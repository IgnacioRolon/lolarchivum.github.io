As with all of these now-regular faction updates, I hope it's becoming clear that there is no template for the type or amount of content we publish - to be quite honest and open, we Narrative folks are experimenting with ways to get new lore out to you... :-)\r\n\r\nI've said this plenty before now, but we genuinely DO welcome feedback, because it helps us to figure out when we're doing something right, and also when you would like us to try harder.\r\n\r\nI try to keep up with posts on here, and on Reddit, Twitter etc, and I know there are some of you who don't like the new Karma bio. Full disclosure, we had intended to deliver some more story content for her at the same time, but that didn't happen - we have limits on time, resources and promotional space that we have to bear in mind when working on this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nAnd, in this case, the plan changed mid-flight. We ended up not telling her whole story, and that's not good enough when so many players are so invested in her as a champion, and as a character in the wider Runeterra setting.\r\n\r\nSo we're going to update Karma's lore again. No, we're not going to retcon it - we're going to _improve_ it.\r\n\r\nWill we do this for any/every champion that gets negative feedback? Heck no. Sorry. Sometimes we're doing something for a specific reason, with a specific goal in mind... but in this case, my personal feeling is that we only delivered half the picture in Karma's update. But, luckily, that's something I can make sure gets fixed.\r\n\r\nAs always, we just need to figure out a patch where we can re-release it - that's the only reason it's not coming out today.\r\n\r\nBut we hear you. And we're on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Xeneth","date":"2018-04-13T03:09:11.826+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":5,"body":"I suspect that fleshing out the \"many lives, one body\" concept won't exactly appease fans that would rather she remain easier to grok/empathize with, but I for one appreciate the attempt at crafting a backstory for her that's a little more unique than, \"An Ionian power, like Irelia, but more centrist\".\n\nRegardless, this is...

We’re told “Karma is a pasifist” and “Darha is headstrong” but were never really shown it. The best we got is the fact that Karma was so adamant about not harming people and Darha changed her...it’s.... their mind(s) to kill one person. But beyond that there’s nothing but exposition saying ‘trust us they’re peaceful and headstrong’\n\n2: Dont make Karma a pure pacifist. For her I always got the feeling of ‘Pacifism is the end goal, but not always the right choice’. Noxus is killing people left and right, desecrating Ionian temples and Landmarks, nearly destroyed their most sacred place and Karma basically says ‘do nothing’. What made the previous lore appealing was that Karma tried that, peace failed, and she blasted a soldier, that WORKED, and she learned peace is awesome, but it’s not always an answer, it’s a hard but true lesson.\n\n3: Make Karma more empathetic. She’s so static in game, and now (until you touch her up) in lore she’s boring too. Karma’s kit is a subject I’ll stay away from since I know that’s not your department. But lore wise give a joke, some dry wit, some **feeling** to the character, it’s something she’s been missing for a while.\n\nThanks for posting{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[{"poster":"y0r1ck","date":"2018-04-13T15:32:53.456+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"In Hindu mythology and Buddhist teaching dharma and karma represents order, equality, duty, and divine justice. They're inseparable concepts and there's no single word translation. Trying to translate dharma and karma is like trying to define the nature of the universe.\n\nDharma and karma are primal. Nobody, not even god(s), is above dharma and karma. These concepts work together to guide every day life. They are not opposites, they work together and both are necessary. Karma teaches us to accept what we cannot change, and to walk a straight path; for God will punish those who stray. Dharma teaches us to do our duty with an unshakable faith and determination. Faith in the universe, and determination in a goal. I hope that helps to clarify karma and dharma, the inspiration behind the champion's name.\n\nIn truth, the path of karma isn't equal to pacifism. The path of dharma isn't killing or violence. In truth, I feel a little bit personally insulted. Riot misrepresented these concepts a lot, and they're beliefs that every Hindu and Buddhist live their life by every day. \n\nI suggest writing the lore in a way that reconciles karma and dharma into one identity. From there let the reader see the paths of karma and dharma as she walks them. Tell us what is happening, and let us see that karma and dharma lead the champion onto a path of service, duty, and justice.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hadriel","date":"2018-04-13T08:15:45.474+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"We didn't tell the whole story\" sounds like \"our awful version of Karma has more backstory\". The problem isn't a lack of context, the problem is that the key elements of the Karma you wrote are poor and go against who Karma is as a character. \n\nJust listen to her voiceover - a great one - and contrast to what you wrote. You did not capture the essence of Karma, you wrote a supporting character in Irelia's story meant to be little more than a contrast. The problem is that the stories show Irelia as the one who takes action to protect her homeland when that is not in any way incompatible with the fabric of Karma's character.\n\nKarma is about retribution, about reaping what you sow. About peace, enforced. Your version of Karma cannot proactively enforce peace or dole out retribution because \"she stops hearing voices\". The in-game version of Karma is all about catching up to you to give you what you had coming. You wrote Karma as a pacifist stereotype that makes absolutely no sense, and trying to explain it further is not going to fix the problem, it's simply going to give you a better argument to self-assert on your tonedeaf version of Karma.\n\nKarma's contrast to Irelia should come in the form of sensibility that Irelia lacks entirely. Irelia has grown to be bloodthirsty and dehumanizing, something that Karma isn't and shouldn't ever be. But Karma is very far from a doormat, something that you wrote yourselves in a corner about. Your Karma is toothless because she lives in fear of losing more \"voices\" than she already has. \n\nYour Karma also reads as *not her own person*. She's a pair of pants worn by \"the spirits\". There are no interesting conflicts attached to Karma because she doesn't appear to be truly autonomous. Her power is conditional, she's overly concerned with a counsel whose importance you did not explain, and she does not exhibit any of the strong personality you get from her in-game. She's swallowed alive by the spirits.\n\nIf you want to make right by Karma, MEAN IT. Scrap the whole \"never kill again\" and make Karma *more* than just this generic chosen one who hears spirits. That's a generic character and a generic trope. Make Darha much, much more prominent.","replies":[{"poster":"y0r1ck","date":"2018-04-13T15:38:20.625+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"YES!

A few brief points on what I felt didn't come across well in the new bio:\n\n\n- The 'Karma' spirit choosing Darha as a host. This comes across like yet _another_ possession story, it makes me question why she couldn't just be born with these experiences/memories from her passed lives and unlock them as her story progresses? I think a more natural reincarnation theme would have been more appropriate for the 'enlightened one'.\n\n\n-  \"Killing would always be easy, but came at the cost of **true enlightenment.**\" This statement lacks nuance, so it comes across like \"killing is always bad\". That doesn't sound 'enlightened', and it's unclear to me whether that's meant be illustrative of Darha's current mindset and understanding, or a truth of Karma. If that quote is in fact supposed to be Darha's  current understanding, she needs to go see {{champion:420}} - Illoai would set her straight. \n\n\n- \"The voices that had spoken so clearly in her mind now fell silent, and she felt Darha returning to prominence—this brought little comfort, however, as she realized she had made a huge mistake.\" The mistake isn't clear (at least not to me), was the mistake that there were innocent people on board the invading vessel, or was it simply that she took a life? The previous quote implies killing in **any** context is wrong, and this quote seems to affirm that with a penalty. This is where the lore really begins to make me question why she's a playable character in this game, and not just an npc from Irelia's lore. We're moving away from the Karma in-game more and more at this point, and that's worrying.\n\n\n- \"Karma has pledged to guide as many of them as she can to more peaceful means.\" This is cool, it leaves the door open for Karma to once again become the diplomat she was in her old lore. Then it continues: \"And with every conflict she averts, more of the lost voices return to offer their eternal wisdom.\" This appears to be setting her up on a journey to regain those voices; which based on the penalty she faced when she **defended** her homeland, means a purely non-violent journey. \n\nThis lore overall doesn't sound like the wise Karma with the profound quotes we have in-game at all. The Karma we know and love understands the wisdom in war and the perils of inaction, she desires peace and harmony but will defend her home and her people with deadly force if **necessary**. \n\nUltimately I just hope that Karma's story brings her to place she's at in-game, I think her quotes do a good job of showing her wisdom/enlightenment and should be expanded upon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hozenb","date":"2018-04-13T08:46:12.536+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wrote an article about Karma's old lore and lore update...\n\n>**Introduction**\n\nI am a player since Season 2 from the Taiwan server. Karma has been one of my most played champions over the past few years. Not only did I love her play style, but most importantly, I was also fascinated by her lore. I loved her stories, I love her vivid characters. To me, she's more than a name and more than a model in the game. She indeed was a person who had been with me for years and had encouraged me in the vicissitudes of life. I would not have managed to get through the mental illness (i.e. depression) from which I have suffered for years without her.\n\nIn the first half of the article, I tried to have a more rational and critical view on why I love Karma by analyzing her personality traits and characters. In the second half, I would like to talk about why I think the new lore does not fit her character.\n\n\n> **What I love about Karma?**\n\nThis can be split into several parts - (1) her charisma as a leader (she was discerning, she was a mediator and she earned her respect) and (2) her adamant resistance to Noxian invasion (she loved the Lands and her people, she was strong-willed). I will discuss her personality with references to her 1st and 2nd lore. Her 1st lore was the original released version in 2011, her 2nd lore was released with the 2013 rework of Karma. In my opinion, the 2nd lore retained the personality of Karma with changes to the episodes that she had gone through. So, I will treat them as the same character in this article.\n\n> **(1) Charisma as a leader**\n\nShe was discerning. This was manifested through the wise decision that she was intellectually capable to make according to situations. In both the 1st and 2nd lore, she managed to save the villagers from the cruel invaders. In the 1st lore, she observed and discerned how the villagers were captured by the Noxian Commander, In this particular situation, she decided to utilize her ability as a mediator, which she learned from the teaching of the elders in the young age, to resolve the problem diplomatically. She finally persuaded the Commander to release the villagers. In her 2nd lore, she observed how the elders was killed by Noxian in their \"peaceful protest\" and she understood that was not the best option when you were facing some heartless soldiers who were about to ravage the village and kill all the life. She decided to use her power to stand in front of the people to protect them. She triumphed over the Noxian army.\n\nShe was a mediator. That means more than calming people or solving conflicts. She could solve conflicts because she was able to listen to different or even contrasting views and was able to find the middle ground in divergence. The 2nd lore emphasized this point more than the 1st lore, but her similar attitude towards the traditionalists could be observed in both lores. In the 1st lore, when the traditionalists (the elders) decided to surrender, she bolstered them to resist and fight back the enemies. In the 2nd lore, the focus was put explicitly that she was fighting for a middle way between the traditionalists (pacifist) and the revolutionists. She embraced peace, but she believed peace would never come if no one fought for it. This is well known to the majority of the players who may not have the chance to read lores since this is clearly depicted in her current in-game voice line. \n\n\"Peace, no matter the cost.\"\n\"Never again will I sit idle.\"\n\"I have seen two paths and made another between.\"\n\"If you desire peace, you must prepare for war!\"\n\"An ideal is nothing... until you fight for it.\"\n\nThe most fascinating part of the old lore to me was that she actually earned people's respect to become the leader of Ionia from an ordinary villager (1st lore: the daughter of the owner of a local business who struggled to provide for themselves; 2nd lore: an ordinary person living in a small village). She built her reputation in the Ionian-Noxian war through her strong will to resist enemies and her modesty to always stand alongside the people. In the 1st lore, she \"never compromised, and she shared every hardship with her people\" to become the \"formidable leader of the Ionian resistance\". In the 2nd lore, she also became a well-known leader because the opponents surrendered to her strength and spirit.\n\n>**(2) Adamant resistance to Noxian invasion**\n\nAs mentioned above, she became the icon of Ionia in the raging war. Most importantly, we should understand the motivation behind her action - what drove her to become such a person. Both of the lores show how she loved her people and the lands. She loved them so much that she could even sacrifice her own life to rescue others. The 1st lore described her as always willing to share hardship with her people. And in the 2nd lore, she refused to accept the death of the innocent villagers, instead, she made a decision of \"sacrificing a single life to spare many others\". Merely being a sage will not make her the representation of Ionia, but her thorough understanding of the traditional Ionian teaching, her love towards her people and her lands, together with the pragmatic actions of protecting all the things she loved make her the true leader of Ionia.\n\n\"_Ionia speaks through me._\" - Karma\n\nAll the endeavors she put into the war further illustrate this point. There was a whole paragraph in the 1st lore highlighting how Karma devoted herself to improve her combat skills. She modified her fans into lethal weapons and she even sought Janna's tuition to enhance her skills. In the 2nd lore, she changed her protecting spiritual power into immense harmful power to defeat enemies. She did this always for the same purposes: to push away Noxians and to bring back peace to Ionia.\n\n\n\n_P.S. Due to the word limit of the comment section, I have to split the second half of the article into another comment._","replies":[{"poster":"Hozenb","date":"2018-04-13T08:50:46.301+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":">**Why I am not a fan of the latest updated lore?**\n\nThe new lore fell apart when it tries to force onto her a new story, which was not able to make connections with the previously well-established character to a large extent. Almost none of her aforementioned traits was retained in the new lore. I always think champions are more than a name or an in-game model with specific Q, W, E, R abilities. It didn't feel right for me when I saw Riot completely \"butcher\" the old character and tried to tell a story of a new character (like the new Karma). The old designers and narrators brought this character to life, and over the years, fans had built emotional attachment to this specific character. Since a fictional character is not something that exists materialistically, it's hard to define what this character is based on his/her sole existence, unlike you and me. You will always know what you are as long as \"you\" are here. So for the case of a fictional character, the inner soul (which can be embodied by the personality traits) defines what he or she is. If even his/her soul is taken away, I am not so sure what this character is.\n\nBut, well, I understand not every player in the community agrees with this point. Sometimes people think as long as the in-game champion has an underlying cool lore that fits the play style, it would be fine. I respect this viewpoint, but I believe Riot also planned to somehow connect the updated lore to the old lore. I can see Riot's effort on connecting Karma's new and old lore, they did retain one aspect of the old Karma - the part that she embraced Ionian tradition.\n\nIn both the 1st and 2nd lore, there was one paragraph dedicated to this respectively. \n\nAs written in her 1st lore:\n\"Even in her youth, Karma exhibited almost superhuman composure. While her peers explored the torrent of emotions that came with adolescence, Karma meditated in the Lotus Gardens. She was convinced that the true path to enlightenment was a journey inward, to a place within the self, overlooked by most.\"\n\nAnd in her 2nd lore:\n\"Led by elder monks, the villagers practiced a tradition of benevolent magic and pacifism. Known for her powerful connection to the spiritual realm and beloved as a just mediator amongst her people, Karma embraced these traditions as an essential aspect of the enlightenment sought by all Ionians.\"\n\nShe had always been a pacifist, following the traditional values of Ionia. But this was just the start of her old lores and she didn't stop here. She faced challenges when the invasion started. She was capable of the flexibility to learn from new occasions to attain her goals - protect Ionia. Flexibility and intelligence were where her charisma built upon. She knew when to be intransigent and when to compromise. The new lore failed to show this point.\n\nIn the new lore, she immediately believed violence was wrong after killing an entire team of enemies, even in the very middle of the raging war. How about the people who were still suffering from the violence brought by the opponent? How about the families that had been torn apart? Karma had been a character who felt and cared so much for her people and always tried to find the best solution to save her people in her old lore. Even in the new short bio, Ionia is written as \"the land she holds most dear\". The decision she made in the new lore is really questionable to me.\n\nApart from this, while in the old lore Karma earned the respect from the people through her pragmatic actions, she simply gained support from people because she was a blessed spirit or god in the new lore. This is a serious disempowerment to the originally strong female leader who grew from an ordinary villager living a modest life to a leader admired by the whole nation.\n\nWhat is worse, the new lore introduced an identity conflict to her old fans. Karma is no longer a woman in the current lore, but it is now a title of spirits. This title was given to the body of a 12 year-old girl named Darha in the current lore. Worse still, Darha and the spirit Karma (which is actually a mixture of past life memories) fought for the control of the body. This identity conflict is confusing to fans. Who is Karma now? Is she still the woman we love? Or is she a voice in somebody's head? Or is she Darha...maybe? When this identity conflict brings nothing but confusion, I can't see the necessity to include this in the story. Karma can simply be a person who has the ability of reincarnation. She lives different lives over the years and gains wisdom from past experience. She can enjoy a completely new life in every incarnation, starting from a little baby. It's not necessary for the writer to force her to borrow the body from other children. Being a single entity can strengthen her characterization as \"Karma\", the soul that was brought to life by the old narrative team.\n\n>**Last thoughts**\n\nThank you for reading. As you all know, there has been a huge debate on Reddit and the Boards on Karma lore update in the past week.\n\nI was happy a few years ago when I knew Riot decided to remove the Institute of War from the stories and add more depth to the storytelling. Unfortunately, despite that some champions received awesome modifications, some other champions have been drastically changed to someone I couldn't recognize. Sometimes huge modifications have to be made as the old lore just didn't fit into the new plot, but I hope the soul of the characters can be retained on top of the new events that would be added to their life. Karma can be a spirit with reincarnation, but she can at the same time be the Karma we know. Riot can always think on the basis of her personality - what the Karma we know would do now when she is given the divine spirit and all the past experience.\n\nNo matter how she is gonna be changed, I still appreciate Riot to have created such a vivid character that have enlightened me for the past few years. Thank you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jack0Alpha","date":"2018-04-13T03:15:06.501+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":9,"body":"U said four ionians alongside irelia..the champs that got bio update were karma,lee sin,yasuo,and RIVEN..riven is noxian not ionian..or did i miss read something?","replies":[{"poster":"Raven Redeemed","date":"2018-04-13T03:18:35.594+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"She now lives in Ionia.","replies":[{"poster":"Jack0Alpha","date":"2018-04-13T03:23:30.210+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Raven Redeemed,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=cXx0nG5A,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2018-04-13T03:18:35.594+0000)\n>\n> She now lives in Ionia.\n\nAll tho she is born in noxus,so u cant call her ionian tho...","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-04-13T03:31:55.308+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":14,"body":"When has Karma ever been born in Noxus?\n\nShe's always been Ionian","replies":[{"poster":"Jack0Alpha","date":"2018-04-13T03:33:56.683+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name= Król Wilk Sam,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=cXx0nG5A,comment-id=0005000000010000,timestamp=2018-04-13T03:31:55.308+0000)\n>\n> When has Karma ever been born in Noxus?\n> \n> She&#x27;s always been Ionian\n\nAm talking about riven","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"M00ndanc3","date":"2018-04-13T03:33:22.475+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"ok would you call kayne or urgot noxian since thats where there from but not where there story ended, as with xin zhao being demacian even though he was born in ionia.","replies":[{"poster":"Margrabia","date":"2018-04-13T08:10:40.145+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"Just because mouse decided to live in the stables it doesn't mean it is now a horse.","replies":[{"poster":"M00ndanc3","date":"2018-04-13T13:18:27.674+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"As smart as that sounds.

We're not trying to look to read a novel, or an anthology on the champion - we just want everything essential in the bio itself. All the other things, like the flavor story, videos like you did with Varus, splash images, etc, should expand a little and supplement the bios. They should never have information that the bio does not, unless it's something that expands on the narrative, like maybe going into detail on Kataraina's and Cassiopeia's mother or something that's not critical to understanding the core motivations and backstory of a character.\n\nThe bios SHOULD NOT be half narratives on a character that only give us a painting on them as they were. Bios should tell us who they were and what started their path, but_ ultimately should tell us who they are now and how what happened to them led them to this point_.\nKarma is a prime example of this. It started us with who she was, and what began her on her path. But at the climax of her story, it kind of stopped. This is unacceptable for a character bio. They're still stories, and they should still follow the same pattern of storytelling, and the ending of character bios should leave us with the champion we know from the game. Karma's story left us with a conflicted woman trying to coddle the spirits in her head and make them love her again. It didn't leave us with the focused, driven woman who has managed to strike the balance between good and evil deeds, and enact philosophical understanding in order to find the best direction for her people to progress in. \n\nTry to correct this on future bios.

Since a fictional character is not something that exists materialistically, it's hard to define what this character is based on his/her sole existence, unlike you and me. You will always know what you are as long as \"you\" are here. So for the case of a fictional character, the inner soul (which can be embodied by the personality traits) defines what he or she is. If even his/her soul is taken away, I am not so sure what this character is.\"\n\n\"the new lore introduced an identity conflict to her old fans. Karma is no longer a woman in the current lore, but it is now a title of spirits. This title was given to the body of a 12 year-old girl named Darha in the current lore. Worse still, Darha and the spirit Karma (which is actually a mixture of past life memories) fought for the control of the body. This identity conflict is confusing to fans. Who is Karma now? Is she still the woman we love? Or is she a voice in somebody's head? Or is she Darha...maybe? When this identity conflict brings nothing but confusion, I can't see the necessity to include this in the story. Karma can simply be a person who has the ability of reincarnation. She lives different lives over the years and gains wisdom from past experience. She can enjoy a completely new life in every incarnation, starting from a little baby. It's not necessary for the writer to force her to borrow the body from other children. Being a single entity can strengthen her characterization as \"Karma\", the soul that was brought to life by the old narrative team.\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vanjie","date":"2018-04-13T03:32:04.591+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"I really appreciate you taking the time to communicate about the new Karma bio. It's horrible that it took so much hate, backlash, threads and passion to get you guys to make change. It's a shame that in 2018 the community that supports your game, has to force Developers to make changes on a champion that had so much taken from her already. The track record with every single Development team that does work on Karma has not been good. The reason be is they take everything that made her unique and interesting and put it on Ivern, Irelia, or a new champion that will have something she had. This is the work ethic you and past Developers created for yourselves and didn't rectify for the past 5 years. I apologize if myself or any other Karma main hurts your feelings or makes you feel a certain way. None of us should be ashamed of what we said or did though. You had 5 years to do work on Karma and you spent it on champions like Ryze, Ahri, and Lux. Every single Developer spent the past 5 years working on popular champions as opposed to working on champions that really need attention.\n\nThis lore update for Karma was an opportunity for SOME Developer at Riot Games to show the Karma community that you cared about her. Instead you gave us the same transparent attitude and work ethic that almost every other Developer has been giving us the past 5 years. You took away her fans for a theme that isn't even present and represented well in her art, lore, kit and narrative. You took away her shield bomb and gave it to Ivern because you wanted a champion that sits in the back and builds shield enhancing items to be relevant in the game. You took away any status and grace Karma had and gave it to Irelia because you wanted Karma to be this character that does nothing, is no one, and is forgettable. Every single one of you Developers from different teams, really need to start making progress with Karma's issues. The Karma community has been patient, understanding, and passionate about a champion that was completely butchered for half-worked on content that is almost insulting. I mean Karma doesn't even have a running and shield casting animation and this is just one of her many problems that I know every single Developer is aware but refuses to actually work on or communicate about.\n\nThe problem Karma mains have with her goes far beyond just a bad lore change. You don't seem to care and you don't seem to listen. We want a fully conceptualized champion that deserves more than what every single Developer has been doing to her the past 5 years. It's really pathetic that in 2018 Lux gets VO additions to her but Karma cannot get a single thing that matches new art, a theme and narrative created for her. It's really pathetic that a champion like Cho that is slated for a VGU can get all of his abilities updated but Karma cannot get improvements to her abilities that show us some sort of flashy art or thematic that really brings it all together. It's extremely pathetic that Ahri can get massive kit changes done to her for 3 patch cycles but Karma can have her shield bomb removed and put on Ivern, a buff to her Mantra E that is later nerfed, and buffs to a passive on Mantra abilities that are bland and make no sense. So, tell other Development teams to start communicating about Karma, because Katey, Reav3 and Meddler said no one in house is communicating about her. Maybe it is high time that in the past 5 years you stop prioritizing work done for popular champion or champion that are slated for a VGU, and start working on champions that do not necessarily need a VGU to fix mistakes YOU CREATED.\n\n-----------\n\nNow to talk about the lore at hand. This transparent lore you seem be going on about better give us more than what we have now. Right now we have a champion that reflects how she is in game: bland and does nothing. I want to see Dharia's story, personality and adventures more. Even though she is Karma, this is Dharia's story and this is the perfect opportunity to show us more of a personality than this bland and boring character you created. Karma needs to do more than just sit in one spot and meditate all day. I want her to actually fight, use her abilities, and do something other than shield people in the back-line. You didn't do any of the above and look where it got you. We got a snippet of Dharia's personality and then it just went all away.\n\n- Thank you and good luck.\n\nMiss Vanjie.","replies":[]},{"poster":"murasakiyukari","date":"2018-04-13T12:18:49.258+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I liked her Rework concept at 2013.\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3197509\n\nI began a game after 2013.I was very glad to read this argument last year.But I think that the new story takes the present which they loaded Karma with then.\n\n・The Enlightened One does not bite.\nThe state that Darha contains an ancient soul is passive.\n\n・A description of twindragon disappeared.\nIt is very important that her appearance includes a symbol of Ionia.

I want to see her suffer, put myself right next to her and watch her dream nightmares. Being born with special powers is sooo meeeh (my opinion). I would rather picture this Lasting Altar as something that just appears holy, but actually  they are trying to preserve Karma and are kinda abusing their powers, feeding the child with thoughts so she carries some wisdom or something till she dies and then it happens again.
