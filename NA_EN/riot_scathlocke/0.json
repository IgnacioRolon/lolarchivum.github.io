Looking at the list of champions whose bios are feeling a little dated, we&#039;ve realized that [Nautilus, the Titan of the Depths](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/champion/nautilus/), deserves a backstory that better fits the modern world of Runeterra. We talked a lot about why and when we might choose to do this sort of update in our recent [Nexus article](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/02/narrative-in-2018/), if you would like more context there.\r\n\r\nBack when we added all the champion short bios to the League client in November, some of you expressed strong feelings or concerns that a retcon was approaching. We saw the pain that some Varus mains felt with his backstory changes at that time, so now we&#039;ve taken on stewardship of the lore and we are trying to give more visibility on the process, to make sure we get Nautilus right.\r\n\r\nWe don&#039;t just want to make changes. We want to make _improvements_. And that&#039;s where you come in.\r\n\r\nAs players, we really value your thoughts and feedback when it comes to his narrative. **We need you to tell us, what&#039;s most core to Nautilus as a character? What&#039;s most important to you about his story?**\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re going to read every single response, and we&#039;re going to let you guide our efforts. Don&#039;t get me wrong, some elements of his story _are_ going to change... but we want to make sure he&#039;s still the same champion that Nautilus mains love to play in League, and that the big guy&#039;s heart and soul still come through in the lore. While we&#039;ve done behind-the-scenes surveys in the past, we want to try a more visible (at the cost of maybe being more narrow/limited) poll. We won&#039;t necessarily do this every time... and even if we did, it would likely be done differently so it&#039;s not just NA Boards-goers answering...\r\n\r\nThat being said - what the heck, let&#039;s give this a shot! We want to do right by your champion - so, thank you for taking a few minutes to point us in the right direction :-)","replies":[{"poster":"Solo Josh","date":"2018-03-28T18:21:04.484+0000","up_votes":298,"down_votes":8,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Spacesuit Spiff","date":"2018-03-28T20:43:19.845+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":5,"body":"This.

Considering how Nautilus was once a brave sailor who was ultimately betrayed, he might play a role similar to Kalista in that he punishes men at sea who betray their fellow crewmen. \n\nAlso _how_ was Nautilus created?

Yet despite this, he keeps on going. Despite whatever corruption tainted him, he's still a man; a tired, broken man with nothing left but to keep moving forward. \n\nHe can't remember what the voyage was for. Were they mapping the seas? Searching for wreckage? He can't remember much of anything before he was dragged down into the depths. He remembers the moment when he was left to die, and everything went black.\n\nHow long he's been stuck in the depths, he isn't sure, but it can safely be considered at least several decades, if not centuries. He can't have revenge, as those who left him for dead are surely dead now themselves. He can't go back to his old life, as even if anyone who knew him was still alive, there's no going back after whatever has happened to him. He has nothing left, and despite this he keeps on going. I imagine that even he doesn't truly know why he hasn't given up.\n\nHe doesn't know what happened to him exactly. He can vaguely remember a massive creature as he sunk down into the abyss, but when he woke up he was alone. All he's found are twisted abominations appearing through rifts in the sea floor, and the occasional Vastayan who more often than not flee at the sight of him. He's tired, lonely, confused, and frustrated. But nevertheless, he continues his march. Perhaps he's searching for answers to what happened to him? Maybe he wants to find a way to return to the shores of his home? Perhaps he wants to avenge those who are abandoned by others to save themselves? Whatever the reason, despite the water pressure, the isolation, and the endless exhaustion, all that's certain is that Nautilus won't break.\n\nAfter some thought, a reason for why he is able to keep going is that he was saved by Nagakabouros, who demands for people to keep in motion at all times. Perhaps Nautilus was saved because his will to live was so great, that he was given another chance. Sadly, giant sea creatures who are worshiped as gods are not exactly experts on what constitutes an enjoyable existence for human beings. Thus, Nautilus' new lease on life is more a curse than a blessing. But even then, he keeps on moving, such is his will to survive.\n\nSide note: I remember the lore snippet that was posted for him, that he was a servant of Nagakabouros who'd sink ships, and I took this as what people thought he was, not what he actually was.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2018-03-28T18:46:28.658+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":1,"body":"I loved the fact naut wasnât portrayed as a cruel person.

And while he may have fallen from grace in recent years in terms of popularity in game, I still uphold his small amount of character as one of my favorite parts about this game. So, let me begin with some questions and my explanations of what I think the answers are at the moment:\n\n**What is Nautilus?**\nBefore his entrapment in the metal coffin called a deep diving suit, I imagined Nautilus was already a massive, hulking specimen of a man. I also imagine he was a sailor, just as he was in his old lore. He sailed the more dangerous and unexplored parts of the world to discover the undiscovered and make known the unknown. I like to think that while he was a popular and well respected man on his ship, he was most certainly not the captain or even first mate. Given the fact that in his old lore he was the only one brave enough to don the suit and explore the black ooze, I believe it should at least be briefly mentioned that Nautilus is (or rather was) a well accomplished diver. Moving into what he is post-suit melding, I definitely want that part to be kept a mystery. It is obvious that whatever pulled him to the depths or alternatively saved him from it is supernatural in nature, and yet supernatural beings are never truly benign. Whatever happened to Nautilus, he is not fully human anymore. The thing that grabbed him in the ocean may have kept him from completely dying, but it did not keep him fully alive either. But I think that is all we should receive in terms of his current state of being. He's a huge metal monster now, with sea life growing from his various openings, glowing light coming from his rust covered joints, and a facial view port of pure impenetrable blackness with naught but two blazing red eyes looking out. He should have an air of mystery, something for the people on the shore to latch on to and make legends about. He should be a story on a similar level to other supernatural beings in the area of Bilgewater, like the tale of the River King. Whatever is hiding beneath the suit is no longer human, but nobody will ever know exactly what he is anymore. Even Nautilus himself.\n\n**What is Nautilus' Character?**\nAssuming we keep the base elements of his old lore along with his new one Nautilus, when he needed the help of his friends most, was betrayed by those he held closest and was condemned to the black ocean depths. For their cowardice, their sheer unwillingness to help someone truly in need, those sailors need to pay. Pay in the same way Nautilus had, cursed to spend an eternity in the depths of the ocean eternally searching for a life they can never get back. His sheer contempt for those who left him to die should never waver and one of his sole motivations should be to avenge himself upon those he called friends. However his rage should not be a white hot fire, but rather a bottomless abyss of cold fury. Nautilus' voicelines are few but some of the best in the League in my opinion as they really show his hatred without making him seem ludicrous or out of his mind. Nautilus lost everything on the day of his death(?) and remembers almost nothing of his previous life, but the one thing that still burns in his memory, the one thing that he can remember even if it is faint is the betrayal. His comic says it best I think: \"I remember it like a dream... They left me to die. But I survived.\" His never ending quest to destroy those who wronged him should preoccupy the majority of his thoughts, but he can't remember the way back. The sea is an unbelievably massive place and if Nautilus can barely remember what the shore looked like, what chance does he have of finding it again? So he marches. He marches endlessly. And that should be another facet of his personality. The only moments he is driven to action is when he is driven to anger, when he is driven to remember how he died. But those moments should be few and far between. Otherwise Nautilus should just pick a direction and start walking in hopes that he finds the original shore he came from. He is slow, massive, and heavy. His steps are weighed down by the crushing pressure of the deep ocean and yet he continues on regardless. He is a part of the water now, something it or perhaps something inside of it can use as an extension of itself. But I will get to that later. In his quiet moments, Nautilus in game seems to speak to himself about various things. He either attempts to remind himself of why he continues to march everlastingly or states mysterious lines about the abyss. \"_Do you hear them calling?_\" \"_Echoes from the deep._\" \"_The tide ebbs_\". Nautilus appears to know something about the abyss, of something hiding in wait there. However I believe it comes off as something he didn't learn through reading or other such forms of knowledge but rather through having the information directly granted to him from some other means. He knows of what hides in the abyss, because he is a part of it. However unlike the human characters with glimpses of the Void or Nami's people vaguely knowing of what hides in the darkness, Nautilus does not fear whatever lurks in the undersea shadows. He seems to know they either cannot or will not hurt him. But he can still hear them, their whispers in the dark. Voices from far way away, echoes that talk to him in these moments of silence. Something is waiting deep below the ocean's surface, and Nautilus knows full well what it is. The question is whether he truly cares about it or not. That leads me to bring up another important point about Nautilus' character, and that is that I do not believe he should be evil. If anything Nautilus seems more like a force of nature now. Yes he still feels hatred for those who damned him but he doesn't hate all life. There is a story of Nautilus alone fending off a good portion of the Harrowing one year as it attempted to harvest the souls of Bilgewater. I believe that while perhaps he doesn't care about the individual people on shore or on the ships that sail the seas he also does not wish them harm or death. That is unless he has even a slight suspicion that those ships or shores house even a single member of his former crew, in which case he unleashes his pure rage and drags them to the depths with his great anchor. The guilty must be punished. \"_All will drown_\".\n\n**Nautilus' Anchor**\nI shall make this section a bit briefer that the others. I believe Nautilus' anchor should continue to hold a large place in his lore. It is the only tangible connection to his former life and also a constant reminder of why he is where he is. It not only serves as a physical and mental force but also a metaphorical one. To use another one of his quotes (albeit a joke one), \"_Sometimes I think this anchor just weighs me down_\". The anchor is physically heavy obviously, but the weight should also be a metaphor for Nautilus' hatred and anger. They weigh him down. They continue to trap him in his current life and state of mind. His anger may be the only thing keeping him alive, but is that necessarily a good thing? Nautilus knows he isn't a man anymore and he also knows what lies in the dark crevices of the deep ocean. He is cursed to forever hunt for those he may very well never catch. So what is the point of living? If he were to just let go of his anger, his anchor, maybe he wouldn't be weighed down anymore. Maybe he could even float. Float to a rest he has rightfully deserved for some time now.\n\n**Nautilus' Connection to the Real World and Other In-Game Entities**\nIt is no secret that with the addition of a new god-like entity near Bilgewater's seas comes a host of new possibilities involving said entity. It is entirely possible that it was Nagakabouros who \"saved\" Nautilus' life (or was even the one to doom him to it). Perhaps Nautilus knows that this being was the possible cause of his death, although I think in his current state Nautilus more so blames the sailors who wrenched his grip free from the sides of the boat then the thing that actually pulled him into the water. Perhaps Nagakabouros has put Nautilus into servitude after it rescued him, with him acting as her vengeful spirit of the sea that drags evil sailors to their deaths. Or so the legends go. Perhaps Nagakabouros is using Nautilus as a way to combat the spreading dangers of the Shadow Isles or the evils that lie in the dark abyss of the ocean. Or maybe Nagakabouros IS the evil that lies in the dark abyss of the ocean. If that were the case, then I could segue into the connection I think Nagakabouros and by extension Nautilus himself has with another author's work: H.P. Lovecraft. An ancient entity that is connected to a port town and has a cult following in said port town that states that the entity it worships is all powerful strikes me more than a little of A Shadow Over Innsmouth and the Deep Ones as a whole. While I do not believe Nagakabouros is nearly as malicious as the human sacrifice devouring Deep Ones, parallels do exist. However again, I must state that I believe Nautilus should remain a relative mystery in terms of what we know about him and that should extend to Nagakabouros. Perhaps Nautilus knows what Nagakabouros actually is or perhaps he doesn't. I think in the end it doesn't really matter to him.\n\nThat's the whole post. A bit long winded if I do say so myself but I am glad I caught this post early on so I could post my thoughts before the thread is drowned in a flood of replies. I am very very happy you guys are taking feedback from the community and I have complete faith that you guys will make Nautilus even bigger and even better than he was before. Keep up the good work and I'm counting on you.

GP, after becoming the pirate king of Bilgewater, became complacent, which is why Illaoi dumped him. Despite having \"reached his destiny\", so to speak, he had stagnated.\n\nI don't imagine GP enjoys working from the shadows in order to restore his lost power, but it's what he has to do to achieve his new goal, and Illaoi supports that. Likewise, even if Nautilus feels burdened, he is still working towards his goal of finding those who betrayed him.","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2018-03-28T20:42:57.429+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":6,"body":"I would have thought that \"reaching your destiny\" implies reaching your goals anyway.

A minor quibble over words? Perhaps, but every word has connotations that should not be ignored, especially in a narrative context.\n\nNautilus's goal is to find those who wronged him, and I don't feel like that is a task Nagakabouros itself would have set him on; rather, it's a mission he's chosen to undertake himself. Assuming Nagakabouros is responsible for Naut's empowerment/resurrection/whatever you want to call it, I feel like it would be because it was impressed with Naut's sheer will and drive to live, even in the face of all being lost, not because it has some task that it is forcing Naut into.\n\nI really like MM's proposed character arc for him as well, where he moves past this desire for vengeance and leaves it behind, in an effort to reconnect with his humanity yet still remains just as strong and willful to live.

[It details all the Harrowing events that took place around Bilgewater.](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/special-event/first-light-after-harrowing) What's interesting here is that Nautilus apparently helped fight off the Black Mist once. This is actually an awesome piece of information and I hope that it is somehow preserved in his new lore. It implies that Nautilus, mysterious as he might be, is some kind of defender, who will come to the aid of Bilgewater in times of need. And although people might see him as being big and scary, he might actually be serving a greater purpose that none are aware of. It also kinda fits with the way I play him (support).\n\nFor a short story, I just have this idea of a sailor that's fishing out at see, when suddenly an iron titan emerges from the depths, knocking over his boat. The sailor thinks he's doomed, but suddenly notices that the titan is just walking forward, completely ignoring him. Suddenly a huge sea serpent appears and the sailor witnesses the two colossi engage in an epic fight. After a long brawl the titan finally lands the killing blow, and all is silent for a few minutes. Then the titan suddenly turns his head and shines his red eyes on the sailor. The sailor swims back to Bilgewater as fast as he can. By the time he dares to look back, the titan has vanished. Nobody in Bilgewater ever believes the tale he tells of the gigantic battle he witnessed.\n\nThis implies that 1: Nautilus is super scary when he's coming for you, 2: He appears to be some kind of guardian, though we can only guess what he is guarding and 3: His exact nature and purpose remain a mystery. Those are the three things that I personally would like to see in his new lore. But these are just my thoughts, I'm sure that whatever you guys come up with will be awesome :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2018-03-28T19:20:16.305+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"The core of Nautilus, for me at least, is the story of a man now monster that perseveres in spite of his transformation. It's a common theme in fiction, humans transformed, and frequently it is done as an allegory for corruption or a metaphor detailing how a person's external features come to reflect the internal truth. Nautilus' circumstances aren't nearly so didactic because his story is about coping with the physicality of his transformation and its impact on his mind; he's lost, without a hint of where to turn.\n\n> The awakened, the enlightened man says: I am body entirely, and nothing beside; and soul is only a word for something in the body. Your body is a great intelligence... Your little intelligence, brother, which you call \"spirit\", is also an instrument of your body, a little instrument and toy of your great intelligence.\n\n> -- Friedrich Nietzsche\n\nNautilus is a monster, a living titan transformed against his will, his character and history eroded little by little through the sinister ebb and flow of time. His loss, among League's champions, is the most personal all: the loss of identity. What's worse, in his current state he cannot reclaim the life he had even if it was rediscovered. In spite of it all, Nautilus is always moving forward, searching for the truth.\n\nMore than his monumental stature or titanic might, a relentless will is his greatest strength, his spirit. It's different from Diana, who wishes to validate her belief in the moon, or Syndra's need to assert herself as sovereign of her own body, or even Warwick's continued struggle with the beastial nature imposed on him. Nautilus struggles against the abyss, both in his mind and beneath the waves. It's an incredibly intimate and terrifying conflict. If you've ever known someone with dementia and witnessed their fleeting moments of lucid memory, you understand just how frightening the ordeal is. And in my opinion, that is the crux of his character. He recognizes his own faltering identity, but keeps pushing forward, always marching.\n\nNautilus will never stop, and god help the poor souls that get in his way.\n\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/a/a7/Nautilus_Comic.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120209115547","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-03-28T18:28:16.810+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":5,"body":"I would like to keep him human, (at least a former human, maybe he mutated or something) as his original lore says, a human betrayed who wants revenge\n\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/4/44/Nautilus.move8.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20120616030109\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/7/7e/Nautilus.attack1.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20120616030049","replies":[]},{"poster":"MalrothDragonia","date":"2018-03-28T18:30:53.478+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Things that stick out to me as being 'Naut-like':\nSlow, but with a sense of impending,\ncrushing weight to him.\n\nSomething like an Ent, a primal force taken mysterious shape, slow moving but powerful.\n\nTied to large and ancient mysteries.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-03-28T18:33:32.658+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like an Ent of the sea?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CleverCactus","date":"2018-03-28T18:50:51.949+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me, Nautilus character and his lore worked together in a kind of metaphor.

Note: I typically play him supp or jg. His title \"Titan of the Depths\" is true to his play style in that you feel unstoppable as you trudge towards enemy laners pinning them down with the weight of your anchor and dragging them back into the depths of the fray as they run. He has a looming presence that once you see him their is no escape. With that being said his lore as of now doesn't really depict that and none of his quotes speak the lore either really. For example \"I will have vengeance\", \"Lost and Forgotten\" and \"Do you hear them calling\" are all very notable quotes from nautilus but the lore doesn't speak to these other than the crew cutting him off the boat. I also very much like the comment from Rakejo as lovecraftian aspects would fit nautilus exremely well. Here's an example short story from and aspect point other than nautilus's that could be adapted in any way but sent chills down my spine when I was writing it (in which a nautilus story should do seeing as he's very mysterious) as well as fits his quotes well. Sorry its so long but I've thought about nautilus's lore before quite a bit and thought about changes that could enhance it by a ton and this is the best way to get them all out without a boring list that doesn't really show the enhancements possible:\n\n\"I'd been floating for I don't know how many days before a passing ship found me. I was pulled up out of the water, sunburned on every inch of exposed skin and some areas where lesions had began to appear where the water, along with advantageous fish, had eaten away. The crew and captain asked many times where the rest of my crew was and what happened. The first of these I could answer easily, \"Dead\". The second.......the second I'm not entirely sure; the only thing i could tell them before passing out was, \"He came searching\". \nFLASHBACK. \nI am only 16, grew up in bilgewater with my mother, never knew my father, and only had one dream.....getting out of this hellhole. But the only way to do that was to join up with a ship or try not to die in the streets stealing or joining a gang. I chose the obvious of the two and joined up with a mining ship. We had always heard the stories, mainly to keep new ship-hands in order and to make sure no mutinies arose. \"If ye turn on your mates, the diver will come\". An old urban legend about some crew who were out exploring and ran into a mysterious liquid in the water. \nSTORY TIME.\nOnly one man of the crew was brave enough to venture into it using an old diving suit. The mysterious liquid grabbed him as soon as his foot touched the sea top. He begged the rest of his crew, all now too scared to move, to pull him back on board. The crew, too terrified to help their mate, banded together......to wedge him off the ship. They began to cut the supports to the diving suit along with the air pipe. The man begged and pleaded but to no avail. With a loud snap the remainder of the uncut pipe and supports broke free and the diver began sicking into the depths, the ooze creeping up his suit as more of him sank. With a last desperate attempt he grabbed the anchor but the ooze wasn't letting go. Once the screaming stopped the crew aboard sat back away from the railings for a time before they finally found the courage to see if it was over. As they peered over the deck the ooze was nowhere to be found.....along with the diver and along the side of the ship they noticed deep gashes and scratch marks that looked like metal rubbed against metal repeatedly. But the most interesting, or troubling thing, was that the anchor was no longer there. The only thing left was a chain with the link at the separation point bent entirely out and no longer an O but more a J.  They vowed to never speak of this to anyone and once they arrived on shore split any earnings and went their separate ways. Or at least that't how the story went. \nBACK TO REALITY\nThe story was far from the truth. The waters were choppy and the sky was darkening, odd considering the entire week had been clear with little to no cloud coverage and no signs of a storm. I was swabbing the deck when it happened. There was an enormous clang sound as the wooden bow deck split into a hundred pieces, sending splinters and any crew that had been standing there either into the railings or overboard. The force of the unknown impact from below had made the entire ship rock backwards, sending me on my ass into a railing and the supplies that were once organized neatly were now strewn about the deck and some over the railings. I looked around as to what had just happened when I suddenly noticed in the center of the ship a large, rusted, anchor just sitting there. I stared at it for an eternity until something moved.....a large metal gauntlet came out from behind the anchor, grabbing onto the point of the enormous thing. I could hear metal scrapping upon metal as if something was lifting up from the center of our bow....and that is when I saw it. An enormous metal diving helmet rose out of the hole. Then followed the rest of the suit. Where there was any rubber between the joints of the suit was now a pitch black ooze, that seemed to seethe in and out of the joints. And seated in the middle of the helmet were two large orange eyes that seemed to be scanning the deck, back and fourth, back and fourth. They looked like two dim suns in the middle of a universe without stars. I hadn't even noticed until now that other crew members were looking upon it, some stunned in silence while others began to let out wails, begging for mercy. It just stood there, when suddenly i was pushed aside by a leg of another crew member who drew a pistol from under his coat. He pointed it at the thing for what seemed like an eternity. I watched his eyes scan the monster, his pupils constricted into pinpoints, his teeth firmly pressed against another as his jaw looked rock solid. Then he lowered his pistol from the creature and slightly to the left of it.........i had completely forgotten but I now understood his intention, as we were a mining ship and the one thing all mining ships have........explosives. As soon as a i comprehended what was being aimed at the monster exploded, splinters passed by my head (one cutting a deep gash across my cheek). I looked in awe where a huge smoke cloud now stood where the monster had just been. The crew member, who seemed to be slightly more relaxed looked down at me, and smiled (something rare among sailors who weren't drunk off their ass)and I heard cheering from other sailors who looked on. \"Well kid, I think we're in the cl------\". Where the sailor had just been was now now a pair of crumpled legs with half a torso and a chain that stretched from the cloud of smoke to the rear of the ship. In the side of the ship center cabin was what looked like a ravine of wood and metal, i snapped back to reality once i heard the chain make a clanking sound and began to be pulled back into the cloud. Some of the crew began to scream out in terror as others just closed up entirely, their minds broken by the situation. The rest of the anchor was being pulled back from the rest of the ship, i watched as it inched closer and closer to me, tearing at wood and metal alike as if you were pulling a knife through butter. It edged towards me but I was just outside of it, clinging to the railing. Blood splattered the front of the rusted anchor and a scrap of the sailors clothing who had just been standing next to me was draped over an arm of the anchor. I looked back to the smoke cloud from which it was being pulled and saw two arms reaching in and out of the now dissipating smoke cloud, as they reeled their anchor back in to the now visible hulking behemoth who shouldered the anchor with ease. He then began walking across the deck towards a crew member, with each step I could hear the already damaged deck creaking. He bent down over the crew member for what seemed like an eternity and then ripped a board out of the deck and placed it over the mans lap. As he stood up and began walking towards another of my mates I looked at the man he'd just been to. He was staring into space, head raised slightly, tears streaming down his cheeks. He made no noise but just sat there staring. The diving suit monster now finished with the second member, who now too was staring into space, was now walking towards another member who passed out as the monster got within two steps of him. The creature bent down and gently lifted his face upwards, turning it side to side. With another crunch he placed a board over the mans lap and began steadily walking towards me, his eyes staring straight ahead of him but not at me, over me. He stood over me and I saw his eyes begin shifting downwards until our eyes locked. He began bending down, his suit scraping against itself at the joints but was soon drowned out by........whispers. It sound as though whispers were being emanated from the great black void in the helmet as if the eyes themselves were talking to me. I couldn't make out any words being whispered withing the helmet but I could see the eyes shift slowly back and forth over my face as if it was looking for something, as though it was searching for someone. When it finished scanning its eyes locked again with mine, and for a split second it almost seemed human. It then reached down into the deck and ripped another board out. It placed it into my lap.....I now knew for what reason. I hadn't noticed before but the hole he had originally came out of was filled with water that was slowly spreading across the deck. The creature moved to the center of deck just next to the hole and stood there looking out across the sea, not moving an inch. The ship slowly sank and I began to float on the piece of deck he had placed onto my lap. I watched the creature until it disappeared in the dark depths below along with the rest of the ship and then passed out.\"\n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-03-29T02:32:17.947+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the old gods and the new...

Please take a momment to read my version and have some mercy, I am Spanish and although I am not bad at English, I am aware that there may be some failures. Even so I think it is quite readable. Here we go:\n\nThe dreadnought of the oceans known as Nautilus is caught between the world of the dead and the living at the service of Nagakabouros. Once a man, he had to live the first arrival of the Black Mist, and in spite of being just a humble sailor he was one of the last defenders standing, and the improvised leader due to his great bulk and strength.\nThe last battle took place on the beach, despite all the dead comrades the victory seemed to be now closer than ever. Brandishing an anchor as the only weapon, he dealt the final blow to the last evil creature that seemed to remain standing. They had won. The few surviving defenders allowed themselves to celebrate, they barely saw one another through the heavy fog, but it was already retreating. Indeed the victory seemed obvious, there were no more creatures left, but the vigorous man had also disappeared. The shouts of joy stopped.\nIn the middle of the confusion something had grabbed his leg, and now he was being dragged into the cold, dark depths of sea. As if he were a ship, he tried to grab the anchor to the ground, but it was useless. Even if it worked, the pressure was too much, if the anchor had caught, his arm would have been torn like a rag.\nHe was beginning to feel the pressure of the water on his body. the oxygen left his lungs with each hit on the ground, and was replaced by salt water. The cold covered him, and his squeezed leg burned with pain. And he closed his eyes, despite all the pain, he seemed to be entering a deep and delicate dream. The darkness whispered in his ear.\nSuddenly, an explosive greenish light took him out of his trance, he opened his eyes almost without remembering his situation. What he saw was a huge creature of titanic dimensions, from which the green light emanated, fighting against the mist itself.\nHis leg was free, he was not being dragged anymore. Instead, he was sinking into the depths of the abyss. He noticed something in his hand, the anchor was still there, he had not released it at any time. The colossal battle was disappearing from his sight, and he closed his eyes again, trying to remember the unintelligible words that the darkness had whispered to him, and he succumbed.\nWhen he awoke he hardly remembered anything of his previous life. The most intense memories belonged to the battle on the beach, to the colossal green beast, and to the terrible mist. He had never been a religious man, but now he saw his new mission without any doubt. The bearded lady had saved him in exchange for a cost, he would exercise as his eternal knight, and defend the oceans of the perfid corruption.\nArmored and and with the heavy anchor in his hand he would fulfill his mission, and would have his revenge: he would end the Black Mist, even if this meant sinking in the depths the whole Shadow Isles.\n\nWith this version he keeps being the the mysterious titan of the depths that we all love. He may seem like a bad guy, be he is definitely not. He acts more as a legend of Bilgewater, although some elders claim to have seen him.\nHis voiceover will not be outdated, as he is obsessed with vengeance, against the Shadow Isles now, but he could use some new lines about Nagakabouros and the Black Mist :P\nI hope you enjoyed it, I did not think that I would extend so much.\n\n\"DRAAG THEM DOOWN\"  {{champion:111}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"6FlagsFunnelCake","date":"2018-03-28T18:39:01.008+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Aside from the obvious things that most Nautilus fans definetly want to keep, I personally like how the retcon connects him with the rest of Bilgewater by giving him some connection to The Bearded Lady, some**thing** else that whispers of the depths other than Illaoi","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thermal Kitten","date":"2018-03-30T21:05:15.504+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi All, \nIt's been really great reading all these posts.

Even in the few lines that we have, you see in his torpid speech the kind of lost, hazy reflections of that man who was drug down with lines that give feelings of resignation, [burden](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/4/4c/Nautilus.move3.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20120616030051),  [nostalgia](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/4/44/Nautilus.move8.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20120616030109), resentment, yet some succumbing acceptance of his fate, and his own, maybe indistinct, realization of his solitude.\n \n The man who was pulled in, a character, is what is shown and is figuratively influenced in the way the description of events matched.  Lost, forgotten, compelled to move forward, bearing the burden of the ocean, of the suit, of the trudge, hidden deep, but then surfaces, [where the man looks for what he was.](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/champion/nautilus/)\n\n  The dialogue is what players have to go on for Nautilius and it's the character, the reflection of what is left of the man, a full character, is what was there for players to attach to.  It would be a shame to lose Nautilus if he were to become just a means for mariner's revenge.\n\nAs for the Black Ooze, could it please, please, please be it's own thing for him.  Because people having their own stories makes the world of Runeterra feel like a world.  Have it be it's own thing, not some Darkin side effect this, or void thing whatever that, because having champions tied onto other characters makes it feel like champions are playing second fiddle in their own story.  Having things not exist separately makes what is supposed to feel like a vast world filled with possibilities feel like an apartment complex instead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skins Project","date":"2018-03-28T18:57:12.171+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm, I love this, lost titan feel he gives off.\n\nThat big hulking beast that doesn't notice you because honestly?
