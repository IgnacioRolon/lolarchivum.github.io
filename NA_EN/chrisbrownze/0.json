It's not a CHANCE anymore. It's guaranteed double damage or guaranteed 225% damage because {{item:3031}}. Once an adc completes a build with 100%crit you literally cant even get close to them. They will oneshot you.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-08-28T09:26:41.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It caps at 100%.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aredid","date":"2019-08-28T10:36:51.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe thats the reason they're called ADCs...\nAnd having 100% Crit chance means you have 4 crit items and usually you build boots before fullbuild. So yeah, they have dmg, but no resists, hp, lifesteal. Take basically any assassin and unless its Trist that kills you before you get into your spells range you're ok.\nThe only problem with crit is yas that doesnt need to waste 2 item slots with crit items and rather builds BT, mallet or sterak so he does more dmg and is also tanky.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2019-08-28T10:28:40.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It requires 4 items to get there.
