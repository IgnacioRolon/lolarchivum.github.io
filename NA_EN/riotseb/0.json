With the help of your feedback we made several changes to Karthus during his time on PBE, mostly centered on clarity but with a little swag mixed in for good measure. \r\n\r\nSome of you had expressed concern about losing Karthus’ abilities within each other due to color similarity, and internally we wanted to make sure players could tell the difference between abilities cast by friendly/enemy Karthuses (Karthi?). We decided to kill two Teemos with one axe by adding friendly and enemy team-color indicators to Karthus’ basic abilities, so they should be more distinguishable when you’ve got spells flying all over the screen. We’ve also done some optimization work on Defile, as it was originally a bit performance-heavy and visually noisy given how often it’s used. \r\n\r\nWe also saw some requests for global VO on Requiem; the main issue there is that Karthus’ R lines are pretty dang long so as to match the channel time, and long global VO could turn annoying very quickly when you’re hearing it (not to mention dying to it) every couple minutes. We definitely liked the idea though, so we added a global, evil laugh to Requiem that’ll crank up the feeling of impending doom no matter where your enemies are on the map. \r\n\r\nAs I’ve mentioned previously, we’re committed to following through on Champion Updates post-Live and making sure their foundations are solid. With Karthus, we’re keeping an eye on couple areas such as whether his frenetic casting causes VO overlap and whether his clearer Q effect results in the ol’ lich needing a bit more power.\r\n\r\n**Skarner**\r\n\r\nWe’ve been working on Skarner for a while now, and in addition to some of the gameplay updates we’ve discussed previously we also had time to flesh out his thematic through some art upgrades and a brand new passive.\r\n\r\nWhile continuing to avoid Skarner’s old gameplay problems, we’re looking to increase his power with more CC and stickiness as well as enable him to consistently bring value to his team even when behind.  To that end, Crystal Slash now grants Skarner stacking Movement Speed, and the scorpion is sporting a new passive that stacks on enemies every time he hits them with a spell – at 3 stacks, Skarner’s next attack applies bonus damage and a short stun. \r\n\r\nSkarner’s new passive obviously required some new VFX, and we decided to take the opportunity to roll together some other key art updates. In addition to the obligatory passive particle, Skarner has received a Texture Update as well as a touched-up shield particle on his W.\r\n\r\nIf you’d like to dig deeper into Skarner’s approaching update you can head on over to [his PBE thread](http://community.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/UNO0P9E2-skarner-pbe-feedbackbugs-thread). \r\n\r\n**Nidalee**\r\n\r\nWith her nuclear-tipped spears and incredible escapability, Nidalee's been a contentious champion for a long time, and we’ve been working on a Gameplay Update focused on toning down the frustration of playing against her and giving Nidalee players more diverse gameplay options and decision points. \r\n\r\nTo that end, we knew we wanted to reduce the damage potential of Javelin Toss as well as tone down Nidalee’s overall safety (especially in prolonged chases) and force her to balance escape potential against the ability to finish off opponents. Doing so gave us the opportunity to diversify her offensive arsenal and make Cougar form a more co-equal partner in Nidalee’s engagements – furthered by the fact that Cougar form is now available right from level 1. The defining feature of this update is a new ‘Hunt’ mechanic , which is applied by Nidalee’s human-form abilities and both increases her speed towards Hunted targets and provides additional options and power to her Cougar-form abilities. Along with some other changes, this mechanic links Nidalee's two forms into a more cohesive package and gives her the chance to feel incredibly agile and dangerous in her ability to close the distance and take an enemy down.\r\n\r\nHead over to the [Nidalee PBE thread](http://community.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/rr5Noh3H-nidalee-gameplay-update-feedbackbugs-thread) if you’d like to see the current specifics of her upcoming Gameplay Update.","replies":[{"poster":"Thales","date":"2014-06-04T00:34:53.431+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"With Karthus's Requiem voiceover, will he be able to hear his own lines globally?

If that strength of Karthus goes away, Riot will probably give him more appreciable power, as they say in the last line of the section on him in this very thread.

The idea with him was that he could get in, and as the game progressed, it went from hard to get in to easy to get in, and the enemy team took a lot out to stop Skarner from getting in or making him blow his ult on the wrong person. He was great for fighting teams with hyper carries because on the right engage he could either get the hyper carry killed real fast, or at least force them out of the fight solely on the fear of his stinger.\n\nYou (Riot) made this impossible with changes to his W, which therefore made him more squishy, made his early game worse, made his farming take longer, and essentially put him out of comission for any serious player, and this was done on purpose because for whatever reason, despite how poorly Skarner was represented, you didn't like his play pattern. So you purposely nerfed him to make him unviable, as you did with Eve, so that you could focus on remaking him while not worrying about balancing him.\n\nNow that you've completely remade his kit, you've admitted to failing on his remake, and have already started to remake the remake that you forced through anyway. Lets keep in mind that since you gutted and remade Skarner, you've also thoroughly changed the way the game is played, through champion nerfs and buffs, balancing of champions, items, etc.; What made Skarner good before, even in his original state, completely untouched, he would still be completely unviable right now, much for the same reason Nautilus is; building tanky early with mediocre base values does not give as much of an effect due to how bursty big name champs are right now, and their shields get eaten. You can't build early damage on them to give them threat during champions trying to break that shield by punishing them because they scale awfully. The more recent version of Skarner was on the right path in that at least if he was on a target with a shield, he could put out some damage in exchange for having his shield eaten. His major problem was that there was no longer a reliable slow, and even when landing an E, it did not allow him to capitalize on anything other than maybe landing an ult, but as soon as the ult was done, Skarner was back to bad.\n\nNow you're trying to fix him yet again by giving him a worse version of Braum's passive, and removing his damage across the board, as well as killing his scaling. So now he will have the exact same balance and play problems as before; he will not be able to build tanky due to bad base damage, and he can't fix it by getting an early DPS item because the options for early DPS items in the jungle will not scale on him at all, and just make fixing the squish issue take that much longer, item wise. You've lowered the cooldown on W, but that doesn't mean anything as part of (what I think) made Skarner was that landing auto attacks lowered the cooldown, and that has long since been removed. All you've done with that change is give a little of that cooldown time back, but we still can't itemize to scale the shield at all like Nautilus so without the ability to make that mediocre shield come up more frequently we are again, as always, back to square one.\n\nI get the overwhelming feeling that I'll not really ever get to seriously play Skarner again in ranked, and that's pretty disappointing. I also get the impression that that doesn't really matter to Riot, as the repeated 'focus' on Skarner is to ignore most of what made Skarner good and try to make us feel better that you've essentially taken the engine out of our Ferrari and put in one from a KIA, but you gave us power doors and windows and seat warmers and other funsies.\n\nPlease just accept that you've tried this iteration of Skarner, and that you've extremely failed this iteration of Skarner, and that you need to go back to the drawing board and wipe that shit clean. Start over.
