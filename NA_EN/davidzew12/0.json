The video bitrate also matters.\nThe best way to combat this is to lower the process priority, also I will look into pausing or even removing the process whilst in game.\n\nI've tested it on Win 7, 8 and 10. I managed to hook windows 8 so that the animation is fully behind the icons (special way rito), 7 and 10 for some reason the icons will be hidden but the animation will still act liek your normal desktop wallpaper. Although I know a work around and may implement it.","replies":[]}]}
