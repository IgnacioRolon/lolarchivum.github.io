Although, this time, I was unable to reconnect and was given low priority queue for 5 games, 20 minutes each, which is complete bullshit, seeing as how this problem was Riot's fault and not mine.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-13T21:06:14.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is continuing to degrade, if it was already having issues before.  While I'm down to take accountability when we screw something up, these issues are common because League is always online and caused by a network problem.  More specifically, your connection seems to be having a lot of problems reaching the game servers, blocking you from getting in promptly. \n\nMy suggestion here would be to run through every step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix up whatever is doing this, and get in-game.
