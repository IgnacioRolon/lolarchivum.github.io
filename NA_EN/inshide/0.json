Im gonna start by saying that i am an akali main with 68% winrate but everytime i am trying to get to my promos for silver 2 im losing because of my team.. Let&#039;s say so, i win i lose i win i lose again, and i am 100% sure that the problem isn&#039;t me, it&#039;s my teammates.. They can&#039;t cooperate, i mean last matchup i got an &quot;Miss Fortune{{champion:21}}  support&quot; and an &quot;Kha&#039;Zix{{champion:121}}  jungle without smite&quot; that did tilt me so bad, anyways i did play good early and had a positive score in late too, my farm wasn&#039;t that good but since i had to roam because my team being so bad with 0/.. i had no choices.. I tried to help them but nothing.. And after all of that they blame me cuz i didn&#039;t help them, and flame me for all the things i haven&#039;t done... Everytime it happens like that and i am stuck in Silver 3 because of this.. I mean last time i tried to get Silver 2 i got an Xin Zhao{{champion:5}}  adc that feed until 0/13.. So let&#039;s be serious, even if i try to carry the enemy always wins, cause of my teammates, they can&#039;t cooperate with me..I know maybe one of you will say that im blaming my teammates too much, but it is true, everytime i win toplane/midlane they lose their lane and blame me! So please understand me. (btw im very tilted atm).\r\n\r\n                I get to have trolls in mostly every game in ranked cause they get autofilled and they go trolling because they don&#039;t know to play support, if you know something and you can help me i&#039;ll appreciate it. :D","replies":[{"poster":"DrTeath","date":"2018-03-30T09:36:11.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just loose more and loose harder, wont take long to get out of silver.","replies":[{"poster":"Darknesss Black","date":"2018-08-03T14:30:01.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol this guy","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DW Diana","date":"2018-03-30T09:05:00.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know your pain dude but just keep at it. I'm a Malz main, try hard carrying on him since he got nerfed to the ground. All you need to do is find that 1 other person on your team who isn't feeding and play around him, or set up a bush next to your feeding adc so you can jump their adc when they come for the free kill. It's not easy, and I know it's frustrating but remember trolls and people having a bad game are different things and keep at it =)\n\nThe only other suggestion I could give is try playing something that can hard carry and also be useful when behind. I played diana last season and gave up after dropping to s5 because no matter how well I could delete their carries, my team still found a way to lose a 4v2 lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Humble Aatrox","date":"2018-03-30T07:24:19.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:19}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:1}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2018-03-30T07:11:07.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Work on your farming, even when you need to roam a lot you shouldn't fall behind on gold.\n\nOther than that just grind out games.
