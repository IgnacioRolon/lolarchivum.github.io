I, too, have random FPS lag now after the latest patch. My ping is constantly below 60 ms but after the patch 7.14 there are FPS issues. Most of it is based around animations. I have updated my drivers and repaired my game files. This lag never used to happen but now it is occurring. You can see several other people have posted about this new issue arising from the latest patch, can you please address this sincerely?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Liquid and 4th","date":"2017-07-14T17:43:06.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually do have the same problem after patch 7.14\n\nLeague client suddenly used a lot more cpu and memory in game which cause lag and stuff like that. \n\nIn game video setting is always the lowest, it just started to happen after 7.14 update","replies":[]}]}
