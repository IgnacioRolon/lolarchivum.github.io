I've had this issue for a while, but i've just learned to live with it, because it hasn't been so bad, but lately it's become crippling. There are certain matches i cant even bear to finish, and some games it only happens 1-2 times, it is so inconsistent, i really need some help. I should also say i only have this problem in online games, my internet works fine otherwise and i have a wired connection, ethernet, and as you can see i have around 30 ping the entire time, and everyone else is walking around like normal, it's so strange. I've linked to a video showing my issue, there is also 2 clips from CS:GO there because i have this issue there as well, but feel free to skip that part. \r\nI would really, really appreciate any help, this is driving me crazy. Thank you so much in advance","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-27T22:18:22.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This looks like the direct result of packet loss on the way to the server.
