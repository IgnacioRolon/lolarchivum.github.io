It patches fine, it opens the launcher, and then when I log in it fails to connect and closes the launcher.\n\nIn that time i tried everything: I resynched the comps clock, I changed my DNS settings, I disabled every possible anti-malware/ firewall that may interfere, I repaired the files, I even reinstalled. \n\nThe only thing that worked was downloading hotspot shield.\n\nUnfortunately when i try and play now I'm getting the bugsplat error and a message telling me I need to disable 3rd party applications. How do I fix this? What Riot god must I pray too?\n\n**TLDR; stopped being able to connect  to PVP.net hotspot shield offered a fix it worked for a few days, and now i'm being flagged for 3rd party applications. what do?**\n\n**EDIT: Now when using hotspot shield I get a bug splat error telling me to disable 3rd party apps**","replies":[{"poster":"MrKennedy","date":"2016-07-19T09:55:27.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately I did all of that before posting this to the forums.
