(not what i thought it was)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings League of Legends Staff!\r\n\r\nI bought the 10$ chaos bundle and eventually got the Border and Icon for Nightbringer Yasuo, and I didn't realize that the border ONLY worked on Nightbringer Yasuo, I thought it was just a border available to you if you had that and it would be seen on every champion, not just Yasuo with that specific skin.\r\n\r\nSo, I want to kindly ask the League of Legends Staff if I could get a refund on it, I dont have any refunds available on my account and I was wondering if I could get a refund just on the tokens not the money.\r\n\r\nUnless I'm mistaken and it's just bugging out, and I can't see the border (I'm still not 100% sure about it), I would like a refund.\r\n\r\nKindly,\r\nOne of your loyal players.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-16T03:34:39.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That border is meant for the Nightbringer Yasuo skin only. I'm not 100% sure about refunds on the tokens, since they're already been spent and you don't have refund tokens left. I definitely don't want to steer you wrong though, so I'd reach out to the experts on our billing team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They'll be able to go over what happened, and let you know what they can do to help!","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme NA","date":"2017-06-16T03:42:45.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, Thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}
