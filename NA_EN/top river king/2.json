For example, I've played a grand total of 120 matches with Ekko, tied for fourth most of all the champions I've played, and I'm still learning. That's also partly because he's weak now (except for in the most skilled hands) and I hadn't played him in normals in months before this week... but the point still stands.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2015-11-29T05:54:39.215+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me, a main is a champion that you can always fall back on and will usually do well in the role you play them in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Tsundere","date":"2015-11-29T04:55:09.876+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have 500+ games on Thresh.

Though I don't base it solely upon games played, as some champions I'm just newer to, and others I tried in vain to succeed with for way too long.\n\nFor example, I have 120 matches with Azir, which ties Ekko for fourth most. I think of Ekko as a sort of \"main,\" as I've played him top, jungle, mid, support, love his kit, and feel he's one of the funnest champions in the game. But I only played Azir that much because I wanted desperately to pull off the sort of stuff high-level Azir players can, and because I found his kit fun enough to carry on despite things never quite clicking.\n\nThen there are champions like Lulu, who I just picked up recently, and only have 44 matches with, but who I intend to spam in ranked whenever the new teambuilder and client go live. I'm a support main, and her, Tahm, and Nautilus are practically the only supports I play, especially in ranked. So I'd consider her a \"main,\" or at least a champion who's for sure gonna become a main.\n\nBut those 44 matches on Lulu, and definitely those 120 on Azir, are more than most have on their supposed \"mains.\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XinZhao2WinNhao","date":"2015-11-29T22:37:30.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main Akali. 300 games so far, 24.2 kills per game average.\n\nbest Akali ever on all of the servers","replies":[]},{"poster":"kasfas","date":"2015-11-29T21:40:05.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spamming =/= maining, but correlation also =/= causation, meaning I may spam a champion for a while, to find their ins and outs, the play them a bit more loosely, like with poppy right now. \n\nMaiming a champion means to me that you always play that champion come need or buff, because you enjoy their kit.

Some people think you can only have 1 main but i think this is wrong, i think you can have several main for each position, one for different situations that you always fall back to.

Some don't like being tied down to a small number of champions because they find it boring.\n\nI, on the other hand, have played 597 matches with Garen, by far the most I've played with anyone, with second place being a measly 139 (Tahm Kench). And I average 181 with my top 7, and 112.5 if you don't include the outlier (Garen). Only two other champions even surpass 50 matches. Honestly, before I could play Garen every match and never get tired of him, and now I could do the same with Tahm. You, on the other hand, probably would be bored with that.","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2015-11-29T05:56:20.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm...
