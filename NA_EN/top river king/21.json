Either we have some semblance of a team and win (or at least have a fighting chance) or we are a team in shambles, running around aimlessly. Tonight provides a perfect example of these two extremes. One match is over in 20 minutes. 32 kills to 5, 9 towers to 0, 1 dragon to 0. A 17.3K gold lead. The following match, we lose with a 10K deficit, 1 tower to 10, 1 dragon to 2, 0 barons to 1. It was even at the start, with top and mid winning lane, and Vi 1/0/4, but bot struggling due to Vayne being up a couple kills and her entire team pitching a tent down bot. Our lane didn't exist to Vi, as she never showed up to help, even before things got out of hand, despite our entire team begging her to and their entire team making it their mission to snowball bot lane. Vayne finished 12/3/8, so fed that all she needed was a couple autos to finish any of us off.\n\nSo, due to this, I desperately want **at least** one person to queue up with that I can rely upon. Sometimes all it takes is one person. Especially in bronze and silver, where you see stuff like teammates with no masteries (last match) or teammates feeding double digit kills in lane. All I know is, at this point, it couldn't hurt. ADC, jungle, top, mid, whatever. If you think I can rely upon you to, at the very least, not _lose_ the match for us, post here, send me a friend request, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"I Need Axe","date":"2016-02-09T05:35:18.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feel free to add me, I'm in bronze 2 trying to climb as well.
