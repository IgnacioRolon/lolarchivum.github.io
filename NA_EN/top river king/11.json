My teammates swapped roles, leaving our support at ADC with an ADC they had no ranked matches with. Bot alone fed the enemy team 24 of their 49 kills. Lucian dealt 4.5 times as much damage as Twitch and had a 140 CS and 4 level edge, finishing the match at level 17. Our only other halfway decent player, Ryze, was bashing our bot lane (and the rest of our team) all match. Said after the match that he's a plat smurf, but the account he told us was his plat main has played 18 matches with his \"smurf,\" and his \"smurf\" is stuck in silver 2 with a 50% winrate in 450 matches.\n\nBut some matches just aren't winnable, I tell myself as I queue up for another. Get a Vayne ADC and think about dodging again, because I never win with or against Vayne, but I don't. Our Vayne then AFKs the second she gets to lane and sits there, AFK at turret, until we hit 3 minutes and can take a remake vote. They vote 1-4 for the remake and I had to wait an additional 17 minutes (with Vayne never showing up) just to surrender. Apparently Poppy was friends with her and was told she'd \"BRB.\" (I reported Poppy, partly out of spite, and partly because her voting no helped her dodge the LP loss you get if you queued up with the leaver).\n\nAnd, in unrelated news, the Steelers got ass-blasted against the Eagles earlier today, making it just a terrible day all around. So... yeah. Who else wants to vent?","replies":[{"poster":"Hell Week","date":"2016-09-26T02:50:05.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bro you dont even want to know what im going thru right now, i cant even enjoy 1 simple match. life is fuckin hard right now, lets stay strong for our futures sake...not being able to enjoy my free time is just 1 little thing. nothing compared to the things im going through.","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2016-09-26T03:38:07.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're being sincere, I hope things improve for you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Emojay","date":"2016-09-26T02:30:40.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you ever heard of ILLOAI?

The only time I can imagine him being tilting is in URF. I've rolled him twice in ARURF and am a combined 38/6/14. No stopping the beyblade. Someone tried to trade me Tahm Kench for Garen the second time around and I noped them fast as I could, and not just because TK is the literal worst in URF. I said it was thoughtful of them, but you don't give up Garen in URF, not when he was your first main and still your second most played champ since you started playing the game.","replies":[]}]}]}
