He hasn&#039;t even approached 50% (49.32% and 48.72%) since patch 6.22, and that was only for one patch. Even pros, per Probuilds, only hover at 50%. According to OP.GG, sorted by the last 7 days, it&#039;s not until you reach Master and Challenger that he surpasses 50%, and that&#039;s with only somewhere in the ballpark of 100 matches played, meaning not much of a sample size.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, he&#039;s so underplayed that Champion.GG cannot even populate a most common or highest winrate build for top lane. OP.GG is much the same, with the most common runes and mastery pages being used by something like a couple dozen people, according to the site.\r\n\r\nThen there&#039;s the matter of his bugs and matters needing fixed. His W minion spit doesn&#039;t always apply splash damage (seems to be a result of the minion being too low prior to W). His W also needs a complete overhaul, allowing for use with target champions only (if I eat one more minion instead of an ally/even because it happened to be there at the wrong time), and with improved prioritization (yes, I wanted to eat full HP ally instead of low, 3 stack enemy). That&#039;s not including the many other bugs that pop up, like inactive Heimer turrets becoming temporarily invulnerable if eaten, the various ways he can eat buffs (ex. try to eat enemy standing next to one without 3 stacks), etc.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of all this, he seems to have become even more forgotten about than Aatrox, for instance. At least Riot admitted to Aatrox needing attention. Tahm Kench, on the other hand, hasn&#039;t received any balance changes, bug fixes, or been discussed since the work done on him on patch 6.13.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this radio silence is becoming an endless source of frustration for me, a Tahm Kench one trick. Can I at least get some confirmation he&#039;s being looked at for something?","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-01-17T14:35:42.692+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"they should really shift some power around in his kit \n\nmake his support a little more fair and buff his top lane \n\nmake tahm juggernaut again","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2017-01-17T14:45:02.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just don't want him thrown in that pile of champions that are kept down on purpose until their inevitable rework, but I fear he's already in it.

The only nerfs to his Q were to the width and range of the skill shot; that being said, it was never \"undodgeable\" prior to those nerfs.\n\nPlus, his slow at max rank, which I don't see having changed anywhere in his patch history, is 70% (starts at 30%). \n\nIn short, the hate for him, like the hate for most (ex. Poppy, whose winrate doesn't at all justify the recent circle jerk), is due in large part to hyperbole.","replies":[{"poster":"Hige","date":"2017-01-17T17:26:44.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"his Q damage wasn't really from his Q per se, the dmg added from his ult was the culprit here, this was heavily balanced towards late game which was a blessing.\n\nAs for it being undodgeable it used to have Xerath's Q width and the indicator was kind of broken if I remember correctly, there was no side stepping that tongue\n\nAnd the slow was never touched, yeah, but currently Tk's Q is so unrealiable that you're better off leveling his E and applying your stacks on melee range, back then you were able to level Q first since you had a lot of damage from level 6 onwards","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bellows","date":"2017-01-17T20:13:33.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skarner also needs a revert.

Downvoted for not understanding obvious bad champ. Korea high elo has less then 1% playrate with only a 49% winrate. Hes played completely differently than hes supposed to, hes not a juggernaut like they wanted him to be and he isnt fun at all anymore. It was an utter failure. he only has the winrate he has now, cause they didn't fix the original issue with him.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SplicketyLick","date":"2017-01-17T20:11:19.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2017-01-17T23:04:18.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Riot wanted to make it less a panic button when you're about to die from burst and more of a shield for poke.

You can occasionally Q, which used to be good before Warlords Bloodlust was reworked so that the ADC can just heal up off of minions. Hes not tanky enough to sit in their faces for 3 autos or 2 autos and a q and he brings no meaningful cc. You can't play him aggressive bottom lane because he will lose out on every trade. He desperately needs something to bring him back up to par as a support. The damage nerfs to his passive really hurt his ability to meaningfully apply damage, which would be fine if his utility wasn't on such a long cooldown. Everyone seems to forget that he can only lock down ONE target or save ONE ally within the span of a brawl. Maybe TWICE per teamfight. That is ALL that he does.\n\nHis devour gates him too much. Its got a 12 second cooldown and the majority of his kit revolves around him eating an enemy, eating an ally, or pulling off some tricks by spitting a minion at the enemy. I just wish there was some way to make him a more meaningful threat.\n\nHis early game is usually ok, but I've noticed that he falls off pretty damn hard mid to late game.","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2017-01-17T17:20:58.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone also seems to forget that he is hard countered by CC. If your team is CC heavy, he can't shield, meaning eating an ally or enemy is often a death sentence between that and the self slow. That's why I think his early game is weak: until he gets some items and levels, he can't stand up to much punishment.\n\nBut you're right about him having no lane presence. Most dodge the Q, and unless you get 1 auto and follow it up with flash+Q+AA, you're rarely gonna get 3 stacks on anyone Bot, at least not without getting kited and chunked.","replies":[]}]}]}
