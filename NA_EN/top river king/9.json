I'm sure if I accepted just anybody it'd be a lot easier, but I'm taking this team too seriously to do that. We had a top laner, but he left the team for another. We had a jungler, but he left the team for another. The only one who's stuck around, aside from my IRL friend (ADC), is our mid laner.\n\nAnyway, here's what I'm looking for in teammates:\n\n1.) EST. Or at least be able to routinely play after 8pm EST.\n2.) Able and willing to voice chat.\n3.) _**Not toxic. At all.**_\n4.) A sizable, diverse champion pool.\n\nSilver or above is preferred, but I'd be willing to consider a B1 or B2 if you prove yourself and/or work well with the rest of the team. Shoot me a friend request in game and/or post here with a link to your OP.GG, your desired role, and your champion pool.","replies":[]}
