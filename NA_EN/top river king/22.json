Matchmaking adjustments need toned down. Today I went Tahm top for the first time in TB. Rather than the matchmaking adjustments giving me weaker competition, we went up against two Plat 5s. Match before that? Faced a Plat 4. A couple matches before that? Faced a Plat 5 and Plat 3. In all of these matches, nobody on my teams ranked above Gold 5, and the overall MMR gap was sizable. What accounts for this? It would appear those Plats got matchmaking adjustments which matched them against primarily Silver (and low Gold) competition. Wanting to ease people into things with new champions is fine, but the matchmaking adjustments go above and beyond. I mean, even in matches where things are \"balanced,\" the matchmaking adjustment just results in you going against, and playing with, players who seem to you like utter morons. Either you get stomped or do the stomping, it seems. I personally don't learn anything from that, though I can see how it would be valuable to others. Still, it needs to be toned down.\r\n2.) As far as I can tell (and correct me if I'm wrong), you could play nothing but Garen top in draft pick, for example, yet still get a \"matchmaking adjustment\" because you've yet to play him in team builder. If that truly is the case, that too needs to be fixed.\r\n3.) Like with #1, I understand why normal and ranked MMR is different. But I think the two should be tied together more closely. I've seen people whose normal MMR was in range of mine (going based off the total match MMR for their most recent normals), yet whose ranked MMR was Plat. At the very least, matchmaking should take both into consideration. Maybe average the two out.\r\n4.) Lastly, I hope Riot does decide to eventually give us a separate MMR for each role after ranked team builder rolls out. They could even use that to provide players a \"matchmaking adjustment\" of sorts for when they play roles their MMR is significantly lower for. For example, ADC is by far my worst role.But say I get stuck going ADC for some reason. It could then match me up either against weaker competition, or (not sure if/how this would work) against other teams with people playing similarly out of position. Then, if I lose, I lose less LP, and if I win, I win more LP. Though your MMR gains and losses shouldn't be effected. This would help incentivize people to learn other roles.\r\n\r\n**P.S. Apparently talk about_ gameplay_... and_ balance_ doesn't belong on the gameplay and balance board, per Riot. That makes tons of sense.**","replies":[]}
