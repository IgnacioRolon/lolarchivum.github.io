I&#039;m personally waiting to get bronze 5 somehow, despite playing all my matches against golds and plats.\r\n\r\nRiot, if you want us to treat this as a replacement for normal draft, which you mean to do away with, I guess you&#039;re succeeding, because I can&#039;t take a clusterfuck like this as seriously as I would any other ranked mode.","replies":[{"poster":"ph1234k","date":"2016-11-29T00:13:42.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know they aren't getting rid of normal draft right?","replies":[{"poster":"x Kuro x","date":"2016-11-29T00:25:08.533+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"They already turned off normal draft in some regions... allegedly for fear that player numbers were not high enough to support both normal draft and flex.","replies":[{"poster":"ph1234k","date":"2016-11-29T01:21:54.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not for fear, for the fact that not enough players in those regions play Normal Draft.

Our goal is to offer the fewest number of queues that give unique experiences (so we can keep queues healthy) while keeping disruption low, and in all regions except NA/EUW/BR, normal draft had very low participation. In an ideal world, we’d like to retire normal draft in all regions.\"\n\nEDIT 2: \"We completely understand that some of you prefer Normal Draft. We also completely understand that some of you still miss old Teambuilder and would go back to it if you could. What we're trying to do is make Flex Ranked attractive enough to some players who preferred Normal Draft, while also improving Normal Blind so that those of you really don't want to venture into Flex can have a good experience there.\"\n\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/2016/11/red-post-collection-2016-ranked-season.html","replies":[{"poster":"ph1234k","date":"2016-11-29T01:18:26.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why does your edit not correct your statement?
