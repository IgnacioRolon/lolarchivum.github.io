I'm Arnold and Nasus was the guy cut down to his underpants. After I denied him farm and killed him twice top, he went mid, only for him and Riven to get baited by me into my team. Then I guess he decided to put as much distance between him and myself as possible, going bot lane instead. At this point, I looked at his build and all he had on him was this: {{item:1001}} {{item:3067}} . Dude wasn't even level 30, nor was his Ezreal mid, and his Draven went AFK at level 2. He finished 0/7/0 with only 1K more gold than the AFK Draven, the least damage on his team, 69 CS, and still just those two items. And, looking at his match history, he hadn't played in months, minus one bot match 2 days ago. Like my friend said, he probably just re-downloaded League looking to have some fun and I shit-stormed all over his parade. Don't know that I've ever felt more sympathy for an enemy than I do right now.\r\n\r\nHave you ever dumpstered someone so thoroughly that you couldn't help but feel bad about it afterwards?","replies":[{"poster":"Dark4Void","date":"2016-09-06T20:13:57.847+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Went 16/0/8 as Yasuo vs Galio few months ago and my team went 54 kills to enemy's 7 kills. Getting those early kills allowed me to roam and get my other lanes fed, by the end of the game my ADC was 2-3 shooting the enemy ADC lol. I kinda felt bad for him picking Galio vs a 60k+ mastery Yasuo","replies":[]},{"poster":"JayHog1992","date":"2016-09-06T18:37:37.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have before. Once was against a Garen as Teemo, killed him because he engaged level 2, then he lane swapped with Kayle, killed her too.\n\nWhile I went back, I heard Kayle sob posting how she was mad that leblanc got banned in DQ, so I just made a truce with her. Me and her went top lane to just farm. No intentional trading, no ganks, nothing. It lasted for 20 minutes and Kayle even made some nice convo with my mid laner Annie, so I was happy that she got entertained. We honored each other for how friendly I was and how I managed to cheer her up.\n\nSometimes you remember that enemy players are people too, they play for fun or play to win, all that matters is that you enjoy the game in the end.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WyvernEgg","date":"2016-09-06T19:31:15.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not really.","replies":[]},{"poster":"agbudar","date":"2016-09-06T18:45:18.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sometimes, \nwell actually I had this one time were i played 2 ranked matches first match i had an extreme flamer (adc or mid can't remember) who blamed me the jungler ALL game LONG for not ganking her/his sorry as by the time i even got to ganking he was already 0/3/0. but yknow how this works he somehow manages to get the entire team riled against me \ntl;dr we lost.\n\nsecond ranked game. i just so happened to get matched against him.\nhe goes in all chat their jungler sucks he never ganks i lost my promo's cuz of him.\n\nall did was mute all chat.\nthen i told my team my side (that he had died 3 times by 7 min) \nand i proceeded to gank him after my first buff.\nhe ended 0/14/5 or something.\n\n","replies":[]}]}
