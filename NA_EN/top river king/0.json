He's just the culmination of everything I love about League. As someone who started life as a Garen main, playing just shy of 600 matches with the guy (597), making the leap to Tahm just felt natural. Both are easy to play and, if ahead, virtually impossible to kill without tons of help. Except, whereas I played Garen mostly due to my proficiency with him, Tahm was the whole package. Look, character, lore, voice over, kit, etc. It's rare that a champion wins me over on every front like that. Amumu's the only other one that comes to mind, and he and Tahm came together to form my summoner name, which I actually paid to change. Tahm + Mumu + Hat (for his top hat). It's an almost palindrome that I fell in love with the moment I thought of it, just like Tahm. Likewise, my club, Call Us Kings, is named after his champion select quote (\"Call me king, call me demon - water forgets the names of the drowned\").\r\n\r\nTahm also served as the perfect bridge between my previous main role, top, and my current one, support. Supporting always infuriated me because I could only do so much to negate the stupidity of my ADC; however, with Tahm, I could effectively put my ADC in time out for a couple seconds when necessary with devour. Before the removal of the MS boost while running away, and the nerf to his E, which both made matters more dfificult, I was known to elicit numerous compliments for my clutch saves. As Tahm, I felt like a respected member of the team for the first time as a support.\r\n\r\nNow, in the 8 1/2 months since his release, I've logged 194 matches with the guy between my two accounts (this one and EkkoFroffles), including all match types. To put that into perspective, aside from Garen, I've only played 4 other champions more than 100 times. I'd likely already be over 200 matches if not for him being banned so often, sometimes even by my own teammates when I had him as my intended pick. As far as mastery points are concerned, I currently sit at 116,855 total between my two accounts. Second highest is Nautilus with 76,665. AKA, not even close. I've tried him top, support, jungle, and even mid, and continued playing him consistently in spite of his crap-tier status lately, in terms of win rate.\r\n\r\nSo, with all this in mind, I kindly request the chance to play a match with the designer of Tahm Kench, Zenon. Maybe, with the rotating game-modes, it could even be Tahm Kench One For All. I never did get the chance to try that last time OFA was around because people only wanted to play the OP picks. I'd love the chance to play and talk with you some. See what you think about where Tahm Kench stands now, what you expect in the future, etc. That's all. Like I said, just thought it was worth a shot. If you actually read all this, thanks for at least doing that much.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2016-03-22T03:02:57.628+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds cool!
