A Master, 2 Diamonds, a Plat, and a Gold versus 2 Golds and 3 Silvers. I would write this off as maybe just a bug in the system, but I&#039;ve seen more than enough examples of this same sort of thing happening, except with the other team all being pros. I&#039;m okay with the new champ select as a whole, but this absolutely must be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Troiann","date":"2016-01-16T16:31:02.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean this has happened before.  I remember Dekar was playing on one of his smurfs, which was master, but had maybe 100 normal games played.  So he was matched against gold players-plat players whenever he played normals.","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2016-01-16T16:38:31.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before it was a rare occurrence, though. At least rarely to this degree, or anywhere near it. I would often face Platinums, with the rare Diamond, but this is the first time I've ever faced two Diamonds in the same match, and most certainly the first time I've been matched up against a Master. Plus, like I said, now you see pro teams getting this sort of matchmaking in **ranked**. It's like Riot took the quirks of the old teambuilder matchmaking system and just decided to exacerbate them further.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Penguin Eclipse","date":"2016-01-16T16:32:29.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am guessing there was a multi-queue on at least one side. This is what normals have been having for years. I would be surprised if they ever fix it. The mmr system is incapable of properly handling premades of 3 or larger.","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2016-01-16T16:33:55.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At most, we had a duo queue on our side.
