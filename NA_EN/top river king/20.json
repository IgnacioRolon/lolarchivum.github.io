Him (http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=BlengeSquelch) as ADC, and myself (http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=TahmumuhaT) as support.\r\n\r\nI'm betting you want to know a little about us. I started around the end of season 4 and started playing ranked (on my first account, EkkoFroffles) during the season 5 pre-season. I had no runes and was the definition of a one-trick pony, only able to play one champion and role at a serviceable level: Garen top. This resulted in me tanking my MMR until partway through season 5, when I finally had adequate runes and began approaching the game the right way.\r\n\r\nI finally heeded my friend's advice about CSing and warding, as well as devoted time to learning different roles and champion. Problem was, I'd tanked my MMR so much that trying to climb felt like an uphill battle not worth fighting. I'm sure I could've worked my way up the ranks given enough time and effort, but felt a more valuable use of my time would be to first practice a ton (outside of ranked), and later start out fresh on a new account.\r\n\r\nSo I decided to become a support main, and then played nothing but support for months, reaching Level 5 mastery with a ton of supports, learning the ins and outs of all of them as well as the support role. You can look up my history with various supports if you want (http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA1/219119546), since I've been doing a different kind of practicing on this new account. I've been trying to find champions in other roles that function like supports, as well as practicing flex picks (Tahm Kench, Lulu, etc.). That way, I can always be in my element.\r\n\r\nMy friend has been playing this game for a year or two longer than I have and has played a lot of both ADC and jungle (most recently, jungle). As we're friends in real life, and have played with one another a ton, I think we should make a great team down bot.\r\n\r\nThis leaves the other 3 spots up for grabs. Ideally, we'd like you to meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\n1.) Silver or higher.\r\n2.) English speaking.\r\n3.) Able/willing to voice chat.\r\n4.) Able/willing to practice.\r\n5.) Have a sizable and diverse champion pool.\r\n6.) Friendly and not toxic _**at all**_.\r\n\r\nI think that about covers it. Hope people viewing this thread didn't just say \"TL;DR\" and exit out of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Buttrit√¥","date":"2015-11-01T23:14:01.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will jungle i play Wukong,Kindred,Nautilus,Lee sin, and Kha'zix","replies":[]},{"poster":"axel vazquez","date":"2015-11-01T23:12:19.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually really tired of playing ranked and, as usual, am having trouble getting out of Bronze. I'm solo queue and most of the times it sucks. The main issue is not how angry my team gets, and how toxic they can be, it's what they react over and why. They get so angry over the little things while they're blinded by what's really happening in the game, thus getting angrier at themselves and allowing themselves to do bad without realizing that we still have great chances of winning. I don't mind the spot I'm in and I'm simply bettering myself as a player. Making a ranked team to at least have people who will become familiar to you may help, but it all depends on how you do, and how you are able to help your entire team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ryze James Cryin","date":"2015-11-01T23:11:22.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"added","replies":[]},{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2015-11-01T23:06:44.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"P.S.
