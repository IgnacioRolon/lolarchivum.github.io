That&#039;s an average of just over 1 every other match. I&#039;m Silver 4. I can hold my own against Golds, but I know I&#039;m no Platinum. Even the rare match I win against a Platinum feels more like luck than personal accomplishment.\r\n\r\n&quot;Don&#039;t play team builder then,&quot; I can hear you saying. When I choose team builder specifically to practice certain roles and champions, though, playing draft or blind pick won&#039;t be much help.\r\n\r\nAll I ask is that I don&#039;t get matched with people two tiers above me. Golds are one thing, but Platinums are another thing altogether. If they&#039;re too high for me to duo with, why should I be getting matched with them in team builder?","replies":[{"poster":"dangopee","date":"2015-12-03T00:47:40.690+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I get matched with plats every single game, usually diamonds too.","replies":[{"poster":"Top River King","date":"2015-12-03T00:50:17.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only got matched with a Diamond once in recent memory. It was because we had a Platinum on our team, for some reason. So, since the team I'm on can never seem to have the MMR advantage, the other team got a Diamond _and_ their own Platinum.","replies":[{"poster":"dangopee","date":"2015-12-03T01:07:14.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A few days ago I got matched against a D3 {{champion:107}}  and a Master {{champion:161}} . It didn't matter that he was master tier because {{champion:254}} destroys immobile mid laners so hard. I literally just walk down mid lane for free kills. Ended up going like 19/4 and carrying pretty hard, had better score than the Rengar and also wrecked him pretty hard 1v1 because he thought he could outplay me because I'm silver. He was making bad decisions trying to cheese me because he underestimated me.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ElysMustache","date":"2015-12-03T02:49:59.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played in a Team Builder game the other day.

I'm getting thrown against plat players in Blind pick as well (and I'm borderline silver/gold)\n\nIt's made even worse with players doing multi-queues. Getting sick of playing Blind pick normals when everyone else is more skilled than you and every small mistake is brutally punished, and you can't drop mmr without screwing over your team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheCeeJay","date":"2015-12-03T00:48:07.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. I recently bought Azir and wanted to try and learn him. Bot games aren't a good indicator of ANYTHING so I didn't want to start there and I figured with Team Builder's match making thing based on role/champion, it would help. I was wrong. Game after game I've been put up against people who have level 5 mastery with the champion they took mid and it's made learning Azir (a pretty hard champion to learn) very hard.","replies":[]}]}
