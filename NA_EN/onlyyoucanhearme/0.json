I spent a loooooot of time perusing the Universe today trying to sniff out any potential Darkins-in-waiting, and I came across a handful of typos and errors.  Where would we report something like that?  Somewhere on the Boards, via Ticket, or something else?  Most of them weren't anything big, just the sorts of things that need a quick tidying up.  Thanks for any help!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sona-playing}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-01T19:34:24.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, your best bet would be to report it on our[ Bug Report boards](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report).
