The reason why I'm asking this is because I've been hearing different opinions about this a lot. some say it's best to go for computer science than game development due to having a safety net for other job opportunities and knowing how competitive the industry can be causing positions to not be available. This alone has been bugging me for awhile and I wanted to know your opinion on this as well if possible. (Right now I'm thinking about switching from game development to computer science) Thank you in advance!","replies":[]}
