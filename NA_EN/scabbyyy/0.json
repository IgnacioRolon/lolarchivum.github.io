Please take a look at my last game. My summoner name is Scabbyyy, i lost 17 lp when i was there for most of the game. i have no idea how to link the video so that you guys can take a look at it but i played kayn and went 7/6/10 (The score enough shows how i contributed).","replies":[{"poster":"I am your dog","date":"2017-10-24T04:47:02.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just had the same thing happened to me and i'm guessing it's a new system they implemented because i knew back then if you reconnected and won, you were still eligible for the LP that you earned. I understand that this may cause other negative experiences, however i was dominating my lane, came back and still dominated, just to see that we won as a team but i lost as a player. Isn't this suppose to be a \"team\" game? This means the moment a player loses connection or has to reconnect he/she has no incentive to play anymore since they won't receive the win anyways. I feel that it's really unfair that the reconnecting player is penalized for coming back. You say it causes others a negative experience, but so does a feeding teammate that lost lane. However if that player isn't penalized then why should a player that actually won be punished?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ivern a Tree Guy","date":"2017-10-14T16:52:56.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same thing happen to me. Was there for the first 12 minutes of my game dc'd for 8 minutes because internet disconnected i came back at 20 minutes and was there for the last 14 minutes of the total 34 minute game went 1/2/16 as Braum support and lost lp at the end. I don't think its fair at all. Maybe i can see not gaining or losing LP but even then i don't think it's fair at all. At the end of the game in the post game lobby it said i was not legible for \"end game loot\" but i feel like LP is not loot its what you're entitled to for winning a game that your were there for at least a minimum for half the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-13T21:49:08.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry to hear about the loss here.  :(  Even though the leave wasn't intentional, it will still count as a loss because it still causes others a negative experience.  Your best bet is to make sure to tighten up your network settings and play when you know there won't be issues, as leaving can also result in a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).
