Those two groups have some strong similarities, with both aiming to get onto and explode a valuable squishy target. Assassins are burstier, with primarily ability based damage, generally a lack of CC and usually some need to flank to get onto the target they want. Divers have slower damage, a bit of tankiness, generally rely a lot on their auto attacks, bring a moderate amount of CC and can often go straight into a team fight. Nocturne's got a theme that's pretty assassin like, his gameplay puts him solidly into the diver category though.","replies":[{"poster":"afk soon btw","date":"2016-07-08T17:48:22.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the Reply.

She`s either too strong to kill you and you can`t do anything about it or she`s behind and can't do anything to you (well she can still stun you so your team kills you, so I guess she has that). She is in need of a complete rework (kit wise; I wouldn't say she's really needing a full visual rework like many other champions are). Probably something like Fiora's rework. She is the exact same shit that Xhin Zhao is. Either too strong or too out-of-the-meta; difference is he mainly jungles and she mainly lanes.\n\nWuKong should probably get some changes too, ok, but nothing as big as irelia because he is somewhat unique, he has pretty interesting stuff on his W and Ult. Irelia's most interesting thing is her Q refreshes on kill and her stun isn't 100% unreliable, other than that (which honestly isn't anything very special) she is an incredibly generic AND unhealthy champion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"afk soon btw","date":"2016-09-20T19:02:11.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sry i posted on the wrong Server ( on EUW ) i reposted it on NA Board, Here is the Link : \n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/YN4M5biP-riot-so-with-the-assassin-rework-knocking-on-the-door-what-are-your-ideas-for-diving-fighter","replies":[]},{"poster":"afk soon btw","date":"2016-09-20T18:32:08.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"~~So Time has Past and the Assassin Rework is knocking on the door. \nDo you have any new Information for the \" Diving  Fighter Rework ? \" \nI opened a new Thread [here](http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-en/i4gqceMZ-riot-so-with-the-assassin-rework-knocking-on-the-door-what-are-your-ideas-for-diving-fighter), so you can comment there if you want. \n@Meddler ~~\nEdit: Forget about this one, i send you a linkj to NA Board.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaloDragonX","date":"2016-07-08T19:46:06.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So we'll have the diver's update next, after assassin?

I get that supports might not be as noticeably problematic as like divers or junglers but I think thats the problem. The support class feels so unimpactful during a game that we just don't pay attention to them as much, and this hurts the game just as much as broken champions with no counter-play. Now the added focus on supports in the recent patches for me at least has not gone unnoticed. I and im sure alot of support mains out their appreciate this a great deal. Although I think it will take a lot more to make the class feel more important. Playing support should be satisfying. Saving a teammate should feel just as rewarding as killing the enemy as other classes. Also I'd like to point out the fact the any non-support champion with an ounce of CC is taken support now. To put this in perspective, you don't like ekko or fizz top right? Well its almost exactly like that. Just like ekko and fizz top, it shouldent be viable but it is. This leads me back to first point in that the reason people started taking carries with CC bot lane in the first place is because the support class feels so unimpactful. \n\n\n  TL;DR Support for next class rework please.","replies":[{"poster":"HaloDragonX","date":"2016-07-09T20:20:42.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports already had a mini rework for next patch, too be fair they just need better itemization.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ScarletStump","date":"2016-07-09T15:26:24.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would Riot ever consider releasing a list of every champ and their classification as Riot sees fit.

Nocturne can burst, I'm not disputing that. I'm disputing that his 'best playstyle' so to speak is that of an assassin. Out of Nocturne's 3 standard abilities, only his Q and E do damage, and only his Q scales off AD. His main form of damage is from auto attacks, heck that's a huge point of his Q, to buff his auto attacks. Compare this to someone like Talon, as you mentioned above, and you can see that Talon does the job of an assassin much better than Nocturne because **all** of his abilities do damage, and they do damage quickly without having to weave in auto attacks. However, unlike Talon, Nocturne is not completely useless if he runs out of mana or has his abilities on cooldown, because of his naturally higher attack speed (passive on W) and his regular passive. \n\nAlso, perhaps I should have been more clear with my AD Malphite example. I know that Malphite scales off of AP. That was my point, to show you that even champions that scale off of a completely different stat can be made to work in certain situations with a completely wrong build. LankPants understood what I was trying to say. A fed Nocturne can build full damage and be an assassin, sure, but that's not going to work the majority of the time. The nature of Nocturne's kit is strange in that it leans  towards 1v1 assassination as well as bigger fights, I'll give you that. But I think, as a whole, being able to dive into the enemy team, lock down a carry, avoid CC, and then do sustained damage is a more effective way to play Nocturne than simply going in to assassinate someone and not caring if you die afterwards. \n\nYou wouldn't build Malphite AD because you waste his utility as a tank; so too you shouldn't build Nocturne as a full damage assassin because you waste his utility as a diver.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Razgriz","date":"2016-07-09T02:42:48.529+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Out of Nocturne's 3 standard abilities, only his Q and E do damage,\n\nPoor argument.

Not only does Talon's E not do damage, he weaves in about 3 auto attacks in a combo if you include Q, two if not. Which is the same amount you'd have with a burst style Nocturne. And Nocturne gets it done faster and from greater range.\n\nI downvoted you because of the straw-man argument part.

Itemization/masteries are very favorable for that build at the moment, and frankly bruiser nocturne just isn't all that effective compared to other picks. To a certain extent, this may reflect more on the state of nocturne as a bruiser than the strength of him as an assassin, but he is still a pretty effective one.\n\nNocturne may have less burst than other assassins but it is far more reliable burst. It's virtually impossible to escape from one (and very difficult to do anything about getting bursted). An unstoppable semi-global point and click dash that does a substantial amount of damage and denies vision is an incredibly powerful tool for an assassin, and it more than makes up for having slightly less burst than some other assassins.\n\nFurthermore, just using autos doesn't mean that you aren't an assassin. Rengar's damage is almost all autos and almost everyone would call him an assassin. Even Zed and Talon rely on a substantial amount of autoattacking to make the most out of their kit.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Razgriz","date":"2016-07-09T02:44:30.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would, and I think most do, consider Yi an Assassin as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-07-09T10:43:24.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's a secondary assassin, yes, but his playstyle is that of a melee ADC, just like Yasuo's.\n\nNocturne assassination pattern is simply superior to either of them.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Razgriz","date":"2016-07-12T12:01:42.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Master_Yi\n\nPrimary Assassin, actually.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheOvermind","date":"2016-07-09T02:54:07.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There a lot of things wrong with your post and makes me see that you don't understand the game as well.

I realize that would require some very significant work, since the only ability on his kit that is very solidly an assassin ability is his ultimate, but I'm just wondering whether you think the kit should change to match the theme, or if perhaps the theme should change a bit to match the kit.\n\nAnother, more general question - how do you guys decide when to work on champions who exist on the border of classes? Nocturne currently plays like a diving fighter but is themeatically an assassin, so you guys are want to work on him with the diving fighter class, right? So with him, you are working on him based on his current gameplay. But the opposite is true of Diana, who, while thematically a fighter, is currently played fully as an assassin. With Diana, Riot has also said that they are going to work on her with the diving fighter class, even though thats not the class she functions as currently. So she is being worked on based on her theme, not her gameplay. Is this someting that is being decided on a champion-by-champion basis, or is the goal here simply to keep the assassin update small?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khazixer","date":"2016-07-09T08:08:35.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey @Meddler, but Nocturne really need some buffs he is so weak against tanks and cc and his mana cost on his spells.. god please..
