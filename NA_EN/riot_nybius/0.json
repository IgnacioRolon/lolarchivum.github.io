Come check us out if you’re in town or attending AX (Exhibit Hall, Booth # 215)!\n\nIn addition to the Merch booth, Rioters will be walking the show floor with a special gift for League cosplayers as our way of saying thank you for being an awesome part of the community. ~~Also, be sure to head over to Kentia Hall each day from 12:45 PM - 1:45 PM to have your picture taken with the one and only Poro King!~~ _(unfortunately we've had to cancel the Poro King photo ops. You can grab a picture of his Royal Poro-ness at the Riot Merch booth all weekend long.)_","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2016-06-29T21:09:32.230+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please keep an eye out for El Tigre Braum on days 2 & 3!","replies":[{"poster":"Jynx","date":"2016-06-29T21:36:17.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome!
