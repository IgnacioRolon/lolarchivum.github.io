My league account got hacked in, changed region (later found out to be EUW From NA) the thing is, after MANY years of playing league and THOUSANDS of dollars invested into it, i had my Paypal and League account Link for quick purchase, you know so i dont have to authorized every single purchase. So, yah, the hacker bought 2x100$ (2x15 000RP). I Immdiately made a ticket to you Riot and To Paypal to cancel the transaction(October 10 2016 21:30:00). After Hours and Hours working through the night to try and retake possession of my account. I finally succeeded in Recovering my account, i can now log in into my account on the Website, which i couldn't at first. Only now to find my account suspended for chargeback. I guess for now its a good thing cause the hacker is now stuck with a suspended (unsellable account) even he tried to re-Hack into it...(because i do believe an account with the quantity of skins and stuff i have is worth Thousands of dollars). The bad thing is now IM locked out of it too. And i haven't even received an email saying anything about the \"undeserved\" suspension. I fear that if i dont post here My issue might never see human eyes and only be delayed by automated robot response that wont help my cause in any way. I hope you understand my distress situation. I dont drink, i dont do drugs. League is my stress reliever. \r\n\r\n23708465\r\n23683680\r\n^ the 2 open tickets that have yet to get a response... Makes me sad that a player with many THOUSANDS of hours and dollars, a prime customer, is suspended without a word quicker then his ticket answered.\r\n\r\n~Anthony","replies":[{"poster":"Kelenek","date":"2016-10-13T00:42:55.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually am a very patient man, but ill be honest this situation has me in quite a panic stat the last few days.\nThis is really the least of my problems right now considering all the other but... im kinda sad i cant buy Worlds token to upgrade my summoner icon aswell :-(","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-13T01:09:28.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've been slammed with quite a lot of tickets lately, therefore response times are a bit higher than what is normal.
