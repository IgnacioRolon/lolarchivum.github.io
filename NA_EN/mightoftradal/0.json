I was really good at him. I Mastered his lifesteal/selfharm ability and I had the absolute BEST TIME with him. He was the champ that made me fall in love with League of Legends. \r\n\r\nWhen I came back in November, I went straight to my boi Aye-Ayetrox and was immediately blown away by how disgustingly different he was. There is absolutely NOTHING about him that is how he was. People tell me that hes a great pro play champ, that hes really strong, that im just playing him wrong...\r\n\r\nwell i say SCREW THAT! you, riot, CHANGED HIM! instead of just making a new champion, you killed my homeboy and made him into some sort of mish mash riven... If i wanted to play a riven with garbage abilities, id play riven... \r\n\r\nPlease, riot, give us back OG aatrox. Maybe do some sort of story of how pantheon cuts aatrox in half and we end up with two aatrox's, one thats current(garbo) aatrox, and one thats OG aye-ayetrox. youve made pantheon stronger and stronger, and cheaper and cheaper, but aatrox, who is a major part of his story(right?) is just getting worse and worse. \r\n\r\nor maybe, let the community decide. give us some sort of game mode where we get to play with OG builds of champs and see which ones players prefer.","replies":[{"poster":"KronosXVIIII","date":"2020-02-02T00:53:10.040+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"oh no, all that time spent mastering right clicking wasted","replies":[{"poster":"Wind Whistler","date":"2020-02-03T21:51:02.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KronosXVIIII,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=mw8eAppA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2020-02-02T00:53:10.040+0000)\n>\n> oh no, all that time spent mastering right clicking wasted\n\nHow fitting that your profile picture is someone who loves seeing other people suffer, just like yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MightofTradal","date":"2020-02-02T04:10:02.242+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"really? he had an amazing kit, he could jump over walls, slow people and his lifesteal/selfharm was amazing. idk what you mean by \"mastering right clicking\"...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rowan Your Boat","date":"2020-02-02T05:48:18.770+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've learned to never take a \"Revert Aatrox\"/\"Bring Back Old Aatrox\" post seriously when it mentions the tired claim that current Aatrox is just Riven.
