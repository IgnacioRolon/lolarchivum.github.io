I think it would be a nice feature to be able to see that.\n\nEdit: You know what? Screw it. I've played with Rioters a few times before by sheer coincidence and really I just want to play. If they want, they can join 100_ win, but it's whatever","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-04T02:46:23.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've always loved doing this fun little thing, but in the past things have gotten rather busy to the point where we just couldn't make sure everyone had the opportunity. Sometimes we'd be able to join some games and not others, so it felt really bad for those we couldn't fit in. \n\nWith that being said, some of us in Player Support still try to do these player games with people! Feel free to reach out here once you have those 1000 wins finished up and we might be able to schedule something! Otherwise you could also hop into the Boards Discord to see if any of the Mods would be a worthy substitute! (Understandable if not hehehe XP)","replies":[{"poster":"zero356","date":"2017-12-04T04:08:55.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well ok then, I just get wrecked 3 times in a row, so I'm done for now\nBut when I do play again, I'll be back. I think it'd be nice\n\nAnd it is interesting. I'm like 999-950 total. ~51% winrate over the entirety of me playing league. Interesting how close that turned out","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-04T04:22:16.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayy bro, it happens to the best of us. Nice winrate too, most players never see anything higher than 60% winrate, even the pros!","replies":[{"poster":"zero356","date":"2017-12-04T05:00:58.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I more surprised how even/average it turned out in the end.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
