This seems to be fixed by tabbing out and back in. I have seen another user report the same issue. I am also experiencing significantly lower fps, from about 75 fps to about 20 after updating with the same settings. This is on a 15 inch 2015 Macbook Pro with M370X discrete gpu. Any help would be greatly appreciated as it is making the game almost unplayable for me.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"SoQuiche","date":"2016-09-23T01:23:34.872+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having low FPS as well.

When I start it will be normal with about 60 FPS but then a few seconds after I start the game it slows down to around 8 FPS. Its impossible to play.

I recommend capping your FPS at 60, then enabling vertical sync for the best experience. If you wish to regain your previous FPS, I recommend reverting back to El Capitan from Sierra until League is more optimized for Sierra.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
