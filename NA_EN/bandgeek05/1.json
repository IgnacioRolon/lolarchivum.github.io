On game 2 of Bo3 vs froggen. This game would have won the Bo3 for doublelift. Riot called a rematch and doublelift agreed to it. But  this was actually a legitimate win by doublelift! As we know, the snowball deals damage which should stop the recall animation for doubleift right!? Well NO!! not exactly! In the recall animation you are able to take damage for the lat 0.5 seconds of the recall WITHOUT canceling the recal. That is what we saw there! we saw froggen hit doublelift with the snowball in that 0.5 window! He then activated the second part of the snowball while doublelift was actually going to base! This is a legitimate win and was such a crazy strike of luck but this was not a game glitch!

It was pretty clear he initiated it intentionally his second time throwing the snowball as he knew he wouldn't win by farm, because he didn't try to do anything else in any of his 1v1s, and it was boring to watch. He couldn't win any other way (which made it funny that he lost it by cs).\n\nI am glad they redid the first match, but the second time it was clear froggen did it with the intent of knowing he would get the remake, and it cheapened it. I would have been pissed if he had won after intentionally throwing for a remake when he should have lost the series a game before that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NeoDeimos","date":"2015-12-14T01:24:43.732+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"1st time, shame on the recall issue... 2nd time, shame on Froggen for allowing the issue to happen.\n\ni.e. stop taking the snowball right away w/o seeing if LiftLift actually recalled or not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-12-14T18:06:51.334+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didnt Riot even confirm that if you recall in a recent change that there is a point to where a recall cannot be interrupted by damage?\n\nEDIT: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/V5.12\nLess recent than I thought, but check this out.\n\n_Grace period at the end of recall normalized to 0.1 seconds from a random amount between 0 and 0.25 seconds._","replies":[{"poster":"AsphodelNext","date":"2015-12-15T09:41:04.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That patch was last year, and Snowdown Showdown was two years ago; it's likely that patch wasn't applied to the Showdown mode.

The second time it was clear Froggen knew (as he gets vision on Dlift when the snowball hits) and did it knowing he wasn't going to win. \n\nA bug, sure, but it was exploited at that point after he knew it would have that interaction and he got a free draw out of it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2015-12-14T01:30:24.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do on purpose from froggen, he just want to have fun","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niaphim","date":"2015-12-14T01:11:37.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just happened again.
