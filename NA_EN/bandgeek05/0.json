I think Dig is individually much better than TIP and that shows in some the fights we saw this game. However, the rotations and the shotcalling was really really bad. No reason why TIP got that free baron. They had all 5 bot that was an easy tower/inhib. They knew they were at baron pit. Instead, they gave them the free baron while they went to base. To many throws that game, on both sides.","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-01-30T20:59:32.129+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"On another note, lets all take a moment to appreciate that TiP who weren't even supposed to have a team and got the fastest perfect game in NA done to them have now won 3 straight.","replies":[{"poster":"Ale non Ã¨ male","date":"2016-01-31T21:46:54.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which is not a good thing, really, because TiP theirselves haven't look like they were really good","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-01-31T21:43:46.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also worth noting that the players who got the fastest perfect game done on them were different from the ones that won 3 strait","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Iabusemyminions","date":"2016-01-30T20:58:26.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They kind of started falling apart when Kalista was caught way far out, and they burned a teleport to try saving him. I understand that when you play this game correctly, you never get to taste the delicious flesh of minions right behind a destroyed outer turret, and this was the demonstration why, but if they were given the opportunity, they'd just take those minions and continue being min/max hyperbole players, so watching a few of them fuck up over losing their discipline kind of points to the design being appropriate for now, like Chess.\n\nThe Pawns are juicy, but there are reasons for why you must ignore them for now.","replies":[]}]}
