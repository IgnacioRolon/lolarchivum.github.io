There's no warning, no notices, it just does it on it's own.  Periodically it will return to normal, and then go back to being gray again.  I've found no fix for this other than restarting the client.\r\n\r\nCan someone please help or explain what the issue is, or, you know, fix it?  Shit's annoying.\r\n\r\nClient Version: V7.6-4115265.4140304","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-26T23:21:03.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like to sometimes refer to the play button as your \"matchmaking portal\". If your network loses it's connection to that portal, it won't be able to connect you to any games so the play button will no longer work. Whenever it grays out, it's the clients way of letting you know that it can't talk with our servers well enough to play a game. \n\nCheck out our [Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for some ways you can get a more stable connection with our servers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEEP1NG 4NGEL","date":"2017-03-26T18:35:57.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also submitted this to the Report a Bug thingy.","replies":[]}]}
