Error: 500","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I recently checked my email to see that I was accepted into the PBE. When I try to click the link provided in the email to create a PBE account, it loads for an extended period of time only to bring me to a website saying \"Error: 500\". I have tried doing most of the fixes provided in other posts by people with the same issue, all to no avail. (Using cyber ghost, clearing cache and signing in on NA site and so on) I was hoping I could get some support on this matter.\n\nThanks, Triprox","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-04T20:55:25.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, a few players have been having this error when accessing the PBE page and is a known issue.  I have no updates to share on this, but just in case make sure you're using the [correct link ](https://pbesignup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/pbe-signup)for your region.  Hope that might help in the meantime!","replies":[{"poster":"Triprox","date":"2017-04-04T21:01:40.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the quick response. Unfortunately the link provided still gave me the same error message. Hopefully the issues on the PBE are resolved soon. I look forward to testing future releases. \n\nThanks again, Triprox","replies":[]}]}]}
