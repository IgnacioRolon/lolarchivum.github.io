The game loads, two seconds pass and then it freezes. I can't alt tab, I can't force quit, all I can do is force my laptop to reset. I've gone as far as factory resetting my laptop (keeping files), this worked for one game, then in the second game it froze again. \r\n\r\nI believe that the hardware I have shouldn't be a problem (i7-5500U @2.4ghz - IntelÂ® HD Graphics 5500) granted my game has never run nearly as well as the intel page suggests it should for my graphics card. I've only ever been able to achieve 40-60fps on low settings.\r\nhttps://gameplay.intel.com/GamesSettings/8602/85214/Intel%C2%AE%20Core%E2%84%A2%20i7-5500U%20Processor%20(4M%20Cache,%20up%20to%203.00%20GHz)\r\n\r\nPlease help! I miss LoL T.T\r\nThanks guys\r\n\r\nNote: I have the hp Spectre x360 - 13 4003 edition and it does get really hot.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-04T22:21:33.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As hyperion3182 mentioned, your issue may be with a recent Windows 10 update.  The [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) is getting auto-enabled and causing freezing for some players.  Disabling this should get you fixed up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-10-04T11:01:14.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, are you a Windows 10 user who got a recent W10 Anniversary update?

Some hardware could be broken in there (like the fans), making it go really hot. I'm pretty sure some laptops (if not all) shut down when they get way too hot. Not sure though.","replies":[]}]}
