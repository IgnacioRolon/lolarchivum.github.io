I would definitely start by checking your graphics drivers then DirectX. After that, you might need to adjust some of your video settings in case there's some kind of mismatch going on. I would keep this [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) handy, and try those steps in a practice game to see what works best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordPhillip","date":"2018-02-17T14:57:43.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i got a similar bug, my screen blacks out for a few seconds and then recovers multiple times in the game.

I get this often as well. And I can load up the replay and watch the game and the screen will flicker at the exact same spots it flickered in game and I can keep rewinding and watching it over and over. This is a league bug that I feel has something to do with the 7 black dots that appear on the screen too. Both these bugs were introduced this patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-15T00:33:55.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope your graphics card or monitor isn't dying!\n\nMy screen started to flicker occasionally, and over the course of a few months, it got worse. Then the screen would black out for a whole second or more before coming back up. Eventually it came to a point where there were lines across my screen, and it would barely turn on outside of safe mode. Ended up replacing (and upgrading) the graphics card, and everything worked better than before.\n\nIn another instance, one of my screens were flickering, and simply changing the power cord solved the problem, thankfully. It was probably those darn cats biting on the cords. Lucky for me, we've owned a good number of computers and had kept multiple power cords. Those cords, unlike many others, haven't changed too much over the years.\n\nNot too long ago, one of my screens started to flicker, randomly went out of focus, showed a pink-ish hue, and developed large lines going down the right side. I ended up replacing it with another monitor that I had previously put aside when I got my new one. This screen is an inch smaller, but at least I didn't have to buy another, and it's just my side screen, so it doesn't matter to me as much. Of course I tested the cords first, everything else was fine, and this issue was unlike the previous 2 as it only affected a single monitor.","replies":[]}]}
