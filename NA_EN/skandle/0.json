First, my keyboard was acting funny, so I fixed that issue.  Now, however, whenever I try to enter a game type (i.e. ranked, normal, etc) I get kicked back to the main screen.  When I do it a second time, it makes the sound effects, but it goes frame by frame (about 30-60 seconds per frame) and then freezes before I can even pick a role.  I've uninstalled and reinstalled league, restarted my computer, ran as administrator, all with the same issue happening.  Is there anyone that can help me out with this issue?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-03T21:23:21.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you using any third party apps?  Programs like play.tv can cause freezing and crashes like this, so disabling that should get you fixed up.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Skandle","date":"2016-09-03T21:31:24.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I removed all additional apps.  play.tv being one of them along with overwolf.  I appreciate the fast response though.  I'm open to trying anything at this point.","replies":[]}]}]}
