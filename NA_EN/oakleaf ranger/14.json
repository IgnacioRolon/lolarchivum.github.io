I went from that sweet spot in gold elo where everyone kind knew what they were doing for the most part. To the cess pool of silver elo where yasuo and vayne &quot;mains&quot; run rampant, people instant locking zoe no matter their position, and autofill supports vs those who purposely picked the position are usually pretty easy to tell apart in champ select alone.\n\nTrying to actively climb out of here is mind breaking and would only be acceptable if i knew i didn't actually care about the outcome.
