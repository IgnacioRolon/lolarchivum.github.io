There are just better overall picks at the moment than those 2 to justify using bans on them. An increase in Yasuo ban will more likely have to with avoiding the match ups that he is actually really good into rather than because he is &quot;op&quot;. Since certain roles are rarely target banned, Lee Sin isn&#039;t high enough on the jg pecking order to take priority over other jg champions to ban out. \r\n\r\nDo not get your hopes up or expect some kind of miraculous ban rate increase on those 2 when more ban are allowed. If anyone was ever in a pick/ban state like {{champion:38}}  used to be, that champion would be hot fixed or gutted almost immediately.","replies":[{"poster":"CÃ˜ulrophobia","date":"2017-04-27T05:53:22.677+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will ban Yasuo anyways just because i hate playing against him. :D\n\nOr with him for that matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Paquay","date":"2017-04-27T06:05:49.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, it's not about who is a good matchup.

I.E, Yasuo. People just ban Yasuo because he's \"OP\", when in reality, he's really not.","replies":[{"poster":"Oakleaf Ranger","date":"2017-04-27T06:23:25.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is a difference as stated above.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MisterSki","date":"2017-04-27T05:21:26.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think there is a champion that will reach 100% ban rate at all.
