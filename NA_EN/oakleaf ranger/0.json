[Not everyone likes John Oliver but I loved this segment he did regarding monarchies.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyYpjF6iQGo) \n\nThere's also the Collectivist Stigma: Collectivist Socities tend to discourage (or restrict, sometimes forbid) the growth of the individual in ways their society may not approve of. Fiora would arguably be capable of leading her house, but their society continually pressures her (and tries to force her) to marry men she's not interested in.\n\nNoxus is Imperialistic, Cruel, and Racist, we know this, but they are, ultimately, a Pragmatic Meritocracy where even Swain, who was a cripple, was able to politically maneuver himself to become Grand General and yes, Katarina and Kled disagree, but that's their _opinion._\n\nDemacia, by Contrast, is Sexist and Condescending.
