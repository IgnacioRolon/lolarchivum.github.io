IMO I think it should to help make it more distinct from the biscuit and assassin mastery.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-04-27T18:26:20.666+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Runic Affinity does not affect Wolf Spirit or the Scuttle zone and that's intended since they're map based effects rather than personal buffs. It does affect the revised Rift Herald buff though, giving an extra 3 minutes on that which might occasionally be pretty meaningful.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-04-27T21:06:18.624+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"are gromp and krug benefits extended as well?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oakleaf Ranger","date":"2016-04-27T19:11:45.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I got a reply from riot, my life is complete....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"vladerag","date":"2016-04-27T17:52:19.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as im aware, no they do not.\n\nThe reasoning going that those are game objects that provide team buffs.  \n\nHand of the Barons buff time is increased, but only for the one using the runic affinity mastery.  other players receive the normal duration.  Similarly, the scuttle and wolf spirit are unlikely to gain the increased duration from the mastery.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-04-27T20:58:23.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what about the Gromp/Krug buff?
