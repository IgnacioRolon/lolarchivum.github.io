I see nothing crazy there.  \n\nOne other curious note here - I see a Soraka game where you purchased 4 tears... and went 0/12... that looks a little bit like intentional feeding to me, which is punishable.  \n\nWith that having been said, Riot basically never reverses their decisions regarding bans, so you're out of luck there.","replies":[{"poster":"Psychology Major","date":"2017-06-07T22:13:38.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Recently I've just been having fun and if I win, I win. I only purchased the tears when they were taking our nexus. There is nothing crazy, but apparently Riot thinks so.
