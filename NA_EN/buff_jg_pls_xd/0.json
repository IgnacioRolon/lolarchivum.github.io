Not to argue with Riot but it looked like Sona was the reason for the remake, it wasn't even his team that prompted the remake and he was penalized for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-07-07T18:57:55.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The penalty is not necessarily only for a single person.
