I really don't want to loose it or get it banned...\r\n\r\nThanks for taking some time to read all this","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-06T23:12:41.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reach out to us through an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) asap and our account team will look into this.
