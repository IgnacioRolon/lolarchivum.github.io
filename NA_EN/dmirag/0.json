Sadly, transfers are still down right now. We have some minor repairs that need to be done on our back end before we can open them up, but we will give a notice once they're up and ready to go ^__^\nBe sure to check out the League News for any announcements of when transfers are open again.\nLet me know if you have any other questions,\nThanks for understanding!\nPapaBear\nPlayer Support\nUrsine Commander","replies":[{"poster":"hi im kken","date":"2017-12-15T17:24:33.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi i still cant find it","replies":[]}]}]}
