When I close it with the task manager, restart and try to reconnect, it freezes in the loading screen, forcing me to restart my PC. The 'fun' thing is that when it freezes in the loading screen, my friends can't even remake the game.\r\n\r\nEver since Patch 6.14 this happens extremely infrequently and it's just annoying. Not because I will get punished eventually but mainly for ruining the game for others (especially for my friends).\r\n\r\nAs you can see I already asked for help quite some time ago and I didn't really get anything out of it. I repaired the client, reinstalled the game, all that stuff, but it keeps happening every now and then.\r\n\r\nCan someone help me with my annoying problem?","replies":[{"poster":"RengClaw","date":"2016-08-18T05:24:18.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have a simalar problem but i dont dc in games anymore sometimes the game becomes my wallpaper","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T16:33:32.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems that your network is having trouble establishing a connection to the game server, so you may end up getting stuck at the loading screen or even stare at a blank screen.
