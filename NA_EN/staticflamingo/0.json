I've been around here for a while but never have had a reason to post. It all started earlier today, when I was playing in a match and lost connection, and was unable to reconnect. upon further inspection, I was unable to connect to any websites other than google related things(such as google itself and youtube). I finally resolved that issue and was able to connect to regular websites again, however, I'm getting a connection error when trying to log into League of Legends. Does anyone have solutions? (I've tried some things already but none of it seems to work.) Thanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-03T23:06:04.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since I'm a bit delayed in writing a post back to you, I wanted to see if you are still experiencing issues at all or whether this was a temporary issue regarding your internet.\n\nReply back and let me know if you would still like some help!","replies":[]}]}
