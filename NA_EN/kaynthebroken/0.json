(proof and facts that Riot needs to change their system)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So let me begin by stating I understand the reporting system and how it works in order to try and ensure that everyone has a fun and enjoyable game in League, but after what happened today I have lost all hope in Riot. I a month ago got a chat restricted for 25 games and took a week off away from the game to really reflect on my attitude towards others in League. I then came back with the mindset of proving and changing my ways by if someone starts to  even tilt me I just mute them and play the game which in turned started to make the games way more enjoyable. I even got my first level of honor back from continuing this new way of playing and just holding my words and then this last game i played today after a solid month of getting tons of honor and ranking back up I get a two weeks ban for one game. Yes one game not 2 game chats, not 3 game chats, but one and what makes it even better is that I got honored after that game by our mid (which I was not duo) because him/her and our support saw that our adc &amp; Jug were trolling the entire game. I am currently in disbelief at this action because in the chat that will be posted below, I didn't use any curse words, our support even said he cant stand this and was going to go afk due to these two trolls, I even muted them to stop talking to them, and the only word that I used was \"bad\" when talking about how getting camped on a lane does make you good and that show boating doesn't prove anything when playing. Here is the game chat and remember this is from one game and also a month after I got the last chat restricted so I have played over 200 or more games since then where I have kept it cool and gotten multiple most honor on the team.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nKaynTheBroken: full ad i like it\r\nKaynTheBroken: bad puppy ( speaking about how warwick was camping in the bush at start making a joke)\r\nKaynTheBroken: and my mouse just spased out\r\nKaynTheBroken: lol\r\nKaynTheBroken: why you flexing you did nothing lol (other team trash talking to our team this was my response)\r\nKaynTheBroken: lmao\r\nKaynTheBroken: wow you are bad (got doubled ult from Wuk kong and yas and then Warwick so I wasn't being serious its game talk hence no curse words)\r\nKaynTheBroken: come on wuk\r\nKaynTheBroken: do better \r\nKaynTheBroken: if you cant 1vs1 just say so\r\nKaynTheBroken: veig\r\nKaynTheBroken: ping better\r\nKaynTheBroken: plz\r\nKaynTheBroken: thats twice\r\nKaynTheBroken: this veig (veig started to sit afk then came back which was good)\r\nKaynTheBroken: k.....\r\nKaynTheBroken: 2 top again lol\r\nKaynTheBroken: ww top side but watch out mid\r\nKaynTheBroken: so bad\r\nKaynTheBroken: 0 help top (I got triple ganked again and I pinged multiple times for help yet noone came so I type this)\r\nKaynTheBroken: i love it\r\nKaynTheBroken: literally been camped all game\r\nKaynTheBroken: dont understand this jug\r\nKaynTheBroken: why no help?\r\nKaynTheBroken: like are you not helping on purpse\r\nKaynTheBroken: this jug\r\nKaynTheBroken: is trolling\r\nKaynTheBroken: plz report vi troll\r\nKaynTheBroken: you are trolling dude\r\nKaynTheBroken: ive been camped all game top\r\nKaynTheBroken: 0 help\r\nKaynTheBroken: we fight mid\r\nKaynTheBroken: you are up top farming\r\nKaynTheBroken: we get drag (I called out vi for troll due to sitting up top afk farming while the rest of the team played hence past couple of messages)\r\nKaynTheBroken: you still up top\r\nKaynTheBroken: see troll ( Vi said I dont care about helping so I asked to please report)\r\nKaynTheBroken: muted and reported have a fun ban\r\nKaynTheBroken: WHY CAN YOU NOT GROUP ( vi still sits up top while team team fights mid)\r\nKaynTheBroken: like why is someone always trying to farm\r\nKaynTheBroken: lol you and vi swear to go\r\nKaynTheBroken: god\r\nKaynTheBroken: i mean yes wuk you are bad being camped all game but ok\r\nKaynTheBroken: funny how you got 4 ganks from mid and jug yet my vi tried once \r\nKaynTheBroken: nice cs stealing vi\r\nKaynTheBroken: i mean i out csed you all game so eh\r\nKaynTheBroken: ezreal have a fun ban as well (exreal then starts trashing me and our mid veig so I mute) \r\nKaynTheBroken: look at my past 5 games as vlad ( past 5 games before this I got multiple honor, won, and got most honor of the game twice) \r\nKaynTheBroken: gg (even stating gg to enemy team, also our support and me were the only people to say gg)\r\n\r\nThis is turn leads to a 14 day ban which I can not even start to understand the logic behind it. I have gone a month with improving and getting back a level of honor, I have played over 200 games improving, and now after one game count it one game with a troll who even admitted to not caring I get the ban because he reported me. This is why I have lost faith in Riot and before people start to say well you had two warning or there must be more proof than this, I understand the previous warnings that is why I have gone a month with nothing but positive feedback and honor. Also no this is the message a received one game and only one game nothing more and this is because all the other game I got honored and had fun with the team or we tried our best to finish it out. (Remember I even got honored this game so that tells you something). Well let the comments begin.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-26T03:33:04.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Threatening to report someone can be viewed as a way of poking the bear, it's a pretty clear way to try and get someone riled up without having to directly call them any names. Also, you didn't get this punishment purely off of these comments, but rather a culmination of past offenses. You're free to reach out to our player behavior team in a ticket if you want all the context of why this ban was placed.","replies":[{"poster":"KaynTheBroken","date":"2017-09-26T19:47:48.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So let me get this straight on your logic in this case, I even mentioned throughout the post that the last suspension was over a month ago and since then I have gotten back a level of honor, received multiple honor from teammates almost every game, and have played over 200 plus games since then. This was the only game given to me and since there is no other instance used since a month ago Riot's logic is that it doesnt matter how long its been since your improving, all your hard work trying to improve can be taken in one game no matter how much positive feedback you have gotten from your other games. This is what Im talking about excuses that don't shed any light into the matter, (once again how can you say that someone who even the past 5 games got tons of honor and then even got honored that very game equals a ban?) If this is the logic at Riot then there is a problem because what you are telling us players is that if we mess up in the past and then try to improve we must shut up and be quite and not say anything to anyone cause one report from one game can cause all your work to go away no matter how long ago your last suspension was.","replies":[]}]}]}
