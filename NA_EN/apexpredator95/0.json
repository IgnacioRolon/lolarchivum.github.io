Because I had a clean 15/0/10 kda and 200farm but stil did not get an S. Are you so stingy to hand out tokens because I have been playing jhin continuously for a 2nd S shard for lvl 6 Jhin. Please enlighten me!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-29T23:35:14.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simply put: *there are no requirements for getting an S*.\n\nHuge misconception there. Mastery scores are not on any type of flat scale, rather they're a way of scoring how well you did compared to others in the same boat. \n\nFor instance: If you got an A going bot with Jhin, it doesn't mean you *didn't do good enough*, it means *others did better*. If you ever feel frustrated with the score you get, keep in mind there's something you could improve on. \n\nYou can always read up on how mastery works over here:  https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284","replies":[]},{"poster":"minorhacks","date":"2018-01-29T17:49:56.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"From what I have read, riot keeps it a mystery box so people can't abuse the system.\n  So yeah everyone has an opinion, but there is no right answer so to speak.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Divine Arcanine","date":"2018-01-29T10:58:09.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are many many things that factor into what your rating is. For example, 200 farm is great for 20 minutes but not so much for 35 minutes. so Farm-per-minute is an important factor, trinket warding is also important. I find that a massive amount of contribution to S ranks are based on (role-specific but for this is for adc) over-all damage and objectives aka turrets/epic buffs assisted on. An awesome kda is great but be sure to focus hard on those objectives. That's my two cents.","replies":[]}]}
