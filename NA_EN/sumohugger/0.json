I know, **_fun _**stuff..\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \r\n\r\nSo normally you have you're buttons mapped item one to **1**, item 2 to **2**, so on and so on.. and your trinket as** 4** by default. For me it was always a hassle to  press the 4 key in dire situations(as a support main{{champion:40}} ), the second to move my finger would usually block me from using other spells.\r\nSo I decided to map the trinket button to one of my mouse keys when I got a new mouse(it's a _**Steel Series Rival 300**_ just to put that out there), it saves time and it requires less movement. win win right?\r\n\r\n7.8 comes out and the new client is pushed on everyone(not an issue for me as I was already using it when it first released) and everything is fine; though I could no longer use my mouse buttons(aside from pressing in the middle mouse wheel, but why..) to use my trinkets, I asked my friends if they were having the same issue since they use the same layout as me and they told me their controls were fine..\r\nSo here I am trying to figure out what to do, nothing really helps and I'm back to playing on default controls(why does it turn on smart cast on default?). I just want to be able to use my mouse button again, ~~Help my Rito-wan Kanobi, you're my only hope!~~\r\n{{item:3070}} \r\nEven though this all just sums up to a minor annoyance, nothing game breaking.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Prynce","date":"2017-05-03T04:34:10.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is pretty hard to speculate as I don't have much context/metadata about what OS you are on but by any chance, are you on Windows 10?
