No other game does this to me; not Overwatch, TF2, Starbound,  Payday 2, etc. ...\r\nJust league, I have no idea what caused this to happen to me but this started happened at the beginning of the month and at first I was like \"eh... it's no big deal..\" but now it has gotten to the point where I flip my **~~SHIT~~** (_pardon the language_) every time it happens, and boy... does it happen often!\r\n\r\nIt's almost impossible to get any video or picture proof this happens since screen recording a laptop that restarts just doesn't work, and it's always so sudden that I never think to pull out my phone and record it (_maybe now I will though, I just have to now be ready and expect it_).\r\nLike, I thought this was just a small bug that would go away, but now it's a big deal and it just makes me not want to play anymore.\r\nI don't want to have to play if it's guaranteed to shut off my laptop every time. It's just not worth it, but I really do love the game still and I just want to fix this problem.\r\n\r\nI know this is rather ramble-ish, but I'm really frustrated about this seeing as this has gone on for about month now..\r\nI've tried adjusting my setting in-game and on my laptops display, I've tried repairing the client, have yet to just straight up re-download the game(_I don't want to spend and actual lifetime downloading just for the chance of it not working_); I'm not sure what to do...\r\n\r\nI just want to be able to play the game without having to worry if my laptop with crash or not..\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n_**TL;DR**_ : Playing a game in league crashes and reboots my whole laptop, **plz** help!\r\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sumohugger","date":"2016-09-22T11:04:14.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_**Update:**_ So it appears that the issue only happens on my regular account, I dusted off my PBE account just to see and it seems like that has no issues...\nGuess I'm playing on the PBE till this goes away.. :l","replies":[]},{"poster":"4EVERASWOWannabe","date":"2016-09-22T16:35:40.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do not know if this might help, but since it started happening at the beginning of the month it may be related to issues I seem to be having. Though I can't actually seem to play a game since it freezes immediately upon entering the game.\n\nAssuming you're on Windows 10, have you 1) Tried disabling the XBox Game DVR? There are some serious issues with that and games after the anniversary update in August. To do so go to the XBox App in the Start Menu, in the bottom left corner click on the little gear, then under 'Settings' title there will be four more titles -- General, Game DVR, Xbox One, and Network. Click on Game DVR and slide the slider to Off.\n\nAnother thing you can do is go to your league client in the Riot Folder, right click and go to Properties, click the Compatibility tab and select \"Run this in Compatibility Mode for Windows 7\".\n\nI haven't been able to verify these have even resolved my own issues with the game, but they might help you. If it works, credit goes to a bunch of other people who solved these issues before I did. If it doesn't, I can take the blame. It's what Supports do. {{item:3097}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sumohugger","date":"2016-09-24T06:59:08.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you taking the time help me in _my time of need~_.

Regardless, SWOWannabe brought up a great suggestion.  The freezing that you're experiencing may actually be due to a recent Windows 10 update causing freezing for some players.  The culprit may be with the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) not working properly with league.  Disabling that may resolve the issue for you.
