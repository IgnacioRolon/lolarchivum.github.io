After it downloaded, I check marked the run alpha client after it finished. I played a game on it and it went fine. After the game I closed it because I was done playing for a bit. Now when I try to run it, nothing happens. I double click it to open it and it doesn&#039;t open. I tried it once regularly and then i tried it when it was on &quot;Run as Administrator&quot; and neither of them was successful. Anyways, I hope someone can help. Thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Dreamlike","date":"2016-07-21T23:46:42.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I might be a little bit late but opening task manager, ending the League alpha client process, and then reopening the program should help that problem.
