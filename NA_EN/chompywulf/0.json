I have had some godawful games lately, but I want to address a more specific issue to get advice as a Bronze.\r\n\r\nI was Jhin ADC with a Braum support. We were opposite Thresh and Vayne. \r\nI knew I had to abuse my range advantage, keep Vayne pinned back and deny her farm. I did so, pretty easily pushed wave after wave into their tower. Braum mostly threw some Qs, we both kept river warded....but he kept backing off to reset lane every time.\r\nI wanted to siege their tower, but when Braum runs away, no way I can put hits on tower without getting picked off 1v2 that comp. \r\nFurther, enemy mid Fizz and enemy Noc jungler got 2 kills each early, and after a 4 man rush with an enemy Shen ult, our outer bot tower dropped. Braum never returned to my side and instead went top to hump our GP &#039;s leg.\r\nWhat on earth could I and should I have done at this point? I attempted to continue farming lanes with a lot of deaths due to two fed enemy assassins and enemy bot duo sticking together. I had decent CS and gold at end, but with a lopsided bad kda and of course a loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-19T01:10:03.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just sit as far back as possible and farm, don't try to make plays just farm until yall start teamfighting.\n\nIf your support gave up on you so he focuses mainly on another, there's nothing you can do cept sit back and farm till you can do something big.\n\n\nMost people think they should try to force plays when they shouldn't. just sit back.\n\n\n\"but x player... doing X things\"\n\n\nDon't matter, you farm... rotate as need be and help where need be, but you lay low.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Fuzzi","date":"2017-07-19T01:35:20.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This, you can't control them so try to keep things under control. In that case you might want to try and lean into a build with Jhin that uses RFC so your basics can poke enemies. That 4th shot with RFC is just sweet sweet gold.\n\nDon't try to do flashy things. If you end up doing nothing but forcing them to go back to fountain, you've done well. If they're going to 2v1 you there, try and stall them out as long as possible because somewhere else, your team is imbalanced in _your_ favour.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2017-07-19T01:13:10.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jhin actually has the same range as Vayne xd","replies":[{"poster":"ChompyWulf","date":"2017-07-19T03:22:06.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same base range for autos, yes,but you know that with clever play and his abilities Jhin can farm and harass from a distance.

Get more CS than her early and push objectives ASAP, prevent the late game hyper carry.","replies":[{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2017-07-19T04:13:29.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think if you want to deny her you should pick Caitlyn, Varus, Draven, or Miss Fortune. Jhin doesn't have reliable tools to harass the enemy. His Q is very telegraphed if you try to stack it and Vayne has enough mobility to avoid it every time. Jhin's W isn't a harass spell.\n\nCaitlyn significantly out ranges Vayne and is one of the best lane bullies. Varus can poke Vayne out and out ranges her. Draven is Draven. Miss Fortune can play around her Q and all it takes is one shot to put a ton of pressure on Vayne.\n\nBut anyways if your team is not with you don't push far in the lane especially against 2 assassins. Get farm and just walk back to your tower or group of with your team. Jhin can make plays with W and R from afar to support the team.\n\nIf you are talking about lane phase tell your Braum to stay near so you have pressure on the objective. Or make sure you ward because maybe no wards so that is why Braum went back. Or if he goes back every time just try to zone out, don't push and just deny farm and try to get them to over extent so you can kill them.","replies":[{"poster":"ChompyWulf","date":"2017-07-19T16:45:18.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually picked before Vayne was chosen.

It delays your power spike way too hard.\n\nConsider this:\nBurst Mages job is too burst, what does the mage do if it cannot burst? Absolutely nothing.\n\nNow ADC job is to do damage, what happens when the ADC doesn't build damage? Absolutely nothing, the ADC becomes useless. That huge of an investment is just screwing yourself over and delaying your necessary items by far too much. If you need some kinda of defensive early vampiric scepter, cull or dorans shield, refillable potion are your option. Investing 3800 for an item that only gives life steal and shield won't work out well. Life steal scales with damage and having only 80bonus AD doesn't do much for champions reliant on auto attacks.\n\n80 bonus AD is good on fighers because fighters use abilities to do damage. ADCs however only auto attack so they need crit so that there attacks do damage (or lethality).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2017-07-19T04:53:29.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you insult braum by chance?","replies":[{"poster":"ChompyWulf","date":"2017-07-19T16:40:26.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, I did not.

I know these situations just too well, but it's not really \"abandon\" you, but rather rebalance your team's rescources. You fell behind and lost a tower, shit happens. But when they don't group with their mid and jungle and try to push in second bot tower, you should be able to get cs and experience solo under it to get back into the game. There's no need for me to sit next to you and watch hiw you last hit. My powerspike is a Sightstone, so i rather start moving across the map and help our solo laners and jungle to set up vision for us and pressure other lanes so the enemy team is busy with us and forgets about you.","replies":[{"poster":"ChompyWulf","date":"2017-07-19T03:29:48.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would understand this if that was what Braum had done.
