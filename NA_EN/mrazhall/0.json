Well, over the past two weeks I have gotten at least five games with three honors, have not been toxic in chat, and am still not even honor level one. I have gotten 5 chests, but 0 key fragments. I currently have 9 chests and no keys to open them. I don't know if this is bugged, but either way, it is an incredible pain in the butt and I would appreciate some form of explanation for this unfortunate occurrence.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-10T18:00:39.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Consistency is key!

If your honor is high enough to receive keys, and you get an S- or better with a champ you have already earned a chest for that season, you get an instant key fragment instead of a chest. That way you are still getting rewarded for good games with the champ. Seems a simple solution to me.{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moonfall Saber","date":"2017-11-10T18:29:29.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=4gvWq4A1,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-10T18:00:39.802+0000)\n>\n> Consistency is key!

I have not been able to raise my honor level from 0 from a chat ban I got 4 months ago.  I've gotten many many honors from teammates over that time and to be still sitting at 0 after 4 months Is alarming.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gone Lethal","date":"2017-11-10T18:12:53.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I have had similar issue but I'm honor 5. I made a discussion sort of why are we receiving random amount of keys at random times. I had a lot of people give their view on it but at the end of the day, it fields so unfair and unbalanced. When you get a key fragment drop, you only get 2 and you need 3 to make a whole key. For me, it just feels like forcing us to buy Hextech keys because we dont know when the next drop is and how much. I just see this as them trying to make more money from the successful Hextech Crafting and its disappointing.","replies":[]}]}
