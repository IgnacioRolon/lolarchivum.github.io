What is the point of only being able to receive 5 of them when it requires 3 to make one and 6 to make 2? Why do we have these left-over pieces?\r\n\r\nAlso, what will happen to the project cores that we didn't have enough to spend on something or we spent all we could and now have extra? \r\n\r\nThese left-over crafting parts leave me feeling kind of gypped, and I'm sure it's the same for other people. There is nothing to do with them: we can't disenchant them, so they feel like useless clutter.\r\n\r\nA nice feature to be added would be at the end of the event, all project materials from the event (project cores, augmented cache fragments, etc.) would have the option to be disenchanted into either essence, or perhaps you could combine 3-4 project items to get a Hextech chest. This would make players feel more fulfilled because there would finally be a point to all the extra, useless items in their Hextech crafting inventory.\r\n\r\nRiot, if you have an answer to my questions, I would appreciate an explanation. If everything I recommended makes sense, please take what I said into consideration.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time,\r\nMolotovPeep","replies":[{"poster":"Rinalya","date":"2016-08-17T23:12:26.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't seem to disenchant these :(","replies":[{"poster":"Mrazhall","date":"2016-08-19T11:47:32.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's going to happen in the future, I believe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sosagotjuice","date":"2016-08-18T15:11:04.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same I cant either","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-16T15:27:04.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Extra fragments were available in case you were able to nab fragments from Augment Caches.
