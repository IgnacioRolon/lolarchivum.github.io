I get out of the game and I get a notification \"you have qualified for your series into Bronze 1\" AFTER I JUST COMPLETED IT AND WON. I have played this game for two years consistently and I have never seen a spaghetti this tilting. Riot please explain why this would happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-21T20:51:20.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really strange!  Is this for Ranked Solo?  I'm taking a look and I don't see any previous series this season for your account.  You paced in February, and just today received your first series.  I wasn't able to find anything out of the ordinary here.","replies":[{"poster":"Mrazhall","date":"2017-04-22T14:27:10.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was looking through my files and I don't have any screen-shots as proof and I'm too lazy to scan my obs videos to find anything there (I have over 12 hours of footage). I understand that even if I did have proof there is probably nothing that you could do for me to fix whatever happened, but i just wanted to bring this to your attention in case someone else has a problem like me. Also, does Riot have an email or something that I could use to send a private message to? I have another question but it's kind of a private matter and I don't just want anyone on the boards dropping in.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mrazhall","date":"2017-04-22T12:02:22.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that's the problem I specifically remember being 0/1 in my promos and then I played and won but didnt check after. When I won the third won, my friends confirmed I had been 1/1 in my promos, though I didn't see it myself. It's truly bizarre but I get if you cant do anything about it.","replies":[]}]}
