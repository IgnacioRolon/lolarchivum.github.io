She's been complaining lately about not getting any chests but having a bunch of keys, so when I saw that I got a chest I turned to her and said \"Hey! You finally got a chest!\"\r\n\r\nBut she didn't. She doesn't play anywhere near as me and hasn't gotten one in forever and it's making her sad, thus the post. Her screen name is OldPatronus. Her profile page says she's at the max available chests and I know for a fact no one's ever gotten an S with Nidalee around her.","replies":[{"poster":"Ultangenn","date":"2016-10-05T03:01:27.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, then this may be our misunderstanding. I thought it was you earned the chest for whoever it was that your party member was playing (in this case, the Nidalee would have gotten her a chest under the Nidalee). If that's the case, it makes much more sense. Sorry for wasting your time guys but I appreciate you helping me understand what the problem was so I can more accurately convey what happened to her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-04T21:31:50.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed with Lew here.  Looking into this, it looks like her recent history shows champions she's already earned a chest for.  Per the [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide), you can only get a chest one per champion per season.  Hopefully that helps clear things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-10-04T11:14:49.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 for Lew.\nThere are several possible reasons your girlfriend doesn't get Hextech chests, please have a look at the FAQ:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide \nClick on the blue button \"hextech chest\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lew","date":"2016-10-04T07:55:07.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You earn a chest for the champion you are playing when someone in your premade gets an S.
