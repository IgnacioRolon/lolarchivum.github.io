Or when Zed ults you and that spinning blade appears around you and you know you're screwed? Well I was thinking Darius could get the same sort of thing for HIS ult. In the two other cases, those indicators mean the difference between a successful all-in or a waste of resources. Currently, the Darius player needs to either eye-ball it, or have really good instincts to know whether his ult will kill someone. Cho and Zed get these perks for free, so they know exactly when to use their ults. Darius, however, must go wanting. For what reason? I say treat Darius the same as these others and give his ult an indicator that lets you know it will successfully kill someone.","replies":[{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-02-17T01:54:31.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They will nerf him for it, I {{champion:86}} tee it.
