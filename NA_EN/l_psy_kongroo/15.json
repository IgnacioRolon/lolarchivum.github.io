It's like shielding your ADC but better, since a shield can be popped, leaving your ADC with no protection. But his passive is far more consistent damage reduction, and it affects EVERYTHING. You can auto the ADC and Q the support for a total of 30% damage reduction on the enemy, which is almost criminally overpowered IMO. \n\nFor builds, I'd go with something like this: {{item:3042}} {{item:2301}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3107}} {{item:1001}}. These items are all relatively cheap; nothing over 3K gold, and getting the SS+Income combo item gives you an additional item slot to work with. I'd probably replace Locket with Black Cleaver if I was really ahead though. Plus, if your ADC ever falls behind, you have the option to build AD yourself and try and replace them.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2016-12-28T23:59:49.123+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, it's a total of 15% damage reduction. 15% reduced damage from the ADC and 15% from the support is still 15% overall.","replies":[{"poster":"L Psy Kongroo","date":"2016-12-29T00:26:00.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Glory ln Death,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3K2fVgvs,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-12-28T23:59:49.123+0000)\n>\n> Actually, it&#x27;s a total of 15% damage reduction. 15% reduced damage from the ADC and 15% from the support is still 15% overall.\n\nUh.........no?

In this case, the something is damage reduction. Urgot reduces one target's damage by 15%, and a second target's damage by 15%. So in total, he's reducing damage by 30%; 15% from one source, and another 15% from another source.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2016-12-29T03:44:59.204+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again.
