One area that consistently gives me trouble though is bread. I love the convenience and portability of sandwiches; they&#039;re my go-to lunch for a busy day. Not to mention peanut butter is probably one of my favorite foods ever.\n\nBut it seems to be impossible to find bread that&#039;s not loaded with preservatives and unnecessary sugar, lactic acid, glucose/fructose, triglycerides, and a whole bunch of other unpronounceable ingredients that make it seem like you&#039;re eating a loaf of candy. \n\nI really don&#039;t want to have to give up sandwiches, but I really struggle to justify eating this crap. How do you guys do it?","replies":[]}
