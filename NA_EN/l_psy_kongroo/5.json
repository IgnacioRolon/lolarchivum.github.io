Annie ADC? Did I miss something?\n\nAnnie ADC is legit, she gets 40% damage reduction every 4 seconds from her E that ALSO returns damage, so you don't even have to buy Thornmail. Her auto attack range is above average, and farming is easy with Q. And what other ADC has such amazing self-peel with a built-in stun?","replies":[{"poster":"LightIsMyPath","date":"2017-06-14T01:28:41.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"O.o I really hope you are trolling me xD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dokkaebi","date":"2017-06-13T21:37:28.316+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Annie has more CC","replies":[]},{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2017-06-13T22:35:16.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you mean any adv?","replies":[]}]}
