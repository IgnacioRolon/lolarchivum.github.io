I think there are a few things Riot can do to make him much better without outright buffs. For one, they can make it possible to instantly detonate his Q so he can ACTUALLY do something against champs like Zed and Yasuo. It isn&#039;t a very long stun, so you&#039;d only have time to make maybe one W hit before the stun wears off. Assassins are favored over mages, so I have a hell of a time facing Assassins. \r\n\r\n\r\nA totally off topic statement here, but I think there are so many great skin Ideas for Aurelion Sol already out there. I mean, Dark Star Aurelion Sol, Super Galaxy Aurelion Sol, maybe even a project Aurelion Sol? Hear me out here with Project ASol: A Mechanical Star dragon with his passive being hunks of metal surrounded by White fire. It would look dope. Same with chromas for him! His only current skin isn&#039;t that great to be honest, and I often find myself playing with the original skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you main ASol I&#039;d love to know.","replies":[{"poster":"Snake Town","date":"2017-02-08T02:41:46.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"elderwood, arclight, or deep sea","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-02-01T22:36:08.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he needs a \"definitely not\" skin above all else","replies":[]}]}
