Are you hyped for Warring Kingdoms Vi? wouldn&#039;t you prefer a Firecracker Vi? I would suggest riot to show the idea of what they already have and this idea i&#039;m trying to get out.\nPlease leave your comments, upvote or downvote this post in the top corner, the more attetion this post gets, the more likelly it will call riot&#039;s attetion, if it doesn&#039;t become popular, well, like all other posts it will be burried and forgotten.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-12-07T22:20:03.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"j4 and xin cry","replies":[{"poster":"ProtoSpark","date":"2016-12-07T22:37:47.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha, true, they need something like an Academy skin for them","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RusselChambers","date":"2016-12-08T08:18:53.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahem {{champion:5}} has a wonderful warring kingdoms skin too :'(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cosmic Star","date":"2016-12-07T22:06:43.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this idea, not that this skin for Vi is bad (it's pretty good) but she could take a full potential with a Fire Cracker Version. \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
