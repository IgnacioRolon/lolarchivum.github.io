Can we get an update so the healthbars have indicators of when the opponents are at 30%..\r\n{{champion:31}}  and {{champion:555}}  have these indicators...\r\nYes could be cause those are true executes but for abilities that rely on health percentage i think could use an indicator..\r\nIm sure its happened alot and in one my recent games i ulted {{champion:21}}  as {{champion:28}}  and it didnt kill  i did math after the game she was at 763 when i ulted she was 13 hp from 30%    \r\nand as for my items {{item:3152}}  {{item:3285}} {{item:3089}}  {{item:3135}} {{item:1052}}  wasnt at full build  but was more than enough to deal 90% of that hp left  without the less than 30% ult boost\r\n\r\nSo  can we get a future update to have some sort of indicator on champs with health bar % skills  it would help all players out alot\r\n  \r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-09-07T22:06:16.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then we'd have to add one in for {{champion:122}} Darius and I don't think that's something people want.

Even if you earn each and every one of those stacks chances are that (especially at rank 1) you will not get the execute you want.","replies":[{"poster":"AceNinja1993","date":"2019-09-07T22:27:35.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BlackKnightJack,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VVRhm7os,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-09-07T22:18:16.472+0000)\n>\n> Believe me, it's not.
