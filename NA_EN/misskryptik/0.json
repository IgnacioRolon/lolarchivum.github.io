I know that Wind doesn't either, considering I just tried. \r\n\r\nI'm curious. What companies _**DO**_ support the mobile payments in Canada?\r\n\r\nTelus? Koodo? Bell? \r\n\r\nCan any Canadians help me out? I've tried looking it up but I'm really coming up short!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T04:45:44.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We support [Boku Payments](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201753264-Boku-Mobile-Payment-and-Internet-) in Canada, but you'll probably want to reach a representative at some of the mobile providers in Canada to specifically ask if they support Boku.\n\nHopefully, some Canadians swing by to offer their advice. Let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"MissKryptik","date":"2016-11-01T02:45:31.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, I appreciate the suggestion.
