Literally have no clue what to do... I have reinstalled 7 times and turned my computer off in between installations two times and every time I try to start this game it says the game has crashed. Not really expecting anyone to know what's going on but maybe there's someone else having the same problem? Thanks :\\","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-07T21:50:14.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a lot of installations!  Assuming that this error is happening when you select the icon, you might be experiencing an issue with your OS settings.  As your first step, make sure that you have your Windows updates so you are missing any necessary products that may be needed for a proper installation.  You may be experiencing a security setting problem that is blocking the patcher from launching and treating it as a risk.  I suggest using our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that the patcher has access to open.  Hopefully that helps, but let me know if the issue persists.","replies":[]}]}
