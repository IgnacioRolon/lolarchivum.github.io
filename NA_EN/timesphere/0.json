Why support of course. And the last card appropriate enough for the set would be of course, the jack. So since a jack card would require a Male character as well as a support, why not make it for Taric?  \n\nI&#039;ve heard through the interweb grapevine that Taric is getting an update soon...  \n\nTaric always goes well with Ezreal... \n\nThresh and Braum just got skins....\n\nPlease make this happen! I am not a visual artist so no concept art, sorry! Plus I would hope that this skin would come out after his rework anyway. \n\nAnyone feeling this idea?\n\nEdit: I'm an idiot and did not know that there was already a Jack of Hearts Twisted Fate. Oh well.

Oh well.\n\nDefinitely not an idiot. :] It's an older skin, and you're not the only one wondering where the Hearts falls into place.\n\nIn regards to Taric, RiotRepertior mentioned in [this thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/EABt8X1q-riotrepertoir-how-is-taric-and-the-rest-coming-along?comment=0000) that he's currently in the middle of a rework. \n\nSince he's going to be receiving a new model, animations, etc., we decided to hold off on giving Taric a new skin until after his rework is complete.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-05-13T05:18:23.465+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ghKpPdcepA","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kinjishi","date":"2015-05-14T06:36:42.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Queen of Diamonds Taric... should have happened.
