If you look at his op.gg, the most recent match played is a normal played 2 days ago where he goes 1/20/0 as Galio in a near 40 minute game, which means on average, he died about once every 2 minutes. He earned less gold than anyone on his team, only earning a little over 200 gold than the _enemy_ support, and also had the least amount of CS out of any non-support laner in the game, barely beating his own jungler by 9 CS, who had a much higher kill participation. To me, this game doesn't look to good for the OP.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that the OP did indeed intentionally feed in this game, but I'd be willing to be it is the game that triggered the ban. If I'm not mistaken, though, I do believe intentional feeding punishments come with an in-client reform card with a link to the game that triggered the punishment. If he didn't get one, then he should definitely ask support for the match where he was intentionally feeding.","replies":[{"poster":"Chønklord","date":"2017-04-03T05:45:20.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmm I'm looking at that 1-20 game. It's his 3rd Galio game ever, in Normals:\n\nHe has more damage than his midlaner,\nHe took more damage than his midlaner/adc,\nHe placed more wards than his midlaner/adc,\nHe has more CS than his jungler,\nBut he earned the least amount of gold,\nAnd had the lowest XP level,\nAnd no assists, 1 kill and 20 deaths\n\nIt's _very likely_ he was split psuhing all the time and the enemy Quinn (top laner) and/or Zed (midlaner) were heavily focusing him down before any fight. He's bought items and just seems to be _really bad_ at itemization and galio overall.\n\nhttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/59874222/LegendaryYangY#matches gives more context, including item purchases throughout the game etc.\n\nI'm trying to find the one website that shows where a player died/made kills, to see if it supports my theory of him splitpushing only and getting focused.\n\nIt is also possible he was continuing to run at them and intentionally feed. If we had a spectate copy of the game it would help to solve the OP's issue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-03T02:25:29.003+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was gonna say http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2404298804/221406641?tab=overview , but on a second thought that's actually a regular Yasuo KDA.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LegendOfKings","date":"2017-04-03T04:07:25.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I didnt feed every games i play so far... get ban for 14 days lol.....","replies":[{"poster":"Chønklord","date":"2017-04-03T05:52:33.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey if you'd like I can watch your game replay from your Galio 1-20 normals game, in order to better determine what caused Riot to ban you.\n\nIf so, you'll need to upload a copy of the .rofl replay file; You can download replays to your computer by going into the client, then click **Profile > Match History > Download match button (right side)**.
