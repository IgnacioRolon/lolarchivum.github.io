Can you quite in the middle of the game when your teammates get toxic or blaming you ? Because in some of the game, you&#039;re doing good but they just blaming you. Like for example: our top lane can&#039;t stop other teammate top lane to come help out in bot lane. Our top lane blaming a sup score 1/5/16 a bad sup and toxic it out. Blaming teammates. At this points i just wanted to quite the game and start a new one. But can you get ban from afk in the middle of the game since you don&#039;t want to die anymore and get reported for international feeding &gt;?","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-07T21:01:41.949+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leaving game/AFK.  <--- That's the report you get if you do","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2017-06-07T20:24:11.861+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's never okay to AFK out of a game.\n\nIf your teammates are flaming, you gotta mute them.

I'm not sure if they give you account suspensions for going AFK but Leavebuster will detect it and eventually give you a Low Priority Queue if you keep going AFK. I recommend you mute them and try your best to communicate via pings OP.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LegendOfKings","date":"2017-06-12T04:23:07.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well no choice but to agree with you all... thanks all of you guys. good response.","replies":[]}]}
