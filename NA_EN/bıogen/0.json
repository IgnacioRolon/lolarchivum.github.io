So basically, I can only run High Sierra. Riot has decided not to support High Sierra in the mac client, which means it frequently (about once a game) disconnects through a bugsplat. It&#039;s not that big of a deal, since I can simply reconnect. But it does take me 1 to 3 minutes off my game, which could be crucial in the early game in e.g. ranked games. Why doesn&#039;t Riot support this new iOs, while billions of people are running their systems through different iOS?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-23T20:02:03.058+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OSX is not iOS.\n\nThe OSX userbase is tiny, well under 1% of players, and developing for OSX is harder than for windows, plus far less developers that are familiar with the drivers and OS exist.\n\nIt will either get fixed, or cut entirely if it is too much work to fix. You should strongly consider dualbooting windows with bootcamp. It is free, easy, and will give much better performance than the OSX client anyway.\n\nIt wont fix the shit hardware, but it will at least fully utilize it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-05-23T19:58:23.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apple rolls out OS updates at a helluva higher frequency than Windows, which makes them a pain to have to constantly work on compatability for, which is why people prefer to game on Windows. They'll get there, with time, but that's just something you'll have to live with if you're gaming on an Apple.\n\nPS: Apple's OS names make no sense. This is a case where it's more easier to grasp what level an OS is at when you say Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10 as opposed to Bobcat, Snowflake, or High Sierra.

I've never had an issue with League on this laptop, and it runs the latest version of High Sierra. I've had *maybe* 3 crashes since I've had it, and have had to restart twice *at most*.\n\nIt's probably an issue with you, your computer, or just outright terrible luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Bıogen","date":"2018-05-23T19:53:40.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've spoken to several mac users, all on High Sierra, and having issues since they upgraded it. I've never had any problems with League, or internet, or any other game. But since the upgrade to High Sierra, I disconnect at least once almost every game. I've been scrolling through the forums before, and found some useful threads regarding this issue. Result was that Riot isn't actively planning on making a special suitable client for High Sierra, and that the best advice was to downgrade your iOs. Which I tried, but then my iMac told me I could not go back to Sierra or an older iOs version because IF your computer can handle High Sierra, it magically blocks downgrades for some reason. I've also reinstalled the mac client several times, but nothing has worked. I'm already used to it, but I'm scared to play any ranked games since I don't wanna get flagged for afk or trolling or something like that...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-05-23T19:39:17.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because even big rito knows\n\nOne does not \"game\" on a mac","replies":[]}]}
