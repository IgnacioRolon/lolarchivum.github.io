Before the issue for riot that herald was too easy for many to solo but didn't offer any extra pay off other than gold (and stacks during the days of devourer) now it is in a state of being too dangerous to take even with multiple people and really only offers a buff to one person lowering the incentive for others wanting to help in a soloQ environment where everyone is on a bit of a selfish mentality. Maybe consider adding/changing it so that the one carrying it still gets a buff but also shares some type of buff to their nearby team members so that at least it would encourage it to better be a team positive neutral objective.","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2016-11-23T21:37:51.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shadow Hazard,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vL01ptFg,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-11-23T21:36:52.431+0000)\n>\n> Thank you for the response!\n> \n> My 2 cents on the matter.

Like I said in soloQ people will have a tendency to be more selfish in looking for advantages and making it something that could affect the whole team but still dependent on who picked up the buff means that it will still be very good in organized team play (even better) and will seem much more worthwhile in soloQ play.","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2016-11-23T22:10:16.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shadow Hazard,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vL01ptFg,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-23T21:41:37.635+0000)\n>\n> I agree that it is powerful, but it shines best in organized teams.

When it's only one person people just say meh fuck you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
