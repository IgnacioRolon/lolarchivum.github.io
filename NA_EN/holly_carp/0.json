In your case, since you specifically mention this happening after the recent Windows 10 Anniversary update, it's likely caused by that update. In this anniversary package, some changes were made to Xbox game bar and the DVR feature was enabled by default. I recommend disabling that feature entirely using [this guide](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html), as it has been able to resolve this issue for a decent amount of players.\n\nLet me know the results of those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"ZV Dapex","date":"2016-09-29T13:50:21.392+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have exactly the same problem and it works!!!!!! thank you very much!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"King Kosher ","date":"2016-08-29T23:06:23.422+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy crap that actually worked after trying everything!
