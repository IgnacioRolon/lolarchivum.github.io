Ever since I updated my computer with the new windows 10 update. I&#039;ve been having this weird jaggedness/lagginess in game. So i started playing around with in game setting and when I turned off v sync and uncapped my fps, it stopped. But I&#039;ve been having my v sync on and fps capped at 60 for the last 3 years. I have a 60htz monitor so i always capped at 60. Can anyone explain what might cause whats happening and why v sync off and fps uncapped fixed my problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Cranky","date":"2016-09-27T08:39:22.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might want to try some of these things [](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) as Windows 10 updates many things of which we don't know and screws up many others.
