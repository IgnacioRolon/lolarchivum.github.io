(Final score was 4/2/4)\r\nThe game before that I admit I did die 2-3 times where I messed up and I could have done a lot to avoid it.\r\nIn said game I want to know what other things I could have done better.\r\nI was mainly following my adc because our team would never get in groups bigger than 2 other than fights.\r\nI did try a few times to attack people when they were away from their team.\r\nThis would end with my team not noticing my pings or the fight at all.\r\nSo what I got from the 2nd game is I just need to stay away from people because I can&#039;t always count on others to notice they have been alone for over a full minute and the rest of their team is not even close to them. (Final score was 6/9/19)\r\nSadly I have taken breaks from ranked a lot and I don&#039;t remember my stories from the other 4 games.\r\nThe scores were 4/8/13, 3/3/4, 6/7/9, 3/5/4\r\nSorry if this looks like a mess to anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-05-20T23:55:53.304+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take a break for a day and come back later.

You don't have to go to the gym, or lift weights.

Alot of games in low elo are simply carry hard, or lose.
