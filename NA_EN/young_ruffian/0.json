I was trying to fix up using racial slurs and the like, but I was permanently banned for the chat logs copy-pasted. I only really started making fun of bot lane when they kept making messages to each other in game, which honestly made me feel very alienated, and awkward. It was in agreement throughout pretty much the entire lobby that nobody really liked the duo, so it was widely accepted I was not really making anyone feel uncomfortable. I believe I was perma'd through a bot, rather than manually, because more often than not I'll attempt to tilt opposing laners/junglers in ranked games by typing like \"lol\" or \"nice play\" or something of the sort.

Doing so can encourage players who are already negative to continue their behavior. Whether they know they are being reported or not has no bearing to whether the system will act on them. But most importantly, repeatedly threatening or arguing with a negative player can end up derailing the game for everyone else and then open yourself up to reports and possible disciplinary action as well. Avoid negative thoughts and useless chatting with poor performing teammates! Focus on victory by muting the offending player and then reporting them at the end of the game.\n> \n> Do not ask other players in the match to report the offending player. It only takes one report for our systems to review a game. Additional reports will not do anything for the offending player; however as mentioned above, it could open yourself up to a report of your own; especially if you are derailing the match by constantly demanding reports of other players.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=young ruffian,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=nXeF21Ht,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-08-25T09:46:55.412+0000)\n>\n> nobody really liked the duo, so it was widely accepted I was not really making anyone feel uncomfortable.\n\nExcept, perhaps, for the duo.
