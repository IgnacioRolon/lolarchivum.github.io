That's what the old Morello was.\n\nArchangels gives you everything you want: Highest single AP item after rabadons, but the added benefit of 20% CDR, tons of mana and mana sustain, and a defensive shield. \n\nIt's just better than Ludens in every way. Ludens has lost it's identity after losing movement speed. Nobody ever really thinks this is superior for poking. Arch will give you more AP to offset the lack of burst from luden's passive. More mana. More AP as the game goes on and you get more mana items. More mana sustain for poking. \n\nI also think they are making a huge mistake, nerfing the wrong aspect of archangel. They should reduce or remove the CDR, making Ludens the superior poke choice, and leaving Arch for what it always was: The late game scaling AP/mana option.\n\nNobody wants a low AP mana sustain item with CDR. That's too much like a support item we already have. \n\nNow, the main reason people never used Arch before was the lack of CDR. If you just wanted high AP, you had other options. And you didn't need it for mana sustain with other options that also gave AP. But, things are different now. If you made it 10% people would probably still use it, but there would be a more clear choice available. But if you made it 0% CDR, its use would be more limited but still probably a viable option for people who want both high AP and mana sustain but are not necessarily looking to spam abilities as fast as possible.
