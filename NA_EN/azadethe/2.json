I&#039;ve made another post on this, but oh what the hey.....\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/dAAXQuia-after-87-why-would-anyone-take-any-runes-but-precisionsorcery\r\n\r\nI explained it mostly there, but the TLDR:\r\n\r\nStacking Ult reduction now makes Sorcery/Precision the meta because both have ult reduction, and if you win a team fight, the aggregate Ult Cooldown reduction is over 61.2%. In other words \r\n\r\n-If you lose a Baron and the opposing team goes directly to your base, they will have their ults on your respawn and you won&#039;t, meaning they can muscle a second ace, and take your base.\r\n\r\n-If you lose any generic fight where your base is already partially gone, they can finish.\r\n\r\n-Champs with Invulnerability will now have such more often by far, and invulnerable champions generally ALWAYS can manage 1v3 fights at minimum, especially with the new {{item:3124}}  ({{champion:10}} {{champion:23}} )\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\nBut...... then Riot did this too:\r\n\r\nLegend: Tenacity\r\n&quot;Underpicked and underperforming.&quot;\r\nTENACITY 5% + 1.5% per stack &rArr; 5% + 2.5% per stack\r\nMAX TENACITY 20% at 10 stacks &rArr; 30% at 10 stacks\r\n\r\nBasically..... the only reason it&#039;s underpicked and underperforming is because Legend : Alacrity exists and Precision was mostly used on Basic attack champs. It was by no means Weak.\r\n\r\nWhat this amounts to:\r\n\r\nEvery champ now has a viable Sorcery/Precision combo of runes that ignore its focus being around mostly adcs.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nPresence of Mind + Legend Tenacity as minor runes, or Presence of Mind + Coup De Gras\r\n\r\nPhase Rush + Manaflow/Ultimate Hat + Celerity/Transcendence + Gathering Storm\r\n\r\nThen there&#039;s the Precision Main options.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhat I&#039;m going to emphasize:\r\n\r\nI want you to look at the sustain adding Domination offers and compare it to what a 61% reduced Ult can do as utility for a champ. You&#039;ll find that pro players who are safe and smart, will always use Precision better. Poor players will USUALLY use the Precision better.\r\n\r\nI want you to look at the moderate tankiness Resolve offers. Which helps more? a 3 hit tankiness followed by sustained death, or Ultimate reduction? Most will find Precision does it better (Korea already runs Fleet Footwork on {{champion:113}} , and it serves about the same purpose as Grasp)\r\n\r\nAnd then you look at Inspiration: It doesn&#039;t have mana control, the keyrunes are very Niche, and the move speed bonuses/debt/cdr reduction is just done better by Sorcery. Unbound Spellbook has uses, but not as much as massively reduced Ultimate cooldowns.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only champs that don&#039;t really exponentially change based on these changes?\r\n\r\n{{champion:77}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:42}} ....... most of which are already mediocre performers.","replies":[{"poster":"TempName54846","date":"2018-04-05T04:03:49.238+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"people actually believe this LUL","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-04-05T04:48:58.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"P.S.

Even then spellbook is still really nice for these champs.\n\nLike you can compare Domination sustain with precision utility but since when was Domination ever about sustain?? Might as well be telling me to compare resolve damage to sorcery damage.\n\nSure if you want to be that HUGE NUMBERS person who looks at the situational x% CDR in a late game 40% CDR rank 3 ult teamfight ace, whatever but you're seriously underestimating early game where that AS is replacing approx 1/4 of your potential early AP, wards aren't constantly available, a small 4% increase in damage can mean the difference between clearing with a single Q vs a single Q + several autos, 40 HP advantage can win a lane and 300 gold alone can snowball into an objective.\n\nFunniest part is where you say \"what would you prefer?! Three hit tankiness then sustained death, or ultimate reduction?\" as if it's fair to compare when a rune's not useful to another rune when it's most useful. What would you prefer, winning a burst trade or getting cooldown reduction on a skill you haven't ranked up using that kill you didn't get?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-04-05T06:48:45.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Btw..... played 3 games tonight with this:\n\n3 wins\n\nThe only game someone beat me on dps was one where I used {{champion:143}}  (We had a Cho do 16k true damage, or we would have been even damage)\n\nAnd I'm talking as a support role....\nFirst game {{champion:267}} \n(2nd most damage entire team, most healing of all players, almost more than entire other team combined, saved 279 seconds of ult cooldown) 5/4/21 24:12\n\nSecond game {{champion:143}} \n(Wasn't best game, but still did second most damage, team got a Diana and Cait fed, so I died a few times, but still landed an A; 236 seconds of ult cooldown reduced) 3/10/20\n\nThird game {{champion:99}} \n(Early surrender; I dominated a Sion/Kai Sa lane but died twice it a Xin Zhao team fed. Still reduced ult 176 seconds, and outdpsed every player on BOTH teams, took a whopping 7k damage, shielded away over 21k) 3/2/6\n\nThese are support performances.\n\nSomething I DID notice is..... I was about 1300 less gold in these games than I used to be. Even if I had the highest KDA. The 4 per 10 down to 1 per 10 really will screw any support whose using a different rune build for damage outputs and gold accrual. \n\nThe reason I was doing so well is..... Cut Down. Sorcery and Domination doesn't have a rune like it, and Enchanter supports have low HP. So, I was abusing that fact to really lay on amplified damage. The larger a Sion gets from eating those large minions, the more Cut down hurts him. The Larger a Darius gets in his build, the more Lux can hurt him. The larger a Ornn gets, the more a Nami can hurt him, etc.\n\nThe reason I had such trouble with the Zyra game wasn't because the runes were weak; It's because I normally run Relentless hunter on her for move speed. The other team had a Diana that was pretty good at throwing her ults in and diving on Zyra's delay, and once Cait gets some move speed, she too can outrun Zyra. So.... I was basically trading move speed for more damage, which Zyra doesn't really need. So there is sometimes a small tradeoff.\n\nBut yeah.... on a lot of champs, this Presence of mind is OP. I can easily get 6 minutes of Ult cooldown removal with my playstyles.  That's huge. I don't think games will reach 40-50 min marks anymore if this rune stays as it is.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-04-05T07:29:16.687+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, ult CD only matters if \nA your an ult relient champ like malz/malphite, or,\nB your ultimate CD comes up before teamfights.

Realistic ress timers are 20-30 seconds, at which point you're already bombing a base.\n\nIn the Nami game I was initiating a fight nearly every 40 seconds, which just didn't give Nocturne/Viegar/Tryn time to react. Pressure Pressure.\n\nI play Nami like one trick carries play Kha Zix or Jarvan. I know my angles, and can shut down 3-4 opposing team members at once, and bubbles are near 100% hits when I'm not zoning bot lane or trying to make them feel secure that I miss skill shots. That means I usually have a 60% of greater kill participation. Even higher if I got out of lane early and go carry a neutral top who hasn't been trading kills.\n\nThe only champs that I think don't benefit from this rune are those who :\n\n1) have no inherent sustain from local sources (mages who don't use Fleet Footwork or life steal for example, and don't have heals in their kit)\n\n2) Non Mana Champions (Runes shift them over to Triumph, so this is an unintended nerf)\n\n3) Have no cooldown on their ults because of some specialized kit like {{champion:77}} 's.\n\nIt affects the pace of the game on champs who do not have to recall.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Harden Stepback","date":"2018-04-05T06:32:23.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice propaganda","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-04-05T07:08:23.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try it before you knock it.

You should EASILY be able to proc Presence of mind. Takedowns are when you contribute to a kill, which can be when you global ult.... so if a top lane is in a skirmish, you heal him, that counts if he manages the kill.\n\n2) If you take a Legend, Assists count as 1 stack of 10 for each. Drake kills also count as 1. I don't know why you think it's weak.\n\nAnd also, you can take Cut Down or Coup De Gras for greater lane harass. \n\nIt's not a dead rune unless you let it be, and a core part of Soraka's kit is to use Q to sustain yourself. if you're just spamming W into your own annihilation, you're doing it wrong.\n\n3) Revitalize is overrated. AP scaling on Sorcery is far great enough to compensate, and I haven't used it once since the rune change because it's quite frankly worse than Domination's Taste of Blood/Ravenous Hunter at sustaining self, and enchanter KITS have enough heals to heal teammates when itemized and played correctly. I can pull 900 heals on {{champion:267}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:16}} . You most likely cap out at about a 350 heal, unless your ult doubles.\n\n4) Ingenious Hunter can be useful for a support that goes active items, but active items all come at the cost of kit utility. I know you are fixated on healing buff passives, but AP builds heal the SAME as healing item builds, AND amplify the rest of your kit. If you can get enough gold to actually run certain AP builds, you should always run them. The Move speed bonuses attributed to AP are no joke, as are the damage buffs, and the increased base heals (that doesn't mean you don't get a {{item:3504}} ofc; that's still an AP item). So with Ingenious hunter, you're basically deciding:\n\nDo I want highly reduced ult cooldowns, or do I want highly reduced item cooldowns, on items with long cooldowns and a 1-2 second temporary buff? It's your choice, but the ult will win more games, and result in less deaths.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ivern and Irelia","date":"2018-04-05T05:30:02.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is already what ive been running since the rune/mastery update","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mhihnj","date":"2018-04-05T04:10:16.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"60% Less CD on Karthus ultimate lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venomar","date":"2018-04-05T03:42:24.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I honestly don't know what they were thinking adding ult reduction to two different trees.

The only Champs who won't use this are the ones who have flicker ults or are gated behind other mechanics as you mentioned, or the ones who are forced into inspiration because they basically require a flash to function.\n\nI'll gladly trade free boots and some biscuits for a 20-30 second ult cooldown on most Champs.\n\nShits Dumb.
