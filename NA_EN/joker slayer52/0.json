It won&#039;t let me reconnect. Also, after it scans the now quarantined file and marks it as clean and I restore it, when I try to reconnect the same alert pops up and the quarantine process begins again.\r\n\r\nVideo / Screenshot: https://imgur.com/DN7KsbZ\r\nSteps to reproduce: Have Avira antivirus. Wait until everyone has locked in their champion and wait for the game to begin.\r\n\r\nExpected result: Game should start normally as it did before this patch.\r\n\r\nObserved result: Game won&#039;t start. Antivirus alert will pop up.

Also they never really have problems with antivirus, its just the new anti cheat patch that reads the LoL data, which gets spotted by some of the antivirus programs, which they didnt know propably.\nAnd since they already contacted the antivirus companies, relax and wait till tomorrow and it will most likey be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Asmodious","date":"2018-06-28T21:35:31.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you implement such system, you at least check on most famous antivirus like avira...
