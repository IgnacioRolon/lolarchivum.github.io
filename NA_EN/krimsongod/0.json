So when you say \"type\" what you mean is...it's different......because you can't compare three things in an analogy?.....sounds pretty anal to me.....even then, comparison doesn't have multiple types as a comparison is literally only \"the act of comparing\" so while analogy is specific, comparison is not, therefore it has no specific types.....A Great Dane is a dog, a dog is not necessarily a Great Dane.....I'm not following your point. Are you just trying really hard to attempt to sound smarter than other people by using words and phrasing that would come off as remotely intellectual to a layman in order to manipulate people into blindly following what you say under the assumption that you know more than them?","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2019-05-02T16:06:50.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that last part came out of nowhere.
