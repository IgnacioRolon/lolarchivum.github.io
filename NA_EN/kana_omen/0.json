In the past, the media focused on games like Halo because of how people treated each other in multiplayer. League of Legends has surpassed that community in toxicity.\n\nMy last bit is wondering how you are so unaware of this fact that you're bewildered by the toxicity in the community, like putting your hand in a fire and being surprised you were burned, and then I insulted your intelligence by implying if you were unaware of that, I'd expect you to build AP on Urgot and think it was a good build.","replies":[{"poster":"KANA omeN","date":"2015-02-16T03:35:03.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Toxic\" is the word used by the players I'm talking about.
