It wasn't fun, it wasn't fair, and thank god it was changed.\nTanks used to be able to walk into three or more people, kill a mage with their Sunfire by standing next to them, then revive and do it all over again.\n\nDo you remember why people didn't play bruisers for the longest time? Because tanks could take 3 times the punishment while dealing as much damage as the bruisers. GA enabled a lot of that, giving a free extra life on top of the large sustainability that MR/Armor+HP provide.\n\nEven if it's just 3000 HP, the item gave 60 armor and 45 MR plus 30% max HP upon revival, and stats piled on top of a large HP pool go a long way and you wanna add a revive on top of that??\n\nIf you go back to the {{item:1031}} {{item:1057}} build, then what is an ADC supposed to build against assassins? Just waste a spot for a fully defensive item that doesn't even work as well since they don't even build that much HP? And if you're gonna reply to this you'll need to give me more than the usual _\"REEEEEEEEE ADC OP REEEEEEE\"_ stuff a lot of people do in these boards. And no, PD is just not enough in some games.\n\nBuilding anything defensive as a carry feels horrible, but in this one-shot meta is necessary.

It's easier to close the gap between champions if you can hinder their ability to move backwards by placing a smart Q.\n\nI didn't say much about W outside of it's damage, but I'll just say one thing: Don't underestimate 2 seconds of Silence on which you cannot flash, since in the next 1 second you might fly in the air via Q.

My R is back in like 30 seconds! I'll play passive and only trade for that time and then I'll think about all-in!\" And you do, and you have second Feast stack. Ofc. I didn't do precise math to that, but I am sure that similar outcome of this situation is far from being farfetched, especially that Cho'Gaths these days would preferr the CDR items like Kindlegem, Glacial Shroud or even Fiendish Codex to get those sweet free Feast stacks up and running.\n\nAnd then there's Transcendence, scaling CDR and the Ravenous Hunter for even more Feast CDR.

They're dealing a ton more damage, but back in \"the good ol days\" tanks were durable front liners that contributed by physically blocking space and with CC, not with constant damage. Killing a tank twice meant they were doing their job even longer: tanking.\n\nAnd right now, adcs(and ad fighters like Irelia) can still build both GA and lifesteal, a lot of them don't have to choose. they rez, kill an enemy, and are back to full health like nothing even happened. There should be a sacrifice given for a second life, and when they can get a full BF sword attached to their rez, the sacrifice of an item slot isn't really there. Many seasons ago, it was standard for ALL champions to buy one full defensive item because building glass cannon (All AD/all AP) was risky. Now everyone builds glass cannon and just blows up whoever is faster.\n\nI don't think just a GA revert is enough though, I think several changes would need to be made to tank items so that Tanks are tanking again, and so that squishies aren't melting anything in range.","replies":[{"poster":"OtterlyLost","date":"2019-05-14T21:36:11.881+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"No, killing a tank twice meant that you died the second time because you blew all of your CD's trying to do it the first time.
