But something weird happened. I clicked the play button but nothing happened. I kept pressing until i got a demoted screen from gold 3 to gold 4. I was like no way I got demoted since i got 20 LP in gold 3. Also my team, which I dont know them, lost so much league point in one game. Lost like 45 lp... Is there anything I can do to report it to riot?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-03T21:12:08.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account and it seems the following happened: You were promoted to Gold III, you played through your 3 games under temporary shield (prevention from demotion), then eventually dropped below 0 LP. At this point, the system placed you in the right division based on your MMR (matchmaking rating) and the most recent matches you played.

And I was stated about the play button didn't let me in the lobby, that is when the message of demotion happened... Not sure this is clear enough for you but I am positive that with 20LP I would lose like 19LP or less but I lost like 45LP. Could this be a bug or something?","replies":[]}]}]}
