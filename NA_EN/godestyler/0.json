If you press Control + 3 Snowday Bard make some moves and starts dancing without his music. He moves to the left, to the right and after his second move to the left the music starts to play. It&#039;s just the Snowday Bard Skin. The dance by the other skin (Elderwood Bard) works normal as the vanilla skin.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-31T20:25:04.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey GodeStyler -\n\nThanks for the report!
