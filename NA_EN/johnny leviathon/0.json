Like PRONTO. Mid game or on Load screen I get \"Essential Game particles missing\" or just don't connect and have to restart my client. I've BEGGED, and contacted support 11 times now. WITH ZERO RESPONSE OR HELP and now I am on a 6 month suspension because of YOUR screw ups and inability to fix or alter the leaver buster to show when someone comes back to game, or show when it is a client issue and not due to rage quitting.\r\n\r\nFIX THIS.\r\n\r\nThe League community has been BEGGING you to fix these issues and instead you alter Masteries and REALLY screw up the game. Wow GET YOUR PRIORITIES RIGHT!!! YOU ARE LETTING DOWN THE LEAGUE COMMUNITY!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-12T23:25:22.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Johnny Leviathon, \n\nI have had the same issue before and it isn't fun, so I can understand where you are coming from.
