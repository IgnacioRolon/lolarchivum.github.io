If you're burning through 70g to get something no one else is looking for, you're pretty much guaranteed to get it.  On the other hand if you're trying to find something that 4 people already have 2 Silvers+ of, you're probably not going to find it no matter how many times you re-roll, because it's not in the pool.  Finally, you need to understand your current level and how that relates to the probabilities.  If you've got 2 Silver Vaynes, you want to re-roll a lot after Krugs if possible, because that's when the highest likelihood of of Tier 1 champions is.  On the other hand, if you are trying to get Anivia, you don't want to start re-rolling for her until you're higher level, at least level 6, but really 7 or 8.  She doesn't even have a chance to appear until level 6.\n\nCan you re-roll 70g in the right conditions and still not get what you're looking for?  Sure, but it's not a coinflip.  If you're re-rolling under the right conditions you're much more likely to get what you're looking for.  If not, you may be SOL no matter how much gold you burn through.","replies":[{"poster":"Devilreaper XIII","date":"2019-08-03T08:47:04.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Subdue,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=xQ73QBxO,comment-id=00000000000100000000,timestamp=2019-08-02T14:00:20.107+0000)\n>\n> You can see what other people are gathering, and by extension, what should be available in the pool.
