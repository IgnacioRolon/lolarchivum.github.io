It starts not responding, and I have to try and force it to close... With the emphasis on 'try'. Task manager can't do it, not via the Applications tab nor via the Processes tab. I tried 'taskkill /im leagueclient.exe /f' in CMD - and it can't find the process.\r\n\r\nThe important thing is this: Once I open League, my computer just starts REFUSING TO COOPERATE. Any program I try to open gets immediately stuck in the best case; or refuses to open altogether in the worst case. No matter what, though, every single program leaves a \"ghost process\" when I attempt to open it.\r\n\r\nThis has been going on for a few days now - first only when I started a game, but now whenever I open the client. The only way to revert this is to force shutdown the computer, because the shutdown/restart button doesn't work as well. Uninstalled and reinstalled to no avail.\r\n\r\nHas this happened to anyone else? Is there a solution to this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-10T21:51:56.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it seems like your pc is really having a hard time with league for whatever reason.

This time it got stuck after the ~~Victory~~ Defeat screen, and I couldn't press \"Continue\". \n\nStrangely, it happened when I tried to launch Overwatch as well, so maybe it has to do with games and other \"heavy\" programs in general.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
