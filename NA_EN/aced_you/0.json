Also, before the game freezes, a really loud crackling noise occurs and that's when I know it is about to freeze. Anybody have any ideas on what's going on here?","replies":[{"poster":"JenStark","date":"2016-08-21T21:26:29.846+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I came here to report the same problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-21T23:33:07.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This issue is generally caused by the Xbox Game DVR feature that was packaged inside of the Windows 10 Anniversary update.

This was driving me nuts, I could not figure out what was going on.  Was crazy, friends were spectating me and for them the entire game was frozen too.
