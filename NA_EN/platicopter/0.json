It seems that when he is relatively far away from the soldier (roughly just outside his own auto-attack range if he were to attack the solder) he cannot order the soldier to attack, even if a minion or champion is within the small range circle around the soldier. I&#039;ve played a few games with Azir and have been seeing thing pretty consistently. I would place the soldier in a minion wave, move back a bit, but still in the tether range so the soldier lives, and clicking on the minions will do nothing (Azir won&#039;t move to attack them, and the soldier won&#039;t attack them as well)","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2015-07-08T04:50:47.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if Azir is close enough so that the soldiers don't die, that doesn't mean that he can use the soldier to attack. You have to be within a certain range of the soldiers (I think it's like around 750 or 800 range) in order to use them to attack, but the range to just keep them alive is a bit larger than that.","replies":[{"poster":"Platicopter","date":"2015-07-08T06:15:36.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I figured that might be the case, the tooltip on the ability should reflect that though. It currently says that he can attack regardless of the range and doesn't mention a limit at all. It would be nice if there was a range indicator and mention of this limit on the ability itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-07-08T10:13:21.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The soldier goes into an Idle animation when they are out of range from Azir.
