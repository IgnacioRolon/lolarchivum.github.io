We can take a look at your route during the affected periods of time, but first, we need to ensure your local settings are good to go. To do this, I recommend working through the steps in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), as local network settings can exacerbate latency issues.\n\nLet me know if your latency issue persists.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Suguto","date":"2016-09-14T07:39:47.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't know but it's on their side.
