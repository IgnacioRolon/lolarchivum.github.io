I know it’s his fault for being stupid and giving away his username and password, so im no trying to defend him. So, after pondering about his situation for a while, I thought of an idea that can stop the messing up of ranked scores:\r\n\r\nCreating a short password/keyword (must be different from login password) that you must use when you want to play a ranked game or buy a new champion, rune, skin, etc. By doing this, it will allow people that have your username and password to not be able to spent your hard-earned ip and rp and not be able to play ranked games. In addition, you must type in that password when changing masteries and runes. I know that it might be annoying to some people to have to type everything in when you want to do anything, but it will highly raise security in your account. Thank you for reading and gave me your comments and feedback below!","replies":[{"poster":"Kao Atlantis","date":"2015-01-17T22:32:13.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a creative way to solve the problem. However, Riot already solved this problem by making Account Sharing not allowed for any reason under the Terms of Use. It is a bannable offense.\n\nYou can find the rules in the [Terms of Use](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse) in section III, subsections C and D.\n\n> C. In creating an Account, you will be required to select a unique username and password (collectively, “Login Credentials”), which you will use each time you access the Game. You may not share your Account with anyone other than as expressly set forth herein, and you are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Login Credentials and for any and all activities (including purchases and charges, as applicable) that are conducted through your Account. Please notify Riot Games immediately if you become aware of any breach of security, including any loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure of your Login Credentials.\n---\n> D. Account Sales. The Account supplied to you is personal to you, and Riot Games does not recognize and expressly forbids the transfer of user Accounts. You shall not purchase, sell, gift or trade any Account, or make any such offer, and any attempt shall be null and void. A**ny distribution by you of your Account and/or your Login Credentials** (except as expressly provided herein or otherwise explicitly approved of by Riot Games) **may result in suspension or termination of your Account.**\n\nI would recommend you tell your friend to change his password immediately to prevent this from continuing. Your friend can do that [here](https://account.leagueoflegends.com/change-password/na/en-us).","replies":[{"poster":"A Sneaky Snek","date":"2015-01-18T06:58:56.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for you valuable input! While Riot has clearly stated that the sharing of accounts is unacceptable, this is still an issue which will probably never be resolved. Many new players are being scammed with web-sites that promise ‘Free RP if you type in your username and password!’, or ‘Free Level/ELO boost if you type in your username and password!’. I just thought that that would be a kind of... extra security against the scamming of newer players. Thank you for you time and valuable input!","replies":[{"poster":"Kao Atlantis","date":"2015-01-18T07:15:34.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good news, Riot is on the list of companies that is in the process of implementing two-factor authentication.
