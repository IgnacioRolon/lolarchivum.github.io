This is the first season I&#039;ve taken climbing seriously. I&#039;ve gone from mid B1 to B3 and back several times but, never quite able to break into Silver. \r\n\r\nI rarely ever lose lane when I go mid, I try to be as helpful and get as many objectives as possible when I play jungle, and when I&#039;m support I do everything I can to make my team successful. And I almost always have a positive KDA. \r\n\r\nBut. Nothing. Seems. To. Work. And it&#039;s so frustrating. I&#039;m ready to give up on ranked all together.\r\n\r\nNow, I know with what I&#039;m about to say people will reply with &quot;don&#039;t point the finger at others&quot;, but I&#039;ve had so many games that no matter what I do my team feeds, gives up lane and/or objectives, or afk&#039;s etc. I rarely ever have a solid team that has game knowledge.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m starting to think that climbing has more luck involved with who you are matched with than actual skill in the game. It feels like the match making system is really broken. Do you agree? If not, I&#039;d love to hear how you were able to climb.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-09-01T13:45:05.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Step back for a sec.  Pick a replay of a game you lost but don't understand why (not a game where you think there was an enemy smurf, but a FAIR game you think you should have won).  Play the replay.\n\nI only want you to watch for ONE thing: the sidelanes.  Don't even glance at the champions.\nThey don't matter.\n\n**Count how many times do the minions reach the side-lane towers in big piles with no-one there to clear them**.  You need to expect those waves, ping them out, and get someone to catch them by blue-pinging it 30 seconds before it gets there.  Don't fight if a big wave is pushing to you, but if a big wave is going to them, go ham.  Even if you lose the fight, you'll likely still win or at least go even due to minion dmg.","replies":[{"poster":"DankDaddyDizzle","date":"2017-09-01T14:36:28.428+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your thoughtful feedback. I do this actually. But this reminds me of a game I had yesterday. We just got baron buff. Went top because the inhib was open, but the minions were pushed to river. I split to push minions to enemy base, my team split and went straight to the inhib and all died. They couldn't wait for the minions to catch up, and I even pinged and typed in chat to not fight without the minions. It cost us the game.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-09-01T18:09:46.509+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You guys didn't back after baron to buy elixers and stuff?  Kinda strange imo :/\nLater in the game it's best to stay with the team.  We both now they will either fight or get jumped on once the enemy team sees you're not with them.\n\nAs a general rule, towers > inhib.  Towers don't respawn but inhibs do.\nTry to get them to take a second lane's towers through blue pings.\nI've found it helps not to type.  (To them they're always right)\nUse blue pings instead (the ones that don't show who you are) for stuff.\n\n-basically #1 thing:\nPretend your team is a bunch of cats.  They follow laserpointers^^\"","replies":[{"poster":"DankDaddyDizzle","date":"2017-09-01T22:29:00.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We did back, I just left that part out. And I had never considered Towers being greater than inhibs. That's a great point! And yeah I need to learn not to type at all during the game and rely solely on pings. My gutt says I win more games when I just ping...\n\nLove the Cat analogy too lol","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Frightning","date":"2017-09-01T15:39:00.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really wish there was an easy way to share replays, because the I could just watch 1-2 of your games that way and probably give you some useful and specific feedback, but riot still hasn't made sharing replays easy for reasons I don't understand.","replies":[{"poster":"DankDaddyDizzle","date":"2017-09-01T15:47:48.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish that were possible too!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2017-09-01T15:03:01.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both of the other responses here have some good points.\n\nIt is sometimes really hard to understand how to get better. There have been several times (I've been playing for 5 years) that I felt really hard-stuck in a bracket, and it truly felt like when I finally got out that I hadn't actually been doing anything differently.\n\nThat isn't true, though. When I play against people from those tiers now, I see that I've improved in a lot of the areas that people rarely point out. Simple things like positioning, holding skillshots instead of using them to poke on cooldown, poking at the right times, wave management, vision, map awareness, etc. \n\nThere are *so many moving parts* in League of Legends, and I think that's *why* many people say that you should watch one game at a time and try to understand what your mistakes were in that game. Sometimes you weren't watching the map. Sometimes you went for a stupid baron. Sometimes you went in and died with a teammate who was *obviously* out of position. It takes improvement on all of that stuff to climb, imo.","replies":[{"poster":"DankDaddyDizzle","date":"2017-09-01T15:15:27.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I appreciate your thoughts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BALDG1VEN BOOMER","date":"2017-09-01T14:58:51.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you rarely lose lane then you're not pushing your individual lead hard enough.","replies":[{"poster":"DankDaddyDizzle","date":"2017-09-01T15:13:25.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could be right, and this may be something I should look into.
