Did fairly well. As did everyone EXCEPT this fucking cho'gath.\nAt around 28 minutes in the game. I as the jungler delegated blue buff to be more effective on our assassin Leblanc mid laner, rather than our front line tank cho'gath top-lane. Having seen that I gave the blue to the Leblanc after ferociously pinging that he was on the way to blue buff and saying that he wanted it. He proceeded, to mindlessly afk split push top and bot lane. Getting caught endlessly. Making this game a 4v5. We were steam rolling this shit. Had all towers down except for the two nexus turrets. He did this for roughly 25-30 minutes. Until he managed to snake the blue buff from Leblanc and then he grouped. Where he 4-5 shot by the enemy Vayne. Then Vayne proceeded to ruthlessly ass fuck the rest of my team. Everyone on my team reported him for this. This my fellow league players. Is why the league of legends community is the way it is. Because of dog shit children. That ruin the game for the rest of the people on their team. Because they did not get a fucking buff. The shit that this cho'gath pulled. which caused me and another player on my team to get demoted is the reason league of legends has the worst fucking community in gaming history. I used to think call of duty held that titled. But I have officially re-thought my opinion and given that title to League Of Legends. People like this Cho'gath. Should have their accounts permanently banned from this game. Because their passive aggressive bullshit. Fucks this game up. They do not deserve to play this fucking game.\n\nYes this is an extremely overboard rant. Pardon the language. Kill the thread if it's too much Rito.\n\nUPDATE!\nSAID PIECE OF SHIT CHO'GATH WAS PUNISHED BY THE TRIBUNAL FOR BEING THE GIGANTIC BAG OF DICKS THAT LOST MY TEAM\nTHAT GAME. GOOD FUCKING JOB RIOT.","replies":[{"poster":"AbyssionKnight","date":"2016-06-30T16:49:18.304+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":5,"body":"So I'm torn on this. \n\nOn the one hand, I completely agree that he sounds like a spoiled brat and should be punished. \n\nOn the other hand though, it sounds like your whole team threw the match, not just him, and you're placing all the blame on him anyway. \n\nIf you were stomping the game as hard as you claim, then you should have still been able to take objectives. He's pushing bot and drawing 1 or 2 of them? Great, go to baron. Bait that shit, and if they don't come for you take it. If they do head your way just back off of it, and now Cho has some extra time to pressure bot. Baron not up? Go grab that top inhib. If you're all dramatically far ahead you should be able to manage a 4v4, especially if they send vayne bot to deal with  Cho. If he's top same thing, except focus on bot inhib or elder. It sounds to me like you guys were afraid to fight without Cho, and as a result you let the enemy back into the game through cs in their base, and attacking Cho without the rest of you really doing anything to stop it. \n\nThere's also the fact you could have given Cho what he wanted. I know giving spoiled people what they want is only going to encourage them to do it again, but if you have control of your jungle and theirs, you have two blue buffs. So, who was getting the second blue? Were you, the jungler, taking it? Were you giving it to the support? The instant you see Cho being a little whiny baby, you should have talked to him. Don't call him names, don't insult him, just ask him why he's not grouping with the team.  When he tells you it's because he wanted blue, explain that you feel it's better on a fed LB, but that if he groups with all of you, you'll help make sure he can take the enemy blue.  Just like that you've most likely defused the entire situation. I'd still report the hell out of him after the game, but if I was serious about playing ranked, and some of us were at risk of being demoted, I'd never intentionally do whatever it is that's making Cho help the enemy team get back into the game. \n\nSo while I sympathise with your pain, and agree it's a problem, from what I've seen in your post, as a team the rest of you handled it poorly. As you said this is a team game, and in a team game you're only as strong as your weakest player.  So don't tilt them further, help them, even if inside you just want to beat the shit out of them irl.","replies":[{"poster":"Gentleman Cho","date":"2016-06-30T21:36:22.445+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"IVE BEEN FRAMED{{champion:31}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"King of Mongoose","date":"2016-06-30T20:40:03.352+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"their chogath had the second most damage on their team so he must have been doing something\n\ndidn't deserve punishment imo","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2016-06-30T21:09:18.836+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is a weak argument.\nDoesn't matter how much damage they dealt if that damage is not being dealt to the right person and at the right time.

You take your weakest teamfighter or the member who got rekt (Vayne in this example is a good candidate) and camp them in the lane vs the Cho. They get freefarm pushed into them and potentially kills, while your team can 4v4 their team with no threat of Cho'gath support. Even better, you put the toplaner with TP against cho'gath and 4v5 every teamfight.\n\nIt's super duper easy to look at a scenario and say \"you should've just done better\" but this game isn't in a vacuum, and how the enemy team responded is important. Someone solo splitpushing forever away from their team and never grouping up is what I PRAY FOR on the enemy team when we start losing, because it's so, so easy to stall the game out and force a throw from that position.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-07-01T09:26:24.533+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"welp, i was in the same case as OP and i did as the player here replied in more of a case, and it worked.\n\nI reported the shit outta those players, but diplomacy can lend itself on great lenghts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"President Swa1n","date":"2016-07-01T17:53:00.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He already addressed this.

All his skills are AoE except his ulti, which is still encouraged to use on minions to beef himself up.\n\n2. Cho did fine. His end line was 12/10/7, meanwhile Cait's was 14/12/8. If he splitpushed a bit, it sure didn't effect his score much, as he'd at least be lacking assists from the rest of them (particularly with the \"we were holding up quite well 4v5\" claim). Looking at the game's progress, he almost never took a death without getting a kill meanwhile, and often contributed in the same timeline the 4 were going at it.\n\nI see too much toxicity to believe anything at face value. The fact of the matter is that his stats don't show blatant team disregard, even if splitpushing were considered to be that. I can't say for certain what happened, but looking at the game's length and team's progress throughout the game, he *might* have missed one big battle toward the end, possibly holding a lane, and suddenly he's the sickness that caused the loss.
