I've been trying to sleep but I couldn't because I had a champion idea in mind. We don't really have a dagger dual wielder in League of Legends and the closest we get would be Katarina but she's not really that assassin fantasy that I have in mind. So here's my champion concept:\n\n**Dristor** (Open to name suggestions)\n_The Hextech Assassin_\nZaun/Piltover\n(Tell me any lane suggestions. I was thinking jungle)\n\n**Stats:**\nHealth: 532 (+94 per level)\nDamage: 58 (+4 per level)\nAttack Speed: NaN (+3.5% per level)\nMovement Speed: 345\nHealth Regen: 9 (+1 per level)\nArmor: 32 (+4.25 per level)\nMagic Resist: 32 (+1.25 per level)\n\n**Passive: Secrets of the Trade**\n\nWalking near walls gives Dristor camouflage outside of combat (5 seconds out of combat, -0.15 seconds per level). (Works like Talyiah passive)\nEnemy Takedowns (Kills and Assists) give Dristor 15% (+5% per level) more gold.\n~~Level 6~~ If Dristor gains an assist on an enemy with a bounty, he receives gold equal to 40% (+3.5% per level) of that bounty. If he picks up the bounty (Gets the kill), he receives 15% (+5% per level) more gold.\n\n**Dagger Rush**\n_Cooldown:_ 14/12/10/8/6\n_Mana:_ 70/75/80/85/90\n_Range:_ 700\n\nDristor dashes forward, daggers in front, dealing 60/110/160/210/260 Physical Damage (+80% of bonus AD) to all enemies along the way and applying a poison for 100/150/200/250/210 Physical Damage over 2.5 seconds (+300/325/350/375/400% of Lethality). While poisoned, the enemy is Grounded.\n\nNote: Minions and Monsters are stunned instead.\n\n**Dice Em!**\n_Cooldown:_ 7/6.25/5.5/4.75/4\n_Mana_: 60/65/70/75/80\n_Range_: 400\n\nSlash in front of you with both daggers dealing 60/100/140/180/220 (+90% of AD, +100% of Lethality) Physical Damage two times and slowing all enemies by 50% for 2/2.25/2.5/2.75/3 seconds with a motory poison. Each of the two attacks has a 15/25/35/45/55% chance to critically strike. Triggers on hit effects.\n\nNote: Unaffected by Critical Strike Chance\n\n**Hextech Daggers**\nCooldown: 16/14.5/12/10.5/9\nMana: 80\n_Passive:_ Your Hextech Daggers draw the life of your enemy with every attack, draining 2%/2.5%/3%/3.5%/4% of the enemy's Max Health (+2.5% of AP) as magic damage while giving half of it to Dristor. \n_Active:_ Heat your daggers with hextech energy gaining 7/12/17/22/27 lethality (+10% of your bonus AD).\n\n**Marked for Death**\n_Cooldown: 150/120/90_\n_Mana_: 0\n_Range_: 1600\nMark an enemy champion for death for 7 seconds. During this time, you gain 35/50/65% increased movement speed toward your marked target, your Seep Life ability's effects are doubled against the marked target and your damage against the target is increased by 20/27.5/35%. Your camouflage works in combat for the duration. \nIf the marked target dies within the 7 seconds, gain 33%/66%/100% more gold from the Takedown and extend all effects by an additional 7 seconds considering all other enemy champions marked for the extended duration. Killing a second marked champion doesn't extend the duration but refunds 35/42.5/50% of your ultimate's cooldown.\n\n\n\nAll values are subject to change, suggestions and feedback are highly appreciated. Is he broken? Is he unfun? Does something not make sense? Is he really weak? Or maybe even overburdened with mechanics? Tell me!\nThanks for taking the time to discover my Champion Concept!\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Rektagon","date":"2019-08-27T13:44:49.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Passive: Secrets of the Trade\nWalking near walls gives Dristor camouflage outside of combat (5 seconds out of combat, -0.15 seconds per level). (Works like Talyiah passive)\nEnemy Takedowns (Kills and Assists) give Dristor 15% (+5% per level) more gold.\nLevel 6 Dristor gains gold equal to 35% (+5% per level) of the gold claimed from bounties by his allies.\n\nI don't see how this relates to Hextech...but alright.\nI think you might need to work on the percentages; 35% gold might be too much, especially for fights he's not involved in. Perhaps change it so he has to be responsible for a certain % of the damage dealt to be eligible for bonus gold? It'd encourage less idle play and more active participation in teamfights, for as it stands he can be in another place at another point in time and still reap the rewards of an assist or better. Not fair on his team.\n\n>Dagger Rush\nCooldown: 14/12/10/8/6\nMana: 70/75/80/85/90\nRange: 700\nDristor dashes forward, daggers in front, dealing 60/110/160/210/260 Physical Damage (+80% of bonus AD, +200/225/250/275/300% of Lethality) to all enemies along the way and applying a bleed for 50/90/130/170/210 Physical Damage over 3/2.75/2.5/2.25/2 seconds (+300/325/350/375/400% of Lethality).\n\nWtf are those lethality scalings? Relax mate. The bonus AD and base damage are OK, but for something that looks like it's meant to be a trading tool (it's on his Q) the scalings are ridiculous. Secondly, the bleed is...well, even worse than the actual damage, which doesn't make sense since it's meant to be additional DoT. Assassins aren't generally DoT champions, so, like {{champion:105}}, any 'bleed' damage should be secondary to his Q burst.\n\n>Dice Em!\nCooldown: 7/6.25/5.5/4.75/4\nMana: 60\nRange: 400\n\nSlash in front of you with both daggers dealing 60/100/140/180/220 (+90% of AD, +100% of Lethality) Physical Damage two times and slowing all enemies by 30/40/50/60/70% for 2/2.25/2.5/2.75/3 seconds. Each of the two attacks has a 15/25/35/45/55% chance to critically strike. Triggers on hit effects.\n\nIf the damage racks up, the slow shouldn't, otherwise it's too much for an ability that only costs 60 mana. That's nothing in the late-game.\n\n>(Passive) Seep Life\nYour Hextech Daggers seep the life of your enemy with every attack, draining 2%/2.5%/3%/3.5%/4% of the enemy's Max Health (+2.5% of AP) as magic damage while giving it to Dristor.\nLanding the killing blow on a minion or monster restores 2/3/4/5/6% of your maximum Health. May only occur once every 1 second.\n\n\"May only occur once every one second\"\nThat's still rather frequent, you know.\n\nSecondly, uh...he's an assassin with built-in lifesteal? And can regen health via farming? Isn't this why {{champion:84}} Akali's Q got nerfed, because she was healing too much for her class?\n\n>Marked for Death\nCooldown: 120/90/60\nMana: 0\nRange: 1600\nMark an enemy champion for death for 15 seconds. During this time, you gain 35/50/65% increased movement speed toward your marked target, your Seep Life ability's effects are doubled against the marked target and your damage against the target is increased by 20/27.5/35%. Your camouflage works in combat for the duration.\nIf the marked target dies within the 15 seconds, gain 33%/66%/100% more gold from the Takedown and extend all effects by an additional 15 seconds considering all other enemy champions marked for the extended duration. Killing a second marked champion doesn't extend the duration but refunds 35/42.5/50% of your ultimate's cooldown.\n\n15 seconds, with possibly extension to 30 seconds, is way too long for an ability that shares functions with {{champion:238}} Zed R...even {{champion:92}} Riven's ult only lasts 15, and {{champion:50}} Swain's ult only lasts 10 despite being DoT.\n\nAlso, as an assassin, he should be forced to make quick decisions, not play safely around timings with little counterplay. Reducing the window to 5-6 seconds punishes him more harshly for not marking at the right time, or the right target, especially given the ability is free.\n\nIn short, I see little kit cohesion, and little thematic cohesion - but the potential for growth. We don't have a hextech assassin yet. Think about the origins of this character a lot more, because I get a Noxus vibe out of this more than Piltover/Zaun. Also, look at other assassins for balance guidelines.\n\n~Rektagon","replies":[{"poster":"majoc","date":"2019-08-27T17:16:32.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is what I thought thematically when I made this \nby the way:\n\nPassive: This is not a Zaun thing, its more of an Assassin thing. However, the stealth near walls is due to Hextech tech that allows him to look like he's not there from the distance.\nQ: Gap closer, uses a Zaunian poison to reduce enemy's motory ability while they are poisoned. (Grounded)\nW: His burst and main source of damage, applies on-hit effects, triggers twice, slows enemies by poisoning them with a Movement Reducing poison. (Slowed)\nE: His Hextech Daggers allow him to Seep the enemy's Life Force with every attack, dealing max HP damage and healing Dristor.\nR: Puts a death Mark on an enemy and artificially enhances himself with Hextech when fighting said enemy. Killing the enemy fills up his Hextech energy allowing him to use this enhancer upon everyone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"majoc","date":"2019-08-27T17:07:19.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the elaborate feedback!

The bonus gold generation makes sense for something like Pyke, who is supposed to be a support assassin and supports are limited in gold.\n\nIf you want to make this champion a jungler assassin, I think it would be a good idea to give them some telegraphed CC to support them in ganks. All modern junglers nowadays get some form of hard CC to enable ganks (and it also helps with taking scuttle crab).","replies":[{"poster":"majoc","date":"2019-08-27T17:08:54.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Katarina just doesn't fit the bill for me.
