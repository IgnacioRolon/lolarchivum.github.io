But this time, they work a little differently:** in previous seasons, placement games were way more impactful than regular season games.** Challenger players could lose all ten games and end up in Silver during the 2014 placements, while Bronze players could go on lucky winning sprees and end up in Plat before getting their butts kicked repeatedly until they fell a few tiers. Neither of these are good experiences, so while this year’s placements are still important, they won’t cause established players to swing as far up or down because of good or bad luck. **Your placement will still be heavily influenced by where you ended up last season.** If you’ve never played ranked, then your form in your placements will be all that matters!\nFinally, with the pretty substantial changes that preseason brought, we figured that everyone should have a fresh opportunity to rise to the top. Because of that, we’re again running a soft reset to player position with the start of the ranked season,** meaning you’ll likely place lower than where you ended the previous season.**\n\nSilver 4 to bronze 1? sounds like OP made it out alright compared to the other placement QQ stories I have been reading...I fully expect to place in a lower division than the previous season...But I'm certain MMR has something to do with it and not your division... http://na.op.gg/ check your mmr before the reset and after...the soft reset was on the divisions on not the actual players...
