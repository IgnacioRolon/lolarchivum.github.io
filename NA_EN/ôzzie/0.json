I&#039;ve tried OCE server and my ping is around 180-200 which is borderline unplayable.\r\n\r\nI love this game and have thrown quite a bit of money at it. But since the servers moved, this game is basically unplayable. This game can be frustrating even with a zero ping... Since the servers have moved, I now have an NA server ping of about 180-200. I don&#039;t know what to do. I can&#039;t play on Korea Servers because you need a KSN (Korean Serial Number like our SSN in USA), just to make an account or get on their servers. I&#039;m on a gig fiber connection and have awesome internet, but all servers I&#039;ve got access to are just to bad to play on. Any help is greatly appreciated.","replies":[]}
