So I decided to play a prank on him and wait till the last second to select. At second 3, It said team has been disbanded for a dodge, when I had 3 seconds left. which means that, yes partly my internets fault, but also riots fault because riots server didn't recover the last 3 seconds. >.>","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-29T17:34:39.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like the prank didn't work out so well.  :(  When you join champion select, the server has to grab everyone and group them in together.  If you have any network issues or even a weak wifi connection, you can actually get ouf ot sync at champion select or get left behind entirely.  I highly suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your connection is in tip-top shape to avoid issues like this in the future.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
