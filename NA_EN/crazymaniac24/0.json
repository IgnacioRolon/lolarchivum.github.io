I have no idea what happened.  I look at my match history and it looks like someone has been in my account because i wasnt even home last night to be able to play, and they were obviously a lot better than me.  I've spent too much money in this game to no longer have access, what can i do.  please help","replies":[{"poster":"CV Protostar","date":"2020-01-15T05:05:36.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happened to me last year. Got an email telling me I was perma-banned.\n\nSome scripter got into my account, spammed Kayn and played Mid syndra at 40-0-2.\n\nAfter a ticket and several days of back and forth communication, it was determined that since:\n\n1. As a Support main (who literally only plays support) the account activity was extremely out of the ordinary.\n\n2. This had happened to a ton of accounts in a very short span of time.\n\n3. I had almost no actions taken on my account since I started playing in Season 3.\n\nThey were able to undo the ban (I was told this was a one time thing and would 100% never happen ever again.)\n\nIf you can prove you were not on it might help but I was never asked to provide this information. But yeah, as someone who owns 3 ultimate skins and a ton of others besides as well as 6 seasons of play at that time, I was totally freaked out.\n\nRemember, being patient with staff, giving them what info you DO have, etc will make them more likely to take your claim seriously.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WwSPARTANwW","date":"2020-01-14T11:20:13.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The exact same thing happen to me!

I heard a story one guy had this happen, but he got out of it because at that time he was playing pokemon GO and streaming it, so he had timestamps proving he wasn't on his account. I imagine if you have something like that...it couldn't hurt to submit it? \n\nIts a loooong shot, but PROVE you weren't anywhere near your computer. \n\nIf you had a friend on your account, you're shit outta luck.\n\n {{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Twilight Wolf","date":"2020-01-04T22:29:13.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds like you were not worried that someone was playing your account which makes it sound like you were letting someone play your account","replies":[]},{"poster":"MisterCrabby","date":"2020-01-02T07:24:23.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im trying to contact player support at info@riotgames.com , i am waiting for responce.
