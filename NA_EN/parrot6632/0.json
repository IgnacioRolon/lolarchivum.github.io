But that early game came with a God like late game 1v1 potential.  The introduction of bramble best severally cuts her early game power down to levels that you just can't seem to comprehend.  \n\nTo put this into perspective let's look at a level 6 fiora looking to heal off 4 vitals against a bramble vest with say 40% magic damage reduction, short of 50% being 100 MR.  This is being generous.\n\nFiora at level 6 heals for ~58-60 health on a vital proc.  It is 30-115 based on level for context.  Taking into account grevious wounds and MR vs the thorns passive base 20 damage off of just 4 hits you are looking at a difference of 23 health per a vital to 92 on all 4, and 58 to 232 over 4.  This is a huge cut in healing which is at least over 50% reduction.

She has her W on an incredibly long cooldown so you'll probably only use it once in a team fight. Then she has to proc vitals to do her true damage but in team fights its incredibly hard to do that.
