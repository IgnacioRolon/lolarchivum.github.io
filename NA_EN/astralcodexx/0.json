So I'm sorry someone called you \"r%%%%%,\" but that's not why you were punished.\n\nYou don't want to share your logs? That's fine, as is your right. \nDid you quote the other players? Even doing that might trigger a punishment that would otherwise not be merited.\n\nEdit: I'm sorry i misread this. Intentional feeding is met with a 2-week ban when it's detected. While being called that is certainly unacceptable, retaliation is similarly unacceptable in game-behavior.

If they keep up flooding games with grief all it does is lower people's standards and effort since there's a low bar for ranked.  event larpers are just forcing aram quality teammates and it just creates nothing but forced snowballs where people just can't come out of it because the game is actually balanced in respect to a 5v5 with functioning teammates.\n\nscene's ruined man, it sucks and the forced memes of behavior have not served the quality of league very well.  what did you expect by telling players to shut up when their teammates are doing something fundamentally wrong?  no one learned and calls never giving a shit about taking time to learn a mobo and hitting the queue button 'trying and learning'.  years later the average ranked low elo has maybe 5% of what a season 2 new player would know.\n\nthe quality of ranked lives on the bottom line not being completely worthless because games realized without skill are what disrupt the latter.  tat placebo toward inflated egos only messed things up.  self esteem in an unskilled player not ready for a ranked meta does not help them know not to fuck up the matchup that they are ignorant of.\n\neven in pro matches be like having to let things out and people actually end up performing better but do this in ranked with noobs and you get the chat? it doesn't make sense.\n\nMatch quality/fairness over behavior will improve things not this SJW era.  Balance is at a fairly good time with only a few exceptions.","replies":[{"poster":"AstralCodexx","date":"2019-06-02T21:46:58.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"End of the day riot is going to keep banning people over stuff that isn't serious because its funny for people to see someone lose their account over saying a word than actually using the report correctly.  All riot has done trying to get rid of toxicity is make it about 100% worse than it already was and they are still driving that nail into the coffin as we speak.","replies":[{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2019-06-02T23:38:22.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, generally you might not have permabans/suspensions from just that although outliers do happen and we see these support staff worship these game 1 punishments with... very mundane logs.  The whole accountability thing is removed from reality, because of the human factor, nature of needing in a competitive state to vent a little bit, and quite honestly if rito wants players to not be human I am just going to consider them soulless.  Neopositivity is the ultimate toxic culture and it has fucked shit up here and IRL.  And the system has had diminishing returns to the point of toxic players being able to take advantage of it while openly talking about how toxic their victims are.  It isn't about attention, it is about having power over ruining OUR game.  Like a Chinese tourist wiping their ass on an endangered species and throwing it into a pristine beach, the larpers are just there to not give a solid fuck about league ranked and just queue for the sake of it.\n\nPlayers should be allowed the same negative communication permissions that professional teams display. \n\nThere is a ranked queue solution and that would be having the community hold off all normal reports to just mass report anyone under level 100 to abuse riot's automated report system to gatekeep the toxic game ruining players that don't understand league from ruining ranked.  But it would be easier just to hire more devs instead of the useless behavior bois and just put in a dodge button while having the level restriction be a part of league.  League is just better with people who care to play a MOBA instead of trying to play '1v1 me nerd CoD'.  I understand the appeal to other players but there's no need to shit up competitive play over \"hurrr me learnings u toxic\" players that never actually fucking bother to learn their own main champion while hostaging the fuck out of every game.\n\nWhile a suspension could indicate you could improve even if you did misbehave or your movements are unwittingly troll, it still isn't the problem.  A 73 account is still pretty fresh and quite honestly I am not against going hard to make them try again if they are screwing around in ranked.  Try not to flame out in normals or aram (honestly i don't think you're the kind that would flame in aram tbh) and just focus on learning what champ your style pays off in.  don't play jungle right now it is shitty and you are shitty if you play jg without fully learning WAY too much about the game compared to other roles lol.  ezreal isn't your champ lol.","replies":[{"poster":"AstralCodexx","date":"2019-06-03T03:09:50.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is just tyler one syndrome, just compares to my previous reasons the had this time would barely even be considered \"toxic\" and even if it was I never flammed to the point of spamming r%%%%% in the chat.
