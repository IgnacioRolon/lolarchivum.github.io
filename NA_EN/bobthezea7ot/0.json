Saw the new client update thing in the first launch screen that showed up, and thought, \"Oh cool, I'd like to have a new League client to use, it'll probably look really cool.\"\r\n\r\nI've now regretted that decision, because I can no longer get a login screen at all to show up anymore.\r\n\r\nI keep getting the initial screen that has the free champ rotation and a couple other featured stories in the corners that's got the launch button to show up.\r\n\r\nBut after I hit launch, nothing. Or at least nothing anymore, the very first time I got a dark blue box to show up in the left hand side of my screen with nothing on it and no audio. Since then, I've gotten nothing.\r\n\r\nEven now, I have had the launcher try to run to see if giving it 10 minutes or longer will actually get anything to appear. The answer seems to be a resounding no.\r\n\r\nI think part of the problem is that the client beta itself has not properly installed. When it was downloading, it skipped from 55% downloaded to complete, without even having an install phase during the process. So I'm not sure if I can try reinstalling that specifically or not, my original scan of the FAQ I didn't see if that was an option.\r\n\r\nHopefully I don't have to reinstall the whole client now because even with the P2P transfer, it took 5 hours for me to install the client just about 6 months ago, so I don't want to do that again.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows anything that could be helpful, please let me know. I'm all ears.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDominoMaster","date":"2016-11-16T14:55:04.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-16T16:24:35.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I keep getting the initial screen that has the free champ rotation and a couple other featured stories in the corners that's got the launch button to show up.\n\nThis part is really interesting to me, because technically you shouldn't see that anymore.  Are you clicking on the same icon through a desktop or taskbar pin?  What happens if you try to open the updated client directly via **C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends** then **LeagueClient.exe**?  If going this route works, you can Send To or Create Shortcut that icon to your desktop \n\nLet me know, and we'll go from there.
