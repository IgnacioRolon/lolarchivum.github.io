My firewall doesn't affect League itself when I'm playing, but I guess for some reason it finds the newer crafting stuff suspicious all of a sudden.\r\n\r\nSo if you're having this issue, try turning off your firewall if you're having issues with hextech loot. Should you still have problems, I can't help you there. You'd have to go through submitting a ticket and all that.","replies":[{"poster":"Demonbird","date":"2017-10-13T09:19:23.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had the same problem, fixed it by going to firewall settings and allowing LoL Kernel and LoL Launcher both to use public and private.

Sounds like that firewall was blocking the client when it tried to pull the data for those tokens from our servers. Remember to turn those firewalls back on afterwards if you do turn them off!","replies":[]}]}
