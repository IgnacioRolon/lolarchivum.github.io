Out of all the changes in 9.14 many of which I'm excited for somehow Mord has matrix dodged any nerfs despite having a pretty high ban rate and being, considered by many, to be unfun AF to play against. How? How does he do it? Do you somehow think that hotfix you did when you released him was good enough? I'm genuinely curious.\r\n \r\nI got some suggestions for nerfs. \r\n-Decrease passive damage in early ranks so he isn't fighting me and winning in my minon wave. \r\n-Remove the bonus movement speed he gets from passive.\r\n-Remove the heal from his W and replace it when a movement speed buff if you decided to remove it from his passive so he isn't perma in your face. \r\n-Remove the E passive so his forced to buy Void or MR,which is weak AF anyways, is an option to counter him.\r\n-Reduce the time from his R from 7 seconds all ranks to 5,6,7. Most champs won't have any way of fighting off this monster for 7 seconds early on and later around level 16 people would have time to build defenses to counter it.  \r\n\r\nJust pick one please like any one of these would imo put him more in line with other champions. Out of all of these I'd like to see the R change the most so he isn't diddling me or my jungler for 7 long seconds. Even if none of these are the nerfs he needs he needs to be nerfed. But honest to God I don't wanna wait till 9.15 for a f****** nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"ApexInTheCircle","date":"2019-07-04T03:34:54.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiora dicks him down pretty hard, so does Nasus later on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xavanic","date":"2019-07-04T07:17:57.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"morde has a lower win rate then even garen rn and you wanna nerf him?","replies":[{"poster":"TÃ©x","date":"2019-07-06T12:28:02.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats both untrue and doesent mean anything.
