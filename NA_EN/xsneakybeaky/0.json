I even bought RP as soon as i got banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-12-29T05:03:55.228+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hate speech is zero tolerance and is an immediate 14 day suspension.\n\nBe careful as even slight toxicity after your ban will result in a permanent suspension.","replies":[{"poster":"xSneakyBeaky","date":"2017-12-29T06:02:27.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh dident know that ;-; thanks for the info","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-12-29T05:04:49.619+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering riot has said multiple times, they dont accept hate speech at all, and will escalate to a ban, yea this is a fair punishment.\n> [{quoted}](name=Reksu,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=kd7Hk8zZ,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-12-29T05:00:37.358+0000)\n>\n\n> Reksu: yorick stop being a %%%got","replies":[]},{"poster":"d4rkshock","date":"2017-12-29T06:16:49.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that I think about its hate speech because %%%g0t is a homophobic word. It's just like the n word or the k word for Jews. Maybe if you used a different word it would've been a warning or a chat ban. Other than that, yes you deserved it. Tbh, about your punishment, I thought it was one or the other and not a chat ban.","replies":[{"poster":"xSneakyBeaky","date":"2017-12-29T06:18:37.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah it was totally my fault, its funny because im not even homophobic i was just mad and said it so say it. im dumb","replies":[{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-12-29T07:44:25.378+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I've seen, that is actually the case with most of the people who use the homophobic slurs.  They aren't actually trying to attack someone's sexuality, but they are using them as an insult, and Riot still doesn't want the words to be used so flippantly.  \n\nJust be aware that your account is on very thin ice at the moment.  Any further rule breaking, ANY AT ALL, will result in a permaban.  It doesn't have to be something big.  It doesn't have to be more hate speech.  Any toxicity, if reported, can get you banned.  If you have a tendency to lash out at teammates when they are bothering you, you might want to consider muting them at the beginning of the match, or muting their pings.  You cannot be banned for saying toxic things if you never say anything toxic.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
