If possible, could you give me a work around onto how to play 7.19 Patches on 7.20 or if possible send me the previous patch so, I can play my replay off the Client itself. \r\n\r\nThanks in Advanced!","replies":[{"poster":"Xentheus","date":"2017-10-16T21:40:46.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh ok, thank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-16T20:34:45.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you'll be able to play that one anymore since it was saved on an older patch.
