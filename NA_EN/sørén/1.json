Regardless of what the cause may be, it's best you consult either a techie friend or a computer repair shop so they can investigate further.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolfess","date":"2016-09-11T10:00:53.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might've damaged or disconnected something on the inside. Usually one of the most easily damaged components due to shock is the hard drive because it has moving parts unlike the many other parts of a computer, the disk has to spin and the read/write head has to move back and forth to read the many sections of the plate. Either of these being slightly damaged can cause MAJOR malfunction that prevents your computer from working properly.\n\nSecond best guess I have is maybe your video card disconnected so nothing is showing up on your screen even though everything else may be working normally.","replies":[]}]}
