Then you have to type /whisper [player name] [message] to send a PM to the intended player.\n\nThat is not exactly relevant to the point I'm trying to make, which is about good communication practices within a community via a text chat.  If 5 people speak russian, 3 of them speak german, and 2 of them speak korean, which language allows them to all communicate?  I'm not talking about a discussion on international politics either.  Just a few simple phrases that can be understood by everyone.  In OP's case, they clearly know enough English to be able to communicate in it.  If they didn't, that's fine - as noted above there isn't a rule stating that only a select set of languages are allowed per server.  However, if a person has the ability to use a language that allows communication to the entire team, then they have an obligation to their team mates to use that language in preference to others.\n\nChat communication, as I've said above, should be for the entire team - that's the designed intent behind the system.  If you think certain game-relevant communication is not important to the rest of the team - asking for a gank, for example - you are not thinking about the whole team.  If you are talking about stuff being said in chat that isn't relevant to the game, there are other communication methods that would be better suited, regardless of the language being used.\n\nIf you want help, and are asking for help, then shouldn't you ask the entire team for help?  If it's relevant to the game, it is relevant to all the players in the game.  If I'm top, I like to know that bot lane is asking for help and the jungler is responding, saying he will get blue then go bot or whatever.  That means I know what the jungler is planning, and I should pay more attention in 20 seconds to see about teleporting bot lane to help, or pressuring my lane to prevent my opponent from teleporting down to counter / opening up the possibility of taking a tower while he's gone.\n\nBut if it's in another language that I don't know, I won't be able to have that heads up.  Sure, I'll see the jungler getting blue and know he's down there.  I might anticipate he will check on bot (depending on level/rank, this can be hit-or-miss).  But I won't have time to set up my waves properly to be as effective as I could be, and I probably won't be paying as close attention to the situation down there either.  This actually has a negative impact on the game and my team's chances of winning.  Granted, sometimes that gank won't need help, the top laner won't try to counter, and they end up getting the ADC a double kill and first tower.  But sometimes it goes just the opposite and having the rest of your team be ready to weigh in and possibly turn the tide is extremely important.\n\nSo, by communicating in a language that not everyone knows (when you DO know the language everyone else knows) you might be causing your team to do worse by obscuring information that might be important, regardless of whether you think it is or not.  Yes, other communication tools, such as smart pings, can be used to negate some of the negative outcomes I'm talking about - which is fine if they're being used.  But since my point has always been about the design intent of a chat communication system - and the inherent use of that system - you can't assume they are being used.\n\nBut hey, if you don't want to communicate with your team, that's really your business.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Big Ol Spicy Boi","date":"2017-12-18T07:44:34.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not to mention the game literally has a whisper system built in.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2017-12-18T03:30:41.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There isn't, but it's still really annoying and makes it hard to communicate.\n\nIf you have people in EU speaking spanish, french, german, and russian, it's going to be hard to do anything.\nEnglish, while it's also a symbol of white colonialism, racism, and blah blah blah, is basically the universal language of NA, and people should abide by that.","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Modesty","date":"2017-12-20T06:14:29.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"basically\" the universal language... \"should\" abide by...\n\nDo you realize the hypocrisy of your OPINION?\nI feel for the OP.

I understand the discrimination from some towards others that speak another language primarily. It sucks. But as I've recently found out... Rito is cracking down on toxic players and even those who aren't actually being toxic are being caught up in the IFS.","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Modesty","date":"2017-12-21T03:34:17.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're wrong, friend.
