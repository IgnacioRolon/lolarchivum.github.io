Same thing goes for Kayle which can be worse since she can use it on allies, so let&#039;s say the enemy team got a really fed adc that just destroys your team in matter of seconds if you dont get rid of him/her. So your teams Zed goes for the adc which gets ulted by kayle cant die and this is legit unoutplayable, it&#039;s completely impossible for the Zed to win at this point which is unfair aswell since it gives their adc the opportunity to not have to care at all about being cautious and becomes allowed to make huge mistakes without getting punished for it.\r\nAnd yes, Tryndamere and Kayle would most likely be useless even if they got new updated ultis because the ones they have are needed for their kit, but this is why they shouldn&#039;t have gotten their abilities from the whole beginning they shouldn&#039;t have been made from the start. they would need complete reworks to actually be relevant. \r\n\r\n{{champion:39}} is the only champion that i have in mind that have this type of passive to her ability and this triggers me everytime i face irelia in toplane. It is her E the only thing i can think off when i read this &quot;&quot;&quot;ACTIVE: Irelia pierces the target enemy, dealing them magic damage and slowing them by 60% for a short duration. IF HER CURRENT HEALTH IS EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN HER TARGET&#039;S SHE STUNS THEM INSTEAD.&quot;&quot;&quot; is that if you&#039;re playing bad and losing trades against your lane opponent you will get the upperhand next time because you will stun them. I mean, i would litterly feel better about this ability if it stunned me everytime she used E. \r\n\r\nFinally we&#039;re here\r\n\r\nItem.(s)\r\n\r\n{{item:3026}} So guardian angel, the item that let&#039;s you die just to get back to life. some people might argue that this is a fair item since everyone can buy it. But let&#039;s say you&#039;re in the losing team and then suddenly their adc and toplaner appears with an guardian angel at this point you almost have to kill 7 enemies, and the game is next to impossible to win because of this item that let&#039;s them make a mistake but still get away with it. \r\n\r\nThis was all from me this time, might come back and cry some more next year. would be fun to see if someone agrees or disagrees with me so leave a comment {{summoner:6}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2016-10-26T20:29:27.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can kind of sort of barely understand in the case of kogmaw/sion/karthus (though you aught to account for their retribution damage beforehand or once you were low enough the passive was going to kill you if you killed them YOU had lost) but in the other cases this is simply a matter of you being baited.\n\nParticularly you pointed out kyle ult allowing adcs to \"make huge mistakes\", but assuming (and it is not always the case) the adc was planning on/reacting to the invulnerability better than your team then the daring moves are not huge mistakes at all but the appropriate response.

They're just a safety net that goes away after one death. Logically, you'd want to keep that net, so you still have a strong incentive to stay alive.\n\nKarthus or Sion passive arguably do reward you for dying, in very specific circumstances. However, this doesn't mean it rewards bad play; a Sion or a Karthus dying at an inopportune moment could make their passives useless. However, a good Karthus or Sion will understand how to use the death passive, and perhaps die in the middle of the enemy team, to make full use of them. This is not bad play.

Why does Kat for example need full combo + ult to drop an enemy to 10% HP while Diana is just ... Q R R dead\n\nThe holy trinity, it seems.\n\nIrelia actually has to time her ult right in order to get TriForce spellblade procs right and thus, actually kill a squishy. Her Q is only a high damage ability after she gets TriForce and maxes it. Yes, when she does both, not one or the other.\n\nKat is a cleanup assassin. As a \"main\", you should know that.\n\nAnd Diana is indeed a diver. As is Irelia. Once they jump in, they can´t jump out. Diana needs to spellweave her Q between ult to properly get resets. Irelia needs low HP minions to reset her Q. The maximum level of skill Katarina needs is a stockpile of replacement Q, W, E, R keys.\n\nThey aren´t assassins. They can´t even be played as such because their kits just don´t scream assassin to anyone who actually plays them long enough. Diana has a refreshable shield and a pull-in, Irelia has a gap-closer and a stun. Now, if they tower dive someone, how can they escape without a risk of burning flash?\n\nKat can just shunpo to the nearest minion or ward. Diana can´t do that. Neither can Irelia. They´re supposed to jump into your backline, kill them and stick around to deal with the tanks, not pussy out, that´s why they have forms of sustain. Irelia with tenacity, the ability to build bruiser-ish after a single damage item and heal. And Diana with her refreshable shield.\n\nPlease, stop making Kat look like a champion harder than either of those two. You´re only embarrassing yourself. Post-rework, she might become actually harder to play. But until then she's still the 'smash head on keyboard for pentakill' champion we all love to meme about and i love leaving 0/10 by 15 minutes every time i play either Kayle or Diana.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2016-10-27T09:11:46.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is harder \"kata just shunpoes\" with her 11 seconds shunpo CD... as we all well know, while Irelia has 3 sec CD even if she doesn't kill with her Q... cheers...

And your team's for not doing anything. Irelia and Diana can´t delete anyone in a short amount of hits unless people just stand still and let them do it. Irelia will never engage with Q unless she can do it onto a minion to get the reset, stun you and then Q after her enemy's HP is low enough a single Q will kill them.\n\nDiana only can kill someone quick enough if her R-Q combo is perfectly executed. Otherwise, it´ll take a while longer, which still makes them Divers, not Assassins, because they actually need to stay in the brunt of the fight.
