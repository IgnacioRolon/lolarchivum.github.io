My main account is bbproz with an IGN: guthy. Initially I was able to play perfectly fine on the EUW server (roughly 1-2 days).  I can no longer log into my account on both the LOL website and the LOL client,  with the error of incorrect account or password.\r\n\r\n I have reset my password numerous times, repaired my client, and made sure that I have the EUW region selected multiple times with no luck.  I read something about a potential conflict with my IP / ISP, so I even tried to log in using a NA VPN which still did not work. \r\n\r\nSOS please help me rito. \r\n\r\nSigned, \r\nA Concerned Summoner, AKA: bbproz / guthy","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T22:05:51.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm interesting. I've got that EUW account pulled up and it does look like the transfer went through successfully. I know you're probably typing in the password and username correctly but double check juuuuust in case, possibly caps lock is messing things up? \n\nIf you still can't get signed in, go ahead and reach out to our account team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Make sure to pick \"help recovering my account\" so that you can send us a ticket while signed out.","replies":[{"poster":"GuthyDE","date":"2017-07-15T22:58:18.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Broporo Yes I have even reset my password to very basic passwords to make sure, I have submitted a ticket. Thanks.\n\nYes I have 2 other EUW accounts that I can access perfectly fine, this seems to be more than a client issue seeing as it is effecting my ability to log on to the actual league of legends website.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-16T00:15:24.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Curioser and curiouser.....If this were a client issue, you would most likely not be able to sign into any account at all. Those account agents should be able to get everything straightened out in that ticket though, glad to be of service when I can be ^_^.","replies":[{"poster":"GuthyDE","date":"2017-07-16T10:57:54.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strange enough, I have been periodically trying with the same methods mentioned above... I changed my password and now it works.

I'm assuming so?","replies":[]}]}
