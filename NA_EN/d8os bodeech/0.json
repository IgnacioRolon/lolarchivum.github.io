FPS is good (120-140) but the screen is a little too big for the game. Do I get used to this or is it actually not small enough to play well? I&#039;m plat3 and I feel like I can hardly watch the minimap as it&#039;s a little too far. I also kinda have a hard time noticing that someone is actually walking beside me for how big the screen is.","replies":[]}
