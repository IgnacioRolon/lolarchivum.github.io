I really hope they come out strong and begin to show the true colors. IMPO the NA region has key players that together could make a team strong enough to compete on the world stage spread over many teams. Not to mention there seems to be a large gap between coaching quality for NA compared to other regions.","replies":[{"poster":"Axis the Dragon","date":"2015-11-01T22:28:40.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.

Agreed on the realistic part being up in the air. What I can say though is that Aphromoo and or Zion seem realistic as the dynamic of CLG has undoubtedly been changed completely. We know how close Aphro and D-lift were, not to mention how bad Zion wants to win worlds; if he doesn't see potential I wouldn't be surprised if he found a place for himself elsewhere. \n\nRegardless of how it all ends up playing out I will definitely be looking forward to next season.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"legendkingQ","date":"2015-11-01T12:32:00.764+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poor doublelift gets kicked but gets to TSM in less than 3 hours","replies":[{"poster":"Kinetic Abi","date":"2015-11-02T16:39:42.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"worth","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Poorly Dressed","date":"2015-11-01T10:21:57.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like Doublelift but i don't want to become a TSM fan - why o why :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kalarepa","date":"2015-11-01T09:12:53.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"CLG just kicked their 2 best players (Pobelter, Doublelift).

I have been a fan of CLG since I started playing the game (S1) and I have continued to support them largely due to Doublelift; my favorite adc/NA player. With him getting KICKED from CLG after 4 years of support and consistent play (more or less) I can't help but to stop supporting CLG. I'll be following Doublelift and now that he's with Bjergsen hopefully they will slaughter the other NA teams :P. \n\nIt's definitely going to be weird cheering TSM on when they face CLG as that's been the opposite for the past few years.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2015-11-01T05:03:46.763+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this mean doublelift won't be with aphromoo anymore?

He was obviously VERY conflicted about the ADC role all summer (Turtle on \"probation\"... trying out Keith- who was NOT the answer.) TSM advertises \"open\" tryouts for ADCs and BOOM a top tier ADC comes free.\n\n2a) Yes, it IS an opinion (and we all know how THOSE go),... but I DO consider DLift top tier NA.\n\nHere is my ranking:\n\n1. Piglet\n2. Sneaky\n3. DLift\n4. Everyone Else\n\n3) Even if it's an upgrade for TSM... They still have 3 MASSIVE holes in the team to fill.
