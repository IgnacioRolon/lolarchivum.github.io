You&#039;ve just lost your first World Championship ever, and your dynasty has finally been toppled. Your perfect track record, broken. And you&#039;re right to be dissapointed, you&#039;re right to be sad. But the one thing you shouldn&#039;t do is blame yourself. \n\nYou are still the best League of Legends player who ever lived. Even now, your status is utterly undisputed. You played your heart out this entire championship. You carried your team on your back all the way up to the finals. You&#039;re a living legend, the Unkillable Demon King, the God of League of Legends. You are the model that every player aspires to be, and no matter what, your name will go down in history. Don&#039;t be ashamed. Be proud.","replies":[{"poster":"Douglas Funnie","date":"2017-11-04T10:47:45.922+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":35,"body":"I stopped reading after you wrote, \" The Unkillable Demon King.\"  He clearly got caught at the end of game 3.","replies":[{"poster":"R0XTAR","date":"2017-11-04T10:48:39.535+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Douglas Funnie,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=kblEh6xW,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-11-04T10:47:45.922+0000)\n>\n> I stopped reading after you wrote, &quot; The Unkillable Demon King.&quot;  He clearly got caught at the end of game 3.\n\nHis team clearly made him work from behind as they got caught out nonstop.","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-11-04T10:52:47.219+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":3,"body":"I would also say most people would not expect that play.

Of course he isn't a literal god. Of course he isn't unkillable. These titles are just reflections of people's admiration for him.
