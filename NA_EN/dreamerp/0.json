I feel like maybe it could have been cleaner or just using the wallpaper would make it more attractive. Maybe it&#039;s just me LOL","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ptrans","date":"2017-05-30T19:23:56.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi DreamerP! I think you are referring to this website: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/pulsefire-caitlyn\n\nI checked the website to identify where you may be seeing the distortion. The animated splash banner is running smoothly--I do see that the static splash art (that is downloadable) is a bit pixelated. This is because we had to compress the image on the website, however, if you click the splash art, a much clearer image will display for download :) \n\nHopefully this helps answer your question!","replies":[]}]}
