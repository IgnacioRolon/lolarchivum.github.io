So the sizes make since, but I an adult male who ranges in a waist size of 38-40 depending on comfort and a chest size of 45-47(big rib cage I usually buy XXL at stores because of this) HAVE NO OPTIONS in the merchandise store based on the measurements of Unisex. Would it be too much to ask for a larger shirt for us who are of bigger sizes? I haven't looked at women sizing but based on the T-shirt design I'm sure it's absurdly small in most areas.(Hourglass design)","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-26T21:24:28.206+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely hear where you are coming from.  Unfortunately, in the immediate future there is nothing I can do to help out with this >.<  However, our Merch team is constantly looking at different sizing options, types of products, etc to constantly evolve our store.  It is entirely possible we may add new sizing types in the future, depending how our Merch store evolves.\n\nI know this isn't the most clear-cut answer, but I hope it does shed some light on your question!","replies":[{"poster":"Furfrou","date":"2016-05-26T23:57:00.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's alright I know there can never be a definite answer, but I'm glad you're responding to feedback.
