Not only that but his q now shreds even more (as if it werent enough already) armor and magic resist, and its base dmg got buffed, AND it has longer range. And woohoo its a skillshot now so you actually have to aim it, well guess what it still has a giant width and its fast, what the heck, i still cant dodge it! Really, that's all they could do to make up for it. Might as well give rengar back triple q, trynd gets 10 fury every attack, and kennen gets a longer stun for his next stun by stunning some one. Maybe its just me, maybe im ranting, but i just need a strong example from some one as to why this nerf is fair or not. but thank god they nerfed kass, maybe i can nerf some one else first now.","replies":[{"poster":"Skarnye West","date":"2014-03-18T07:20:15.944+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, they're buffs, not nerfs.\n\nSecond, they want to shift a lot of the abilities that are currently about resource management to being cooldown management. This makes a lot of sense, to help balance them with resourceless champions. Some abilities are core to kits, and you want them to be consistently usable. Others would be overpowered if spammable. I think it's a good direction for balance.","replies":[{"poster":"yeldahman13","date":"2014-03-19T05:39:15.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmmmmm, thanks man, i really needed a good explanation from some one a bit higher in intellect.ty","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FFirebrandd","date":"2014-03-18T15:54:18.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In what world is making their main AA steroids free a nerf?\n\nAlso in all honesty Koggy needed a different Q.

Come late game, he can shine (that's what hypercarries are supposed to do after all) BUT he still has no escapes, so his team has to be epic at peeling for him.  Good luck getting that in solo queue.\n\nTristana has a decent early game.  Her base damages on her abilities are strong and can double dive with her support quite well with rocket jump.  She is probably the best ADC at getting away from enemies between her jump and ult.  However her damage abilites scaling off only AP make her mid game very lackluster.  Also since her base attack range is a bit low she'll be in trouble early if she can't dive in and abuse her good base damages.\n\nNow compare that to the popular ADC's right now, Caitlyn, Jinx, Lucian, and Sivir.  All of those are huge lane bullies with large amounts of poke, wave clear, and escapes or CC.  The only time Tristana and Kogmaw are better than them is late game, which is fine but late game Trist and Kog aren't enough better during late game than those 4 to warrant getting picked because the game might end before you get there or you might have fallen so far behind that 40 minutes in they're still stronger despite you being on a hypercarry.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MackleDoge","date":"2014-03-18T17:49:06.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a joke right? The changes to Kog and Trist were obviously buffs. If you want to talk about unfair nerfs, look at how they butchered Kassadin and Elise. They both needed nerfs, but they went way too far overboard with them in my opinion. I have a PBE account and I've always enjoyed playing Kassadin, but I feel these changes really hurt his identity as a champion and harshly effect how much fun it is to play him.","replies":[{"poster":"yeldahman13","date":"2014-03-19T05:48:09.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dude i  meant buff and i think alot of people knew what i meant, and you do make a point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"yeldahman13","date":"2014-03-19T05:42:49.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well usually people banned him like 99.99% of the time, so these nerfs are probably the only way he's gonna see ranked at all.but i agree elise got nerfed pretty bad.","replies":[]}]}]}
