But a quick google suggests that there is an orbwalking script out now.  So, even though I haven't seen the game, it wouldn't surprise me if a player using a heavy amount of orb-walking was also a scripter.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-12-21T08:40:13.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I watched the game.
