Any amount of packet loss can start causing some really weird internet issues, especially ones where you're trying to patch or update. \n\nThose patching issues might be stemming from that packet loss, which there isn't a whole lot we could do on our since packet loss is mostly caused by your ISP, but there are still a few steps we can take to help push that along. Let's first check up on your [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) to make sure everything is configured correctly there to let League update.","replies":[]}]}
