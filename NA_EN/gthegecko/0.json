We'll want to take a closer look here in case that issue is recurring.  To help troubleshoot, start off with a client restart.  If that doesn't work, try swapping to another region on the login screen, then back to your region.  Let me know if these steps work for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Uberhammy206","date":"2018-02-16T19:47:57.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soooooo....9 months later and this is STILL a problem?! was excited to play this game again but forget it, shit doesn't want t work at all and is a waist of my time now, thanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weedies","date":"2017-05-29T01:51:40.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im still having this same issue, ive tried swapping regions and restarting client but that hasn't worked.
