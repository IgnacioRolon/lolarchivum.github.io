The rioter i think is aiming in the right area, but not at the right issue. On the latest Windows 10 update they added a few extras into their OS for Xbox gaming. I already had the Windows game bar and the Game DVR feature turned off, BUT there is now a third feature in that settings category called Game Mode. I had enabled that because it said it will help play games at the best performance possible. I disabled that feature and now the low fps issues is gone. So, i do believe that's what the problem is. maybe not for all summoners having this problem, but for most on Windows 10 OS.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Irojo","date":"2017-02-15T00:37:23.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMPORTANT EDIT:\nFound the fix to the problem by browsing the forums.

Did all the hackerboy stuff all the people told me to do nothing worked... So i just went in a costum game tried some shizzle out and i found sort of a fix! U go to settings -- video -- and at the bottem u got two options u could turn on or of --- now turn of the buttom with \" wait for vertical sync and voila ur fps is back up to 500. But then i was like hmm it is laggy and then i realised league did an update that u cant have more fps then ur screen can run? So i u have a 60hz screen the best thing is to get is obviously 60 fps, and when u have 144hz screen it is 144fps u understand?
