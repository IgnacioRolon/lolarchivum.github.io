It sounds like you may be having a network issue that's causing you to not sync up and leave you behind.  I suggest going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to fix this up.  You should also test it out in custom games to prevent further penalties.  Hopefully, a connection tune up will get you back in game without incident!","replies":[{"poster":"ThomasLord1311","date":"2016-08-26T18:50:48.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well it doesnt happen as soon as I start about halfway through the queue it sometimes will crash out of nowhere for no reason and idk why this caused to wait 45 mins with my friend to get a game whch is annoying now and this is happening very day when I play league plz fix this because this annoying to deal with","replies":[]}]}]}
