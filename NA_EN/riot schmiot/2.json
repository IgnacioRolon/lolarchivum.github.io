Now that it’s been on for a few weeks and all players who need to make a change should have an email listing the accounts they need to change, we’re going to be making the pop-up mandatory starting next week. \r\n\r\nThis change means players that need to update to globally unique usernames will **not be able to play until they update their account**. If you’ve played in the past few weeks and haven’t gotten a pop-up (or you've made your username unique), you’re in the clear. To find out if you need to update your account, you can visit [this website](https://update-account.riotgames.com/). \r\n\r\nWe’ve also updated the [account update website](https://update-account.riotgames.com/) to allow you to change your account name again if you mistakenly swapped it to the wrong thing, or just want to see what else is available. \r\n\r\nThese changes are in advance of an update next month which will remove the region selector from the login screen.** You’ll still be able to log in to any region**, but you’ll need to use the account associated with the region to do it. If you haven’t updated your account by then you won’t be able to log in at all if your username isn’t unique, and you’ll need to go to [this website](https://update-account.riotgames.com/) to make the change. \r\n\r\nWe know that this rollout created some confusion, but this change is necessary prep for launching our future games, and getting this done now will make your first experiences with those games much better down the road. You can find out more about the Riot Account update by checking out this [Riot Support FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037264394-Riot-Accounts)), which includes more details, some additional context, and a few tips that might help out.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2020-01-08T18:11:06.262+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hah, it was OPTIONAL up to this point, huh?

Seriously this was a terrible idea, executed even *worse*. \n\n\"Ok, we will no longer distinguish between regions, instead of a league account for a specific region, you just have a Riot Account\"\n\n\"Oh cool, does that mean we can now use the same account to play on any region, say if we want to play with friends on another server?\"\n\n\"Hah no, that would actually be useful. No you still are locked to one region per account. We just removed the distinguisher between accounts to reduce security, lower the total number of accounts, and cause username conflicts. Oh and we chose the most stupid way of resolving those, by making it the last man standing gets to keep their accountname. Which is the account that no longer plays the game\"\n\nAnd with all that nonsense, here comes the big question. *Why*? There are a ton of problems with this system. But there seems to be absolutely no benefit. We dont get to switch regions on the same account. And even if the other games are going to not seperate by region, that doesnt mean you need to get rid of the system. Just do it like you did with the LoR beta, where you still login by region but arent seperated by it. Why instead make this stupid mess that noone wants or likes? Frankly at this point if you refuse to change the system or fix how you handle username conflicts, Im simply gonna stop playing League.
