I hope you all enjoy watching as much as I LOVED playing her :D I have been waiting on a good Quinn rework for over 2 years, since I mained her into mid Gold.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmlxbYWDqkc","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mmlxbYWDqkc/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, I just put up a video of me playing Quinn on the PBE.

I mean, ultimately, his kit was just a slightly modified version of Quinn's that was far more risky and only useful in rare scenarios. Eliminating the redundancy isn't really a bad call. Still though...\n\nTag-Team Google Definition: \"a pair of wrestlers who fight as a team, taking the ring alternately. One team member cannot enter the ring until touched or tagged by the one leaving.\"\n\nNOTHING about this new kit feels like that. There's no \"okay Valor, your turn. Knock'em dead.\" I think the rework will be fun, and hit most of Quinn's style points, but it guts the one CORE style point. That's not gonna stop bothering me.","replies":[{"poster":"Krym","date":"2015-11-01T20:19:55.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very interesting point. I agree, her ult should NOT be called \"Tag-Team\" any more lol.

IT DOESN'T HAVE TO END THIS WAY KRYM! PUT THE DELETE-OPTION DOWN! TT\n\nThat would seal the crime in writing.\n\nRiot: \"We didn't like our cake delivery service, so we got rid of it.\"\nPlayer: \"But then I can't eat cake.\"\nRiot: \"Ya know, that's an EXCELLENT point!\" \\*throws out cake\\*\nPlayer: \"NNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOO...\"\nRiot: \"What, you get to NOT have your cake, and NOT eat it too. It's consistent. What's the problem?\"\nPlayer: {{champion:32}} </3\n\nI'm sorry, I want my tag-team. Quinn/Valor was always advertised as a tag-team. Riot even made sure to not leave Valor's name out in a lot of cases when referring to Quinn's champion title in pre-release discussions. The \"duo-team champ\" is a much-loved concept for many fans:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/98WfAxEA-rip-valor\n\nI know this new rework is cool and effective, but THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER WAY!\n\nP.S. logged into downvote and then cancel with an upvote because your video and points are awesome but I hate you >:(","replies":[{"poster":"Krym","date":"2015-11-02T09:09:26.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, your name is awesome and I just love it. Second of all, I admire your passion for Quinn. She DOES deserve to be a perfectly executed champ with the tag-team theme. When I replied to your post the first time, I was thinking that Riot is unlikely to make more changes to her and I'm just happy to see her in a BETTER position than she has been for a very long time. That's mostly me being happy to get any morsel of a scrap that Riot would throw at me after having all but given up on Quinn getting any major changes. I was happy with that. But now you come over here telling me that what Riot has done on the PBE just isn't enough. You come strolling over here to tell me that Quinn and Valor deserve to maintain their tag-team themed kit AND still be a fun and powerful champ to play. And after you come up in here to say all that in the face of my joy... well, Sir, I commend you for it and I stand wholeheartedly persuaded. The Quinn rework is amazing. It's an amazing first step. Riot can do better and our feedback is what they need to hear :) GOSH I love Quinn too much!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sulghunter","date":"2015-11-01T18:45:15.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did anyone see how fast those Kogs were going? 0_o","replies":[]},{"poster":"Penns","date":"2015-11-01T17:55:32.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://youtu.be/mmlxbYWDqkc?t=23s The passive is bonus armor now tho, not total armor","replies":[]}]}
