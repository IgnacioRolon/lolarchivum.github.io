Why did you end my series on an issue that was not my fault to begin with!? I didn't rage quit, I didn't AFK, I did nothing wrong (been playing fine all night until I tried to play ranked) and I'm getting punished for it? Seriously, what the hell?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-31T20:55:16.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When your client crashes, it disconnects from the game platform entirely. Because of the nature of a disconnection, the client/server is unable to determine whether your client crashed, intentionally dodged, or literally ripped the cable from your wall to power down your computer. This is why the server can only see it as a disconnection, which is interpreted as a dodge which in Promos will result in a loss and the end of your series. \n\nBugsplats are often a result of severely corrupted game assets or some local PC configurations that prevent the game from running properly. A good place to start in resolving those is to work through the steps outlined in our [Bugsplat & Crash guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes)\n\nLet me know if this issue persists through those steps.","replies":[]}]}
