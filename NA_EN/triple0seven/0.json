I really want to be able to change them so i can adjust them, on my AD rune page i usually ues for zed mid, lets say i got against a ziggs, or an orianna, i would be able to put on magic resist, or lets say yasuo, so i could put on armour runes,\r\n\r\n                        Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2014-12-24T17:21:02.683+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"they charge you IP/RP for additional rune pages.  if you could have any rune set you wanted with just 2 pages by modifying before the game it would completely invalidate the reason for buying a new page.","replies":[{"poster":"Triple0seven","date":"2014-12-24T17:58:50.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"You might now be able to buy a new rune page, but you would still need to buy all the runes themselves.
