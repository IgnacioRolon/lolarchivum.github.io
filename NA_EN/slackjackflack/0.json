He's always been a super resilient to meta changes since he can build in so many different ways. I didn't work on the marksmen stuff, but I'm guessing that's why he didn't get too much attention. He already has a pretty unique feel among marksmen :D","replies":[{"poster":"Kouga","date":"2015-10-29T08:59:22.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Koalifier,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=Tt7amdMg,comment-id=0000000000010001,timestamp=2015-10-29T08:45:26.233+0000)\n>\n> He's always been a super resilient to meta changes since he can build in so many different ways.\n\nIt's true, and actually it speaks to how well Ezreal works - but in some ways that is exactly what concerns me. For example, several Reds have acknowledged that Essence Flux feels lacking for AD Ezreal. In fact most AD Ez players will agree that its a waste on him, especially early - too much mana for too little damage, its better to put the points into Q for better damage than try to squeeze out a little more DPS off W. The team buff is great mid-late game for taking objectives and team fights, but its still a relic of his original kit (I still remember the days when I could reduce enemy AS.. and heal my team.. all of them at once..)\n\nBut the fact that AD Ezreal can function as good as he does - rarely OP but never not viable - and he can do that basically *without* an entire ability? That's both awesome and unfortunate. Awesome because I can play and have fun and feel skilled and powerful when I do well against numerically stronger opponents with only 4/5 of a kit, but unfortunate because a) he isn't at his full potential and b) if he was, the rest of his kit would likely have to be downgraded to avoid him getting too strong.\n\nI've [written about it before](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/hgs4Y8Bw-spelunking-into-ezreals-gameplay-words-from-a-beta-player) but didn't get much of a response, but I agree that Ezreal has always been pretty stable.
