Was just playing in a ARSR match and was doing fine through most of it, stable ping of 22-25ms, then late game I started getting lag spikes you would see at 1000+ ping. From start to end of the match my ping was stable around 22-25ms. The spikes just seemed to get worse and worse as the match came to an end. I noticed this occurring over the last week or so, off and on near the later parts of matches I was getting lag spikes while my ping was stable.","replies":[]}]}]}
