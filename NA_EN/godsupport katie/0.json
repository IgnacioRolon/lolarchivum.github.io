Even if the ability in itself is a bit more unreliable now that the cast time has been raised the rest of her kit makes her one of the safest (or reliable) champions in the entire game. So even if 9 out of 10 spears miss Nidalee doesn't care or get punished for it in any way, mana cost is cheap (and she can play manaless if she needs to) and the cooldown is extremely low for an ability that hits as hard or harder than most champions ultimates.\n\nA missed ability should tell the enemy that this is the time to strike, but with Nidalee's kit she can just dash-dash-dash away for free (with bonus movespeed as if the dashes weren't enough) and then heal if she got hurt. An extremely safe kit combined with an long range hard hitting ability is a hard thing to balance, I get that. But if the spear is her defining ability a lot of her free safety needs to be looked at.\n\n(As a side note: another thing about her kit that really should be looked at is how all her abilities have something extra added to them, things that many players don't even know about, extra movespeed, extra attack speed, extra dash range, bonus snare. It seems nothing in her kit can just do what it does visually it has to have some hidden power as well)","replies":[{"poster":"Valderis Vandala","date":"2015-08-11T22:44:38.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Safest?

She does not however possess burst.\n\nNidalee however is an assassin that posses an tremendous amount of burst (and part of it from range) which makes the safety assigned to her kit a bit more questionable.\n\nPersonally I'd say Nidalee is safer than Lulu, because of her free wards, ability to jump walls (very big as you otherwise need to use flash) and heal (which I deem better than shields) and free movespeed boost. I'm sure you disagree, which is fine, I'm not here to debate this specific topic. I don't really care if there's a safer champion than Nidalee (as this could be debated endlessly from personal opinions), the question is if Nidalee should posses the amount of safety she does with one of the hardest hitting long range abilities in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Valderis Vandala","date":"2015-08-12T04:52:12.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her spear isn't burst though, its poke. The only way it can be seen as burst is up close when you can combine it with the cougar form abilities, but at that range it loses about 2/3rd of its damage.\n\nI've never found her burst to be a tremendous amount. You have to get her target nice and low before you can jump in and kill them quickly. And you can only really jump in if you land that narrow skill shot spear.\n\nWhat would she do in team fights if not for that spear though? That at least makes her able to poke. She is far too squishy to just jump into the thick of it. Her being a \"safe\" champion is meaningless if she doesn't do anything for the team, take the spear away and what does she do? A bit of heal? Without it she is practically useless.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"stuartk11","date":"2015-08-11T19:41:42.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could have the cooldown on her Q halved or whatever if it hits an enemy, and increase its base cooldown.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-08-10T21:55:34.026+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nid spears are annoying, but it's only part of the problem.

But there are many problems with her kit and even with spears, beacuse they have this annynoing bug that let her spawn invisible ones. Not so long ago I had to face mid nida that was walking into brushes and abusing fact that if you cast it from bursh then you get to toss that damn invisible spear of destruction. \n\nAnd then you have her insane mobility with targeted long gap closer on hunted targets. \n\nShe really should have mana cost in her cougar form or make it like swain one - constant mana drain, but in return give her bigger base mana or something like that. It just so unfair to play vs her when she can be so safe champion with all that power.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aaravos","date":"2015-08-10T22:00:33.874+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe sightly incrase the cooldown on her spear?

Her kit ATM kind of relies on the QRWQ combo.  \n\nIf you are up close, your spear is pretty laughable and the only way to make up for it is hope you bought a TF and then go combo panther.\n\nATM I think the biggest problem with her is it isn't as rewarding as it used to be as a nidalee player to just stand back and chuck spears all day.

Playing against her in-lane ends up turning into a numbers game (particularly if you're another mage, *especially* if you're an immobile one) where she can just chuck spears until she eventually lands one, at which point she can all-in your for at least half your health before jumping away and healing off whatever damage you managed to put on her. Putting Tahm Q-style telegraph on it or a Xerath/Varus/Vi-style wind-up could help as well, encouraging her to stick to the brush to use it rather than flinging them out with no warning until she nicks you. Changing it from flat damage to % current health damage (or splitting the damage between base and % current) could also help distinguish it as a soften-up tool, and forcing her to rely on Cougar form's commitment to get the kills--also helping with tankier champs body-blocking it without it exploding squishies even further. \n\nIf nothing about the Javelin Toss can be changed, then maybe it would be a bit better then to completely remove her heal (which is a relic at this point, from back when Nidalee's foundation was \"uh, let's make a WoW Druid\"), so at least she has to pick her all-ins a bit more carefully, and when you actually do manage to retaliate or hit her with some poke, it sticks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-08-11T00:59:01.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rbOoWs1W,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-10T21:43:35.388+0000)\n>\n> So, I did Nidalee's update a year or so back, and this will probably be an unpopular opinion, but...\n> \n> Without changing the reliability profile on Javelin Toss, I think it actually does need to do pretty significant damage.

From the recent Javelin nerf, Trap damage type being changed from % to flat (still not sure why that had to be done, since they already had a cap on monsters).\n\nI suggest buffing her base AD by a few points; right now her base AD is less than or equal to champions that have auto attack modifiers (Orianna's passive, Lulu's passive, Teemo's E passive), which makes last hitting really hard. Or you could also switch back the damage type of her traps to %health magic damage.\n\nPeople whine all the time about current Nidalee's kit, but I think it's /so/ much healthier than Spear Sniper 3000 that could actually one-shot with just a Javelin alone.
