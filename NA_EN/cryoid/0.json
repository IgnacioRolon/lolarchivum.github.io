Seeing as Caitlyn is one of the most \"pure\" ADCs, compared with (e.g.) the more \"AD caster\" types, I'm especially bad with her. Somehow, I just cannot understand the concept that right-clicking does damage. I've played mages too much; I'm convinced on some deep level that right-clicking is for farming, not fighting.\n\nFor you, Summoner KateyKhaos, I'd probably go with … {{champion:82}} Mordekaiser? I might just be thinking 40K-style Chaos. And Khorne.\n\nI've long felt that there's actually a peculiar kinship between LoL and 40K. Derpiness is important to both settings, though 40K goes more for \"comic testosterone-poisoned unironic excess\" while LoL goes more for \"winking-at-the-camera self-aware pop-fantasy pastiche\".","replies":[{"poster":"Pugh95Bear","date":"2014-09-24T04:46:29.339+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> > (EDIT: For CupcakeTrap)\n> For you, Summoner KateyKhaos, I'd probably go with … {{champion:82}} Mordekaiser?
