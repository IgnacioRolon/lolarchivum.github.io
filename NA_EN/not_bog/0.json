They are a mix of the world itself with the ideas of incoming artists and storytellers. Malphite, a core staple to the league of legends franchise is none other then a god damn mountain or Maokai who is a walking tree.\r\n\r\nNow what can be as cool as a mountain champion? you ask \r\nWell that is a great question! and here is my suggestion for you!\r\n\r\nThe world of Runeterra is fantastic, it is full of places that are beyond your imagination, and that makes it a PERFECT home for an Ocean champion.\r\n\r\nWe have champions that live in the ocean like Nami and Fizz but we have yet to see a champion that represents the seas itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-08-22T09:42:09.572+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhhh...

The most iconic champion for me, when I wasn't a player, has been Jinx, which was the very reason why I also started playing the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-08-22T10:17:29.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jinx had a huge impact due to her Harely Quinn nature and music video.\n\nBut consistently people used to mention it as the game with the furry rats and the game with the little girl who kills you with a teddie bear.\n\nNowadays however, rito's pushing the more edgy champs in their adds though.  Regardless the point stands that Malphite and Maokai simply aren't really iconic to league.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shmeeve","date":"2019-08-22T05:45:46.290+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A cactus that fires cactus's from a cactus rocket launcher.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-23T00:28:09.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot tried to make a champion like this at one point, but it was apparently repurposed into Azir.\nhttps://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Well","replies":[]},{"poster":"OoTriloDiveroO","date":"2019-08-22T06:20:44.838+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i had once an idea about to create someone who came from the ocean depths.","replies":[]},{"poster":"saphireflame123","date":"2019-08-22T04:42:03.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay...?","replies":[]},{"poster":"unicornman27","date":"2019-08-23T19:04:04.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the two i knew about before playing the game where annie and jinx {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZaFishbone","date":"2019-08-22T08:10:52.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malphite isn't LoL's most emblematic champ.
