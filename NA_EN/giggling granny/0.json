So if they directly nerf the items, other champions suffer too. But ADCs also struggle to build tanky, like some other champions, but way more. This limits greatly as to what builds they can effectively use. Boots are sometimes the most defense an ADC can afford to buy or else they may suffer from lacking sufficient damage. So hitting items too much could destroy an entire class and force others to build tank builds. \n\nSome assassins and melee fighters both tend to use some common ADC items ({{item:3031}} {{item:3072}} and {{item:3153}} are good examples) and ADCs tend to sometimes use common Assassin and melee fighter items (such as {{item:3071}} {{item:3147}} and {{item:3812}}). As the meta shifts around, everyone changes builds to what the \"best build\" becomes. Currently it is a \"Poke\" meta. AP burst is also big too with the removal of decent MR from runes. So it is either live through the poke/burst or kill them before they kill you. Most if not all ADCs cannot live though the burst/poke effectively enough to really justify building any more defensive based items than the occasional 1 and boots. So they go for raw damage (i.e. glass cannon). This is why nerfing ADCs is tricky. Nerf them too hard or incorrectly, and you have an entire role suffering because they all tend to follow similar build paths with only a few deviations here and there.\n\n~ tl;dr ~ \nMaybe they plan on nerfing/changing some AD/crit items or making some AD/crit based changes which would effect both Yasuo and ADCs since they build similarly.

What am I suppoed to do as a ziggs/Lux/ Veigar player against a Yasuo every other match?\n\n\nI feel like a lot of people don't want Yasuo to be viable because of how frustrating it is to play against him during laning phase as certain champions, rather than his actual win rate. Thing is, if I happen to go mid as a majority of the mage roster, I can't fight back.\n\nSay I am playing Ziggs. Here in Mexico the best ping you can get in my area is 63. With that delay all the pressure is on me to land all my skillshots because otherwise I will go Oom and be pushed out of lane. If I misposition Yasuo is also going to kill me, and he can hold my entire kit hostage by not using W until critical moments, using his autos and E to dodge and have lane pressure on me. Then I have to rush a mana item while he either rushes hexdrinker or PD.\n\nNow I am not arguing whether Yasuo is weak or strong at the moment, but I am trying to give you insight into why people hate playing against him. You just feel helpless. Alternatively, people that love play him probably in a large part do so because they feel so skillful and powerful during lanign phase,e compared to their opponents. They feel they are being better players simply because their opponents can't react appropriately to what they are doing.\n\nSure, once you get to higher elos and your junglers camps Yasuo 24/7 every time he tries getting fancy he doesn't get to snowball early.

But for sure everyone will react super hard and he&#x27;ll be permabanned. I think.\n\nYasuo is the comeback kid even if poorly played. He can 0/15 in the first 20 minutes but as long as a team buys him 5 more minutes, he'll end that game 10/15 or better.\n\nI generally play Yasuo counters, and there is a very noticeable change in how fast he kills/kits once he reaches about 4 items. You can stomp him into the ground before that. After, he raids your HP in 2-3 hits, even if you're 20/0. A buff means a feeder will come online even sooner.\n\nYou used to be able to tank Yasuo down with mages like Karma or Morg, because they had a tank tree to rely on. Now, if you build resolve in on Karma or Morg, you're just going to die, because the armor bonuses on Resolve aren't built for them (hard cc vs being able to heal/damage as a keystone, and Karma and Morg's hard cc is too conditional to really make Aftershock worth it). He's just stomping melee counters atm, with his barrier procs protecting him while he kites around and takes a cc here or there.\n\nThat's kind of why people don't like the idea of a buff. He already comes back from complete shutdown/feeds. And he's about the only champ who can do it in the magnitude he does.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lil Homie busta","date":"2017-12-08T21:57:19.626+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":8,"body":"**44% ~ 48%** Winrate across every elo and region (https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/pt/champions/stats/yasuo/all) (http://na.op.gg/champion/yasuo/statistics/top)\n\n\"pls rito don't buff this troll pick champion, cuz i rage on my screen when i play against him\"\n\nhttp://s2.quickmeme.com/img/7a/7a2add73451638e1c8eb8a617f7a58228bfaa041017bf0c13b50871c27f54f92.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"SilentBomber","date":"2017-12-09T10:51:41.289+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"So,they give Yasuo MR while most Top fighters struggle to even farm against ranged mages.Nice joke....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-12-08T21:37:01.125+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":5,"body":"yasuo is an AD champ tho, Riot thinks he is perfectly healthy :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scary Door","date":"2017-12-08T22:29:13.972+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":13,"body":"That moment you realize that Yasuo isn't viable in the highest level of play because players that are more skilled actually know how to deal with him.  \n\n-\nYasuo at worlds?
