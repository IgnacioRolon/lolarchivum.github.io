I actually believe Tantram when he says it only takes one report to get _investigated_, but you almost certainly get more severe punishments and are more likely to get a punishment if you have multiple reports. Riot conflates these issues so they don't have to address the real problem of people queuing up together and all reporting the same person. \n\nIf being investigated and being punished are the same thing, then wouldn't 100% of reports result in bans? Assuming you think they aren't in fact the same thing, then what do you think is more likely?

A review is a review. It has literally nothing to do with the amount of reports.\nThe only thing reports previously did do was increase the chance of being reviewed by Tribunal.\nSpeaking of the old system: Why would they have removed report weight (which they have stated **very** explicitly) if they still relied on the number of reports in a single game?\n\n>They just say \"it only takes one report to trigger a review\" and then don't say anything about how the actual review works.\n\nThey haven't explained it in detail, but the bottom line is that they have their machine learning algorithm scan for negative phrases of varying severity. The severity being determined by the frequency of reports for people using such phrases in the big picture.\n\n>You don't make things more complicated than they need to be unless you plan on using the complexity. \n\nAnd I've explained to you how that complexity **is** used. If I include the paragraph above, I did it twice.\n\n>no way they'd track the number of reports unless they're using it.\n\nActually yes. If you believe a statistic may be relevant in the future (which isn't too far fetched for this sort of thing) it absolutely makes sense to track it even if it's not currently used by the program code itself.\nWe're talking about their player behaviour department here, which has literally **only** data as a metric to judge their system. For example the average number of reports per game is an important is pretty much the only metric they have for how much toxicity people perceive.\n\nBut hey, you already made up your mind. The only information we have, and the only information we will ever **get** on the system is by Riot. And you've made very clear that you don't trust them. You've also made clear that you will resort to ad hominems when people do trust them.\nDiscussing Riot's system with you is like discussing future Mars missions with somebody who doesn't trust NASA's information no Mars and who will call people NASA fanboys whenever they cite them as a source.","replies":[{"poster":"Burklight","date":"2017-09-23T00:22:37.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a lot closer to someone telling me the NSA should be trusted because they never spy on citizens and are only here to protect us.
