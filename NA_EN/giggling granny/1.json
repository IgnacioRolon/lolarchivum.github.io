Rather, our team focuses on seeing if design goals are being met with changes and also look to assist with balance reads. \n\nOur team, composed of all high elo players (D3-Masters), attempt to simulate solo queue esque environments and competitive environments.\n\nIn reference to previous cases, the playtest team didn't exist back when Yasuo was released (The team did work on Kalista).\n\nWhen I say that Rammus seems OK in internal playtests, I mean to say that myself and our other primary jungler have played Rammus and have noted that his early game clears are fairly optimal, if not better than live in the current iteration.

This is the evidence , that you dont like the playstyle of the champion.But were happy with the playstyle and you are not supposed to change anything on your own will.\n\nAgain from patch notes 7.10\n''\nReducing Powerball’s duration but having Rammus go faster more often will allow him to decide when he wants to try and chase someone or just back up. When he does go in, we’re giving his other skills slightly more complexity to give him decisions about how he wants to use them. Curling up will still make him incredibly tanky but at the expense of movespeed, and his ult will now steadily stack a slow on people around him. Now, the Armordillo has to decide whether to slow one target to a crawl, or stand still while he takes the heat for the team.''\n\nİ mean wut?? You made its Power ball interruptable and self-slow by 30% , which is equal to exhaust??As Rammus players  we didn't  want anything like that , which is an evidence your ignorence to the community.\n\nİs that all?No.\nThe most important amongst all is the Thornmail update.That was the killing blow to top-lane tanks , which are unplayable now.\nYou gave 250 hp and some griveous wounds but you reduced its damage by %60 even after grievous wounds and increased its gold by 550 and everone thinks , that it compensates itself :D.The most funny part is , we have to buy that item cuz we don't have any other choice. \n\nif you are not aware what you did ,you broke hearts unintentionally. \n\nEdit: With the new rune ''Cheap shot'' whenever rammus uses its W ability , it will get 30 true damage by basic attacks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Giggling Granny","date":"2017-09-26T17:12:26.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Novalas,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Eo3w3Z02,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-09-26T16:14:17.398+0000)\n>\n> Just popping in here.
