It'd make designing items in the future potentially a lot more problematic. It's easier to just have the ability get proc'd only by Evelynn's spells instead.\n\nAs an aside, Evelynn's performing pretty well right now. If you're having difficulties accessing her charm, you may need to try different play patterns (such as flanking, extinguishing the charm early for the slow, or charming a fake target to bait a squishy target into a false sense of security).","replies":[{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2017-12-14T23:59:50.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what about her E bug?

If Evelynn **hits the target with a basic attack or ability**, she will expunge the Curse, refund its mana cost, and briefly slow the target by 65%.If the Curse lasts at least 2.\n\nAnd to exactly answer your question it simply for the sake of counterplay and balance. By giving power to the kit through an item it can be heavily unbalanced. The item could even be nerf because of that. (Because Riot usually prefers to avoid nerfing a champion because of an item except for extreme abuse). The balance between kit power and build power would be thinner and harder to deal with. \n\nHextech revolver got what? 700 range? Almost as large as Eve's stealth Radius. You don't want Eve to be balanced around it (it would means that she's more or less obliged to build it to be efficient). And she would be balanced around it since it would be a point & click cc every 40s. The same could apply more or less to other Hextech item since they're both AoE they can land easily (not as much as a point & click) due to large radius hit and fast travel time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nut on my Butt","date":"2017-12-14T23:54:04.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:107}} also warns people.
