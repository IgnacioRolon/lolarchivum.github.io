I have no idea why riot removed this but i think it is a great feature. People who are new to the game can find that a way as A) Seeing high elo gameplay B) learn about a champion, and C) overall Observations. This helped me when i was new set a goal for my rank and learn about my main at the time Katarina. I feel as if new players of now should still be filled with the excitement of scrolling through and seeing a high elo summoner playing as their character. My moral is i think riot should bring that feature back.

It still works on the old one just fine, though your main page is very outdated (patch 4.15 notes, etc)\n\nPosted a few months ago:\n\nYou can actually get it back! I can't take credit for this, but after months of being frustrated about this, I checked to see if someone had found a solution, and I found this Reddit post:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4rhymk/what_happened_to_the_spectate_high_elo_players/\n\nInstructions:\n\nGo to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client_config_na\\releases\\0.0.0.58\\deploy\\ and find the file called \"lol.properties\" (This is a text file, so open it with a text editor. You will need to adjust your folder path depending on install location or version changes.)\n\nFind this line:\nlobbyLandingURL=https://frontpage.na.leagueoflegends.com/$localeCode/client/landing\n\nChange it to:\nlobbyLandingURL=\n\nSave the file. (It's also a good idea to save a backup of the original in case you wish to revert easily.)\n\nWhat the client seems to do is load a webpage onto the main client page. When you remove this URL, the client will show a different layout, and the Spectate Live section will be on the upper left of the main page.\n\nSince this change is just preventing a page from loading (You could also possibly just block this with your firewall instead of altering the file, but I haven't tested this.), I don't believe that this is against Riot's terms of service, and they're still providing the old spectate functionality. This doesn't change the in-game files in any way.\n\nAgain, I can't take credit for this, but let your friends know that they can spectate again if they wish!","replies":[{"poster":"ShirukuSama","date":"2017-01-04T12:46:24.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome, Its working !!! \n\nThanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"aspects1","date":"2017-01-04T11:29:14.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"upvote so this gets to top","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MatthewRT2","date":"2017-01-03T07:48:01.482+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember every time i saw a vlad or brand i would insta spectate (i've became a support since then) now i would probably spectate alot of high elo thresh players to see how i can improve myself","replies":[]},{"poster":"WASHU HAKUBI ToT","date":"2017-01-03T22:17:34.147+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"10000% i agree completely that i miss that \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2mEWaUsbkw","replies":[]},{"poster":"KaijuJaeger1","date":"2017-01-03T20:42:34.548+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I completely agree.
