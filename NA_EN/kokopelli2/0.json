Since we cannot know, according to quantum law, the Garen is both in the bush and isn&#039;t, in what is called a superposition of states. It is only when we facecheck the bush and learn the condition of the Garen that the superposition is lost, and Garen becomes one or the other (in the bush or not in the bush). This situation is sometimes called quantum indeterminacy or the observer&#039;s paradox: the observation or measurement itself affects an outcome, so that the outcome as such does not exist unless the measurement is made. (That is, there is no single outcome unless it is observed.)\r\n\r\n We know that superposition actually occurs at every elo level, because there are observable effects of interference, in which a single particle is demonstrated to be in multiple locations simultaneously. What that fact implies about the nature of reality on the observable level (Garen, for example, as opposed to entire teams) is one of the stickiest areas of quantum physics. Schr&ouml;dinger himself is rumored to have said, later in life, that he wished he had never met that Garen. \r\n\r\n Schr&ouml;dinger&#039;s famous thought experiment poses the question, when does a MIA stop existing as a superposition of states and become one or the other? (More technically, when does the actual Bush stop being a linear combination of states, both empty and containing a Garen, and instead begins to have a singular classical description?) If the bush is facechecked, it can only be one. Our experience says that no bush can be both empty and containing an enemy; yet the bush, it seems from the thought experiment, can be such a mixture. Is Garen required to be an observer, or does his existence in a single well-defined classical state require another external observer?\r\n\r\nCredits to the writer: BlackDestruction\r\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=831444","replies":[{"poster":"Void Nargacuga","date":"2016-01-10T16:58:08.467+0000","up_votes":55,"down_votes":0,"body":"Relevant enough.\nhttp://img.memecdn.com/sundaymorninglolz-7-garen-amp-039-s-house_o_2078103.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Pale Pirate","date":"2016-01-10T21:42:24.280+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's got to be a necromancer from Skyrim.","replies":[{"poster":"badooga","date":"2016-01-10T23:42:41.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL I get it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2016-01-11T18:12:22.907+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then Garen says, \"Wait a minute...

If I am going to find this unseen clap I must check everywhere, he thought. TF's last act was to seek the clap in the bush, so he put his hand in the bush, and ...\n\nPutting all possible dangers in the bush aside for a moment, this leads to the second part of the mystery. Is it possible that an observable state might be a multiple according to the number of senses observing. If TF received the clap, then what is known about the contents of the bush? Would a Garen in the bush be the unseen hand that shared the clap with TF, or might that Garen choose not to be observed by TF's probing hand? However, assuming Garen was in the bush, if the bush was face checked, thus putting both in the bush, then the Garen would be seen. One observation is guaranteed. One observation is potential. Only not sensing the bush at all avoids the outcome of knowing. Therefore, the Garen in the bush has multiple states (there or not according to the number of sense observing), is a variable force (having potential), and is possibly of no matter while not observed.","replies":[{"poster":"Red Silk","date":"2016-01-13T23:21:48.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can clap with one hand.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mech0p","date":"2016-01-11T04:42:46.121+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone listened in school....\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"darapier17","date":"2016-01-11T02:22:36.027+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Due to the fact that the Garen is in fact on the enemy team, and therefore can be seen by someone, can thus not be in both states at the same time.

Unfortunately, the enemy team, all of which can see the garen, will not be forthcoming with such information, and as there is no ward in the bush, one must ask the question; in order for a single state to be achieved (i.e garen being either there or not), does the observer have to facecheck the bush himself, rather, does the Garen himself exist in different states depending on who is measuring him. The answer to this question may incite the other question; are there different realities? Thi is supported by the Garen being in different states depending of different observers.
