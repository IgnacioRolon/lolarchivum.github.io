Ignore your team when they tell you to do stupid shit like 2v5 invade dragon, unless they show signs of being mature and competent and have an actual plan.\n\nDo not waste your time trying to cooperate with or save trash players, just focus on opportunities and getting as fed as possible from farming (and usually defending while they feed).\n\nDo not waste time arguing with children, you cant win - they are immune to logic, reason, common sense, basic strategy, sarcasm, humor, and flaming. If they want to cry, let them cry, /ignore and focus on the game. Replying just makes them tilt themselves harder.\n\nNever try to help a feeding bot lane, unless you have A; more backup (ie 4v2) or B; really good gank synergy. Chances are you will just die 3v2 if they are already ahead and have your bot under turret. Same goes for fed top juggernauts.

Play one champ, but main at least 3 just in case your favorite gets banned/picked.\n2. Farm CS.\n3. Do not trade early game with enemies when there is a wave of enemy minions in between you guys.\n4. Help your team. Want to know why they are toxic? It is because they are tilted, they are dying non stop. Ganking them will help them gain back momentum.\n5. Actually try. People just go into League leaning back not caring really, but you need to try. Trying makes you better, doing less than the best you can does not improve your play style.\n6. Place wards in enemy jungle early game instead of warding the river. This way you know if the enemy jungler is farming top side or bot side. If the enemy jungler is mia, then he is either about to gank someone or hes back at base. So do not take risks to all in someone if their enemy jungler is mia.\n7. Use the right runes/masteries/items. When I played Jayce on this account (about 2 months ago?), I would use armor pen runes to put more damage in enemies. But it was a lot harder to get cs. Then on my main account, I use all AD runes, now i get the most cs every game I play.\n8. If people do become toxic, just ignore it/mute them. Responding to them only fuels them to talk more shit to your team, and when they do that, your team begins to bash the toxic player to where he does not care if you win or lose.\n\nGood luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Craft Zeppelin","date":"2016-10-31T01:40:07.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Prestofoe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Pqnc0IuK,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-10-31T01:27:16.308+0000)\n>\n> League is a team based game a lot of silvers don&amp;#039;t understand, but i do i can&amp;#039;t carry because they don&amp;#039;t understand.
