Now everything seemed to work well until I started a game. When I got to the loading screen before a game starts after about 20 seconds the screen freezed, meaning that I was stuck at 40% (for example). I first thought that someone had a bad connection or that I just had to wait a little bit but I waited around 5 minutes, no more, and then I tried to go back to my desktop. It didn't work of course, but I could hear a video I was watching on youtube that I didn't pause before the loading screen came up.\r\nThe only thing that worked was to adjust the volume, brightness, and turn off my computer as well as putting my computer to sleep. So I put my computer to sleep and turned it back on and I was on the game screen of LOL, I could see my champpion, I could see the minions spawning, But I couldn't choose to lvl up an ability or even move. There was the \"don't be AFK\" pop-up and then I put it back to sleep, turned it back on, and then the pop-up changed by \"We are going to disconnect you for inactivity\" and there was the \"Attempting to reconnect\" thingy. \r\nI tried uninstalling and reinstalling, still got the same problem.\r\n\r\nThank you if you ever try helping me !\r\nHave a nice week-end.","replies":[{"poster":"CTarik","date":"2016-12-21T18:28:54.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Eli","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-24T17:46:49.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With a new rig, it's super important to make sure that all of your drivers and version of windows are up to date.
