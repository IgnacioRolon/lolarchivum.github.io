English is not my native language, so I don't know if it's accepted in American English, but the anacoluthons create some pretty funny/strange sentences. :)\n\n> **Masked Shaco**: A practitioner of masked dance drama, many of Shaco's performances begin as social commentary...\n\nTo me, it means that Shaco's performances are a practitioner of masked dance drama.\n\n> **Groovy Zilean**: Consistently in a near-comatose state from peering across the space-time continuum, Zilean's more recent hobbies include being terrible at hacky-sack\n\nHis recent hobbies are in a near-comatose state? ;-p\n\n> **Vandal Vladimir**:Leader of the notorious Vandals, Vladimir's exposure to residual radiation has given him control over the blood of living organisms\n\nVlad's exposure to radiation is the leader of the Vandals?\n\n> **Blood Moon Thresh**: A demon summoned on the night of the Blood Moon, Thresh's insatiable urge to torture and kill is fueled by thousands of vengeful spirits drawn to his lantern\n\nHis insatiable urge to torture and kill is a demon?\n\n> **Blood Moon Diana**: A child chosen by the Blood Moon itself, Diana's mind has been opened to the lost ways of the cult\n\nDiana's mind is a child? :)\n\n> **Happy Elf Teemo**: An elf renowned for his unflinching happiness in all things, some people once believed that under Teemo’s merry exterior lay the heart of a killer\n\n\n\n> **Warring Kingdoms Nidalee**: A wild, untamed fighter steeped in myth, it is difficult to know what is true of Nidalee and what is legend\n\n\n> **Dreadnova Gangplank**: Once a high ranking admiral in the Royal Space Military, Gangplank's reign of terror began when he stole and proliferated blueprints\n\n\nSo, are anacoluthons okay in English?\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"GreatUnknown","date":"2019-03-22T06:11:07.283+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please, for the love of Poro, refer to Riplakish's response. This is NOT grammatically correct. It has nothing to do with \"feeling\" you get as a NS, it's just incorrect. \n\nTo reiterate, since the modifiers separated by the comma only have impersonal verbs or other grammatical structures which do not signify who is performing the action or being in the mentioned state, the quality of the modifier is ascribed to the first MAIN noun in the noun phrase... \n\nSo, in \"A practitioner of masked dance drama, many of Shaco's performances begin as social commentary\", that part before the comma is modifying the noun \"performances\", since \"Shaco's\" is just another modifier to \"performances\". Instead it should be sth like this: \"A practitioner of masked dance drama, Shaco intended many of his performances to serve as social commentary.\"\n\n{{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot LegendLarry","date":"2019-03-21T17:50:28.684+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"TIL what an anacoluthon  is.\n\nHere's how I make sense of it:\n\n\"As a practitioner of masked dance drama many of Shaco's performances begin as social commentary...\"\n\nversus\n\n\"A practitioner of masked dance drama, many of Shaco's performances begin as social commentary...\"\n\nThat comma replaces the \"as\" at the beginning of a sentence.

Usage of dangling modifiers is widely considered poor form as it leads to confusion and thereby breaks the most basic rule of good writing: clarity. If I were you, I wouldn't presume that your being hired means that your grammar is perfect, as you seem to imply. Even good writers can have bad habits.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riplakish","date":"2019-03-21T23:08:22.025+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"On the contrary, The OP has a great point, but he doesn't know the right words to use. While Anacoluthons can be caused by grammatical error, the term is generally saved for when they are used correctly. What the OP is trying to refer to is dangling/misplaced modifiers. If you have access to it, you should check out the Chicago Manual of Style, 17th edition, section 5.115.\n\nIn the sentence, \"Being a thoughtful mother, I believe Meg gives her children good advice.\" the writer at first seems to be attesting to his or her own thoughtfulness rather than Meg’s.\n\nIn the sentence, \"Consistently in a near-comatose state from peering across the space-time continuum, Zilean's more recent hobbies include being terrible at hacky-sack.\" the writer seems to be saying that Zilean's hobbies are consistently near-comotose.\n\nIt's a problem of modifiers. The correct reference is not present. In the Zilean example, the noun Zilean is not the reference due to the possessive attached.
