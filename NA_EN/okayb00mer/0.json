Does this appear every time you hit this screen?  Does it occur multiple times per logged-in session?  Are there things you're doing consistently before you notice it appearing? (E.g., does it only appear after you play a game? Right after logging in and going directly to that screen? Taking some other action?)\n\nAnything else that you can share to help us reproduce this consistently would be super helpful. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"OKAYB00MER","date":"2016-06-29T23:56:10.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to say \"yes\" to all of your questions because they describe exactly what I am encountering.","replies":[]}]}]}
