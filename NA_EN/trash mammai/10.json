Neeko throws her ability completely randomly and often doesn't hit many champions despite her huge AOE. Yasuo if he has his ability ready and the enemy with most items is reviving with GA, will take a short break, stand still and do literaly nothing to help the team, classic yasuo. Soraka sometimes has odd priorities as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Defacyde","date":"2019-12-09T16:49:10.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dunno what they changed with last set but they render him totaly useless most of time due to him putting the shield in wrong direction","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-12-07T06:20:18.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More often he puts it up facing absolutely nothing at all.","replies":[]}]}
