I personally find him very lacking.\nFirst of all, he's excessively dependent on the chimes. They're nice bumps when he needs mana, but to get any really poke with them, he has to collect 25, which puts you pretty deep into the game at that point, as half your chimes are unobtainable in the enemy jungle where their jungler will kill you. There needs to be a rearrangement of when you get the strike-through cone upgrade. After the slow and the cone, Bard generally does fine and can help to zone a lane very effectively. Last thing about the chimes, the spawning in the enemy side of the map has to stop. Early games where nearly the entire enemy jungle is filled with chimes is just insulting and dangerous, and no amount of \"risk/reward\" will merit giving their jungler a kill to bring your kit to potential.\nHis Q has issues. It's great for damage, but it just travels wayyy too slow and with next to no range. Bard has to practically be on top of enemies to land Q, which kind of sucks for him considering he's super squishy. If they either extended the range and increased the move speed of it, OR had it work like Lissandra's Q and extend further once it hits a foe, this would probably be a great skill. Until then, it's a bit too easy to miss without killing yourself in the process, especially since nearly every ADC and support can out-range Bard. \nW is fine as it is, though I'd like some better healing from the start so it's not so useless when you need to quickly heal your ADC. Bard's a little rough in saving the ADC once enemies are on them, so better instant healing would help.\nMagical Journey, as everyone has noted, is buggy and could use some better clarity in how you're supposed to go through it. A different cursor clicker would assist in this, similar to Thresh's lantern.\nR is just weird. I'd almost prefer that it didn't work on allies, as it seems to hinder them more than help whenever you land it. For him to have such a kit that relies on next to nothing in terms of peel, if his ult didn't work on allies, this would be amazing in helping your team land kills and escape tough situations. I cannot think of many situations where you actually need to mass Zhonya's your team aside from evading an ult like Ziggs' or Jinx's, but those are too few to warrant the effect on allies.\nHaving Bard roam is a novel idea and all, but as he stands, he struggles to keep up with almost all other supports, especially since every other support can reach full potential with gold and items and not have to worry about being gated by roaming for chimes. Even Sona and Zilean, who have very similar kits to Bard can out-pace him in a minute because they never have to leave the lane in order to be successful, except to ward. I feel that Bard as he is now is a bit gimmicky, and could use some work to pull him up to par with everyone else. I'm rather surprised that he made it out of the PBE as he is, considering how many people are so confused with him and how frustrating it is to play as him with no ability to help your ADC once the shit really goes down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MommyMomi","date":"2015-03-20T01:00:59.884+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":32,"body":"To be fair, he is a completely useless champion.

The reasoning behind it was because everyone kept using it incorrectly, and because English is controlled by the English-speaking community rather than an authoritative council, they changed the definition to fit how everyone was using it. Similar reasoning as to why the word \"Twerk\" can be found in dictionaries.\n\nPersonally I'm against the change (how else would we say \"actually happened\"?), but I'm also a sucker for following the rules and what's written, so technically ActressEmmaStone's post is correct in it's usage of the term \"Literally\".\n\nEdit:apparently Dictionary.com also agrees with the change to the definition (but I'm too lazy to put it up there and I think I have enough sources to prove the point).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Uiru","date":"2015-03-19T23:29:24.907+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure who I hate more, my adc when I'm playing support, or my support when I'm (admittedly poorly) playing adc.

Instead of mid, he may gank top, or invade enemy jungle.\n> \n> What people do not seem to get is that people who play ADC and are not good at the last hit/poke deal, they expect a babysit by the support to shore up their weaknesses. On the pro level, {{champion:432}} is PERFECT. However, short of that, the ADC isn't stable enough for the support to walk more than ten seconds away. Seriously. That's the biggest issue I see.\n\nI don't expect a babysit, but when the enemy has Leona and Draven/Cait/MF in the same lane I expect some lane presence from my support. Their job is to support me and the team once it is safe for them to roam. If I am barely living with him there what makes you think I should be fine without him. If they tower dove me the moment you left and you say \"Should have played safe\" I would like to personally slap you for your stupidity. I was under the tower playing safe. I got 2v1'd and you were out there grabbing temporary boosts.\n\nEven in the LCS the supports are in lane near 24/7. They only leave with a purpose. Bard doesn't. He leaves to gather chimes for no reason half the time. On top of this his presence is very minor even when he is there because only 2 abilities actually put pressure. His passive and stun. His portal is neigh useless in lane. His health packs cost a ton of mana for a less than Soraka/Nami/Taric/etc. level healing even when charged. His ult is only useful for team fights as in most skirmishes it will freeze both sides and accomplish nothing if no help is on the way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crate of Cobras","date":"2015-03-20T02:06:45.169+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's an idea for you that comes from basic counselling and talking techniques:\n\nYou shouldn't have said: \"Why did you\" when you got the chance to. Implicating somebody as entirely responsible, even if they are, only demoralizes them, and makes you their enemy. Rewording it without using \"you\" is much stronger than people realize. \n\nAlso honestly, having Bard as a support a couple of times, I don't appreciate when Bard starts roaming when we're behind. I don't know if that was your case, but say when the enemy lane is ahead and is Leona + Kalista, I'd prefer having a second person so I don't get popped instantly without retaliation.\n\nI should mention I hate playing ADC, but often get forced into it because I play with... more focused players? Anyways, I've always hated seeing Bard in the few times I've seen him as my support, because he represents people with no conception of support as a role playing it merely because Bard is new. Support is harder than just picking Bard and playing Bard. People don't know how to poke, stay parallel, provide lane presence, etc. Bard players shit on how support is traditionally played, and they often fail aside from that because of his high skill cap. I short, he's a passing typhoon of failure in bot lane, and will soon be replaced as people fail and quit. I look at him as a temporary problem, only to be replaced by actually good players who stop building fucking damage on a support with garbage ratios.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phife","date":"2015-03-19T23:26:20.823+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lmfao, on point!\n\nIve never played a game of bard where the ADC doesn't do this.","replies":[{"poster":"Drunken PwNeR","date":"2015-03-20T00:39:44.385+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played a game where my ADC could not stop himself from stepping on the pad.

But i will tell you something tho, by doing this kind of thread, you are just acting like them. You are putting the blame on your teammate, instead of simply looking at what you could do better. I'm not saying it your fault he  died, (it obvious that the adc going 1v2 early game (i assume early, since you were backing for a sightstone) wasnt necessary going to pull the double kill xD), but surely there is some things you could still improve to become a better player. I can tell simply by looking how much you focus on what other people did wrong. Supports can carry games.","replies":[]}]}
