By this logic outside tanks nobody can possibly be strong. And since damage is overbuffed even tanks aren't strong. So why not just remove the bansystem since everyone is balanced?\n\nTrynda kills everyone under ult? CC\nYasuo jumps around killing everyone? CC\nYi is fed, and kills everyone in 2 seconds?

Also it's not just Pyke. You can say the same weakness to like 95% of the champions. Will you be able to CC Pyke, if you already used it on Yasuo, Tryndamere, and Jinx to get them? CC-nuke is not a Pyke specific counter. It's the ultimate tactic. It's like saying, that. He is easy to counter.

Yet they also have ways to survive. The point is, that the cc+nuke is not Pyke's weakness. It's everyone's weakness who isn't a tank. It's like. X champion is easy to beat. Just reduce it's health to 0 while you keep your health above 0.

They get poked to death, if both enemy has poking skills. And their self sustain is much lower.\n\nAlso his base defenses are just so damn high. Yeah he goes against 2, but he got an ADC too. Right now when i play an all-in tank. It's better to focus ANY adc over Pyke on laning phase. Simply because they die easier.\n\nWhat i would change:\n\nReduce early defense, or make self heal lower. Make him vulnerable against something. Right now the only thing you can do is ignore. You can't poke him nor all-in him.\n\nMake Q spend the mana when casting starts. Right now if you interrupt Pyke, then he pays 0 mana for that skill.\n\nMake ultimate into turret style. No extra gold in overall, but gives the killing reward to someone else, if there is anyone who assisted.","replies":[]}]}]}
