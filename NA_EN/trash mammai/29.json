Blitzcrank/Kassadin being the only two with proper ones that DISRUPT rather than completely shut down with the click of a single button. \r\n\r\n{{champion:86}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:16}} are all the champions with silence that feel unfair to play against. Typically they aren&#039;t considered &#039;omg plz nerf&quot; tier but they do all cause the issue where they throw out their silence and you feel as if you had literally no way to counter anything they do during that time and effectively &quot;cheating&quot; you out of a trade. Garen/Cho don&#039;t have this big of an effect on ranged champs normally but against Melee they are infuriating. Soraka&#039;s being the worst one\r\n\r\n{{champion:53}} {{champion:38}} are both examples of healthy silences. Blitz Q doesn&#039;t shut down a team for an entire fight and instead briefly shuts them down to disrupt. Kassadin&#039;s is a weird type of silence as it stops channels but doesn&#039;t TECHNICALLY actually &quot;silence&quot; \r\n\r\n\r\nAnother thing is Roots/Snares. ONE needs to be chosen and remove the other. Both are the same thing by definition where they trap you and immobilize movement. This should work similar to grounded (even though grounded is a busted debuff) where it not only prevents movement abilities but also prevents movement in general, but still allows the ability to use any other skill. \r\n\r\nstuns, knockups, knockbacks etc. all need to be reworked into a more healthy status effect that actually feels good to use but not so good that you feel like there was 0 counterplay when used against you. \r\n\r\nThat &quot;just dodge&quot; excuse doesn&#039;t work anymore in league of no CD/Mana issues","replies":[{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2018-02-04T10:14:08.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Grounded is a busted debuff\" \n\nMy friend, you would likely despise playing Smite. That game has been using Cripple, which also locks you out of movement abilities, for a while now. In fact, Cripple and Roots are two separate things (movement abilities aren't locked out in Roots, just walking).\n\nLeague has very few instances of Grounded abilities, and roots _by default_ keep you from using movement abilities. In that fashion, Grounded as a debuff is perfectly fine as it is.","replies":[]}]}
