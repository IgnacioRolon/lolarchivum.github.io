After which I had an easy time in jungle and ganking was insanely easy. I found myself tanking the entire enemy team and still getting kills really easy. \r\n\r\nI went like 7/0/9 and the entire time I was asking myself.

That could change if more and more people realize you can close the gap super fast with W and Righteous Glory. \n\nNot only that, I don't think a lot of people have quite fully gotten over the changes that were made to him like a year (?) ago. He lost a lot of his damage and stickiness which is what people loved him for. He's definitely still incredibly strong, but he has his clear strength and weakness.\n\nTo quote Phreak: Pro's only like using the most bull shit champions they can get their hands on. Skarner doesn't really fall under that category.

What if she saves her slow for your super dash? Can you still catch? Her rend is a % slow that is 45% at max rank. So if she saves it for your super dash, she slows you down pretty dramatically.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-06-09T20:13:16.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally speaking, I watch for when she uses it before going in, once she uses it, that opens an open window of opportunity to catch her. Skarner is heavily reliant on follow up damage, so she usually has other targets she can use her slows on/nor should you be using your ultimate without anyone else around. If you did caught by it, it does slow you down quite enough for her to kite you, I will admit.  \n\nI also run swiftness mastery on top of the boots of swiftness, altogether, you get a 32% (I think) reduction in slow debuffs. Coupled with Furor which is easy to proc with E (its hitbox is deceptively big), speeds you up while slows Kalista down, you can usually get on top of Kalista even if she rends you, assuming you time it properly.","replies":[{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2015-06-09T21:18:37.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Makes sense to me.

If you don't catch an overextending laner off guard, the lack of a gapcloser and reliable ranged cc(E is really easy to dodge on long range) realy makes it hard to get an advantage early, and without an early advantage, it gets hard to be usefull in teamfights.\nHe also has problems in dueling other popular junglers, and if he doesn't get of a good ult(which is hard if the enemy team knows how to position/peel), his impact in teamfights is low.\nThe effort he has to make to accomplish anything is to high compared to the medicore reward. Especially his passive sucks, land 3 spells AND THEN AN AA to get what Nauts passive does on the first AA...\n\nBesides that, i still hate that they killed hybrid and ap scarner at top with the rework, his scaleings are just poor since then.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-06-05T22:26:41.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mostly it is because whatever he can do, other champs can do it better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raxicor","date":"2015-06-05T22:18:10.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's a fun one to play.

Back then it use to be the case where you run at someone really fast, drag them to your team, then perma-slow anyone who tried to attack your ADC. The first thing that really killed Skarner was the removal of Shurelya's Reverie. That got changed into the Coin for support and so jungle Skarner couldn't build it reasonably (however that got remedied with Righteous Glory).\n\nThe second thing they did was rework Skarner into something that most people just aren't as happy with. They took the slow off his Q and put it on his E (which use to have no reason to be leveled) and reduced the damage on almost all his abilities. They also made his Q and W work on a \"ramp up\" mechanic (which I personally dislike).\n\nAll in all, they change his mechanics so that he keeps his \"stickyness\" but took away a great deal of his damage and reduced his ability to peel. Personally I stopped liking the different Skarner after the changes and I think most who use to play him feel the same. As for everyone else, he's a giant scorpion, and people generally are less attracted to playing as inhuman characters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ternt","date":"2015-06-05T22:11:22.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skarner's ult is OP though lol.
