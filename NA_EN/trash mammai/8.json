What is the point of the but why’s? “Ugh why does this champions kit do damage ugh what the fuck!”\n\nThis complaint makes no sense. And Fioras vitals follow a pattern. The first viral always spawns facing blue base, then it’ll be back or down, then front or up. It never spawns unfairly, so once a fight starts it’s quite possible to keep her away from it. And if she Qs aggressively for it in lane she can be punished.","replies":[]}]}
