His Q stops when it connects but if he can pass through units would it still stop when it hits or would it go right through? I'd imagine it still stops on collision but idk","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-03T02:37:08.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to the wiki, if he's under the effects of Ghost or some other spell that ignores unit collision, his Q will still work normally when he comes into contact with enemy units (damage, CC, the spell ends). I suppose it helps him navigate through friendly units more easily.","replies":[]}]}
