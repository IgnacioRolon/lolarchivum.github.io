A phage with some boots will let you close the distance and hook them before they can react. \n\nWorks on Lissandra as well to an extent, but her root makes it harder to burst her down.\n\nLulu is fucking impossible, and I've never faced Swain in lane as Darius.\n\nAs for melees that can handle most ranged champs, Wukong is a very good choice due to his instant gap closer and ability to stealth. I find Shen works fairly well too, but don't expect to get many kills on your laning opponent. He mostly wins lane by being an immovable. Fiora is good as well. I've beaten Teemo's ass in lane purely because he couldn't handle my early damage as Fiora. Even his blind didn't save him. \n\nPantheon should do well against Teemo and Gnar, but the other three might pose some problems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2015-05-26T08:54:30.639+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't recommend using Renekton against Lulu.\n\nThe result is usually painful and embarrassing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sohleks","date":"2015-05-26T03:53:18.215+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shyvana wouldn't be much better for your purposes. The best you can hope for is to outtank their harass or outshove them because you will get kited almost as hard as Darius and won't have kill potential without help.\n\n{{champion:39}} Irelia is the most infamous anti range bruiser. She has a point and click gapcloser that resets if it kills (if they stand near a low hp cs of your you have a free opening). She has a long duration stun. She has serious burst damage for you to use during that stun. She shrugs off CC with her passive making it harder to kite her.\n\n{{champion:114}} Double gap closer as a normal ability; huge damage, huge cheese potential. Ult can function as a 3rd gap closer and makes you untargetable. Effective versus squishies, weak versus tanky bruisers tho.\n\n{{champion:79}} Top lane Gragas. It is not meta and probably banned for his jungle. But he is beefy, sustains, has huge CC... You play Solo lane Gragas as AP.\n\n{{champion:31}} Huge sustain, good pushing power. Ranged silence super annoying. Survives almost any lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-05-26T08:56:00.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DPS assassins like {{champion:114}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:23}} actually are stronger than traditional assassins vs tanks and tanky bruisers though, because unlike burst assassins they have high sustained damage and in 1v1's usually lifesteal back most of the damage they take.\nYou saying Fiora is weak vs tanky bruisers is incorrect, when I am playing Fiora I win every single 1v1 vs tanks and bruisers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-05-26T08:53:03.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the problem with Darius.
