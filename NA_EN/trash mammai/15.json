He can still do fair damage to a tank as well as a carry because of the True damage on his Ult. This made him a fair burst mage in this meta. His passive give health and mana sustain as well. \n\nI find it funny that OP claims that Garen is an easily kitable melee yet thinks Cho'gath is a problem. (no dashes or MS boosts) The only way chogath gets to you is if a) he flashes, b) he chain CC's because it's not that hard to dodge his rupture otherwise.\n\nSilence is Problematic on the Burst Assassins because it didn't allow for much counter play yes. Cho is more immobile burst mage, If he catches you, you were in positional error. He also had the Silence initially because he was initially used as a tank. Tanks like Cho, Garen, and Blitz use their silences for team disruption, which perfectly fits their role as a tank. Malzahar can also justify having the silence for team disruption, considering he can't use very well reactionary.","replies":[{"poster":"Trash MammaI","date":"2015-05-25T06:25:06.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Garen doesn't have an AoE knockup/slow into one skill that can be used at a range, albeit dodgable but it's still there, said that in the OP. \nGaren also doesn't have an AoE cone silence.
