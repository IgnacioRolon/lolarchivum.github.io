She's pretty much a top-lane assassin, which means her all-in potential is spectacular and if she jumps you at mid to low health she will probably kill you.  But she has all the same weaknesses assassins do, and her being melee and not having great wave-clear accentuates this.  Here's another weakness of hers that wasn't mentioned.\n\nShe *has* to snowball.  A Riven that's not ahead is significantly behind.  Since she has minimal utility and only brings damage, she needs to be outscaling not only her lane opponent but also most of the enemy team in order to have any big impact outside of lane.  Tanky people who don't need a whole lot of farm (Maokai for instance) are her natural bane since they can pin her down in lane, not die to her combo, sustain through her burst, and keep her going even with them.  They will scale up mid to late game, she won't.  A Riven that isn't significantly fed is a Riven that's probably trying to jump into teamfights only to get killed by accident by the enemy mid-laner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MAZZ1M0","date":"2015-04-25T18:47:33.526+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"Another Riven op thread.\nLearn to counter her people. She only wipes face when 2 conditions are met.\n\n1: She knows she can all-in you. If she doesn't and does, it's entirely luck and they'll usually die. She bursts. She _has_ to be able to burst most toplane matchups. If she can't burst you down to a point where her passive AA kills you, you can and should be killing her.\n2: Her shield is up for the all-in. Once a Riven has decided she's ready to wreck you, the shield has to be up against most toplane opponents as many champions actually outdamage her early on. It just doesn't seem that way because her shield takes away most of the damage you'd normally kill her with.\n\nSo... learning curve 101: If she can all-in you, play safe. Do **not** run out to grab that minion. Do **not** get in E+Q+W range. Staying in range of half her combo is usually fairly safe if you're a fighter or tank. If she's dumb enough to try and burst you using half her combo just to get to you, you should win if you actually know what you're doing. (Sidenote: Olaf massacres Riven because of this.)\n\nEngage after she blows her E when you know _you_ can win. If you can tank _enough_ to kill her before she kills you, do it. She _will_ fall behind for little while. Then just ward so she doesn't pick up kills mid.\n\nAnd this is a big one, I see this a lot. For the love of all things good, **do not chase her if she's _almost_ dead!** Getting that far probably did a number on you which means as soon her cooldowns reset while you're chasing her, she'll dash back to you and castrate you before you realize what happened. Let her back. More cs gold and xp for you. It's okay to get ahead that way. You'll kill her eventually.\n\nFinally, pay attention to her items at all times. If she gets Tiamat or Brutalizer she gets a massive powerspike. Be aware of her damage output and how you'll hold up at all times. Going in to fight and \"test it out\" will just get you killed. Know ahead of time, don't engage, and laugh at the Riven prolly crying and raging over allchat cuz u won't engage. Farm up. It is OK not to get kills. Riven just baits noobs so hard. Learn people. She's not invincible. Kayle, Jax, and Yasuo last season, they were f%^ing GODS. I _know_ what op looks like now. Don't complain about a champ that can easily be outdone by just playing smart. She gets rolling when you guys don't understand her burst and she kills you for gold. _Learn, don't complain._ **That's** the mentality that will get you better at this game.\n\nNow if your top laner feeds and she rolls into other lanes, that's a bit different. You'll mostly have to rely on vision control and grouping to catch her, but people should be warding anyway so that's not a special expectation for Riven. that fact that no one _does_ ward isn't something I can help you with. I usually just pester teammates to upgrade their trinkets and light up the map. Had a nice game last night where it worked. Map was lit up like Madison Square Garden.

It's when they E in that you should be worried. Riven is in no way op. These threads just annoy me because she can be shut down early. Players don't adjust their playstyle. That's the only reason she rickrolls people so frequently. There's nothing wrong with her counterplay.

I don't use him. Too boring imo.\n\nDoes Riven capitalize on dumb-decision making more than most champs? Yea, she _snowballs_ from it. There's no reason to constantly die against her though. I can speak from experience I've only lost lane to a Riven 3-5 times that I can recall. I follow my own advice and win. Aside from those times, if a Riven wrecks me it's because she got fed somewhere else and we have no vision -or she's just snowballed so much, we can't kill her with her teammates around. The same could be said of any champ though. Try killing a LeBlanc 3 levels ahead of all of you with 3 tanks covering her retreat from deletions. There's far worse than any Riven out there because Riven counterplay is easy to take advantage of, LeBlanc, Zed, Fizz, (insert assassin here) are usually much harder because of their escapes. Let a Riven get into a teamfight without E up. If you can't kill her then, you're doing something wrong.

Couple of CC (with exhaust) is enough to disable her entirely. She is forced to back off or die.\n\nI had one game where I got destroyed by CC from the enemy team. I was pretty far ahead in terms of farm and kills. But Leona and Nautilus just controlled me in team fights. It was pretty hard to execute a proper combo and kill their squishies. Instead I got melted and we lost.\n\nAgainst Riven in lane you want to build protections. It really depends what champion you're playing. Go for damage if you know what you're dealing with. But Riven can die pretty easily early game if you know what she is doing and if her cooldowns are off.\n\nI would say Riven is balanced because she can be shut down quite easily in team fights.\n\nThere are lots of risks actually: bad combo = dead or forced to back, non-existent sustain early game, long cooldowns early game, Riven gets stomped by chain CC.\n\nIf you're team lacks any hard CC, Riven has easier time. That's for sure. Depends how good the player is. It also depends on the lane opponent. If Riven's lane opponent has no clue what he is dealing with, Riven wins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iittala","date":"2015-04-25T16:14:55.497+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play {{champion:6}} dont let her all in you level 1..

She snowballs extremely hard, and IMHO that's the only real \"problem\" with her.

Zed has his shadows, Talon can try to disengage with mobility, Ahri has her Charm + being ranged, LeBlanc has her W return + being ranged (+ chains against melees..), xerath has range and a stun, fiora has temporary invulnerability (and a parry but eh, depending on who she's facing that can be useless).... riven has mobility to get to her target / try to get away (though have in mind that if she uses her mobility to get to you, she either loses part of her damage or she \"wastes\" her shield) and a shield to try and survive.\n\nProblem arises when, IF she gets ahead, you CAN'T kill her, you CAN'T get near her or you die, you hardly can chase / escape from her, but eh, snowballing isn't unique to her.
