What am I missing to &quot;abuse&quot;?\n\nThe little secret to {{champion:27}} is that you're not playing versus the other champion, a lot of the time - you're playing the lane.  \n\nYou gas up the minions with as little poison as posisble, kill them, push the lane all the way in until they lose minions to the tower, run away and roam/take jungle/run behind their tower for even more CS, rise and repeat.  You {{item:3060}} up, take the tower on cannon shots and minion push, and you don't fight champions until you're 2-3 major items in or more, usually with a huge lead if the other team doesn't know what it's doing and/or counterpick properly.    \n\nI think it's cancerous.  It's cancerous mostly because it forces the entire enemy team into unnatural playstyles to deal with him, and if they don't you get a free win, and if they do you almost certainly lose - the kind of binary play that cost {{champion:50}} his previous identity.  Some champs (basically anybody slow) have no recourse against it, and if the enemy jungler is bad too, you essentially are unstoppable and no one's interactions against you matter.\n\nThat being said, on the League cancer scale, it's no more cancerous than {{champion:17}} {{champion:75}}, etc., so by all means keep playing him.  He's countered pretty hard by AP champions generally because his base MR is nowhere near his base armor - {{champion:10}}'s kit gives him serious trouble unless you're very good, and {{champion:74}} or {{champion:13}} or other pure mage toplaners also give him Hell because they have the range and AP damage to stop his shenanigans.","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2018-06-01T02:46:23.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After 6 though most mages cannot kill him since he just hits R and denies the burst with the raw MR it gives and then heals most of it back over the duration.

That thing isn't dying anytime soon to a regular mage who might scratch it with a full combo. Regardless Singed is still a 1v9 champion if he gets ahead because he can actually murder carries off of a lead while still being unkillable since his ult gives I believe 12k gold in stats over the duration at level 16 (I did the math like 4 months ago, but it was an absurd number since flat health and mana regen are INCREDIBLY expensive with about half that gold value being what he gets at level 6). A 2/1 Singed on 2 items ({{item:3116}} {{item:3151}}) will usually just kill a squishy off of a fling into the gas if his liandry's is already ramped (or at least do 3/4 of their health while he is already off screen due to his passive+R movement speed).

That is pretty absurd especially if he opts for a {{item:2065}} that makes it even easier to get in range.\n\nI don't disagree with anything you just said.  I just have a deep-seated antipathy to trying to get others' favorite broken champions reworked or banned - something I wish the fighter community had been willing to do for me with {{champion:50}}'s previous incarnation, which was by far my favorite champion kit to play of all time.  Sadly not to be, however.\n\nI think League is like a lot of great games - it is good in part because it is broken, and broken in fun ways, and finding ways to optimize and break the available champions is part of the appeal - the question of whether or not it would be a fundamentally better game if it were not broken is not a trivial one.  \n\n-----------\n\nAnyway, yes, if you don't handle {{champion:27}} before 6, you probably don't handle him at all.  Thankfully, that's very possible given his relatively weak early laning phase - if you avoid all his flings pre-6, it can be very hard for him to win the lane or get effective.  He needs to push you out and get free waves and out-CS you to pull his shenanigans, and if he doesn't get the chance to do that, he becomes a fairly ineffective champion.  I tend to try to go as hard in the paint versus him early as possible.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KlydeFrog","date":"2018-06-01T14:49:42.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm all you need is adaptive helm and bam there goes his damage","replies":[{"poster":"Trash MammaI","date":"2018-06-01T16:24:56.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KlydeFrog,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fJzadJnm,comment-id=000d,timestamp=2018-06-01T14:49:42.507+0000)\n>\n> Umm all you need is adaptive helm and bam there goes his damage\n\nIf you're building adaptive helm, you're probably a tank.
