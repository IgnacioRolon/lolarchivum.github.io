Voice chat either. What I do know is Riot's business hiring structure every year you have new people at the top with the exception of the \"very\" top. People straight out of school with no real world \"big boy job\" experience. I am not making excuses. Quite the opposite. Riot has created this culture that basically does not give them the talent or leadership to come up with logical solutions that meet their for profit structure and provide some sort of balanced and fair player experience. \n\nYou are right since dynamic queues have been introduce queue times have increased. I would assume to cover jungle and more likely support. In the past we all had to figure it out ourselves, but that is no longer the case. \n\nThe unfortunate truth I feel is Riots top leadership are not capable of admitting a mistake. They will try to develop some sort of solution that would support all 2's,3's,4's, and 5's in dynamic queue and still have a solo queue. \n\nThey will end up still pulling people from solo queue to fill in their dynamic queue games which will likely create huge backlash because I doubt those players would have some sort of additional reward for winning or some sort of cushion for losing since they didn't want to be their in the first place. \n\nRegarding queue times only Riot has the data to be able to tell how long queue times would be if 3's and 2's were matched together and the system tried to determine a balanced game. I do not know how Dota 2 works. I dont know if you pick roles like we now do with league, but if Dota 2 doesn't have specific roles like league does that would be a large hill to overcome with queue times and such with their current system of role select->queue. If they reverted back and removed the role select this would be a completely different story. \n\nBack to dynamic queues today. Yes queue times have gone up a ton because of the sheer imbalance in role select. I do not have a solution for Riot. I mean yeah when supports were basically mid mages in the bot lane then people didn't mind playing support because they could still annie or brand and melt faces. Plus they had the faster queue time! Some people still do that. Especially in the lower ranks, but meh. \n\nAnyway. I do not know who sits at the head of the table at Riot who says yes or no to these features, but it is very clear to me that year after year Riot has failed at a lot of things and it is very clear that whatever workflows they have for process, balance, or test review are completely flawed. I read somewhere that the test server is only there for bugs and it is not used as a way to check balance. If that is the true case it explains a lot. \n\nIf Riots way of determining balance is from the 7-8 guys who made that dev post about being testers than it also explains all the backlash Riot gets because their tests do not reflect the 80% of their player base.","replies":[{"poster":"6KEMBE4ORBA","date":"2016-02-23T18:28:10.901+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree... \n\nRegarding DOTA2, you're able to check how exactly the matchmaker/champ select works by yourself in the net/game wiki.

Queue times are already awful, what do you expect?\n\n2. How would this change the balance at all? 3+2 fighting against other 3+2s wouldn't be a problem?\n\n3. 4 mans are inherently unhealthy for this type of game (4 people on skype leaves someone on a lone island or 4 people with someone who won't listen to everything will end with one person being flamed worse than someone AFK on a rumble ult)\n\nI don't see why this wouldn't work. Queue times are always going to be high (it's a group queue system, I don't know what the fuck you guys expect but 3+1+1 is barely manageable and the 5stacks against non-5stacks in high elo is a shitfest which would be resolved by having the solos play ranked soloq and those who want to group queue play in dynaq) \n\n4. The fact that they're forcing us to play with friends to get a reasonable ranked experience is fucking awful, just saying. We've had solo queue for five fucking seasons and now they decide \"lol nope fuck off go get some friends or suffer alone unless you're literally Hai with shotcalling or Gosu mechanics in relation to your tier\" especially when you get matched with 3+1+1 sets or 4+1 and no one gives a flying fuck about your opinion and then they lose anyways.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OneSmoothDude","date":"2016-02-22T04:28:33.436+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think removing the 4-stack is a realistic option for them at this point.

They're making a huge push to encourage people to play ranked with as many friends as they want.\n\nAlso, if we're trying to keep things as competitive as possible, there's another problem with that solution. I would think that 5v4+1 would be a better competitive pairing than a 5v3+2, right? Getting rid of the 4-stack would mean that teams of 5 would either have to wait to play another team of 5, or get placed against a 3+2, which wouldn't be as competitive as we have it now with the option of 5v4+1.\n\nInteresting idea though.

Think rationally about this for a minute.\n\nFirst, where did he say that groups are more valuable than individual players? Why jump at the guy and put words in his mouth because he...contributed to the discussion? He says what he thinks Riot's biggest upcoming matchmaking issue will be and you presume that he thinks you don't matter. Breathe.\n\nSecond, why such extreme negativity towards groups? I've literally never had any experience nearly as bad as what you're describing in the nearly 2 years I've been playing. Groups aren't toxic by nature; people have more fun when playing games with friends. That's kind of the whole idea behind this Dynamic Queue. \nBut then again, if you're toxic towards one of the people in the group, it shouldn't be a surprise they'll have each others' backs and reply in kind. Next time you're paired with a group don't communicate negatively and the game will go fine almost every time.\n\nAnd if groups are super toxic towards you, there's really no difference made from them being in a group versus all solo. Actually, it's better to be flamed by a 4-man than 4 randoms, because as Riot stated when they announced the Dynamic Queue, the reports of the group will be weighted just as heavily as the non-grouped members. So if 4 people report you but you report all of them, then each person in the team will effectively have one report.\n\nThat's after the game is over, though. When you're in-game...just mute 'em. Like any other toxic player you get on your team, it's really no different. Sure, a 4-man can ruin a game more effectively than 4 randoms. But let's be honest, if any _1_ person wants to ruin a game for his team, it's not that hard. So, again, not that much of a difference with it coming from a group.\n\nWhy, specifically, did your friends quit? Did they quit League as a whole, or just playing ranked, or just ranked until the true solo queue is released?\n\nYou don't have to get worked up into a fervor and go to the furthest extremes you can think of and rely on hyperbole to convince people you're right.

Which in short, is yes, someone playing with their friend(s) does mean more than a solo queue player. From a business standpoint it is simply more profitable to encourage people to \"bring their friends\" or \"play with their friends\" more people = more profit. \n\nWhen a high level ranked player duo queues with their low level friend, they are matched against other low levels. So the majority of the time low level games have a level 30 or even two level 30s with thousands of games played, full tier 3 runes and a mastery page vs. a rag tag team of level 13's. This has been the state of low level games for years and you have to ask yourself in what world does this seem fair? You'd think that a low level person duoing with their level 30 friend would be matched against other level 30's, because after all it is their choice to duo. But instead they just keep the highly exploitable matchmaking in place and allow these people to farm IP at the expense of new players who are solo queuing.\n\n The only explanation for this is that people who are bringing 1 or more people to the game with them are more important than someone playing alone.

They still don't have a way for you to easily find like minded people, near your tier and skill, with a similar play schedule.... For you to play with!\n\nGreat go play with your friends. If you dont have any that sucks because even after 6 years all we have are beta forums which are spammed and only visited by 2% of the player base to find people to play with. Oh yeah and if you play by yourself get owned we destroyed soloQ and made things so much worse for the solo player----- Put that on a T-Shirt and them out as your holiday gift Riot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Karn Bishop","date":"2016-02-21T23:17:20.731+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing you can do to make riot understand this is to quit playing the game, when they see all the solo Q players vanishing they will panic then care enough to fix it.\n\nThis is what I'm doing, wont touch the game till solo queue is back.","replies":[{"poster":"Shallers","date":"2016-02-23T03:03:59.639+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what I realized and that's what I did.

What a majority of these posts are talking about is the fact that they cant make a 100% true soloQ. They have to forcibly draft soloQ players to fill their dynamic Q games.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PissFromRKelly","date":"2016-02-22T01:05:41.546+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could not agree with this more.

This may be a team game but putting lower ELO players in with everyone else just because they bring a friend doesn't make sense.

Regardless of whether or not I get benefit from it, it's incredibly frustrating as well.  I'm tired of having 10-40 minute queue timers just to get my secondary role every time.  Dodges are also at an all time high, and honestly, I've been dodging a lot as well because of how frustrating the new champion select is.  Being the odd man out matched with premades is annoying, and it seems I hardly even get matched with groups anyway because the enemy team is always a well built comp while the way new queue works kind of nudges everyone solo to play selfishly and a team of randoms usually ends up with 5 squishy carries and no real comp.  Pick intent is hardly even used anymore, and about 40% of the time, someone bans out their teammates, which I admit to doing as well.  It's also annoying when your last pick wants graves and gets mad when someone bans him.  Noone trades champions anymore anyway.\n\nAnother thing is noone swaps roles either.  They think their role is cemented.  Used to be if I didn't feel it because of some picks I would decide to take another role, but can't do that anymore.  I'm tired of all the midlaners picking support secondary so they can play full carry Lux or Brand, or Xerath too.\n\nI really hope this feedback reaches Riot and they stop with the delay on solo-Q.  I do not like Lyte's system, and spending more time on it is not going to change that opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"pulledchicken","date":"2016-02-22T09:56:24.831+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"League isnt League anymore since they took out the Solo Q !
