I searched for it and people say that it might be that game loads death animation right before you die so your computer can freeze while loading it. \r\n(And no my pc is not bad)\r\n\r\nAdding an option in the settings for loading everything that will be used in-game would be helpful. You guys probably didn&#039;t preload everything before game because it would increase ram usage?\r\n\r\nAn option would be nice.","replies":[{"poster":"bro0rtega","date":"2016-09-19T17:00:54.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to have this problem, I played on an Asus laptop with 4GB RAM, and not really existent Graphics card. My setting were at the lowest possible, even 30 fps. After I upgraded, and got a very modern strong computer, I never came across this problem. For my situation, I believe my computer was too outdated.\n\nI'm not sure for your situation, but I hope League will more toaster friendly options, or the world is able to upgrade. Lol have a good day.","replies":[{"poster":"Viktorious Sayph","date":"2016-09-19T17:56:33.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really know what is the problem, I can play Warframe, MGS V extra high with no issue but in LoL sometimes it freezes my comp when I'm about to die and it feels awful that \"I could totally avoid that\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-09-19T16:52:43.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My guess would be that a lot of the times when you die, ulties go off and those have many SFXs that could be heavy on your PC. This doesn't immediately mean that your hardware doesn't have the muscle for it. Maybe you don't have updated drivers for the graphics card, or the driver is not configured correctly, or the OS is messing with it. There are many possibilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Viktorious Sayph","date":"2016-09-19T17:53:20.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it helps I would love to send some log files via support :/ It doesn't happen everytime and I don't know which log but I think I could send my last 10 game logs.\n\nI just bought the gpu and downloaded latest drive and It happened with my older gpu too so I don't think its an driver issue but who knows, but allowing players to load every single thing when the match starts would help people like me. Because I have the specs that could handle all of them at once and there are people that can't handle all of them so a setting option or atleast config option (adjustable option on the cfg file) would help people like me alot.\n\nI don't think it would require such work because instead of in-game, everything would be loaded and kept in the memory when the game starts :)\n\nThanks for answering btw \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}]}
