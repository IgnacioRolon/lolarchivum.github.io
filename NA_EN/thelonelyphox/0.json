But hands down i have had the most fun watching All-Stars!  Seeing all my favorite players from all regions together in a relaxed atmosphere playing fun game variants was JUST AMAZING.\r\n\r\nalso, hope for a 1v1 mode ;D\r\n\r\nPS.

I hate the community for picking those comps and I facepalmed so hard when I saw the comps on the website. Maybe there is a better way to vote for these comps.. Maybe we can have the \"least favourite mode\" where the pros have to use the least popular champs ingame and we pair the pro with the champ.\n\nAll for One (they even made it into All for One Mirror cos of Huni's comments, which was awsome!!) was real fun.\n\nI like the 1v1 introductions from Dash, might I mention that he looks smashing? Those hype me up alot. I like how you guys allowed the players to hear Dash's intro after the first day.\n\nI wonder if a NURF mode would be warrented for the pros .. or would that be too horrible to watch.","replies":[{"poster":"frigginmurlocs","date":"2015-12-17T03:59:19.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was worse last time, with almost a mirror match","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-12-15T21:43:25.685+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"One thing I would recommend is to bring in an Ultimate Bravery match, like what there was at IWCA.

And of course that Westdoor 1v3 triple kill!!! :D All marksmen was less sweet than assassins but still a great time. I won't forget Nasus beating Quinn in 1v1 for a very long time. So many awesome moments.\n\nI also want to mention the fire/ice theme because I really enjoyed that as well. The icons the players could use and especially the death animations were amazing and added a lot to the look and feel and fun of the event.\n\nI would like to see pros play Poro King and Nemesis Draft. Anything that really gets pros playing stuff outside their norm and especially doing wacky things really makes me happy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smart Kitty","date":"2015-12-16T06:14:04.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotShantzilla,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=K2Mpos8Y,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-12-15T21:06:01.097+0000)\n>\n> Thank you for tuning in!
