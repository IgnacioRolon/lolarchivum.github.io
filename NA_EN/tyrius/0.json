Pike is an AD Yordle Hypercarry. Quite a while back, a friend of mine pitched the idea of a &#039;Yordle Barbarian&#039;, and the more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea. To that end, I created Pike, to fill a roll that, at the time, was left empty among the Yordles.\n----\n**BASE STATS**\nHealth - 630-1797.9 **(+68.7)**\nHealth RGN. - 7.1-14.7 **(+0.4)**\nStamina - 100-300 **(+11.78)**\nStamina RGN. 10-25.13 **(+0.89)**\nRange - 125\nAttack dmg. - 59-120.2 **(+3.4)**\nAttack spd. - 0.673 **(+0%-45.3%)**\nArmor - 22.6-42.4 **(+1.1)**\nMagic res. - 30-45.66 **(+0.87)**\nMov. speed - 335-350 **(+0.88)**\n---\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RhnPbj1.gif\n---\n**LORE** (Rather long)\nI&#039;ve lived in the swamp my entire life. At first, it was terrifying, hearing beasts that I&#039;m not sure were even _alive_, roaming in the distance. Every morning at sunrise, my mother would leave to forage for food, while my father and I trained. He taught me much, and I&#039;m glad he did.\n\nOne night, something attacked our home. My father chased it into the forest... Though, I wish that was the last we saw of him. When the morning came, my mother went to find him, leaving me safe at home. She, also, did not return.\n\nIt took me nearly the entire day to muster the courage to search for my parents. I was such a coward back then. Unfortunately, as the day neared its end, I found my parents. Monsters stirred in the fens around us, and in a panic, I grabbed my mothers&#039; shawl. I thought that, at the very least, I would have something to remember her by.\n\nI hid for another night, barricaded in our home. The beasts roamed closer than they ever had before. Every moan and growl I heard shook me to my core. But before long, it made me angry. I couldn&#039;t help but grit my teeth. Morning came again, and I couldn&#039;t help but shake with rage.\n\nI made my way back to my parents, wishing them a peaceful goodbye. I swore to my father that I would become strong, like him. I swore that I would survive. With that out of the way, I took what was left of my fathers&#039; armor, hoping to put it to good use.\n\nMy sadness turned, once again, to anger, as I buried my parents. When I finally got back home, images flashed through my head. I vividly remembered the training my father put me through. I spent the day trying to continue my training, and master what my father taught me.\n\nI would spend months training like this, or foraging for food, or worse, _hiding_ from the monsters that took my parents from me. Eventually, I grew large enough to wear my fathers&#039; armor. I wish he could have seen that.\n\nOne day, though, while foraging, I wandered a little too far, and found what used to be a caravan, covered in gold and blue symbols. Something shiny caught my eye, still in a broken crate. Tearing through the rotten wood, I found an incredibly large weapon. I tried to pick it up, and failed miserably. But I wouldn&#039;t give up. I dragged it away from the caravan, and tried again to lift it. The stronger my grip became, the less it seemed to weigh- atleast while I was wearing my fathers&#039; gauntlet.\n\nFor the next few months, I trained with my new weapon. Before long, it became less of a tool, and more... a part of me. I felt confident, and strong.\n\nOne night, I stood outside my home, waiting for those damned beasts. I could hear them stirring in the distance. They knew. Dozens of them shambled out from the brush, and not too far behind, something shook the ground as it approached. I stood ready as they filled the clearing, and then it appeared... A horrible beast, seemingly made of wood and flesh, covered in moss.\n\nI remember screaming, and charging the beast, but... Everything else is a blur. Everything until waking up that morning, alone, and barely able to stand. I was dizzy, and tried to get back on my feet, when I heard a rustling behind me. Hunched over, and out of breath, I turned, and pointed my weapon at whatever made the noise. I saw three men in strange dresses, poking around my home.\n\nI yelled at them, wanting them to leave. They backed away, telling me they were &#039;passing through&#039;. As if there was _more_ than the swamp. I couldn&#039;t help but ask, and before long, we got to talking. The more I heard of the world beyond my swamp, the more I wanted to see it.\n\nAs the mages got ready to leave, I stopped them. I asked to join them, and they agreed. We travelled together for a long time, and they taught me much, including how to speak like this. Eventually, we reached a giant building, filled with strange, hooded mages. They brought me to the Institute of War.\n\n&quot;They look like me, they sound like me, but we are not the same. They are Yordles, I am Pike.&quot;\n~Pike\n---\n**TL;DR LORE**\nPike is a swamp-dwelling hermit-orphan, that was discovered by associates of the League, and brought to the Institute of War, eventually becoming a Champion.\n---\nhttp://imgur.com/kcrJ5US\n---\n**ABILITIES**\n---\n**Brute Force**\nWhenever Pike is attacked by a large minion, monster or champion, he gains stacks of Frustration equal to 3.0-0.5%¹ of the damage taken. If Pike suffers through stuns, snares, fears or charms, he gains a flat 25 stacks of Frustration.\n\nAt 100 stacks, Pike will gain the Seething with Rage buff, and ignore the next hard crowd control inflicted upon him, and any others of the same kind for the next 1.0/1.5/2.0 Second(s). Pike cannot gain Frustration stacks again for 30 seconds. Critical strikes increase the duration of this buff by 0.5 seconds.\n\nIn addition, Pike&#039;s abilities cost Stamina. While moving, Pike&#039;s Stamina regeneration rate is reduced by 33%. While in combat, Pike&#039;s regeneration rate is reduce by 66%.\n\n¹ **3.0**(100 Damage)-**0.5**(1700 Damage)\n---\nhttp://imgur.com/6PGRc0R\n---\n**Q - Sundering Scourge**\nPike swings his cleaver with great force, causing him to spin, dealing 40/60/90/120/150(60% Bonus AD) Physical Damage, and putting each unit struck in a Daze for 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 Second(s). Dazed units&#039; move orders are misinterpreted, causing them to move the same distance as ordered, in a random direction.\n\nPike can re-activate Sundering Scourge, causing him to leap into the air, and slam his cleaver on a single Dazed enemy, causing them to bleed for 10/15/20/25/30 Physical Damage twice every second, for 2 seconds.\n\nWhile Wading Into Battle, the first cast of Sundering Scourge will deflect missiles within its range back at the caster¹ ².\n\nCOST - 70/65/60/55/50(0 During Wade Into Battle)\nCOOL - 14/13/12/11/10\nAoE - 250\n¹ This effect has a maximum range of 500, and automatically throws the missile back as a skillshot, regardless of whether or not it was targeted.\n² The missile is carried along Pikes' blade as he spins, until being released in the direction of the caster/attacker.\n---\nhttp://imgur.com/trcJa0H\n---\n**W - INDOMITABLE**\nPike heaves his sword infront of him, attempting to block incoming attacks for 2/2/3/3/4 seconds. Melee attacks against Pike are reduced by 30/40/45/50/55/60%, while incoming ranged attacks are reduced by 35/45/50/65/70%. However, the blocked damage is converted to momentum, pushing Pike back&sup1;. \n\nRanged attacks that deal 500/700/900(+25 damage per 600 Bonus HP) damage are not blocked, and will force Pike out of his defensive stance&sup2;.\n\nIndomitable can be de-activated. While active, Sundering Strike and Cleaving Strike cannot be used.\n\nCOST - 40/50/60(+10 per every attack after the first that is blocked)(0 During Wade Into Battle)\nCOOL - 23/21/19/17/15\n(Knockback)SPEED - 400\n---\n&sup1; Blocked attacks ranging from 0-300 push Pike backwards, upto a distance of 25, while attacks above 900 push Pike upto a distance of 150. Attacks are only blocked if Pike is facing them.\n&sup2; Breaking attacks push Pike upto a distance of 250.\n&sup3; Pike cannot move while blocking, but CAN turn, if rather slowly.\n---\nhttp://imgur.com/EWj7GCm\n---\n**E - CLEAVING STRIKE**\nPike leaps into the air, spinning as he reaches the highest point of his jump. If Pike strikes an enemy unit, he deals 35/55/75/90/120(+60% Bonus AD) Physical Damage. Each consecutive enemy struck takes 11% less damage(30% minimum). This ability can critically strike(125% damage)\n\nWhile leaping, Cleaving Strike can be used again, causing Pike to spin faster. If Pike then strikes an enemy unit, he deals 45/60/80/100/140(+75% Bonus AD) Physical Damage to the first enemy hit, and bounces off of them&sup1;. Upon landing, Pike is rooted for 0.5 seconds, as he regains his composure.\n\nPike gains 10 Stamina for every unit killed by Cleaving Strike. Killing large minions, monsters and Champions provides 20 Stamina.\n\nKilling a champion reduces the cooldown of Cleaving Strike by 3.\n\nCOST - 40/50/70(+10 upon second cast)(0 During Wade Into Battle)\nCOOL - 20/18/16/14/12\nRANGE - 525\n(Leap)SPEED - 300-450/500(Second Cast &amp; Bounce)\n----\n&sup1; Pike rebounds back towards his original position, upto a maximum distance of 500, and minimum of 50. Pike&#039;s bounce distance is determined by how far he travelled before striking an enemy unit.\n---\n**R - WADE INTO BATTLE**\nPike focuses his aggressive nature, letting out a loud berserker howl for 1 second. During this scream, Pike is rooted in place, and continuously forces enemy units back&sup1;. If Pike finishes his scream, his Stamina is drained, and replaced with an empty Fury bar. In addition, Pike also gains 1(+1 Per 2,000 Bonus HP) extra Health Bar(s), that can withstand 3(+1 Per 150 Bonus AD) hits.\n\nPike gains 5 Fury every time he is struck, and 5 fury whenever he kills a unit. For every 25 Fury, Pike gains +3% Movement Speed. If Pike reaches full Fury&sup2;, he gains 10/20/30 Bonus Attack Damage for the remainder of Wade Into Battle, aswell as +20% Movement Speed, decaying over 2 seconds.\n\nCOST - 0(ALL Stamina)\nCOOL - 140/130/120\n&sup1;KNOCKBACK RANGE - 100\n&sup1;AREA - 250\n----\n&sup2; Pike&#039;s Fury is drained, and cannot be recharged. His abilities remain free to cast for the duration.\nAdditionally, minions, small monsters and towers ignore Pikes&#039; bonus healthbars, which function like the healthbars of Wards.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Eno","date":"2016-02-15T21:10:15.247+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooooooooh!

It can all be distilled down to a few basic points, though. For example:\n**Brute Force - **If Pike is debuffed frequently, in a short period of time, he can negate the next debuff and truck on.\n\nPike also has Stamina(Energy, except it doesn't regen as fast in combat, or when walking)\n**Sundering Scourge - **Pike spins, damaging and disorienting nearby enemy units. He can hit them again to cause a bleed.\n**Indomitable - **Pike blocks attacks with his sword and is pushed backwards when hit.\n**Cleaving Strike - **Pike spins through multiple enemy units. He can trigger the ability mid-jump to bounce off of the first one he hits.\n**Wade Into Battle - **Pike channels for a moment, before gaining multiple Ward-style healthbars, that count _hits_, not _damage_. Pike also gains a Fury bar that buffs him as he fills it.\n\nHis abilities become free to cast for the duration.\n----\nI simply went more in-depth, knowing that people would question certain features. I always add small annotations that explain these things.\n\nAnyway, what did you think of the model, and lore?","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2016-02-15T22:34:19.250+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea his abiIities themseIves are not compIicated but everything that comes with them kind of is.  \n\nHis Passive has 3 different timers, pIus stacks, and an activation on top of his Stamina which has 3 different recharge rates [btw why does he require more stacks Iate game then earIy game?

Originally, Pike's passive had the following effects, only keeping Stamina.\n1. Critical Strikes dealt 25% less damage.\n2. Higher Critical Strike Chance increases the range of an AoE on hit, dealing 25% of the crit damage, at a range of 175-200 around the original target, once at 100% Critical Strike Chance.\n\nI will retouch Pikes' kit. Please look over the changes. They will be edited into this post.\n---\n**BRUTE FORCE**\nWhenever Pike is attacked by a large minion, monster or champion, he gains stacks of Frustration equal to 3.0-0.5%¹ of the damage taken. If Pike suffers through stuns, snares, fears or charms, he gains a flat 25 stacks of Frustration.\n\nAt 100 stacks, Pike will gain the Seething with Rage buff, and ignore the next hard crowd control inflicted upon him, and any others of the same kind for the next 1.0/1.5/2.0 Second(s). Pike cannot gain Frustration stacks again for 60 seconds.\n\n¹ 3.0**(100 Damage)**-0.5**(1700 Damage)**\n---\n**INDOMITABLE**\nI don't believe this ability is too complicated. Pike hunkers down, and takes less damage from enemy attacks.\n\nThe reason I gave the knockback ranges, was because I know people would think that I meant that someone is thrown away, as if they were hit by a Headbutt from Alistar, because they were hit by a minion once. Case and point, level 5 Indomitable:\n\nPike heaves his sword infront of him, attempting to block incoming attacks for 4 seconds. Melee attacks against Pike are reduced by 60%, while incoming ranged attacks are reduced by 70%. However, the blocked damage is converted to momentum, pushing Pike back¹.\n\nRanged attacks that deal 900**(+175)**¹ damage are not blocked, and will force Pike out of his defensive stance.\n\nIndomitable can be de-activated. While active, Sundering Strike and Cleaving Strike cannot be used.\n\n\n¹ Scaling based off of bonus HP of 4200, blocking a maximum of 1,075 damage before being tossed aside.

The Yordles are known as an incredibly diverse species, due to a connection to the latent magicks that have imbedded themselves in the land, in the trees, in the water, and even the air. Like magical sponges, Yordles, as they develop, soak in trace amounts, and may develop wildly different traits. Take Rumble for example- he looks nothing like the other League Yordles, such as Teemo, or Ziggs. Even Heimerdinger, before he became what he is today, is more similar to them, than he is to the teal-furred, plumed Rumble.\n\nHowever, Yordles tend to push both ends of the scale, even when it comes to this. Some of these Yordles, once born, are discovered to be _wildly_ different, and in many cases, are considered inferior. These unfortunate Yordles are both pitied and shamed. Relegated to an artificial second class, these mutant Yordles generally live very lonely, sombre lives. Oddly, the 'first class' of Yordles engages in a particularly, possibly unintentionally cruel form of doublethink. On the one hand, they feel great pity and sadness on behalf of these unfortunate beings, many of whom live in constant pain, while on the _other_ hand, they are ashamed of them.\n\nMutant Yordles are hidden away from the other races, for two reasons. One, the majority seems to feel that these poor, unfortunate creatures, who live in agony, would be put directly in harms way, if they were set loose on the world, and two, they simply don't want that sort of black mark on their society. Their percieved kindness and protection gives these Yordles the ability to remain the happy, loving, cheerful people they are, while unwittingly oppressing a second class of Yordles, of whom they truly have _nothing_ against.\n\nSable is one such Yordle. Very large for a Yordle, with jet black fur, bright, cherry blossom eyes, and a pure white mark between his eyes, Sable was recognized as a mutant, when, as a child, he displayed a level of natural strength and stamina that was almost simply unmatched amongst his peers and elders. Sable grew apart from his family, who  no longer treated him with the love and warmth that parents should.\n\nEventually, Sable's parents fell ill, and passed. He felt no sadness, no regret for the years of love and happiness he _never_ tried to pursue. However, he was now _truly_ alone. With nothing left, Sable wandered the darker recesses of Bandle City, using his immense strength to his advantage, hoping to find work, and be able to feed himself.\n\nThis life became routine for Sable, until one day, an old, well-dressed Yordle approached him. Sable, busy as he was, did not notice the old Gentleyordle. With a single great heave, Sable lifted a large, stone statue, before placing it right side up. Taking a step back, Sable looked at the statue, admiring the craftsmanship, and wondering _who_ the posh dignitary was, that was depicted.\n\nOut of the corner of his eye, Sable finally noticed the Gent, who, with his old eyes nearly shut, and a large smile on his face, addressed him. The two yordles spoke briefly, with Sable noticeably suspicious. Tiring of the idle chit-chat, Sable demanded to know _why_ this _oh-so-important_ Gent is bothering to speak with a _mutant_. He was there to present Sable with an offer.\n\nCurious, Sable asked to hear about this offer. With a sudden glint now in the eyes of the Gent, he told Sable of the Praetorian Guard. Powerful warriors who protect Bandle City from any looming threat. Boasting of their strength, and noting that only a few dozen of these staunch defenders could repel a Noxian brigade. As the braggard Gent continued, he noticed the disbelief and dismissal in Sable, and immediately changed his approach. He began making claims of the wealth, status and _power_ that the Praetorians hold.\n\nHaggard, wearing rags, and hungry, Sable's mouth watered as his mind raced at the thought of banquets, held in his honor, as a proud guardian of Bandle City. A caped hero of the people. Excitedly, Sable quickly accepted the offer.\n\nOver the next few years, Sable underwent rigorous training. For the first time in his life, he was pushed to his limits. Growing to love the challenge, Sable embraced his new lifestyle. Finally living happily, able to feed himself, and pursuing a goal, Sable began to excel. Eventually, he finished his training, and was given a set of imposing armor, including a helm with a glorious plume in the colors of Bandle City, and twin gauntlets, imbued with strange power.\n\nNo longer a trainee, Sable was sworn into the Praetorian Guard, reciting their pledge, and vowing to put the safeguarding of Bandle City above all else. No love shall overcome that of his love for Bandle City. No loyalties shall be stronger than that of his loyalty to his people.\n\nMore years went by, and Sable dutifully watched over Bandle City. Protecting esteemed nobles, great dignitaries, or guarding places of great importance and secrecy. However, one day, while chasing a thief through the streets, Sable ran roughshod into a delicate flower of a Yordle. As the thief made his escape, the two locked eyes, mesmerized. However, Sable's charge soon arrived, snapping the pair out of their trance, and incensed at the fact that Sable let an urchin escape with his gold.\n\nOver the next few months, much to the frustration of the dignitary, Sable repeatedly stumbled into the sweet ingenue, each time without saying a word, before being discovered, chastised, and dragged away in a loud, cursing huff by his charge.\n\nTired of the old fool, Sable left the dignitaries home early in the morning. Heading to the market where he most often, quite literally, bumped into the girl. Waiting patiently, with his helm held under his arm, Sable hoped he would _finally_ see her again. His patience, of course, paid off.\n\nTurning a corner, the young Yordle's eyes lit up once she saw Sable. Before long, the two finally introduced eachother, and began to talk. It didn't take long for the two to develop a deep bond. Taking on other posts, Sable enjoyed no longer having to play bodyguard, as it meant he could spend more time with the girl, who he affectionally called his 'blue rose'.\n\nKeeping their budding relationship a secret from the Praetorian Guard became increasingly difficult. However, it was all worth it in Sable's eyes. Every evening, as Sable's shift ended, he would always make his way to Rose. This continued for a year, before things started to go wrong.\n\nAs the sun began descending past the horizon, Sable arrived at Roses' home. Reaching for the doorknob, he heard someone behind him, clearing their throat. Startled, Sable turned, shocked to see the old Gent, eyes closed, brow furrowed, arms behind his back. With his back to the door, Sable glared into the Gents' eyes. \"She's expecting, boy\", remarked the Gent, in a sombre tone.\n\nSable's fear turned to excitement. He was overjoyed, though he quickly realized something.  He knew. The Gent _knew_ that Sable has been flagrantly breaking his vow to the Praetorian Guard. Worse, _he knew about their child before Sable did_. Baring his teeth, with a sudden burst of anger, Sable stared the Gent down. \"You won't lay a hand on her\", he growled, to which the Gent replied \"The state does as it pleases, _boy_. You broke your vow, committed a crime... But you are too valuable to the Guard\". Worry began to grip Sable, as he waited for the Gent to continue.\"You will leave your _blue rose_ be.\", sniped the Gent,\n\"I won't\"\n\"You must\"\n\"_I can't_\"\n\"**_You will!_**\" Bellowed the Gent, now visibly angry. Shaking with rage, Sable approached the Gent, grabbing him by his collar. Barely able to calm himself, the Gent hissed, \"Let me down, _boy_\". Sable, rearing to strike the Gent, heard a noise come from behind.\n\nStanding in the now open doorway, Rose gasped as he saw the Gent. She knew he was a part of the Guard, and broke down. She begged Sable to let him go, and implored the Gent to not punish Sable. On her knees, Rose, with tears in her eyes, began to beg pitifully.\n\nUnaffected by the show of emotion, the Gent looked down to her, and told her simply, \"That isn't how this works, girl\". Pausing briefly, he grabbed her head, and forced her to look him in the eye, \"You two will _never_ see eachother again. The Praetorian Guard holds _nothing_ above the state. _**There are no exceptions.**_\". Letting go of Rose, the Gent took a few steps back, before looking to Sable, \"I'll give you two this one last night together, boy. Then, at sunrise, you will face your punishment\".\n\nAs the moon reached its peak in the night sky, Sable and Rose were in a panic, until a thought crossed Roses' mind. She looked Sable dead in the eye, and told him, \"We have to leave\"\n\"But, what else could we do?\"\n\"I don't care\"\n\"Where would we go?\"\n\"_I don't care_\"\n\"I-\" Sable began to trail off, apprehensive. \"We'll leave. We'll go. Right now. Pack your things\" he insisted.\n\nLeaving the city, in the dead of night, with a small cart, the two travelled a vast distance, before finding themselves in a wretched swamp. For days, they travelled, but it seemed as if the swamp itself was alive, and twisting so as to keep them imprisoned. Soon, the couple began to run low on food, and gave up trying to leave the swamp. It was clear that the sinister place would continue to entrap them.\n\nOver the next few months, Sable foraged for food, and built a home for his family. Eventually, their child was born. Overjoyed, the couple held eachother, and their baby close, and for a moment, all was good. Leaving eachothers' embrace, Rose looked to Sable, \"What will we name him?\". \"I-... I think...\", he stuttered, to which Rose asked, \"What?\", \"I want to name him after my father\".","replies":[{"poster":"LeifTheExplorer","date":"2016-02-20T15:12:49.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The feels","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chrophin","date":"2016-05-15T11:57:17.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How did you do those animations?

This fits within the unified Yordle race, as any deviant types are classified as mutants. Consider this; a Yordle whose family is more genetically similar to Gnar than any other normal Yordles. This Yordle is born a mutant, and with this genetic abnormality, this unfortunate creature has the ability to do a _partial_ transformation. A very painful, malformed, grotesque transformation.\n\nPike is unique among the mutants, due to his _vastly_ increased strength, and stature, aswell as having that black fur.

Pike is an angry champion, and it is reflected through Stamina. While Pike may need to carefully conserve his Stamina, that limitation is wholely removed when he activates his ultimate. It simply doesn't register, while his rage does. Thus, the different resource bar during his ultimate.\n\nWhile Pike _is_ able to momentarily wade into the thick of the enemy team, and cause havoc with his Q, it only misinterprets move orders, and they can still collapse on him. Compare his aggressive options to thosee of Tryndamere. To account for Pike's increased utility and tank potential, his ultimate allows for counterplay. The entire enemy team together can easily waste Pike's ultimate bars, as they only require _hits_.\n---\nI'll check it out.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Melehan,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=FqR0URbT,comment-id=000c00000000,timestamp=2016-02-19T03:36:02.300+0000)\n>\n> Will do.

Pike can _either_ fill the roll of a disruptive bruiser/tank like Olaf, by focusing on his W and R, which become highly effective damage-soaking tools, _or_ he can fill a roll more similar to Tryndamere, as a highly mobile, highly threatening hypercarry.\n\nI tried to reach a middle ground between the two, and as far as Pike's ultimate goes, I think I did a good job. It makes him a temporary juggernaut, able to power into and through the enemy team, while not being generally unkillable throughout the duration. Rather than flatout being unable to die, Pike gains multiple, temporary healthbars that have 'hitpoints', not 'health'.\n\nFor example, **if** Pike has the stats for it, his ultimate could grant ten hitpoints in one bar. This means that Sona with -5 AD, and Draven, dealing 1.7K with crits, both need to hit him ten times to break through that healthbar.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2016-02-16T05:48:11.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Intresting champion","replies":[]},{"poster":"invisiblecat1","date":"2016-02-16T01:54:08.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some moves are more balanced than Riot's","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArchDraft","date":"2016-02-15T07:00:00.442+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the champion concept for most of it.

It outright reduces damage, meaning you have a better chance of surviving an enemy Darius' ultimate. Or, you're going to face a fully built, stupidly fed Draven. They throw an axe, and rather than dying in the next few seconds, you pop Indomitable, take 1.5K damage once, and get thrown back and away from Draven.\n\nOther than that, I designed Pike with solo duelling, _and_ endgame teamfighting in mind. In single combat, Pike creates what I call an \"Area of Denial\". Illaoi, for example, is _pure, unfiltered AoD_. Pike is a dangerous enemy, because not only can he more safely poke his enemies, with his E, but he can negate THEIR poke. I designed Pike to be able to punish all-in or onslaught duellists, by either _avoiding their onslaught_, or _preceding it with his own._","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SedareMortis","date":"2016-02-15T04:47:32.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The yordle Garen is much needed on Summoners rift right now...
