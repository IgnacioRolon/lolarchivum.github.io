There were no reasons given to positively vote _for_ a certain candidate.\r\n\r\nKnow what Trump supporters said to convince people to vote for Trump? That Clinton is a corrupt warmonger who would do something nefarious vis-&agrave;-vis Russia, hires ~~hitmen~~ hitpersons to kill anyone investigating her, goes on cruises with her husband to molest children, and is too old and infirm to be president. Know what Clinton supporters said to convince people to vote for Clinton? That Trump is a racist, sexist, homophobic, womanizing, inexperienced warmonger who would do something nefarious vis-&agrave;-vis Russia, has no respect for anyone, and has every world leader (past, present, and future) horrified at the idea of a Trump presidency. Know what Trump and Clinton supporters said to convince people to vote for Trump or Clinton? That Johnson had no clue with foreign policy and Sanders&#039; domestic policy was a totally unworkable form of communism. Know what Sanders and Johnson supporters said to convince people to vote for Johnson or Sanders? That they were neither Trump nor Clinton. Know what supporters of all the major candidates said to convince people to vote for their major candidate? That the minor candidates weren&#039;t worth voting for, and doing so was literally throwing your vote away.\r\n\r\nSo I took all that advice to heart and avoided voting for the given candidates for the given reasons. Usually you can&#039;t please everyone, but this time it was possible via DeMorgan&#039;s Law! You&#039;re welcome, everyone!\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure there was some sort of explanation from each candidate about the reasons to vote for them, but none of it got past the front page of &quot;www.candidatename.org&quot; and all I saw was hate.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wRH9esYgnk","replies":[]}
