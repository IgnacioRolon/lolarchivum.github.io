{"poster":"Farranor","date":"2015-06-23T03:38:01.401+0000","title":"My family's switching from AT&T to Verizon and I'm SCREWED :(","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"My parents travel sometimes, so they want their next phones to be unlocked. AT&amp;T doesn't offer that, and it's a hassle to do it manually, so we're switching to Verizon, which offers unlocked phones.\r\n\r\nI'll have to get a new phone.\r\n\r\nFor many years, I have resisted the siren call of \"smart\" phones. I had a fancy cellphone once - had a camera and everything. It flipped shut, so it didn't need a keypad lock. \"Oh, how those non-folding phones are so quaint with their keypad locks,\" the designers crowed! But then those fuckers festooned the outside of the phone with half a dozen buttons, so that phone ended up with 100+ pictures of the inside of my pocket. Also, the charging plug had these two incredibly fragile contacts - basically copper filaments. That shit broke so fast.\r\n\r\nMy next phone - which I use now - was a Nokia 2610. [GAZE YE UPON THIS ANCIENT PIECE OF TECHMATURGY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_2610). Know what I absolutely love about this phone?\r\n\r\n0. The charging jack is a standard DC input jack, with a corresponding plug. No fiddly nonsense here, no sir. This is a Nokia.\r\n0. It has a keypad lock, because sometimes you might want to prevent accidental button presses. No foolish UI decisions here, no sir. This is a Nokia.\r\n0. I only have to charge it every week or two. It doesn't sit around frantically searching for WiFi or Bluetooth or 4G signals, so it has more than enough juice to send and receive many phone calls and text messages. No frivolous power dumping here, no sir. This is a Nokia.\r\n\r\nIt does only have 2MB of memory, though, so I deleted the fancy themes and such to make room for texts. But how often am I gonna sit there and stare at a phone's animated desktop? Fuckin' never. I bet marketing told engineering to shoehorn that shit into there.\r\n\r\nI just called a Verizon store and was told that there's almost no chance that a phone from AT&amp;T will work with their network. Even the iPhone 6/s, which supposedly has an antenna for each network or something in an effort to make this sort of transition possible, occasionally has trouble making the switch.\r\n\r\nI'll have to join the world of daily charging, apps, selfies, and all that other useless garbage that gets in the way of a phone being a phone. \"but farnor itz a computr lol! such powr many masheen!\" NO. SMARTPHONES ARE TOYS. The smartphone software environment is closer to that of the Nintendo 64, not to that of the PC. People have made these apps, and that's it, and you're gonna like it. Want to run something that works perfectly fine on Windows, Unix, or even Mac? LOLNO. Want to develop in the language of your choice, e.g. Python? \\*blank stare\\*. Want to visit an ordinary goddamn website? Sorry, it's all fucked up on phones, please use the Happy Meal version - I mean the mobile version. No PC Master Race around here. Tap to download Angry Birds! Fuck you, birds.\r\n\r\nSo now I need to choose a phone. It has to be a free/cheap one - no way am I going to shell out $800 for a PRETEND FUCKING COMPUTER. We'll be on a two-year plan. Here's the list:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.verizonwireless.com/smartphones/2ypricea/\r\n\r\nI have no clue about all these Droids and Motorolas and HTCs and all. Oh, and Apple stuff is out because I fucking hate their shit that sticks users in a goddamn playpen sandbox without the slightest increase in usability (it was fun watching my dad trying to configure an email account on his iPhone). I like Microsoft, because their philosophy fits my computing style (i.e., \"let the user control their machine\"), and I'd get a kick out of going \"yeah, this phone is from Microsoft, you probably haven't heard of them :^),\" but most apps are made for iOS and/or Android. See, if they could just make a Windows Phone OS that was actually Windows, it would blow everything out of the water. Instant access to the ENTIRE WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM would make a laughingstock out of the competition, with their proprietary East Berlin-esque environments.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\n0. A real charging jack like the 2610's, or an inductive charging system. Plugging in those flimsy micro-USB plugs multiple times a day wears the USB port out in a few months, and then you can never be sure whether your phone actually charged when you plugged it in. \"Sorry, my phone's almost out of juice\" is like a motto for a lot of people.\r\n0. Reasonably durable. Basically, I don't want a phone that shatters into a million fucking pieces when you look at it the wrong way, which, from what I've seen, is pretty much every smartphone. I cringe whenever I see someone whose smartphone got a shattered faceplate, cracked camera lens, or dodgy charging port a month after they got it, and now they have to live with that toxic waste for the next year or two.\r\n\r\nWould be nice:\r\n\r\n0. Support for doing real grown-up computing tasks. USB port (or a smaller port with a dongle for real USB) so I can plug in a keyboard/mouse, maybe HDMI/MHL/something for video out, and I'm pretty sure the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack is standard, yes? If I'm going to carry an overloaded Tamagotchi around (\"charge me! update my apps! you have an email! hey look listen hello! no bluetooth signal found!\"), it had better be a respectably-capable device (and I don't mean automatically taking [pictures of my breakfast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-dD-QKYN4) and sending them to my pot-smoking friends on Twitter while I make a gang sign with a meaning I'm completely unaware of).\r\n0. If there is a phone that, through some means of voodoo and tetryon pulses, is able to run the standard desktop PC version of Windows (8.1 if possible), tell me it. I want it.\r\n0. Wide video codec support. I have a pretty large video library, and it would be kind of REALLY GODDAMN PATHETIC if a brand-new \"computer\" wasn't able to play anything but YouTube (\"dood u need the app tho\", fuck you) and the 80s-quality videos that its camera produced (\"it's got 90 megapixels!\" yeah, and they're all shit because the lens and sensor are the size of a housefly). This wouldn't be a problem for a phone that ran real Windows, because I could just download codec packs, but of course they won't work on phone OSes. I mean, I have a video player from 2006 (Cowon A2) that can play almost anything. Will I really still have to use that as my go-to portable media player?\r\n\r\nI saw a Windows phone on the linked Verizon page (Lumia 735, apparently a new but low-end phone), but I Googled it and the official MS page on it has a title with [\"The Smartphone Made for Selfies\"](http://www.microsoft.com/en/mobile/phone/lumia735/). This from the company that used to get compared with the Borg? [You maniacs! You blew it up!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063442/quotes?item=qt0482675)\r\n\r\nI think, ideally, I would want a Windows Surface Phone, if such a thing existed. Not as powerful as a full tower PC, but capable of Doing Work.\r\n\r\nI realize that this was very long, but hopefully it was entertaining and informative enough for you to give me some useful advice on what to do here (and yes, \"give up and just glare at your phone every time you take the stupid thing out\" is, if called for, perfectly valid).","replies":[]}
