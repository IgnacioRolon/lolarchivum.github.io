Then the team would get together in one of the more spacious conference rooms (it had a bean bag chair at one point) and break down what the current state of the faction's lore was. Main players? Important figures? Politics? History? Society? Future? We'd go through what existed, read some of the adjoining champion information, then begin a multi-week long series of meetings brainstorming what defined the places and people that make Noxus, well... Noxus.\n\nOn top of that, there were per-week short story submissions for everyone on the team, and those would go through rounds of critique to flesh out the most vibrant and cohesive vision of Noxian society/champs. During this period we'd also double up by having Noxus champion breakdowns, so we'd be simultaneously looking at, say, Katarina, while also looking at how and where she was raised and why. She would *also* have short story submissions during that time, which tended to include Cass, Talon, and her parents. After a while we'd feel comfortable *enough* to move on to another faction, so that we could cycle through them all until we ended up at Noxus for another round of iteration.\n\nIt was super fun, but also a TON of work.

Much of the time it's very natural, some of the time we inadvertently expand on an existing champ while developing the new champ. Sometimes it's spontaneous. Sometimes we don't even know where the new champ fits in at all, so there are iterations ranging from a yordle to a cat dude to a space robot to a darkin and back before anyone agrees on where it should be placed. Of the two I've worked on, only one saw me inputting for story, and that process was really cool because any little thing could dramatically change both the character and the faction they came from, if not the entire dynamic of Runeterra.\n\nLike I said, super fun!","replies":[{"poster":"Nybx4life","date":"2015-03-19T18:34:24.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks again for your input.

I'm QA on the skins team, and can shed a bit of light on this subject.\n\nThere's several factors that determine which champion will get a skin and why. If we come up with an awesome skin idea for say Sivir, but it's winter-themed, we'll hold that idea for the Snowdown event. Same rules apply for other events, such as Lunar Revel or Harrowing. We also look at when a champion last had a skin, if we have a solid thematic for a new skin for x champion, how many skins x champion has, etc. \n\nThe process itself involves severeal stages of ideation. \n\nLet's use Akali as an example, since Headhunter Akali just came out today and this is a skin I've worked on! \n\nWe'll start by bringing everyone together to pitch ideas for Akali. Anything goes at this point! We'll also bring up player concepts that we've saved for Akali, and discuss those, too! Once we've got all the ideas written down, we vote on the ideas that we feel are the strongest.\n\nFrom there, we concept what these ideas might look like. We'll then narrow it down a bit more and choose the strongest concept. This concept is then refined until we feel it's reached it's final form, and from there, begin creating the skin (models, textures, animations and particles.)\n\nWe review the progress of the skin, and give feedback accordingly throughout the process. During this time, bugs are fixed, and we make sure the skin is bug free (and looks pretty... or badass, accordingly!)\n\nOnce we've got the skin nearly finalized, we toss it out to the PBE for player feedback! QA Analysts like myself then gather the actionable feedback and deliver it back to the team for discussion. We'll make changes where we see fit based on said feedback, and those changes will appear on the PBE in the same cycle. Player feedback, both positive and negative, are super beneficial for us! For example, Blood Moon Elise had her outfit color changed three times based on feedback! Firecracker Jinx also gained a jade dragon tattoo! \n\nOnce the PBE cycle is complete, we package it up and ship it to live!","replies":[{"poster":"Nybx4life","date":"2015-03-23T20:16:38.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Many thanks KateyKhaos!

Cool skin and everything, but unrelated to any holidays/Lore events (there's others I believe that fit this list, but I hope you understand what I'm trying to say).\n\nSo, are most skins released based on proper timing (holiday, Lore event, etc), or is it based more on a schedule (something like: \"Hey, it's been a few months since we released a skin.

Again, there's exceptions for this if we have an awesome skin idea that fits well with an event. A good example of this would be Reaper Soraka and Order of the Banana Soraka. \n> \n> Even if it's not tied to an event, if it's a solid thematic, we're willing to ideate on it, and potentially ship it!\n\nSpeaking of shipping, would you guys make \"shipped\" skin sets? I know this isn't the best question, but I couldn't help think of Lux-Ezreal. \n\nSo to more accurately word the question, would Riot create skin sets based on popular \"ships\" which have been pushed by both Riot and the Community (Say, Luxreal/Ezrealux skins {{champion:99}} {{champion:81}} ), and have you done something like this already that I've missed?","replies":[{"poster":"Motajo","date":"2015-03-24T16:06:32.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Keagn,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=sT0kwzhc,comment-id=00030000000000000001000100000000,timestamp=2015-03-23T20:48:32.773+0000)\nSay, Luxreal/Ezrealux skins\n\nPlease no, I'm running out of skin for that substance to burn","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-03-23T21:22:11.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've done a few skins kind of like this, such as Tango Evelynn and Tango Twisted Fate, or King Tryndamere and Queen Ashe, if that's what you're referring to.","replies":[{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-03-23T21:32:28.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=sT0kwzhc,comment-id=000300000000000000010001000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-23T21:22:11.909+0000)\n>\n> We've done a few skins kind of like this, such as Tango Evelynn and Tango Twisted Fate, or King Tryndamere and Queen Ashe, if that's what you're referring to.\n\nI feel silly for forgetting these XO\n\nThere was also Prom Queen Annie and Almost Prom King Amumu for the people who shipped that.\n\nBut I really want to see a EzrealxLux skin duo. I mean, Ez's desk has a picture/drawing of them on it.
