However, the idea of Bloodrazor into Cleaver into full tank has popped into my mind a few times. I haven&#039;t tried it out of fear of it being garbage and have been doing okay with just Warrior enchant. \r\n\r\nHowever, one game I went against this fed Darius. He was nearly impossible to kill. Admittedly I probably should&#039;ve ganked more for my top laner but, after that game the thought has been really bugging me. Part of me kept saying &quot;Could&#039;ve won if you just maxed W and went BloodRazor&quot;\r\n\r\nBut, anyway. Is it viable?","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-09-07T00:27:05.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She doesn't really need attack speed because of her AA reset on her E and she already has an armor shred passive. Plus with so little AD you'll only be doing damage through your W passive, and you probably won't get to AA that much in teamfights. \n\nIf you really want to meme you could go rageblade and solo baron though because you'll be applying your W passive every other hit instead of on every 3rd hit. But yeah neither of them are serious builds.","replies":[{"poster":"Gruckets","date":"2017-09-07T02:15:15.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, not viable then I guess.
