I main {{champion:23}} and I usually have a lead by the end of laning phase. The problem is my team doesn&#039;t do very well and I end up losing. My question is it better to solo carry as  {{champion:23}} by split pushing the whole game or team fighting after laning phase?","replies":[{"poster":"BzRazor","date":"2016-10-22T02:48:50.604+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"afk push top lane, take top tower by 15min or less and care of ganks. \n\nYou want to kill early and take that tower as early as possible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AHarmlessTaco","date":"2016-10-22T02:55:46.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO, the most important thing you can do is attract attention top or take objectives while the enemy team is focused elsewhere. Split top as much as you can and gank if you are ahead. Wait to split until you have pressure in other lanes or have vision on their team. If your team is sieging, keep an eye on them and do lend aid if you are ahead. If you are behind, keep splitting and just try to divert their teams attention without dying. Keep note of who is fed on their team and know who you can duel and who you can't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bruised Ego","date":"2016-10-22T02:54:35.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tryndamere is more of a split pusher, but there are times to group as well. Typically though, if you're strong enough to 1v1 and can draw 2 people to your lane, this leaves your team open to be able to 4 vs 3 the enemies. Of course, you have to keep pressure on their towers and not die. Timing is also important. You want to have hard pressure on the opposite side of the map from where you want your team to take an objective. \n\nExample: Dragon comes up in 1 minute, your team prepares dragon (scans/wards/pinks) while you push the opposite side of the map (top). \n\nIf you can't even 1v1 your opponent, you have pretty little pressure and are essentially useless.\n\nI also want to point out that I've played Tryndamere in low elo and I've gotta tell you, most of the time, your team isn't going to take full advantage of your split pushing or they will just fight 4v5 before you can draw pressure. Feelsbadman. Teamfighting champions are easier to get out of low elo with imo (something brainless like Malphite).","replies":[]}]}
