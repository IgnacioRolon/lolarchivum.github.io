Things you need to take note is that {{item:3031}} does 15% True damage based off of the damage of a crit, so in simple terms a crit doing 100 damage 15 of that damage is converted to true damage. So we get what it does but how do we counter it?\r\n\r\nStep 1 Buy {{item:3047}} this will make auto attacks coming from the AD carry do 12% less damage and on top of that gives you 20 bonus armor to reduce even more **ATTACK DAMAGE**\r\n\r\nStep 2 Buy {{item:3143}} this will make all **CRITICAL STRIKE DAMAGE** reduced by 20% this helps against {{item:3031}} because remember {{item:3031}} does true damage based off of the damage of the crit so if you reduce the damage of the crit you reduce the amount of true damage and the other stats will only help you even more. {{item:3143}} still gives you 60 armor which reduces **ATTACK DAMAGE** and gives 400 health remember {{item:3031}} does true damage based off of the crits damage not your max HP or current HP so more HP the more true damage you can take. And dont forget the unique active that slows anyone around you by 55% good for getting onto those slippery fuckers.\r\n\r\nStep 3 Buy {{item:3110}} ADCs rely on consistent damage and if you can reduce the speed in which then can do that by 15% by just standing near them it will over all also reduce the amount of damage you take from them. Also to put the icing on the cake you get a whole whopping 100 armor because even though {{item:3031}} does do true damage its not all true damage the ADC is still doing more **ATTACK DAMAGE** and 100 armor will help with that a lot. And why not add some candles on that cake with the bonus 20% CDR and 400 mana it gives you to use more of your abilities more often.\r\n\r\nChampions that are good against the new {{item:3031}} are\r\n\r\n1. {{champion:54}} Malphite is really good against crit ADCs because he benefits nothing more than stacking armor making him really hard to kill, but wait what about the true damage? Malphite can buy all these items and they will only benefit from them. Thats not it though {{champion:54}} is one of many nightmares for an ADC due to his abilities. His Ult is a damn near INSTANT knock up that can only really be avoided by using {{summoner:4}} even then you need to be quick on the dime. Next is his E, his E can slow someones attack speed up to 50% this is the same reason with {{item:3110}} if they are not attacking you as fast they are not doing as much DPS. Lastly is his Q this is a very simple but effective ability especially on an ADC that being because it is a **POINT AND CLICK** slow meaning it can not be avoided by just side stepping most ADCs are very immobile so slowing them even more only makes it easier to get to them. \r\n\r\n2. {{champion:75}} The &quot;Oh you need to scale to kill me? How cute.&quot; {{champion:75}} is another ADCs worst nightmare not only because he nuke you with 1 ability but he ALSO benefits from all these items. {{item:3110}} Nasus **NEEDS** CDR so whats better than getting halfway to the CDR cap with 1 item and all the other stats are never wasted either. And {{item:3143}} as where its not a CORE item on Nasus it still help with him the **CRITICAL STRIKE DAMAGE** and an active that makes him even harder to kite. His abilities is what takes the cake here though Nasus&#039;s Q once stacked enough will do MONSTROUS damage to a squishy like an ADC. His W will not only slow your attack speed but can also slow your movement speed to up to 95% as we said before slowing an already immobile ADC makes them so much easier to kill and chase down. Next is his E as were this isn&#039;t AS important it still helps with removing that little shit from your screen the damage of this isn&#039;t why its good its the up to 35% armor reduction to the enemies inside the area making the already squishy enemies EVEN MORE squishy. Finally his R there isnt much to say about this ability other than it makes you incredibly tanky with HP, armor, and magic resist.\r\n\r\n3. {{champion:31}} My last champion is {{champion:31}} he is especially good against the new {{item:3031}} because he stacks a lot of HP since {{item:3031}} does true damage based off crit damage instead of current or max HP he isn&#039;t phased by the true damage at all since the more HP he has the more true damage form {{item:3031}}  he can take. And same ass the other champions he benefits from these items no stat is wasted or pointless. The reason hes good against ADCs is not JUST because he can be insanely tanky but he can 1 shot or come really damn close to it with the combination of his R and {{item:3193}} pair both those up with {{summoner:4}} and there&#039;s nearly nothing an ADC can do against it they will just die instantly and since this only does more damage the more HP he gets chowing down on that ADC only makes him stronger.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this helps I spend a lot of time on this trying to make it as entertaining to read as possible :)\r\n\r\n{{sticker:poppy-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Malak","date":"2018-06-15T18:10:01.163+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea people need to stop crying about new IE, it's not that op","replies":[{"poster":"Bob the Toastr","date":"2018-06-15T20:10:13.868+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not just IE.

Thanks for sharing for us.\n\nI would assume so since the items wouldn't work if it didn't this was also a thought of mine but thinking that since omen is reducing 20% crit damage and ie does true damage base on the crit you DO the true damage conversion would happen after as far as paired up with tabi thats a lot of math my simple brain cannot handle lol","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2018-06-16T19:35:28.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here, too much for my taste lol.
