Totally agree there are significant considerations to be made.\n\nWould you say the problem with ADCs is the power of crit items? \n\nI think lethality and on-hit marksmen are fine. They focus on either squishy killing or tank/bruiser killing only, while suffering in the other aspect. This seems like a appropriate balance where you have a good reason to go a specific marksmen and build a specific way.  \n\nBut crit is just too ubiquitously strong against all kinds of targets. It also has two unhealthy play patterns --- 1) RNG at low crit chance 2) EXTREME scaling, which, while is appropriate against tanky targets, kill squishes way too fast in the late game.\n\nCan you guys retain marksmen' ability to kill tanks, juggernauts and bruisers while tuning down their ability to assassinate sqiushies? A good way to do this I think is nerfing or even removing crit but buffing BONUS armor pen, MAX health % damage and BONUS health% damage on new items.  \n\nThis would make the play pattern of ADCs more healthy while keeping their intended role. And from that point you'll pick ADC bot lane if they have tanky targets. And if they have squishy targets you can go a mage or something else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hópe","date":"2018-02-26T03:06:00.161+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EytivvEE,comment-id=000000020000,timestamp=2018-02-26T00:56:06.831+0000)\n>\n> Yeah.

Many times i see people ''RITO NERF ADCS'' and then we check their match history and they are 100 cs 3-0 at 30 minutes vs the 288 farm Tristana thats 0-5. \n\nI do agree tabis DO need a nerf, but not justify what he said considering Randuins/frozen heart is an amazing item against ADCs too","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2018-02-26T03:59:31.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Repetoir, I think your points here are valid, but I will say with a straight face that {{item:3111}} is **not** equally powerful or desirable to {{item:3047}} . Between all the displacement effects in the game ({{champion:141}}  is a popular one now, and {{champion:5}} is growing in popularity again...) and the fact that Legend: Tenacity gives you 20% slotless Tenacity, I really don't think that there's a reason for divers or tanks to really care about {{item:3111}} . \n\nSkirmishers almost universally do not give a shit about crowd control in the first place, so if they want a defensive boost they'll always go for {{item:3047}} . Juggernauts may be the only ones who would value stacking Tenacity up to 60% or so, but even then they may just prefer the armor offered in the laning phase because juggernauts only ever go top lane. \n\nNinja Tabi's effect would be much better as part of {{item:3143}} , making it THE anti-auto attacker item (selfish, as opposed to {{item:3110}} , though there's an argument for whether we should keep that aura in the game at all).\n\nAs for what effects would be appropriate on an armor boot item, it should be an anti-assassin item. Tanks and divers are unable to rush pure armor items to deal with AD assassins like they could in the old days (you **have** to get {{item:1401}} on tanks), meanwhile assassins are rushing lethality. If assassins want to rush lethality and roam for their kills, great. Let them get their kills on enchanters, marksmen or mages. Not divers or vanguards. \n\nSuggested specifics: \nUnique Passive - Wood Style - Enemies who dash or blink within 300 units of you deal 5% less physical damage with their abilities for 2 seconds. \n\nUnique Passive - Armor Plating - Moving builds up charges, and at 100 charges, you gain a shield that absorbs 20xlevel physical damage. \n\nUnique Passive - Vanguard's Reinforcement - When you immobilize an enemy champion, reduce their physical damage output to you by 20% for 4 seconds (with an Exhaust animation). This effect does not stack with Challenging Smite. Cooldown 60 seconds.
