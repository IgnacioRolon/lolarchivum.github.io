All you need is to farm up minions for your [W: Soul Furnace] passive. Play safely & farm up as Sion can use a Fully charged Q & W explosion to farm up waves. Also make sure to Ward your blind spots as Sion has no real mobility, which would result in you being easy pickings for the enemy team. Sion's Engage/Roaming tool, [R: Unstoppable Onslaught], can also be used as an escape tool if you find yourself caught out. At roughly 30%-40% CDR at Rank 3, Sion's ultimate has a cooldown between 36-48 seconds. \n----------------\nSion has very little mobility outside his ultimate & since he's reliant on farm to make this strategy work, you could bully him & try zoning him from his waves. Treat him as you would Nasus (or even Toplane Heimerdinger), shut him down & finish the game before he scales. Also keep in mind that Sion can do ALOT in teamfghts, knocking people up & Shredding/slowing people with his [E: Roar of the Slayer].\n---------------\nNow as for Sion \"Inting\", that's on the player, not the champion. Sure, Sion is really good & as matter of fact is considered one of the best tanks in the game.

Shortly after release Rengar emerged as a split pushing power-house, and his stealth was powerfully nerfed as a result. Trynd, Nid, Jax, and a few other \"split-pushing duelist escape artists.\" have had nerfs for the same reason over the years.\n\nSion isn't that. He's sort of semi dangerous early and mid game if you don't know how to play against him / aren't playing the right champs, but his kill potential is mostly up to his enemy to fumble. His ulti can get him out of sticky situations, but it's also hard-countered by simply being ontop of him or walking infront of him. It's not like Nid out-running entire teams via bushes and jumping walls.\n\nSo Sion is worse in almost every way than historical problem split pushers. Like, non-viably worse. As in he'd be garbage at it, or at least should be.\n\nHis only redeeming quality is how much health he gets. This lets him double dip; it makes him hard to kill, and makes him dangerous to towers via the Demolisher rune.\n\nBut even still, 'hard to kill' isn't a huge problem. He's not going to win any 1v2s ala previous problem split pushers, nor is he good from escaping this self-same fights. He's wholly unique in that he's a tank who can split push effectively (I guess, technically, Singed qualifies too?), but he's MASSIVELY easier to counter than others have been in the past.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BrightWîngs","date":"2018-10-06T08:08:11.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MorganFreemanBot,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9OcGX1Z5,comment-id=000200010000,timestamp=2018-10-06T07:13:25.373+0000)\n>\n> Split pushing has always been hard to deal with / anti fun for everyone who&#x27;s NOT the split pusher.\n> \n> Trynd, Yorrick, and a couple of other top laners (most of whom aren&#x27;t viable right now) do this exact same strat. \n> \n> In the past Nid, Trundle, Renekton, Rengar, and others have abused this exact pattern.\n> \n> They don&#x27;t come &quot;back from the dead&quot; line Sion does, but generally trade that for a LOT more dueling power.
