His kit is the least-balanced in the game; not the least-balanceable mind you, I can think of several others that are worse.  However, being 1-shot, regardless of your item choices or champion pick (I've seen a 4-armor-item Malphite get 1-shot from 110% HP before,) just for leaving the home pad while there's a level 6+ Rengar in the game is one of the most anti-fun aspects of League.\n\nMy answer has been to ban him every single game, like I said above.
