As well to give him a much better kit that is easier for enemies to counter but to give him more opportunities then ult bot and get fed and a better combo then spear, jump, stab, kill. He is a very cool character IMO and i&#039;d love to see more from him.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-05-05T00:22:54.944+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we go by necessities in MY opinion:\n\nS Class (Need Rework ASAP): {{champion:82}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:72}} \nA Class (Needs a Rework, but Can Wait): {{champion:80}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:35}} \nB Class (Bad Kit, Good Thematic): {{champion:17}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:74}} \nC Class (Simply Could be Better): {{champion:106}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:421}}\n\nEveryone else is too debatable for me to be sure.","replies":[{"poster":"MuffledGarbage","date":"2017-05-05T00:44:10.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kayle just needs a Visual update\n\nJax never hits his endgame fantasy in the 20-30 minute average game.\n\nAurelion sol isn't in need of a VGU at all at the moment, he needs better ap scalings on his passive or W but not both.\n\nVeigar doesn't need to be in that list unless you want an endgame veigar to go from having 1000 AP lategame to having 2000 AP lategame.\n\nEveryone else in your list I agree with entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-05-05T00:56:14.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like Kayle's kit is a little too \"This is going to happen\" for my own tastes.
