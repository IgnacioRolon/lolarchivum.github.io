Your ticket has been received, and an account recovery specialist will be reaching out as soon as they can.  I don't see anything damaging so not to worry, but I highly recommend going over our [account protection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account) just to double up on your security inside and out of league.

I received a response from LoveSickCommander but it only says the following:\n\n\"Looks like we're helping you out on ticket #30296075\n\nPlease forward all your questions and concerns over there, please!\"\n\nThe problem is I can't view my ticket because my log in credentials do not work on the League of Legends website. I need to complete the verification process via my main accounts email address or I need someone with Riot to give me access to the League of Legends website to view my ticket.\n\nI have told LoveSickCommander this several times today, but this has been their only response.\n\nPlease assist!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-17T21:49:33.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like a specialist replied to your ticket that you do have access to just a few minutes ago with some follow-up questions.
