There are only four punishment tiers, and you can't really punish intentionally feeding with a chat restriction, so that leaves the 14-day ban, followed by a permanent ban.\n\nHere's a [Support Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-) with some general info about the punishment tiers.\n\n> After 3 months of slow climbing honor and about 200 games, I am at Honor 1, checkpoint one.

Intentionally feeding is in and of itself unreal, so \"unreal\" severity makes sense.**_\n\nYou wouldn't like it if someone intentionally fed your games, and you'd almost certainly want to see them banned; the punishment fits.

Beyond that, you're not being particularly clear about what you're saying anyhow - what do you mean by Support said \"it gets a lower rate of increase\"?\n\nAnd, on top of that, you didn't answer the questions I posed in my initial response.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Tyson","date":"2019-08-20T00:41:14.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"I include the winrate to signify that I am individually playing very well, so I get lots of honors for that, I get many honors than before and I earned more checkpoints in 150 and than the 250 games I've played since.\n\nTo quote my support ticket:\n\nHey there Mr Tyson,\nThanks for writing in to us! I can totally understand where you are coming from here. For sure earning Honor at a slow rate sucks. Unfortunately though, you have to play many hundreds of games after a penalty in order to get back to optimal Honor experience gains. I know that this sucks, but as you keep playing, your Honor experience will level out and you'll be back to earning the maximum amount again.\nIf you have any other questions, comments, or concerns, please let me know.\nSincerely,\nChocobro\nRiot Games Player Support\nSona Main\n\n\n\nAnd, for the other questions. I do not type much, I try to win games. I'm sure some of the people to who type \"9x mid\" in all chat report me. However, as I've been playing much better, those instances have decreased, although I am sure they still happen.\n\nMy overall behaviour hasn't changed much from my previous 7 years. I play to try and win. In 1 game, some douche 'on my team' was being an asshole actively trying to make me preform worse, and I returned the favor by being a douche back. I did not think I would get 14 days, and w/e, can't do much about that.\n\nThe fact that I have 7 years clean, and 5 months and 250 games since the incidence, is the complaint. Especially when you consider people have been perma banned, but just open up a new account and level with their toxic friends, can participate in Clash. I have 5 months and 200 games of confirmed good behaviour since the ban and cannot participate in clash.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-08-20T01:08:21.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> To quote my support ticket:\n> \n> Hey there Mr Tyson,\n> Thanks for writing in to us!

This is the first time I've heard it stated that Honor progression following a punishment is slowed by default. So then, maybe instances of players taking exceptionally long have a mixture of general misbehavior on top of the reduced Honor progress, leading to those odd-some cases of colossal stretches of time where hardly any progress is made.\n\nBut, that also comes into conflict with some other anecdotal cases, where players have claimed to climb Honor Levels in a matter of months, some even saying that they reach another Checkpoint each week. Granted, those are cases of exceptional behavior post-punishment, but I can't imagine they'd be so fast if Honor progress is reduced by default after a punishment clears.\n\n> I'm sure some of the people to who type \"9x mid\" in all chat report me. However, as I've been playing much better, those instances have decreased, although I am sure they still happen.\n\nWell, given that you don't type much, as long as you don't make any argumentative comments in return, their reports - no matter if it's 1x or 9x - do nothing. A report only triggers a review, and if that review finds no punishable behavior - no punishment is given, and the reports are discarded.\n\nThe only advice I can really give is to always Honor someone post-match (For the Team Honor Bonus), and maybe make the occasional positive bark in chat; \"GJ\", \"WP\", etc. - other than that, patience.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Tyson","date":"2019-08-20T01:14:29.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Well, it is unlikely that will allow me to participate in Clash.

If you are not progressing in honor over 3 months, you are still misbehaving. Many players have returned to honor level 2 in 3 months or less.
