Makes it hard to poke, trade, basically do anything. His passive is so strong to the point they have to lower the power of the rest of his kit.

Broken doesn't mean overpowered, it means that he has a kit that is very binarily overpowered or underpowered, based on the numbers attached to his kit or the items/runes he uses. The issues are his passive and his ult being on the same champion, along with easy and mana efficient waveclear patterns.\n\nThese issues are most apparent in melee low-range or poor waveclear mage matchups. He AFK shoves you into tower because his waveclear becomes mana efficient very quickly and if you try to fight back, you have to pop his passive first. Once you pop his passive, you really hope his jungler isn't nearby because if the jungler is there, he pops ult and you die with about 95% certainty. You have trouble getting wards out because you've been stuck under your tower attempting to deal with his waveclear. Even if he never kills you, he forces many champions to remain under tower until it is gone unless you have considerable jungle pressure. Sure, you can try to gank him, but his passive will deny the initial engage and his minion wave will probably be under your tower, so it may not even be gold efficient to try to kill him.\n\nNo, not every matchup works this way, and players with stronger game knowledge and effective jungle pathing/pressure can abuse him, but it's enough of a problem in enough scenarios that they had to gut him. This is without even mentioning that his Flash R with his passive and Banshee's Veil preventing his ultimate from being stopped is a near-guaranteed kill in teamfights in solo queue because not all five enemy players will have a QSS or a Mikael's Crucible on the support.\n\nMalzahar was better off, balance-wise, before his rework. Now he is destined to either be permaban status or drastically underpowered, based on how his kit numbers are adjusted or the items and runes he uses are adjusted.\n\ntl;dr: I hope to see his passive changed to a different effect entirely or even a full revert to his prior kit, so that he is allowed to be a champion again.","replies":[{"poster":"DW Diana","date":"2018-04-19T00:44:08.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Illaominati,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zGKyvLjf,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-04-18T18:30:47.604+0000)\n>\n> They created a champion which is broken.

You can even tank his space aids early withough taking much damage on most champions as it scales well of ap but has a pretty low base damage. This again really screws up his wave clear and leaves him manaless very quickly. Having done this a simple auto attack will bread his passive for 20 second leaving plenty of time to gank. Malz mains often see this as a prelude to a gank so will back right off allowing to to farm at will even when your jg is not near. Malz is super immobile and any cc you can throw at him is potentially fatal.\n\nWhat malzahar lacks as the moment is solo kill pressure. It's been that way since last season when they destroyed his voidlings. To compensate for it the buffed his ult meaning all of his kill pressure resided on his point and click stun. Then this season they nerfed everything but his voidlings leaving him in the sorry state he's in now.\n\nIn conclusion they need to make his voidlings good again which will mitigate the nerfs to his ult and make him viable once more. His voidlings should have the movement speed towards targets of his e returned, as well as a attack speed increase/extra damage effect as well. This will mean his ult is no longer his only means of killing people. At this point it can be changed to a beam channelled slow rather than hard cc, maybe with a silence included, and his q can be a form of actual cc (like most mages he should have some way to cc that doesn't rely entirely on his ult)\n\nAnywho, rant over, it's nothing that hasn't been said by 10-15 other malz mains on the forums over the last 6 months and riot will no doubt continue to ignore it.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2018-04-19T02:15:28.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simple solution rework him. \n\nWith the same design, and maybe slightly lower Q and R numbers, that existed on him at the start of 2016.
