Why? Well, when I stack over 200 armor and MR and hit over 3k health, I'm supposed to be able to live through things. I don't. And no, I don't mean \"if 5 people focus me I die after 5 seconds\", I mean even with those stats, if the enemy's carry is 6 slotted he melts me like I'm ice in the sun. This can be explained by several factors:\n\n1. Too much armor penetration. If the enemy team has someone with a black cleaver to stack the debuff on me, I'll have my armor reduced by 60% against anyone with a Last Whisper. This means that at 220 armor, I go down to 88 armor. If the enemy carry has any flat armor penetration on top, I'm actually going below 80 armor. This is idiotic and makes armor stacking pretty much useless in the long run.\n\n2. Too much % health based damage. This is most egregious when said damage is true damage (I'm looking at you Vayne). So now you're punished for stacking health too.\n\n3. Poor itemization. Hitting 220 armor, 200 MR and over 3k health is impossible to do without crippling yourself in one or more aspect, usually damage done or mana efficiency. Though tanks aren't supposed to be doing a lot of damage, they need to be doing **some**. And I'm not even going to mention how I'm always out of mana as a tank. So, I stack tanking stats and in return I do no damage, run out of mana all the time and I'm still squishy.\n\n4. Lifesteal is out of control. Since carries can pretty much ignore my armor and do immense damage to me while I do no damage to them, I'm efficiently nothing but a huge health battery for the enemy carry. Low on health? Target the enemy tank and heal yourself back to full while he can't do anything about it!\n\nSo, the solutions are simple. Nerf armor penetration, remove % health based damage as much as possible, buff tanking items and nerf lifesteal.","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2015-01-18T23:15:33.285+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":2,"body":"An ADC burning through a Tank's health is how things are supposed to go.\n\nWhat I have issue with are things like Zed grabbing BotRK/Whisper and turning Tanks into grease-stains.

That it's normal for AD carries to kill tanks pretty much as fast as any other champion?\n\nCarries by definition are late-game champions completely reliant on items to matter. They often have a weak early and strong late, to the point their team basically has to carry them early on and then they can transition to pretty much carrying their team once they hit 6 major items.\n\nIt's important to note the average game is ~33 minutes long and sees ~11,000 gold per player, which is more 3 major items and boots.\n\nAlso incredibly important to note most champions are balanced around how strong they are on average over the course of a game. Early game champions like Shaco and LeBlanc tend to be pretty lackluster late, where late game champions like Tryndamere and Vayne tend to be pretty useless early.\n\nAnyways - late game carries destroy pretty much everything. Tanks are not late game carries, so the carry is properly doing their job if they're deleting you when they're 6 slotted.\n\nLate-game champions aren't guaranteed late-game status either. You pretty much always get to use a solid mid game and you always get to use a solid early game.\n\nAlso, the pre-Last Whisper and pre-Void Staff phase is like 90% of the game if we're looking at an ~11,000 gold per player average. Obviously there's a solid amount of anti-tank that can happen when you fill 6 slots with anti-tank, the game doesn't start at 6 slots filled though.","replies":[{"poster":"Akesgeroth","date":"2015-01-18T23:42:45.444+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, and tanks don't start the game with 200 armor, 200 MR and 3k health either.

Better to target squishies who don't reduce your damage and therefore give you *more* lifesteal. If you are a tank duelling an ADC then it is your fault that you die... And then, of course, there is the obligatory mention of Thornmail.\n\nAlso, 200 armour sucks... It isn't enough for a tank. A tank should be hitting 300 Armour, 100 MR and about 3.5k health. \n\nFinally, I understand that you like tanking.\nWritten a different way, I understand why you like being able to ignore your opponents damage. It is equally frustrating, if not more frustrating for a carry to deal with unkillable tanks then it is for a tank to have problems when facing a carry. The tank meta was boring. This is about as balanced as tanks and carries have ever been. Don't ruin it please.","replies":[{"poster":"Akesgeroth","date":"2015-01-18T23:56:04.892+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. All right. But even at 48,75%, that's still a massive amount. Still, thanks for the precision.\n\n2. Yes, Vayne is an outlier, but she's not the only one who brings this issue. BotRK and Liandry's are the worst offenders in this category IMHO, much worse than Vayne.\n\n3. No, a tank should not deal a significant amount of damage **except in specific scenarios.** As an example, Nautilus is supposed to do a LOT of damage while his W is up to force enemies to focus him and take out his shield. Still, I was mentioning this mostly as a comparison: If tanks die so fast, their only use is CC, and in that case why not get someone who has CC and damage?\n\n4. Though I agree that 300 armor would be better (and I usually do hit 3,5k health), do you think 100 MR is enough?","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-01-19T00:09:19.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1) 50% of 300 armour more than triples your survivability. 300 is about the amount I would expect a tank to have late game.\n\n2) I have calculated that it takes 20 shots **before** damage reduction of BotRK to reduce health past 20%. BotRK will probably do about a fifth of all the damage an adc will do to you. Liandry's is 12% per three seconds before MR, which does not stack. This will likely decrease to 6%. It is only really a problem in extended sieges, in which case, why aren't you dodging? %health is severely overestimated.\n\n3) Yes, Nautilus is supposed to do a lot of damage in that scenario, but he doesn't *itemise* for that damage. His base damage is enough. Other tanks have similar scenarios but again, the base damage is enough. Any more becomes ridiculous.\n3.5) Tanks don't die that fast, really. They live for more than 3 times as long a their squishy counterparts. More if they effectively apply their CC. A tank's job is to tank damage, to CC opponents and to peel for his carry. Think; every second longer your carry lives because of you is extra damage. Your peel, CC and survivability helps the team.\n\n4) Yes, in general. 1MR item is normally sufficient. Exceptions would be when you are up against a Swain, for example. Sustained damage should be what you avoid. The burst that normally comes with AP shouldn't ever come your way. If they blow their burst on you then they will probably lose the fight. It would be better against the squishy target behind you.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-01-19T17:15:11.637+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 50% of 300 armour more than triples your survivability\n\nan AD with 50% armor pen, and a tank with 300 armor will leave the tank with 150 effective armor. 100/(100+150)=0.4 will get through which means only 3/5 of the AD's damage is blocked. that is notably less than tripling your survivability. \n\n> Tanks don't die that fast, really.
