Instead, Champion GG shows the win rates for a couple complete mastery pages and Natural Talent is much less influential on the win rate of a page than other masteries (such as the keystone).  There are also a lot of hidden factors that are influencing the winrate for a mastery page.  Look at Champion GG as an indicator of strong trends but not necessarily as a confirmation of META.

Supports are an excellent example.  They don't get the gold to build a lot of AD or AP items.
