I've played enough SMITE to  understand basic MOBA terminology. I know roles, lanes, team comps, etc. I started playing about 2 months ago and I feel like Riot doesn't treat their new players right. \r\n1. IP problems\r\nThey only give you two champions at the start and the ones you have to buy have some ridiculous IP prices. It doesn't help that there aren't that many ways to earn IP other than just by playing the game. (No sign-in bonus, really?) \r\n2. Normal matchmaking\r\nI've seen on some sites that normals shouldn't be taken seriously and that you should just play ranked instead. You can't play ranked until lvl 30 so new players are stuck. Why the hell should a God IV Cho'gath be in my game when I'm not even lvl 20! Or why should a Bronze II Taliyah be here when no one on my team is even lvl 30! It doesn't helped that those two players already had the advantage of Runes and Masteries. Overall, I feel like Riot doesn't give much of an incentive to keep new players playing. This sucks so much because I think this game has some cool things! You guys got some crazy ass/ unique kits! LoL is anybody to do so much with their characters compared to SMITE!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-20T17:33:44.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to League, friend!  Up to level 6, you have a very specific new player pool but you will have access to [a weekly rotation of free champions](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/free-rotation).  You'll also get a set of[ new player chests ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/ZGErnvY4-hextech-crafting-new-player-chests-to-replace-400-rp)to unlock some champions of your own through [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide).\n\nYou can also gain an IP boost just by [verifying your email](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/announcements/earn-4-win-ip-boost-verifying-your-email)!\n\nThere's a lot more stuff too.  My point being that while getting IP is strictly through playing the game, there are still a lot of other ways to get some cool swag.\n\nSince your account is new, [matchmaking ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide)is still getting a feel for your playstyle and may match you against some interesting players until it places you in a spot best fit for you.  There may be other factors as well, like friends queueing up together, or who is queueing up for that mode during that time.  It sounds like this has been a bit of a pain in the ass, but it should come around.  In the meantime, keep playing to get your rating adjusted and play with some friends if they're around.  \n\nI hope that helps, and thanks for sharing your experiences so far!","replies":[]}]}
