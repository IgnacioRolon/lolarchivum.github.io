Thats basically what got you banned. Everything else u said was mild and wouldnt get u banned (maybe chat restricted). But saying \"kys\" is unacceptable by community and Riot alike. It could have even escalated into perma ban. Considering how many unstable people were cyber bullied into commiting suicide there is ZERO tolerance policy for such comments.","replies":[{"poster":"NineMilly","date":"2017-06-10T10:17:25.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"agreed, I figured if everyone was saying dumb stuff and my repsone was kys riot would see the context, still no excuse, thanks for helping me on some of my concerns","replies":[{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2017-06-10T10:18:49.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NineMilly,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jg8claov,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-06-10T10:17:25.288+0000)\n>\n> agreed, I figured if everyone was saying dumb stuff and my repsone was kys riot would see the context, still no excuse, thanks for helping me on some of my concerns\n\nThere is no context in which \"kys\" would be acceptable.","replies":[{"poster":"NineMilly","date":"2017-06-10T10:26:37.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean if all 4 of my teamates are calling eachother including me autistic, trash, saying kys, mom jokes,  then I don't think me saying it back means to something to them if their using it.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2017-06-10T16:59:38.927+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NineMilly,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jg8claov,comment-id=00000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-06-10T10:26:37.793+0000)\n>\n> I mean if all 4 of my teamates are calling eachother including me autistic, trash, saying kys, mom jokes,  then I don&#x27;t think me saying it back means to something to them if their using it.\n\nJust because everyone else is doing it doesnt excuse you when you do it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-06-10T10:04:08.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can create a support ticket requesting additional logs, idk if they will though.
