Riot expects us to not get upset by it and then if we say anything negative. We instead get penalized. There's a mute button built into the game. Riot shouldnt be banning people for anything related to verbal abuse. Riot is literally just a bunch of pussies who can't handle any \"mean words\". They need to ban the real problem. The troll. Thats just far too hard from them. Penalizing someone for trolling hardcore would be way more useful then penalizing someone for some words that can be muted. I cant mute a trolls behavior but riot can. I dont need riot to mute other players b/c i can.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2017-11-09T09:26:36.236+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The mute button is to try and salvage a game already ruined by toxicity.\n\nThe report function is so that no one else has to deal with that again.","replies":[{"poster":"Flahles","date":"2017-11-09T09:34:12.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Wolf King,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=mtekWejJ,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-11-09T09:26:36.236+0000)\n>\n> The mute button is to try and salvage a game already ruined by toxicity.\n> \n> The report function is so that no one else has to deal with that again.\n\nno. The mute button isnt salvaging anything. Its there for that exact reason like its been in every game. To mute people. If they wanted to save a game \"ruined by toxicity\" They wouldn't allow chat at all and would just use pings. Chat is allowed and the mute is there if you dont want to deal with the chat b/c you arent strong enough to read a couple of words and not let them impact you lmfao.

There is always a positive way to do it. When someone is trying their best to win though and somebody else continues to make a repeat mistake. Some flame is going to come out. You've done it. I've done it. We've all done it. It shouldn't be gameplay bannable. Threatening an account for speech does not reform player. It discourages them from playing or talking at all. Prevent them from receiving rewards or find some incentive apart from permanently removing them from an account theyve spent days of their life playing on.","replies":[{"poster":"The Cream Reaper","date":"2017-11-09T18:22:04.647+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im perfectly ok with riot discouraging flamers from playing","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2017-11-09T22:37:15.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those police have riot shields, why get upset when I throw rocks at them?","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Cream Reaper","date":"2017-11-09T21:18:41.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a better question is **WHY** do you need to flame if there's a mute button?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flahles","date":"2017-11-09T18:41:59.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Cream Reaper,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=mtekWejJ,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-11-09T18:22:04.647+0000)\n>\n> Im perfectly ok with riot discouraging flamers from playing\n\nMight I ask why taking the game away from player for flame seems okay when there is a mute button?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Cream Reaper","date":"2017-11-09T09:28:52.405+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Riot is literally just a bunch of pussies who can't handle any \"mean words\"\n\nit's their game and their rules. if you don't like the rules, go play dota and spam death threaths till you feel better about yourself! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Flahles","date":"2017-11-09T09:37:07.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Cream Reaper,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=mtekWejJ,comment-id=00000000000000000001,timestamp=2017-11-09T09:28:52.405+0000)\n>\n> it&#x27;s their game and their rules. if you don&#x27;t like the rules, go play dota and spam death threaths till you feel better about yourself! :)\n\nI'm perfectly fine with it being their game and there rules.
