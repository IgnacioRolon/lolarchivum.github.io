This way it could probably reward a good Soraka that manages cooldown timers for both her abilities and the enemies CC. ; Normal cost?\r\nR: (1,000/2,000) 3,000 +(100% AP) (5 minute cooldown) | 10s channel, requires at least 2 teammates to be below 50% health before activation. Soraka only heals for half. (Maybe even add a little thing like, Soraka has to be near, or even targeted by enemy champions/epic monsters in order to activate as well, so she doesn&#039;t abuse this high healing power from base.)  (This still might be pretty broken, but I don&#039;t know how to make it look like an actual ult. But this is the general idea.)\r\n\r\nAt the very least, I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;ll drop Soraka&#039;s healing rate in two ways. There&#039;s a high potential to stop both pretty easy, and her W now does something like twice as much by the time this ideal W is back up.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-07T16:18:28.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically only aim for one person in a teamfight and render her 100% useless?\n\nConsidering the healing is the only thing she's good for, she's already seen a good amount of nerfs to the point people don't even need to play her.
