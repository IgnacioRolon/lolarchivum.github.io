There are two reasons for this. First, it has totally failed to address her biggest issue (she can't use her power because she's been made so squishy that even creeps are tougher than her, so closing is insanely risky). Second though, it totally abandons her identity and attempts to homogenize her.\r\n\r\nI'd like to discuss the latter issue, as it's the bigger concern for me (numbers tweaks can happen after the rework anyways, but a total failure of kit is much more severe). This is from today's post going over the rework:\r\n>Instead of hanging back and winning a war of attrition during laning...\r\n\r\nTo me, this sums up the entire reason this rework has gone so badly. The team in charge completely abandoned Sona's identity. Sona [i]is/[i] the attrition support. She was initially released into a metagame that was heavy on poke, and her ability to provide incremental advantage to her team made her the strongest support in the meta in short order. This quickly established her identity, which remained mostly constant throughout all her nerfs (because lets be frank, about the only buff she has ever received was the secondary effects to power chord). The ability to provide sustained damage and health defined her, and it made her stronger the longer a fight went on. It also provided her inherent weakness, as she was significantly weaker than other supports in short fights because she needed multiple cycles of casts for her output to overcome theirs.\r\n\r\nIf we look at supports as a whole, this is relatively unique. Soraka is undisputedly the queen of burst healing. Taric focuses more on boosting armor than heals. Janna and Lulu provide powerful CC and shields to protect teammates. Compared to other healers though Sona is able to provide significantly more health in the long run at the cost of burst heals or clutch shields, and this was the main factor differentiating her from the field.\r\n\r\nHowever, with increased cooldowns, and an apparent focus on the clutch and burst, her identity is being completely abandoned in favor of homogenization. Of making just another Soraka. This is not a musician, a constant source of power. This is just another generic healer. It is, frankly, running away from difficulty. Rather than keep her identity and work to balance her, I feel that instead the team has chosen to take the easy way out, make her the same as everyone else, and shove it live. This of course, while completely ignoring the issues she's had as a result of previous balance changes, and in fact adding mechanics that require playing in ways those issues don't allow.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2014-07-30T02:04:19.665+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":3,"body":"The changes were a good concept, but the execution has been rather lackluster.  This being due to pussy-footing and fear of accidentally creating another Braum, Thresh, Morgana, etc.\n\nAs a whole, her passive has been nerfed with the increased CD's allowing it to trigger half as often as before.  Staccato was nerfed without trade-off.  Diminuendo and especially Tempo got indirect nerfs when her cooldowns became differed.  Hymn having the shortest cooldown means it'll be her song that is (not)active most often.  If she wishes to apply something other than Staccato, she will need to miss out on Hymn auto buffs as she waits.  Not ideal when you have a fraction of a second to peel for the ADC.\n\nHymn keeps its rank 1 damage, but is now weaker at each rank-up than before.  This can only be mitigated by being in queue and having vocal communication with the ADC.  Also only if they have long-range poke, like Caitlyn.  In teamfights, seeing as it no longer buffs teammate's spells, it's lost a lot of power short of having multiple auto-attack champs.  If the buff triggered off abilities, like Leona's passive, that'd be decent, perhaps for 1/3 damage on AOE, but it does not.  Even on a high AS/Crit champ, they still preferred Hymn's old passive as it gave higher dps and mages preferred actually benefiting from it at all.  Then, Hymn no longer gives any turret-pushing strength losing Sona the majority of her objective-taking potential.\n\nInversely, Aria is now weaker at every rank until 4 or 3 depending and costs considerably more mana regardless of already being mana inefficient.  The shield can only be applied once every several seconds for a very short duration, making it questionable if it's truly blocking more damage than a passive defensive buff would, especially the 3-second bonus defense of the original activation.  If it can't be applied to somebody that is currently taking damage, or immediately takes damage afterwards, then the answer is that it does not.\n\nWhere do I start on Celerity?  The base and scaling were increased, but this only makes up for not giving any passive movement, it's never off cooldown unless you save it for the perfect moment meaning zero margin for error.  The short burst duration makes it fairly useless for chasing, but it may give you just barely enough time for a disengage.  However, without the passive MS, Sona is now far less mobile and roaming capabilities are severely reduced.\n\nThe range on everything has been reduced to nearly 1/3 of what they used to be, Sona has to in the literal sense press her bosom against her teammates just to apply them, since they're practically melee and far lower than even Urgot's auto-attack range.  This isn't a problem for Hymn, the only player on your team that can make use of it will usually be the ADC anyways.  For Aria, Sona must venture into the front line and sacrifice herself or hope that an assassin jumps the back line so she can shield the ADC and look like she's being useful and not feeding.  Fortunately Celerity gives a larger speed boost to herself, because you'll rarely if ever give it to a teammate.  The idea of a \"snuggle zone\" is counter-intuitive as teams MUST maintain some distance to avoid making themselves vulnerable to powerful AOE like Nami, Orianna or Yasuo, just for example.\n\nDespite Sona's passive and all 3 abilities seeing substantial nerfs, she now has longer and differentiated cooldowns too, making 40% CD mandatory in 100% of her games.  Don't worry Sona, you'll have company with Olaf, GP and the immobile mages.  Perhaps if your new actives were just added instead of replacing your auras, you'd still be playable...  Assuming your numbers on Power Chord, Q and W as well as base stats weren't nerfed too.","replies":[{"poster":"Luner Hunter","date":"2014-07-30T02:10:56.855+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"bravo! i love you're deduction! every thing i'd like to say... in a much more... nice way of saying it...","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2014-07-30T02:58:11.429+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I joined LoL to play Sona.

I pretty much mained her in S3. However, saying that she has an equal amount of interaction as the champions you listed is just unfair. Name any champion that can stand mostly still in a bush and still help her allies. None of the champions you mentioned can do that. Of course a proper Sona does much more than just sit there, but the point still stands that she can press buttons occasionally and just give free stats for long durations.\n\n> how is sona supposed to stun the enemy backline, heal/speed up your frontline, or poke if she has to sit in the back because shes so weak? your basic concept of the new sona is get-out-of-jail-free-card for the back line if they mess up colossally.\n>\n\nSona always sat in the back, this hasn't changed. If you play Sona, or any support, you know that the \"get-out-of-jail-free-card\" is more challenging than it seems: basically I'm saying peeling is an important job. So important that, in LCS, they often dedicate other roles to assisting in this: Orianna and Lulu are a couple of champions that come to mind that fill this role. Furthermore, Sona still has tools to rush to the front and use her ult effectively. Her speed up has been increased, she now has a shield and even if that wasn't enough, flash still exists in this game.\n\nAre her new auras garbage? I haven't decided yet. But in all honesty, you don't seem to be giving this a fair shot.

Given that these auras don't tag enemies, I don't know if it's particularly useful. The aura range has been kept conservative compared to previous auras or item auras, but that allows for them to have a lot more impact/power. \n\n> Hymn gives ~50% less strength to your ADC, 100% less to most mages and probably some small percent less to the front line as well(assuming you can give it to them without dying)\n\nI'm really interested to see how you calculated this. Looking at level 9, Q aura previously gave each ally 20 AP/AD. It now grants 90 magic damage, not counting her AP ratio. Outside of Kog or Trist, who can actually use some of the AP, that takes 5 auto attacks to beat out the new Q, assuming Sona has 0 AP. Saying that the new Q bonus can't be used by mages or front liners is pretty situational. Plenty of our mid laners either have strong incentives to use autos, while admitted some will not. I'll fully admit that Anivia + Sona isn't as powerful. Sona having a more strategic place in game generally allows us to make her better at the things that she does. \n\n> \n> Aria heals less ranks 1 and 2, can become even ~3 and finally comes back at 4, shield duration is too short, debatable if stronger than +20 defense, but again won't benefit the front line unless you feed a kill\n\nThis ignores entirely the missing health scaling. Max heal on the ability is greatly increased over pre-update Sona \n\n> \n> Celerity has higher base and scaling, but without the passive MS breaks even for those 1.5 seconds, then falls off when it ends\n\nThis is only true for very limited segments of the game, and definitely not true for Sona herself. Because E grants %MS, this ability gets stronger as people start buy boots, upgrading them, etc. That being said, giving it power in cases of engaging and disengaging over roaming was intended.

Mind you I'm using highly conservative numbers, there are other X and Y variables to consider:\n\nHymn's max CD is more than 4 seconds, she'll apply a base of 110 at max ranks of both Q and R.  The old Hymn of course gave +20AD independent of CD at only max Q rank.  An ADC's AS will be greater than 1 AA/sec. with a 45%/55% crit chance.  We'll assume they can somehow only manage those 4 autos and that 2 are crits.  Thus:  (20 x 2) + (20 x 2 x 2.5) = 140 dmg/4 sec.  Sona will need 120 AP to merely match this very conservative calculation.  More realistically, these numbers will be double considering even higher AS, especially on BoRK ADC's, with the Frenzy mastery and other outside buffs like Nunu or Censer.  With the giant nerf to FQC and the large buff to Talisman, that's yet another 50 AP she will need to find elsewhere to compensate.\n\nOn a final note, you say I'm ignoring the % scaling on Aria, but it's the opposite.  It's the only reason the new Aria can sometimes match the old by rank 3 and why I stated as such.  Else-wise, it would always fall behind until the 4th.","replies":[{"poster":"Fearless","date":"2014-07-31T03:22:55.289+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":13,"body":"So 45% crit is going to require 2 crit items, which is often waaaaay farther than level 9, probably much more likely later into mid teens.
