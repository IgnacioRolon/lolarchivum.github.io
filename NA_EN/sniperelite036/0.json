Also, mute the offenders if they refuse to stop acting up rather than join in on the insult-fest.

It's okay to chat about other stuff but if you feel that you can't do that without acting up then just stick to gameplay only.\n* Don't call for reports ever since not only is it considered harassment and bullying (i.e. threatening someone with a report to try to get your way) but it also only takes just one report to trigger a game for review as well.\n* If someone refuses to act up then just mute them rather than join in on the rage-fest. Doing that ensures that only they get punished rather than the both of you.\n* Think before you type/send: if it's not helpful or constructive then don't press Enter.\n\nMy Overall Verdict on this case: Punish.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-29T19:19:46.531+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post your complete unedited chat logs and I or someone else can review it and tell you what got you restricted.
