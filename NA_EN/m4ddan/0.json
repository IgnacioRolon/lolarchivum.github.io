If i enable Vsync from it ... don't change nothing. \n\nps: sorry if my english suck :P","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-28T15:53:55.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not aware of any known issues with Nvidia GPU's and FPS instabilities.

(i ve already show it at the support, if someone has watched this but u already know their useless answer -.-) \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmokp5Jb-RI&feature=youtu.be&t=44\n\nHe set VSYNC on at 0.44s and he have some frame skip from 0.50s until 1 min\n \nHe show the game too without vsync capped at 60 fps and some animations are not completely smooth but the frame skip problem being solved. (he explain all my same issues in the video pls watch it and tell me ur opinion about this issue :D)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"M4dDan","date":"2016-07-28T18:27:33.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed today while frame skip happened my fps raise to 63  with vsync enabled that can mean something? \nI never saw that in other games, with vsync i stay always at 59/60 fps never goes over 60.\n\ni can try rollback divers but i think will not solve nothing :D atm i have the very latest driver 368.81","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nausicäa ","date":"2016-07-27T21:59:11.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You obviously dont understand how V-sync works.
