I'm usually connected to my local WiFi with a bandwith of 300 MBit/s, representing a MCS-Index of 15. This index can be shown on a Mac holding the alt-Key while pressing the WiFi Button located at the status bar of the Mac. I realised that when I'm disconnecting myself from the local area, accessing internet by mobile hotspot, my MCS-Index fell below equal 7, resulting in a connection to the internet via only one stream. Every time my connection reduced to a single stream, my League client could connect successfully to the home screen of the launcher. This may also explain the randomness of time needed to reconnect after launching the game with more than a single stream. I set up the hotspot where I'm connecting to with my Mac usually by my iPhone, only the last time I connected with a expending WiFi hotspot by Windows. The hotspot set up by WIndows had been connected to the same WiFi I'd usually been connecting to with my Mac, so it's definitly not a error on local network side. While my Windows hotspot was strong enough to open two streams, I couldn't connect without the 'Trying to reconnect...' message. Only when it dropped down to one stream, I could connect successfully.\nFor more information about the Streams and the MCS-Index see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009#Data_rates\nReducing the MCS-Index can be archived by lowering the signal strengh, e.g. through body-blocking.","replies":[{"poster":"Mischa1610","date":"2017-10-06T21:52:39.695+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, you are insane.
