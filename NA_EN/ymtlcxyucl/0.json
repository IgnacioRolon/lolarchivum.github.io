The client works completely fine until this point.   As soon as the timer hits zero and the game is supposed to open all I get is the client with a reconnect button that does nothing when I click it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-27T23:33:35.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having a really hard time getting a connection with the game server you were supposed to play on.

I despise wifi because of how unstable it is.  I was trying to play a normal draft game before when this happened. I later tried an ARAM and it worked so I'm gonna try draft again and see if it happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-28T02:03:38.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm that is a little odd that ARAM ran alright while draft doesn't. That almost makes me think that some of the files associated with Summoners Rift might be damaged, but I wouldn't want to steer you wrong. Let's get you some more in-depth help from our tech guys.
