But this is something I feel strongly about. \r\n\r\n**Jungle Changes, Why?**\r\n\r\n          We have now been forced into a meta that very early requires Skirmishes from your laners to help your JG contest Scuddle Crabs. Riots implemented jungle changes were designated to target laning phase be more about laners, and less about the Jungler. This change has had quite the opposite effect, through the games I have played since the change I would say 70% of them have had 2:30 skirmishes in the river between Bot/JG/Mid to contest the scuddle crab to help their jungle get that EVER-SO-SLIGHT exp jump to help them hit 3 faster. \r\n            \r\nIn the event your laners can NOT come to help you, you are forced to give up and scurry back into your jungle due to lane priority, yeah maybe you can get a cheeky smite, but thats not the point. You are now more reliant than ever on having your laners force priority so that they can help you if need be, causing an early game frenzy in which ive never seen in my 4 years of playing. \r\n\r\n**So whats the meta?**\r\n\r\n       The meta has now been **FORCED** into bully junglers that CAN contest and output high amounts of damage at level 2 these are your Lee Sins, Warwicks, Graves, Elise, Etc. the list goes on.\r\n      You now have next to no influence on laners making mistakes early game, because you are reliant on THEM for help to keep you even relevant. These games often feel like the match is decided in the first 3-5 minutes, based on if your laner died to the opposing laner or they were able to shove priorty for any form of contest.\r\n\r\n            **Smite on Mid Laners?** - Maybe this is a Low plat/High Gold thing, but MID LANERS are now taking smite, and with the warding change -always having visible access to when you are going to go for a scuddle crab, or your buff. How is this healthy for the current state of the game? Mid laners who take smite are now running around for free putting Junglers even FURTHER behind for winning their lane and constantly having priority.\r\n                \r\n            **Once Behind its good game** At lower elos, this probably isnt as big of an issue, the Jungler falling behind. People make mistakes and throw all the time. But any competent Jungler knows, once you have the lead the opposing Jungler is at a major disadvantage. If you as the Jungler have the advantage, it was more than likely because your laner won their lane and was able to help you contest, and that snowball will continue and be easier to push with the enemy laner behind, and the enemy Jungler FAR behind.\r\n\r\n**My current experiences**\r\n\r\nToday, out of the 9  games I have played, 3 of them the enemy JG afked. But, _Why?_ The enemy was put into such a disadvantage it wasn&#039;t even worth playing the game, and as a JG main, I genuinely felt bad for them. With the nerfed EXP rates and you now being 0-2 because MY mid laner took smite, and had lane priority, they were level 2 when i was level 4. And I abused this to the degree they had no influence on the game whatsoever. This is a type of play style that should not even exist. Where you are forced into a powerless situation because a DIFFERENT role lost.\r\n          Did Jungle need to be nerfed? In my personal opinion, No. Jungling is a huge part of this game, and always has been. Its a role for a reason, and a very important one. You are now required to be babysat by your laners, and trust me you better hope they aren&#039;t a **_Toxic_** personality because you&#039;ll be in for some _CRISP_ gameplay .\r\n\r\n Whatever riot did, they did for a reason, but it was poorly tested, and we will now see an ever-so-wonky 2-3 minutes in most games, wITh 2v2s, 4v4s going on based around a SCUDDLE CRAB. We are now left with a position that is not influential or that has meaning in the game.\r\n\r\n        While playing, I felt both sides of the spectrum, I was disgustingly ahead, and Horribly behind. The games I was behind were because my mid laner did NOT have smite, so there was a double smite to contest while in my own jungle, and looking for objectives. This pains me to say, but even when i was ahead I **did not have fun playing these games**. And that is truly upsetting, as I have played jungle for the last 3.5 years, and it was the only role i really felt like I REALLY enjoyed. I will now be moving to mid lane, or stop playing altogether until things change again.\r\n\r\nI could complain about how upset I am that my beloved {{champion:106}} Volibear{{champion:106}} was relevant for such a short amount of time after 2 seasons of inactivity.. But I Digress, thats a post for another day.\r\n\r\n**This is not acceptable, and something needs to change.**","replies":[{"poster":"ForFoxSakes","date":"2018-05-17T21:14:45.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Mid laners taking smite sounds so stupid.

I feel the same way. I was doing fine in jungle until this patch came out. I found that certain junglers just cannot keep up and compete early game. They need a bit more time to build and now the bullies like WW take massive advantage of that and counter jungle you so you not only lose scuttle but your own jungle as well. I fell so far behind and I couldn't even remotely catch up which led to me being unable to gank anyone since they were 3-4 levels ahead of me. My laners absolutely REFUSED to help me in the slightest yet flamed me the whole time, their lanes ran around like a bunch of crazy crack heads and were helping the enemy jungler keep me shut down the whole time. It was incredibly frustrating. \n\nI'm mad about these changes because if you play in a lane and if you play SMART, then the jungler can't gank you at level 3 and it shouldn't be a problem... There was no point in kicking junglers into the dirt like this it was unnecessary. It's a jungler's sole purpose of existence to help their team's struggling lanes. Going in and assisting as necessary to give their team the advantage. They were supposed to be a solo role that farmed the jungle and went to aid their team as needed and get jungle objectives... Now it's the opposite. For some junglers their role has been reversed or they've been made completely void. Now I rely on my teammates to help me build by basically babysitting my jungle with me when I'm on their side. I don't have problems with all junglers, Xin Xhao, WW, Jax, Jarvan... They all seem to be adapting fairly well but some of the others that I enjoyed like Rammus just take too long to get anywhere now. \n\nIn essence, if you want to win jungle now you need to choose one of the few out of the limited amounts of jungle bullies available which takes away options and removes the fun aspect for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ratpie","date":"2018-05-18T04:45:51.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DingDongDanger,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=23EJtU2E,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2018-05-18T04:34:19.545+0000)\n\n> In essence, if you want to win jungle now you need to choose one of the few out of the limited amounts of jungle bullies available which takes away options and removes the fun aspect for me.\n\nI already feel like this was the case due to the rune changes, this only compounds it.

This jungle meta will be all about divers bc people are going to realize that contesting the shuttle is messy and unpredictable and are going to choose to set up dives at turrets instead of dealing with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Qiyeanu Reeves","date":"2018-05-18T00:12:08.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i liked s4 to s6 the most for jg, s7 was eh and this is just...its not fun cuz  a lot of my champ pool struggles vs whats meta.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ratpie","date":"2018-05-18T04:43:25.132+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Evalion,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=23EJtU2E,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-05-17T22:39:09.199+0000)\n>\n> Im slow clapping and smirking at this...

This bent over a lot of junglers, but those early duelers that were already making your lane hell? those are the ones that are more likely to get scuttle and be even further ahead and then rape you even harder.

AT LEAST NOW I have imput/control over if im getting spam ganked... NOW I take smite... and ensure that my jungler gets the lead... NOW I actually have influence over which jungle is going to get ahead... SO NO im not wrong... this patch is great. I actually quite enjoy being able to ensure my jungler gets ahead and by doing so ensure my lane isnt ganked.

You only gain a lvl advantage if you farm each crab successfully/ assuming teams help contest objective etc). Putting such a focus on something that doesn't enhance game experience doesn't make any sense to me. The speed and vision buff doesn't last long enough to have a meaningful impact on map control either. The idea seemed that in order to keep up Junglers would have to adapt and opt for ganking if they can't farm the scuttle. Its done the opposite though,  junglers are opting to play around that stupid scuttle than gank  fearing they'll fall farther behind if the opposing jungler managed to get ahead.  I've noticed people have a huge problem deciding which objective to prioritize. Even if the team knows....one jack ass always waits around for that stupid crab.......\n\nI'm normally not to unhappy about jungle changes but this shifts got me scratching my head. The reduction in jungle camp exp and gold makes farming back into the game impossible even if you manage to keep healthy clears up. This scuttle change is just a poorly thought out idea, by far the worst change riots ever tried to implement. They pay people salaries to figure out how to make the game better and the best thing they could come up with was give the scuttle extra exp and gold?...really?...damn bro you're really splitting atoms aren't Riot?\n\nOn the upside, ADC is a lot more fun. Laning is easier and you don't have to deal with the 4v1's in 4 minutes as often.

Picks like Morgana make it really easy to shove safely and then take Scuttler even without Smite... all while being pretty safe doing it.\n\nMid with Smite is probably objectively not better. It's just annoying. Although, I do think Scuttler's value is too high and maybe junglers should get compensated elsewhere. Scuttler is not a jungle objective as much as it is one for laners. You can't really do it yourself if any laners come. One idea is to make it walk a little farther from lanes so there is more cost for it.\n\nAnyway, it's still vastly better than their first idea of having an asymmetrical scuttler right at the start... that would be so artificial and it would dramatically constrain creative pathing/decision making as well as the jg pool. Right now I think the meta is being shaped and there are indicators but we shouldn't be too rash to judge. For example, I do like that intelligent pathing seems more rewarded now rather than just mindless spam ganking a tilted player.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ultra D1ckstink","date":"2018-05-17T17:12:13.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well said","replies":[]}]}
