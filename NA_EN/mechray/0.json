I guess that's just me but the IE pushes an advantage harder because it gives A lot more damage thanks to the crit chance, but the higher cost of the item and the survivabilty a BT gives you is definitely something to take into account.","replies":[{"poster":"mechray","date":"2013-12-13T02:10:38.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wat is ie  and bt","replies":[{"poster":"FearZer0","date":"2013-12-13T15:49:31.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Infinity Edge and BloodThirster","replies":[{"poster":"mechray","date":"2013-12-16T02:34:07.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh lol oh yeah lol thnx","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Psykiss","date":"2013-12-07T00:43:57.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im assuming you mean playing her ADC.\n\nPersonally I wouldn't get either during lane phase. The answer to your question is to get Shiv first. Its passive is strong early game and it has solid attack speed, and movement speed, and a decent crit chance. The thing is, IE gives 70 AD, which is exactly what Quinn needs, raw AD. But its passive bonus to Crit Strike is just a waste of gold if you have no other crit items. Basically its best to get your crit items before your IE. \n\nPersonal note about how i play quinn, you can play her so many different ways, but my favorite is to just get tons of AD early game. I rush Bloodthirstier, then get Ninja Tabi, then Last Whisper. Get Phantom Dancers as your 4th item and then IE. What you want to do is wait for Valor to mark the enemy ADC, then shoot them, and then vault and shoot them again. This combo can take over 2/3 of an enemies health with this build, and can even kill them in one go if you have even the slightest gold advantage. \n\nThis is still a totally personal way of playing her, and her kit is so variable that there's plenty other viable methods, but there is nothing more satisfying as killing a Caitlin before she even knew you attacked.","replies":[]}]}
