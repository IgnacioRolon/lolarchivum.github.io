The other half of the time:\r\n\r\n-Sometimes, I can open to the login screen where it says it needs to restore to an older version, then it fails to restore an older version, and it forces me to restart the client. It restarts and the same to messages appear, forcing me to restart again in infinite loop until I force-quit the application. \r\n\r\n-Sometimes, I am able to login, but then I get a blank home screen and a \"Trying to Reconnect...\" message. My connection is secure, I am sure of that, and I have seen this individual issue on other Riot Support threads. Someone on a different thread identified that it has something to do with the MCS index of my connection and how many streams are being accessed - some players are bypassing the issue by logging into the client while connected to their smartphone hot spot and then switching back to their normal connection. Unfortunately I can't even do this since my phone does not get service from my room, so I can't play LoL at all. \r\n\r\n-Sometimes, this \"Trying to Reconnect...\" message disappears after a while and I can play, but it happens randomly and I have to wait sometimes long periods of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese issues are very inconvenient. Rito pls fix your client or I'm about to uninstall :(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-20T03:20:31.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, the main issue here sounds like your network isn't able to get a strong enough connection to perform the repatch that it's trying to do. Let's make sure you can get a solid link with the authentication and matchmaking servers, then let's run a quick repair to make sure your client is working properly.\n\nFirst, check out the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) specifically for the steps on port forwarding and DNS settings. Once you've updated those two, open up the client settings and run a quick repair. Let me know if that helps by trying to login and test a custom or practice game.","replies":[]}]}
