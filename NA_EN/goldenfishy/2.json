(Able to actually carry games by peeling/engage)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"1. I watch the map for my entire team, not just my lane. Whenever my teammates ward, I will watch all of them and ping mid/jungle/top and my lane to back.\r\n\r\n2. Whenever I play adc, my support doesn't know wtf is peeling and goes all in people while I get jarvan'd and akali'd. When I support I will peel for BOTH my adc + my mid (map awareness op?).\r\n\r\n3. My teammates (civilians) hates me and gives me sht all game (no recognition for winning, but blamed if I die once) even though I secured most of the kills + saved all my teammates during teamfights.\r\n\r\nP.S. I'm Batman, the silent protector.","replies":[]}
