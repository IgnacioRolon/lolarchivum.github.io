My entire team ended up muting him and win 4v5 (he kept trying to \"ward\" and getting caught in the ENEMY territory). In the end he wasn't in half of the teamfights and we still won and ended up with 9-3 scores.\r\n\r\nBTW this in Gold 3 (smurfing), cuz I wanna take a break and play while eating lunch.\r\n\r\nI know there's b1tching in every tier, but I feel like the b1tching decreases the higher the tier. My main is Plat 4 and notice that people are more forgiving when they lose lane (not completely feed), compared to lower tiers (huge difference between division V and division I though).\r\n\r\nMan I can't even imagine the stuff people say in bronze since I've never been there but damn, it must be even more stressful.","replies":[]}
