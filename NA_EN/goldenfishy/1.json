I don't believe him and he wanted me to try playing on his account. I'm like \"fine, I'll prove to you that silvers is easy to carry\". \r\n\r\nGame one...I'm last pick.....guess I'm support. I made my adc fed as fuk and the enemy adc 0-6 and started to jungle instead. My mid/top/jungle getting sht on 0-10.... I'm like \"well since I got my adc fed, we can win late game\".....nope, silver adcs doesn't know wtf to do besides just run up to fizz to auto while everyone else is backing.\r\n\r\nGame two....everything is picked except top, so I went top. Bot/mid/jungle fed to oblivion. Our jungle khazix's (0-5) only kill is when he tries to \"gank\" top (my lane) when I was already about to kill the enemy top lane when khazix suddenly jumped in to ks. \r\n\r\nI'm a high gold/low plat player and I feel like there's hardly ever any \"close\" games in silvers/bronze. They're always hugely one sided, and that some silvers belong in Bronze 5 from what I've seen.","replies":[]}
