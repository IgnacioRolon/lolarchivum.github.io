Now the problem is there server status page doesn't actually check to see if the server is online or not.

If the server is down then they should change the damn status.  That page should be used for actually informing players when the server is not available at any time not just whenever they feel like telling us.  What I'm getting from what you said is basically they only change the status when they feel like it which is absolutely ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"Horayforcats","date":"2014-10-30T21:52:57.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that is actually exactly what i was saying.
