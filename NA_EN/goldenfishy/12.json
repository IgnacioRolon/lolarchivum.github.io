I feel like people should play with other people in the same tier and division.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"My friend's account is in Silver 1 and his MMR is currently at Gold 4. The problem is everytime he gets to promo, he needs to beat Gold 4 players in order to get himself to Gold V which don't make much sense...\r\n\r\nMy logic is this. If he beat Gold 4 players (3 games in promo), shouldn't he be even BETTER than them? So shouldn't he be in Gold 3 instead of Gold 5?\r\n\r\nThis always perplexes me. Doesn't it make more sense for him to be up against other Silver 1 players so the logic behind this is that he's BETTER than Silver 1? Therefore he should be in Gold V?\r\n\r\nIt's like some tennis player beat the world champion but only gets promoted to being 2nd seed.","replies":[]}
