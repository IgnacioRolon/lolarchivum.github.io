We&#039;ve had a very hard time finding players to fill these roles. Finding consistent players who are dedicated to improve is hard to find. We all have priorities in our life and playing league competitively is fun for us but we do take it seriously when we play competitively because we want to improve.\r\n\r\nFor Jungle Tryouts - First and foremost we&#039;ve gone through three Junglers in the past month, Mainly due to attitudes, Selfishly playing, Not cooperating with the team, not adaptive to learn new champions and overall just playing for them self. Due to the past Junglers our expectations and standards are high due to the past Junglers. We need someone we can rely on and someone who is willing to improve and play with the team.\r\n\r\nRequirements for Jungle - Must be vocal, have a decent mic, versatile champion pool, can play tanks or supportive jungles and have a fantastic attitude(would be nice).\r\n\r\nFor Support Tryouts - What we&#039;re looking for in a support is someone who can actually play the role. Sitting at bot randomly engaging, shielding and healing isn&#039;t supporting. We want someone who is vocal, can ward accordingly, someone who is confident in their role and has a vast champion pool in that role.\r\nNot contradicting myself when I say this but don&#039;t be afraid to shield, heal or engage as well. \r\n\r\nWe normally practice 3 Times a week, week days 8:30pm eastern and Sunday at 3pm eastern but will change once we have a new set roster.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re interested in trying out please add me in game &quot; MGN Xunio &quot; or message below, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"BimBIm","date":"2018-05-29T02:44:37.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jg main, added, ll graves ll","replies":[]},{"poster":"OtterGaming","date":"2018-05-29T02:27:42.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support main, added you in game. \"OtterGaming\"","replies":[]}]}
