I had a 770 before this new 1060(sitll have the same i5 2500k overclocked to 4.3ghz)  and I am now getting lower FPS then I was before.  To my knowledge I understand LoL is a more CPU intensive gave so I could understand if the fps remained what it was when I had the old card in, but am confused with a drop in FPS.  If anyone has any light to shed on the subject it would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"TehDiddy","date":"2016-08-20T17:18:10.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like an idiot but I did figure it out, while in game im over 200 fps as i thought I would be, i was testing it out as spectator and there im only getting 100","replies":[]},{"poster":"TehDiddy","date":"2016-08-18T23:39:46.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the newest Driver for this card.

Check through there for things, like recording software and stuff.\nAlso, disable recording through the Windows 10 Game Bar (if you're on W10). I've seen that cause FPS issues in games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-18T20:40:35.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your drop in frames could be due to outdated drivers, which is certainly a possibility with a hot new graphics card!
