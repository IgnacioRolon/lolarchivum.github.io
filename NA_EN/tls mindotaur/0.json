Riot Support helped and then banned me.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My account was hacked a few weeks ago. I wasn't aware of it until I saw a PayPal alert showing several charges coming from Riot. I couldn't get access to my account and PayPal wouldn't allow me to block the charges since they already went through.\r\nFast forward one week later, Riot Support finally gets back to me and I regain access to my account. I see that PayPal has refunded all the charges and all is well again. The weekend goes by and today I get another alert from PayPal regarding the $100 charge again! I check my email and see that Riot has banned my account for \"use of malicious 3rd party programs or modifications to your League of Legends client.\"\r\nHas anyone dealt with this before? It is beyond frustrating when there's over one hundred dollars in fraud involved and I have absolutely no means to reach support over the phone. I've been hit with an overdraft fee (just pulled a bunch out of my savings to purchase a laptop) and this is just adding to my headache and frustration with Riot.\r\nIf anyone has any recommendations on how to expedite this, please let me know.\r\n\r\nTicket number #23812802","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-02T15:46:02.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Due to the sensitive nature of your issue and preservation of privacy, there's not much I can do here on the boards.
