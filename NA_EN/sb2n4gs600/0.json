I would prefer you to have mained mid for quite sometime. I don't want you forced into mid to where you are not comfortable. I would also like for you to have a wide variety for champions to play not just a single champ that you are very strong with. I'd like you to have knowledge about the game; ex. Where to ward, when to ward, awareness on whats going on around you.\n\n**Communication**\n\nIf this interests you and you feel like you fit one of the roles above, then you may add my in-game name: TES Basenji. After I get you added back, we would play a game or two. I use Skype the most, Teamspeak second, and I barely use Curse, but if needed I may use Curse.\nHAPPY GAMING WITH YOU\n","replies":[{"poster":"The Pear Tree","date":"2015-02-01T18:07:19.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Xypher000\nRank: Bronze \nRole desired (one role): MID\ntop 3 champs in desired lane pool:{{champion:105}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:127}} \nCurse?: yes \nWhy you should be on the team: skilled player looking for a team to play with dedicated mature and available \nwould you take criticism of your actions following a game?:\nTime available (time zone as well): 4pm -12 EST\nWould you be willing to work and adapt around a team strategy?: yes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Te4 Kettle","date":"2015-02-01T09:39:01.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to join you if possible, I've been a  mid main for most of my league career and have a wide champion pool, I've added you, hope to keep in touch","replies":[]},{"poster":"N l T E","date":"2015-02-01T08:27:59.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo, I'm interested, lemme give it a shot.
