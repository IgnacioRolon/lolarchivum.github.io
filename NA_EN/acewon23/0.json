Luckily, you generally won't see any penalty for not being able to connect to it, as no one would be able to. This situation typically happens when there's a hiccup with the game server reporting the results of the match and confirming it has finished. It shouldn't last longer than a few hours, but please let me know if you're still having this issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sharcall","date":"2016-08-21T05:27:06.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having this exact same issue, happened roughly 10 minutes ago. Client froze on \"Skip these Game Stats\", skipped the post game screen and tried to create a new one, got the error. \"You are still connected to a game, please restart your client\". Restarted client but it is now trying to reconnect to the game that is over, eventually it gives the \"Check your connection\" error, but there is no issue with the connection.","replies":[]}]}
