Shop wouldn't open, couldn't move, couldn't learn skills, couldn't type in chat, couldn't open options. My friend is having the exact same problem.

If so, this does actually sound quite a lot like packet loss. \n\nIf you don't mind, go ahead and run a traceroute using [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to the NA servers at 104.160.131.1 and post those results here so I can take a look at how the health of your connection is faring when it leaves your network.","replies":[{"poster":"twinfyre","date":"2018-01-19T02:57:06.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm about to lose a ranked game because of this bug.

It's every player's responsibility to ensure they can play without interruptions or technical problems, both for their sake and their teams! \n\nPlease be sure to try that traceroute, otherwise, it'll be hard for us to narrow down the main problem and give appropriate steps to help you out!","replies":[{"poster":"Aheshke","date":"2018-01-19T21:13:39.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm currently having the exact same thing happen to me and it has absolutely nothing to do with my internet.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CSPariah","date":"2018-02-28T22:28:36.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like the same problem I had, which is also being reported (in a different way) in other threads here.
