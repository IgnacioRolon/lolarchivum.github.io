He said he would bring an army.\n\n     Recently we&#039;ve seen the return of various memers such as Kitty Darkstar and RaptorKarr.  You may think that this is a coincidence but I assure you it is not.  Why would Lol Ergo Urgot go through the effort of training posters from the Miscellaneous boards to lead his armies, when he could use seasoned veterans.  He even brazenly declares he has the capabilities to hypnotize.   You were wondering where these memers disappeared to?  Well I posit that they were abducted and brainwashed by Lol Ergo Urgot to be used as tools to wage war on memes and games.  Kitty was gone for much longer as he had to perfect his techniques but now he can do it quickly.\n\nWhen raptor was asked if they were back:\n\n&gt; [{quoted}](name=RaptorKarr,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=0bKNn1Bz,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-06-27T23:19:26.635+0000)\n&gt;\n&gt; Well not entirely\n\nClearly an attempt to fight against the brainwashing and warn us\n\n     The boards have been made unstable by the recent wars (shipping or otherwise) and now they are ripe for takeover.  Other posters have displayed rebbelious intent towards LF and MM, two lords of the boards, in innocuous threads as seen here:\n****\n&gt; [{quoted}](name=Fritterz,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=EGjt7agy,comment-id=0030000000000000,timestamp=2016-07-08T16:53:07.501+0000)\n&gt;\n&gt; The same thing we do every tomoro Blazoir, try to take over Memes and Games.\n\nand then\n\n&gt; [{quoted}](name=Blazoir,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=EGjt7agy,comment-id=00300000000000000000,timestamp=2016-07-08T16:54:39.956+0000)\n&gt;\n&gt; Got it. Our mission: Beat Laughing Fish and Malicious Metal with our super fun and easy riddle!\n&gt; right?\n\nThis war initiated by the self declared queen Airman Compsci has distracted everyone from a real danger.  Don&#039;t be like {{champion:22}}  and {{champion:113}} and get blindsided by {{champion:127}} Btw if this warning falls on deaf ears and the apocalypse comes I&#039;m hiding with the Brackern.  If you declare allegiance with the Brackern (no need to revoke any other allegiances) you can come too.\n\nhttps://boosteria.org/wp-content/uploads/skarner-play-styles-set-ups.jpg?noredirect","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-07-12T23:20:44.003+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excuse me, I'll just be hiding with Skarner and his kin.\nThey could use some company.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Squidsmastah","date":"2016-07-12T23:29:01.373+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you'll excuse me I'm just gonna go to Grimrail Depot...\n\nApparently they've got some technical difficulties with a new train they're working on...\n\nK just call me when the war is over bye!\n\nhttps://media4.giphy.com/media/Wjtqf63eB4AWQ/200.gif","replies":[{"poster":"The Aqualious","date":"2016-07-13T23:08:04.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"**GET OUT OF THAT FALLOUT SHELTER, THE WAR IS OVER**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DGArchitect","date":"2016-07-13T23:09:14.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there are wars and riots going on around the world\n\nyet you choose to devote your time to worrying about a forum war...","replies":[{"poster":"Darathdecimator","date":"2016-07-14T02:13:24.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an example of the [Fallacy of Relative Privation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#Red_herring_fallacies) and is quite frankly a bit irritating.  I mean the fact that you decided to come onto a games forums and tell this to me also makes it a tad hypocritical.\n\nThat being said, I appreciate your concern for global events and the less privileged.  It shows good global citizenship.  It simply is not really relevant in this setting.\n\nAlso, I haven't really devoted much time to this war, if anything in my post I make say I'm going to hide and wait it out.  And yeah, these Meme Wars have gotten out of hand which is why the majority of its participants have decided to end it.\n\nBut thank you for contributing your opinion. ^_^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dragon1xx","date":"2016-07-13T04:49:01.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Airman has an army already.
