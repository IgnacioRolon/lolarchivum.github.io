Now that that is out of the way:\n\nYou are an increadibly negative influence on your games. You aren't an over the top rager or feeder or anything like that, but once toxicity is introduced in your game you perpetuate it, making it worse.\n\nIn order to be banned for this you almost surely went up all of the tiers, which are a 10 game chat ban, a 25 game chat ban, a 14 day suspension, and then a permaban. Anything that can get you a chat restrict can get you permabanned eventually.\n\nAlso, how much you spent is not considered when punishing an account.","replies":[{"poster":"Platinum Hoe","date":"2016-10-05T05:26:20.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Lol I was not negative they started feeding,flaming and being toxic and i was doing nothing but defending myself and telling them how it is.

That last punishment you had was already considered your 2nd chance, and you still blew it.","replies":[{"poster":"Platinum Hoe","date":"2016-10-05T05:37:07.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"How do you know who i muted and who i didn't? the ban system is flawed when your team flames/trolls for a 40-50 min game and wont surrender of course i'm going to have something to say to them. i really don't care about the previous bans this one is bs.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2016-10-05T05:40:50.643+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"And remind me again how is your ranting would solve the case in any way? I get it, we all have bad games with teammates who we can consider as _\"trolls & dumbasses\"_, all you can do is just mute & report the players, or even trying to record the match & screenshot the chat logs & send to Riot Support personally. Your ranting only satisfied the trollers & do even more bad stuff just to see you suffer.\n\nAnd like I said, I still don't get why you would call the ban system \"flawed\" when you already got punished in the past while I myself have a hard time getting myself chat restricted at least once.","replies":[{"poster":"Platinum Hoe","date":"2016-10-05T05:45:16.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"You're irrelevant and probably have only played this game a year max. i have played since the start of s2 and know much more than you. go be a white knight somewhere else thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2016-10-05T05:49:42.279+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok, what's with the sudden AD Hominem in your comment?

In this moment you stand up for yourself (DEFENDING) and tell him he can fuck himself and go back in the trash can he belongs.\n\nThe manager of the restaurant will kick you both out since the rest of the customers want a nice atmosphere. And the Manager won't be interested who started since you both were fucking the situation up. Do that constantly and you go on the blacklist (perma ban) for that restaurant.\n\nWe are talking about a business here, this is not kindergarten and Nobody wants to see you spreading a even worse atmosphere. \n\nYOU SAID:\n\n> Platinum Hoe: im done muting u all gl i dont feel like getting banned rn\n\nand you didn't do it.
