Not to mention that they had traverse a desert and a mountain pass. By that time it is highly possible that the crop has withered or being targeted by bandits or something.\n\"his family's farm\" and \"Until one day when when the buyer was attack by robbers in his shop\"\nThey now have a shop? Interesting.\n\"like winning the lotto\"\nYou should be careful with real-life anecdotes. I highly doubt that Runeterra has invented lotto yet and thus he cannot have such feelings.\n\"castle\" and \"king\"\nThis sounds more like Demacia. Neither Noxus nor Bandle City have a royal family.\n\"During an inquiry on what happened at the shop 2 assassins attacked one throwing the other at the king.\"\nThat sentence could and should fill an entire paragraph all by itself. There is so much that happens in that sentence that I had to re-read it multiple times. It is really bad for the flow.\n\"Adan asked them where his father was\"\nHis father went missing? Did I missed something?\n\nAll in all the lore is very confusing. Not to mention that he felt love for Noxus while only selling crops to it and beating robbers.\n\n\n***\n**Stats**:\nStats seem to be fine at first glance.\n\n***\n**Abilities**:\n\n>**Innate - Sworn Duty**\n\n>Adan gains his assists in bonus gold for assist. Additionally Adan takes 6-23 reduced damage from basic attacks. Additionally, after being damaged by a basic attack, Adan gains 8-25 magic resist for 2 seconds. Being hit by another basic attack resets the magic resist buff's timer.\n\n>Actual Amounts:\n>Damage Reduction: 6/7/8/9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16/17/18/19/20/21/22/23.\n\n>Bonus Magic Resist: 8/9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16/17/18/19/20/21/22/23/24/25.\n\nBoth parts of the innate create 2 seperate problems which are generally bad in every case.\nFirstly, bonus gold on assists. Basically this means that you can buy 1 additional Health Potion after you gathered 8 assists. The first Ruby Crystal would require 28 assists. All this inherits the assumption that you dominate the game already. Other Champions like Twisted Fate gain 4 gold per minion kill. That solution is way more secure and stable over more games.\nHe gains Magic Resistance after being damaged by an auto-attack? Is there any plausible reason why he would do so? There aren't many champions which deal mainly magical damage and have to use an auto-attack before they unleash their burst on you. Not to mention that isn't really helpful at the designated bottom lane against the AD Carry.\n\n\n>**Q - Geographical Separation**\n\n>Adan jumps to a target area sending out a wave of rock that knocks enemy unit away ~300 units from himself and deals 20/30/40/50/60% total AP Physical damage and are stunned for 1 second. To any enemy unit that collides with any wall or structure are dealt 20/40/60/80/100 magic damage.\n\n>Notes: Geographical Seperation can be use to counter Knock ups.\n\n>Cost 80 Healths\n>Range 400\n>CD 22/20/18/16/14\n\n-missing jumping speed\n\nWhy does it scale with AP when it is clearly a physical action? Not to mention that the damage is minimalistic. Usually support champions, and to an extend tanks, doesn't really build any AP since most AP/Tank items are mostly high AP/low Def items which fit more with AP Carries.\nWhat should the note mean? That he's immune to knock ups? Or does he negate Zyra's Ultimate knock up? Or even that the knock up is placed on the caster?\n\n\n>**W - Tectonic Wall**\n\n>Adan causes a small earthquake that creates a lane width 200 wide impassable wall. The wall last for 2 seconds. Units that make contact with the wall are rooted to the wall for 1 second. When allied terrain spells are cast on the wall it emits a 5/7/9/ 11/13% enhanced aura (600) of the ability cast.\n\n>Notes: used like a Viktor's Death Ray. it takes 1 seconds before the wall appears. If Morgana were to cast Tormented Soil on the wall it would then emit an amplified version of Tormented Soil along the wall.\n\n>Cost: 80/85/90/95/100 Health\n>Range 800\n>CD 20 seconds\n\n- missing definition of contact (aura would be better)\n\nThere is way to much confusion within the description.\nFirst of all, \"terrain spells\" aren't exactly precise. My first thoughts were Bard's *Magical Journey*, abilities which interact with terrain like Vayne's *Condemn* or Poppy's *Heroic Charge* or abilities which create terrain like Anivia's *Crystallize*. All of these can be classified as \"terrain spells\". However you mean \"ground-targeted area of effect\" abilities.\nSecondly, what means \"5/7/9/ 11/13% enhanced aura (600)\"? That the spells deal 5-13% more damage? That their CC last that much longer? etc.? And the 600...? Does it mean that the spells are increased to that size? They also have to hit the wall to trigger this at all.\nFurthermore, why would I even want to level that ability? The health costs are going up and the enhanced whatever goes up by a very small amount. And that doesn't even affect all abilities. Not to mention that the duration is so short, the width so small and the cooldown so enormous that there is no use for anything aside being used in collaboration with the Q. \n\n\n>**E Master of Terrain**\n\n>Adan gains bonuses depending on which terrain he is currently on.\n\n>Plain: 5/7/9/11/13% increased Armor and Magic Resist whether Adan is standing still or moving.\n\n>Bush: stealth when standing still and gains tremor-sense ~1000/1200/1400/1600/1800 when moving\n\n>Water: 10/20/30/40/50 increased Health Regeneration per 5 seconds when standing still and 5/10/15/20/25% Movement Speed when moving\n\nI'll tell you what happens: nothing.\nFor most of the time the player won't do anything about this ability at all. They'll receive the bonus armor and magic resistance without doing anything and wouldn't even start to consider of going into a bush or the river. Aside that, is there another state aside moving and standing still?\nThe stealth from the bushes can only be used for juking and the tremor-sense is a cheap rip-off from Rek'Sai.\nWhat I want to say is that you can't choose where to fight. This is mostly decided by the enemies and the general situation. Thus these are just some passive boni which change based on the terrain you stand on. It just creates the illusion of interaction with the terrain and does nothing more than that.\n\n>Blight Shards\n>Adan stomps on the ground sending piercing shards into nearby (400) enemy units damaging them for 10/30/50/70/90 + 40% total AP. Enemy champions hit lose +5/7/10/13/15% Magic Resist & Armor for 3 seconds\n\n>or\n\n>Protection of the Land\n\n>All nearby allies (600) are healed for 90/120/150/180/210 50% total AP Healthand gains a shield equal to 6/7/8/9/10% of Adan's Max Health for 5 seconds.\n\n>Cost 70/75/80/85/90 Health\n>CD 20 seconds\n\n>Note: this works like TF's Pick a Card\n\n- Irregular Scaling (Blight Shards Armor and MR reduction)\n- missing information about triggering (\"on selection\" or after casting after the seletion)\n\nEver played Twisted Fate and picked the wrong card with *Pick a Card*? Possibly. And thus, I guess, you know the feeling you experience when that happens? Sure. Please remember that *Pick a Card* only has 6 seconds for the cooldown. Now imagine if you fail and have 20 seconds of cooldown on that ability.\nAside that there is only one thing left to say. While the type of ablities are the same (point-blank) the range and the effects and quite different. With the first part you deal some damage and reducing the armor and magic resistance while you shield and heal allies with the second part. This literally means that the champion has two completely different abilities sharing the same cooldown. And this is fairly bad. If we look at Twisted Fate (again) we see that he has only one ability in *Pick a Card*. However, upon using his ability he chooses which effect he want to apply as the on-hit effect.\nNot to mention that he Protection is far more superior than the Blight Shards.\n\n\n>**Ult - Devoted Defender:**\n\n>(Active) Adan leaps to target ally champion shielding them absorbing 100% of the damage they would receive for the next 4 seconds Adan can't cast abilities during this time. 50% of the damage impacts the health of Adan, and 50% is stored up to a maximum of 400/500/600 + 40% total AP damage (after this point Adan takes full damage). If Adan survives he heals himself for the damage stored near by Ally Champions (~400) are healed for half. Adan can't die during this time if Adan has dropped to 0 health then when the duration is over he sends out a shockwave (400) damaging enemies by 10/20/30% of damage absorbed past 0 health.\n\n>Cost:100/150/200 Health\n>Range 750\n>CD 60\n\nI'm still stumbling over \"If Adan survives\" and \"Adan can't die\". Is there any scenario where he cannot survive?\nAll in all this ability is just Kayle's *Intervention* modified. And the psychological effects are the same. \"Oh, there's an invulnerable shield. Let's switch the target.\" No enemy has any reason to attack the shielded target anymore and thus rendering the ability almost useless, especially all the additional effects.\n\n\n>**Items**\n\nI have a simple opinion about champion-only optional items: Nope.\nRengar had that exact problem. The basic problem is that you have to balance a champion with and without that item. And this is either too stupid or too time-consuming.","replies":[{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-03-06T03:43:47.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Made changes.

It is just a defender, a guy who protects. However his lore doesn't reflect any of this. There were some situations but that won't make him a defender by definition. Especially his earth powers aren't that representative in the lore as they could be. Imagine that his title would be \"Aden, the Earthen Wall\" or something. What images come to your mind?\nSecondly, the offensive power of all abilities are totally underwhelming while the defensive capacities are overpowered.\nThirdly, the cooldowns. I'm not sure what to say anyway. But the cooldowns are immensely high. For most times you will use W + Q for a 2 second single target snare/stun and E and R on demand. This means that 90% of the time in a fight you do nothing but auto-attacking. Auto-attacking and waiting for your cooldowns. And this isn't satisfying at all.\nA general problem of terrain based champions is that terrain doesn't have any special features. There are some occasions where some abilities interact with terrain but nothing more. Additionally abilities which change the terrain are an I/O button. Either the terrain exists or not. And creating linear terrain, like Anivia, causes many problems. In some areas, like the jungle, the terrain can block complete paths and seperate champions from each other. In other areas, like the lane or in the bases, the creation of terrain can become useless. The addition of a snare on contact doesn't change that much, since the area is so tiny.\nIt's only a mere advice I can and will give and I hope it helped you in a way.\n\nZanryu\n\n*If you liked it feel free to support my [Review Center](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/ocE63lHl-zanryus-review-center-4).*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-03-06T02:17:00.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Made some changes will change Ult when my phone quits messing up","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-03-05T02:03:16.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Made changes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-03-04T14:16:10.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Changed Innate","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-03-04T04:08:30.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Made changes","replies":[{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-03-04T05:18:59.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tamur,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=Iybn7OHF,comment-id=0075,timestamp=2015-03-04T04:08:30.349+0000)\n>\n> Made changes\n\n^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NullDragon","date":"2015-03-03T09:57:32.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buy a gadzillion health items + get 40% CDR.

As for the second reason, I already mentioned they'd respect him for his own strength but not for his actions. His actions don't really demonstrate his strength in Noxian terms, protecting others doesn't demonstrate strength to them, it demonstrates one's weakness. They are a bit Black and White in this area so even then they'd argue that if they themselves couldn't deal with the brother on their own then they wouldn't call themselves Noxian.","replies":[{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-01-30T19:15:41.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adan & Xcedros were once one.

I started looking around the boards and decided to give some thoughts to some of the champion designs I've found. I apologize in advance if I come out a bit rough and callous, I'm not exactly good at critiquing.\n\n\nI’m going to skip commenting on much of the lore, but mention that he doesn’t really strike me as Noxian in any sense of the term. Honestly as a defender of others Noxians wouldn't really support him. Noxian ideology is that the strength of individual matters. While they might respect his individual strength, the fact he is a ‘defender’ would not be respected in the least. The phrase \"They have no-one to look up to and they have no faith in Noxus\" Adan said \"I will restore their faith\". Would be responded to with the ideology that faith in Noxus is faith in one’s own strength, and Noxus doesn't care about those with no strength or no faith in their strength. After reading through Adan’s kit it seems to fit a more Ionian ideology of nurture those who seem weak for they can grow to be much more.\n\n\n*Adan, the Devoted Defender\nStats:\nHealth:442 (+102 per level)\nMana:215 (+35 per level)\nAttack Damage:45.03 (+3.62 per level)\nAttack Speed:0.625 (+2.125% per level)\nMovement Speed:330\nHealth Regen:7.25 (+0.85 per level)\nMana Regen:6.45 (+0.45 per level)\nArmor:18.5 (+3.5 per level)\nMagic Resist:30 (+1.25 per level)\nAttack Range 475 throws stones he creates from his hands\n*\n\nFew things, his base health is extremely low. He has a long range mage level of starting health. This in some sense balances out his health per level which is tied for largest with Alistar, but to be honest it thematically doesn’t make sense for a defender who has a Q which throws him into a fight. My final point is that a ranged defender is also thematically odd. The other champions we typically see as defenders are melees (Alistar, Leona, Taric). While I'm not saying this is essential to a defender of others, I'm saying thematically it makes a lot more sense. If he were to wear gloves of rock or something of that I could see him coming together thematically. At the moment it seems odd he's jumping around tanking damage and throwing rocks at people. Just a bit disjointed.\n\n*Innate - Blessing of the Shield Stone\nEvery 3rd ability Adan releases a burst of healing energy that heals an amount equal to 10 × Assists + 25% AP to nearby (600 centered on Adan) allies including himself Health & restores Adan's level% of the healing resource (mana, energy, rage & other resoures like Ammo).*\n \nI honestly love this passive. It is one of the abilities I argue feels Noxian at its core. In league of legends most Noxians have abilities that thrive off attaining kills (i.e. Darius ultimate, Katarina passive, Draven passive, Swain passive ) And much the same this is a snowballing ability. While I like the damage, health trade generated through this I think the resource trade is a bit over punishing and I don’t quite see the necessity of it.\n\n\n*Q - Geographical Separation\nAdan jumps to a target area sending out a wave of rock that knocks enemy unit away ~500 units from himself and deals 50/60/70/80/90% total AP Physical damage and are stunned for 1 second. To any enemy unit that collides with any wall or structure are dealt 80/125/170/215/260 magic damage and the stunned is increased by 1 second. For 4 seconds after Adan lands as he moves he deals 5/7/9/11/13% of his max HP as Magic damage to enemies in a ~50 unit per 150 points of Adan's Max Health..\nNotes: Geographical Seperation can be use to counter Knock ups.\nCost 80 Mana\nRange 600\nCD 22/20/18/16/14*\n\n*W - Tectonic Wall\nAdan causes a small earthquake that creates a lane width 200 wide impassable wall. The wall last for 2 seconds. Units that make contact with the wall are rooted to the wall for 1 second. When allied terrain spells are cast on the wall it emits a 5/7/9/ 11/13% enhanced aura (600) of the ability cast.\nNotes: used like a Viktor's Death Ray. it takes 1 seconds before the wall appears. If Morgana were to cast Tormented Soil on the wall it would then emit an amplified version of Tormented Soil along the wall.\nCost: 80/85/90/95/100 Mana\nRange 800\nCD 20 seconds*\n\nI’m going to discuss these two together as I see them as his main combo. My first point of discussion is how insanely safe this devastating combo is. He can raise a wall behind almost every marksman and initiate with Q without having to put himself in any kind of danger but receiving nearly 3 seconds of full CC for it. That’s not even counting all the damage from this combo. For perspective Leona Zenith Blade (E) into Shield of Daybreak (Q) has about 1.75 seconds of cc if her Zenith Blade is max range (875) and does 100 magic damage (plus 35 for each passive proc) at level 2. She trades all this for having to get into the fight without any forms of escaping. Furthermore I don’t thematically see why a ranged character will be jumping into a team or why a wall is going to amplify terrain spells. Another thing is if it is going to amplify terrain spells, why does it have nearly no synergy with the rest of his kit. I feel if he is going to jump into a fight, being a melee makes so much more sense. A counter argument might be gnar, but his ranged form jump is for kiting not engaging, shown by its double jump, and has no cc attached and then he has a jump when he’s melee, but it is strictly for engaging for his CC heavy kit. Overall I feel like his Q should be some form of terrain spell, perhaps a cone knock-up or a stagger, animation cancel with a short slight, slow, that can get amplified by his W.\n\n*E Master of Terrain\n(Passive) Adan gets bonus effects depending on which terrain he's standing.\nPlain: 5% increased Armor and Magic Resist.\nBush: stealth and gains tremor-sense ~1000\nWater: 10% increased Health Regeneration and 5% increased Movement Speed\n[Activate] \nStrength of the Land\nAll allied champions around Adan (400) gain +5/7/10/13/15% Armor & Magic Penetration for 3 seconds\nOR\n Protection of the Land\nAll nearby allies (600) gain immunity to the next knockback and knockup they are hit with and gains a shield equal to 12/14/16/18/20% of Adan's Max Health for 5 seconds.\nCost 70 Mana\nCD 17/15/13/11/9 seconds\nNote: this works like TF's Pick a Card*\n\nI honestly love this ability. I’m a huge fan of things that interact with the map and this is a good example. I feel that the Armor Pen is a bit overtuned in terms of range and strength. For example Taric Radiance (R ) has a range of 200 and gives units ~35 AD and AP. This ability, not on such a CD gives Half a LW or VS for allies. I think a better way to get a similar effect is to give enemies within a certain range a reduction in armor and magic resist. In this manner the enemy gets a certain amount of counterplay and thematically it means it is HIS land. Another note I think it'd be nice is that while his active is up his passive is down. My other concern is the brief interaction with other types of terrain such as Rek’sai tunnels, Anivia ultimate, braum ultimate, Teemo shrooms, ect.\n\n*R - Devoted Defender:\n(Active) Adan leaps to target ally champion shielding them absorbing 100% of the damage they would receive for the next 4 seconds. 50% of the damage impacts the health of Adan, and 50% is stored up to a maximum of 400/500/600 + 40%AP damage (after this point Adan takes full damage). If Adan survives he heals himself and nearby Ally Champions (~400) for the damage stored. Adan can't die during this time if Adan has dropped to 0 health then when the duration is over he sends out a shockwave (400) damaging enemies by 10/20/30% of that damage overkill.\nCost 100 Mana\nRange 750\nCD 60*\n\nI’ll briefly hit on the whole leaping not thematically sitting well with a ranged champion. I also want to briefly mention instead of referencing the damaging effect as 'damage overkill' perhaps its better worded as ‘damaged absorbed past 0 health’ for clarity. Otherwise I love the concept of this ability and how well it fits with his theme as a defending champion. The only thing I’d is the 60 second CD. I feel a scaling cooldown something more on the lines of 120/90/75 is mor appropriate. This ultimate does too much in a single teamfight for a 1 min cooldown and you want to give a bit of opportunity for the enemy to teamfight while this is on cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-01-30T17:23:43.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why does Noxus accept Adan 2 reasons.\n\n1 his utter devotion to Noxus (they can't believe it either(\n\n2 he is one of 2 people who has any real control over his \"brother\" http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/fG4ulwei-xcedros-the-deadly-blade-of-zuan\n\n>My other concern is the brief interaction with other types of terrain such as Rek’sai tunnels, Anivia ultimate, braum ultimate, Teemo shrooms, ect.\n\nWas tbis about W or E?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-01-30T02:43:43.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Made Changes","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpiceIsRight","date":"2015-01-28T15:28:20.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perfect!","replies":[{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-01-28T18:14:37.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Know any good rock jokes","replies":[]}]}]}
