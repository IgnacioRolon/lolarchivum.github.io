Thanks for the reviews\n\nTo be honest, Tamur, I've looked at all of your concepts at least 3 times and, I must say, there is room for improvement in all of them. Ability and kit-wise your  champions generally tend to be a bit too generic, but I think your main problem lies within the originality of your champions. \n\nBefore Vex was the Vanarus' Fury, I remember that she was known as the Saiyan Fury, and I'm pretty sure that's where a good amount of downvotes come from. People LOVE original and unorthodox concepts that could potentially bring something new to the pool of champions already in the game. This can also tie into the kits you create from here on out. Don't be afraid to take your time and really BRANCH OUT from the norm in order to produce something unique! Wow people with something they've never seen before and you're sure to get positive feedback. Just make sure that whatever originality you bring to the table is also BALANCED! The same can go for your lore and champion creation in general.\n\nI'm bad at reviews, but that's pretty much all I can think to say x.x\nYou might also want to work on strengthening your lore, but I don't really have any tips for that other than read more often(to obtain better knowledge of clichés and tropes) and study literary techniques you could incorporate into future champion concepts.\n\n**Btw...is Xcedros missing from the list?**","replies":[{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-08-10T13:42:08.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got hit hard for even mentioning Vex was Saiyans with things like “Why didn't you just make her part of WuKong tribe\"\n\nXcedros became Cel","replies":[{"poster":"Kamiroo Wolf","date":"2015-08-10T19:15:07.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tamur,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=Vw6oEkvm,comment-id=000700000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-10T13:42:08.334+0000)\n>\n> Xcedros became Cel\n\nMhm...I see...\n\nNo comment.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Urgot Update","date":"2015-07-28T04:45:16.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive seen these! thought they were really cool!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-07-16T02:17:49.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tamur,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=Vw6oEkvm,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-05-28T22:57:09.302+0000)\n>\n>WARNING long and can get longer\n\nHeh, that's what she said.","replies":[{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-07-16T02:30:11.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":":)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2018-10-10T00:55:51.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it's been quite some time since I posted anything new, but I just wanted to bump it for now","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ýones","date":"2017-04-15T15:39:46.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you should catergorize these champion concepts somehow, if someone wants to maybe find inspiration for a champion. \n\nThis might sound like I just want to advertise [my concept list](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/QZhEAM3t-my-champion-concept-list-post-reboot)  but to hell with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2016-11-06T17:04:09.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2016-10-14T00:54:40.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added more skin idea links","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2016-05-23T00:12:52.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Removed Joshua and Added Random Skin Ideas","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2016-02-15T00:27:37.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added Agent Lucian and Dominion Idea to tbe list.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-10-31T18:32:45.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"added Doom mode link","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-09-18T03:37:04.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added Opposing Skin Themes\nI will post Joshua sometime in the next couple of days","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-08-30T21:46:37.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added Lore vs Kit discussion","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-08-26T22:42:19.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added a few more links","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-07-27T06:16:48.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Removed Scorpion Queen Elise","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-07-16T01:33:12.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Added Scorpion Queen Elise","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-06-22T18:40:26.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-06-04T02:04:11.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Added Shin-Lu and Golden Nami","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-06-01T03:19:09.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bump","replies":[]}]}
