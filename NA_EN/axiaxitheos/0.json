I've never heard of the service pack prompt, especially on windows 10. First, I recommend ensuring your Windows 10 updates are all installed, in case the prompt was just a placeholder for asking you to update Windows. Additionally, I'd check [ensure your local network settings are compatible with League](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), since issues at this point are typically a network disconnection from the patching servers.\n\nIf this issue persists, please screenshot the error prompt and upload it on a hosting site so you can link it here. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
