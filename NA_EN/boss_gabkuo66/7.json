You should be able to resolve this by temporarily disabling any Firewalls or Antivirus programs, then heading into your installation directory for League (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends). From this directory, you'll want to delete the **LeagueClient.exe** file and then launch League from the **lol.launcher.admin.exe** file as admin (r-click, *run as administrator*) so you can attempt the Client upgrade again.\n\nLet me know if this fixed it! ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"ilpeppone","date":"2017-02-15T14:58:04.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty, It worked with me too, but i dont know why it didnt downloaded any file at first time, it just looked updated and gave the error about reinstall, when i tryed it with the admin mode, it went fine","replies":[]},{"poster":"boss gabkuo66","date":"2017-02-15T03:11:34.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you :)","replies":[]}]}]}
