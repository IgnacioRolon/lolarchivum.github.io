In fact, she is way better at it than Nunu because she can use the ult. to escape over walls and she farms/takes objectives a lot faster too. Moreover, she scales better than him and can actually snowball effectively (no pun intended). Unlike Yi, there&#039;s no point where she&#039;s actually really weak and most games aren&#039;t long enough for Yi&#039;s better scaling to outshine Shyvana&#039;s greater gold income. \n\nI really believe she is the most broken jungler outside of competitive play. She is also probably the only primarily Devourer jungler that I&#039;d expect would be viable at their level (even though she hasn&#039;t seen play). Elise and Nidalee are objectively stronger than her but at least they require a lot more skill to be used effectively. Threads like this usually get downvoted hard, but time will prove me right. I&#039;m not the type to get beaten by X jungler and then cry about how OP they are. She is currently the best performing jungler in Platinum+. While I don't think she's OP at the highest levels, I do think she needs power distribution tweaks to make her more manageable at lower levels or at least more skillful.","replies":[{"poster":"mogonk","date":"2016-03-07T22:22:54.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"shyvana counterjungles\n\nholy shit when did this happen\n\nstop the presses","replies":[{"poster":"ArlanKels","date":"2016-03-07T22:26:40.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mogonk,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IqEPMgdE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-03-07T22:22:54.759+0000)\n>\n> shyvana counterjungles\n> \n> holy shit when did this happen\n> \n> stop the presses\n\nThe OP was pointing out that Shyvana has a very fast clear, time, safe jungle clearing, has an extremely strong counter-jungle potential and at any point in the game she is \"Good\" to \"Great\".

She will also starve out the enemy jungle and likely get a large lead for her team early.

There's a ridiculous difference in how games go depending on how well the enemy's champions kite.\n\n Yes she revolves around counterjungling, but that's mainly earlier in the game, and getting objectives is mainly mid onward but that will very often start teamfights (which you will have to be there for) and they won't go as well if you are kited(if one or a combination of the champions that give her trouble are actually ahead, there is nothing you can do without them making a mistake or having \"pick\" champions on your team to lock them down/make the plays for you like naut, morg, blitz etc, because not only can they stop your splitpush, very often forcing splitpushes as a jungler will be more trouble than it is worth and hand a smart enemy free objectives). \n\nHer playstyle isn't mainly splitpushing because you can ONLY do it at certain points of the game like when baron/dragon isn't up, because you won't have teleport/presence ult to stop the enemy team from getting them for free.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"mogonk","date":"2016-03-07T22:29:11.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ArlanKels,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IqEPMgdE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-03-07T22:26:40.428+0000)\n>\n> The OP was pointing out that Shyvana has a very fast clear, time, safe jungle clearing, has an extremely strong counter-jungle potential and at any point in the game she is \"Good\" to \"Great\".
