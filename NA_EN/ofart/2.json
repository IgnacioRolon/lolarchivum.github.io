Corki counter picks, builds & stats have been analyzed from 13,175 games this week.","url":"https://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/diamond/plus/champion/Corki/Middle/","image":"http://cdn.lolalytics.com/image/generated/share/Corki.jpg"},"up_votes":34,"down_votes":17,"body":"PBE: Base AD nerfed from 63-59\nDo not underestimate such a change on a crit. ADC!\n\nAll Corki has is damage and most of it is short ranged as well as single target. His first few levels are already weak and he&#039;s quite item dependent. Unlike most mids, he contributes very little if behind. Anivia will still slow the enemy team, waveclear nearly instantly, manipulate terrain with her wall, stun enemies for picks, tank quite a bit of damage (her passive is great bait) etc.. Corki will merely throw some rockets while he remains at the mercy of his team (he requires a proper team comp. with peel and CC to be a good pick).\n\nCorki was far too weak before 7.22 and he isn&#039;t actually out of line now. He was scoring ~46.5% in Diamond+ for quite a few patches. Since his strengths are very overt, his power is often blown out of proportion, just like for Ryze. Picks that aren&#039;t out of line in DIamond+ are almost never too strong in competitive either. People are just cocky and love to oversimplify things. For example, Ryze performs awfull in SQ and the same is true for his Worlds performance. He&#039;s incredibly overrrated, just like Corki was when he was supposedly too strong. There is also competitive inertia to some picks due to player investment, historic power, safety, reliability, well-rehearsed team strategies involving the pick etc. Lee was absolutely awful compared to other junglers at Worlds and yet he still saw play.\n\nCorki is not over the top now in any ELO segment. As far as I&#039;m aware, there&#039;s no objective/data-driven justification for a nerf and mere opinions (even those of very strong players) need to be supported by practical evidence. The community very often bandwagons on who is supposedly strong or weak and that level of group think tends to create a huge gap between expectations/assessments and actual balance realities. I still see people banning Yasuo today and talking about him like he&#039;s god tier when he&#039;s barely average even among skilled players.\n\nIt boggles the mind that Corki would even be on the radar rather than Malzahar, who has dominated for over 6 months at every level despite having quite low skill requirements. Corki&#039;s Diamond+ winrate is 51.5% and his late game winrate is ~48-50% (which is pathetic for an ADC and goes against the very reasons to pick him). Raw single target DPS does not automatically make Corki great late game. Most team fights are decided by CC, picks, AoE spells etc. An Anivia may not burst one target very effectively like Corki can if others provide CC, but if she can use her CC+AoE on 2-3 players for a bit, it&#039;s often more impactful for winning the teamfight. I&#039;m not even suggesting that Anivia is necessarily OP but the point is that while Corki excels in 1v1 and small skirmishes, he tends to be much less useful in full teamfights. Corki is good late game in specific ways but he isn&#039;t dominant because he is very weak in other areas (AoE spells fall off hard, no CC, short range, somewhat squishy).\n\nIf Riot is indeed not trying to just rotate what&#039;s strong or define the meta, I need to understand the thought process here. Where is Corki&#039;s performance so out of line compared to other champions that there would be any merit for a nerf (especially one that affects him at all stages of the game)? I haven&#039;t even seen complaints about him and his banrate is basically nonexistent. I get that he benefited from the preseason changes but he wasn&#039;t the only one and doesn&#039;t seem to be anything out of the ordinary (indicating that he was overnerfed previously). You can&#039;t just suggest he might be sleeper OP on guesswork and then act upon it as if it&#039;s factual despite the evidence pointing to the contrary.\n\nCorki&#039;s not even the type of champion who can ever really qualify as &quot;sleeper&quot; because he has been around a long time and has a good amount of competitive exposure. His pick-rate is decent and he has many experienced mains with years of experience. Moreover, his kit isn&#039;t exactly subtle. His strengths and weaknesses are both quite clear. He&#039;s not a Sona with fantastic auras that players may not appreciate in game (invisible power) or an Ivern with creative and undervalued uses of bushes.\n\nHe&#039;s pure damage and champions of this type tend to be the most overrated because it&#039;s easier to see the overt power rather than also think about what they lack and what they needed to get there (including good attack-move mechanics and battlefield awareness as opposed to the meme of just &quot;right clicking&quot;). When Anivia walls off a team from a critical area or slows an important target allowing a pick for a teamfight, people feel more like they made a mistake/got outplayed rather than understanding that Anivia&#039;s kit allowed capitalization in that scenario while Corki would not (and that can be a pretty large EV difference). The same goes if Anivia walls off an area saving her entire team after a risky Baron. People don&#039;t cry OP for that as much as if they get bursted through raw single target DPS but in fact that wall may have had an even greater value in the game. If Corki, or another champion like him, played lane perfectly, got a CS lead in a bad matchup and is now at a huge powerspike in damage, people are much more likely to complain about his damage rather than the Anivia situation. However, Corki deserves his strength just as much in that case even if people may be more bothered by it. **The alternative would be to add additional power elsewhere if taking away some of his raw damage (maybe make his normal W have a slow effect). I would have no problem with a 63-59 AD nerf if for example, his W could slow on tick from 5-25% (based on rank). I&#039;d probably still prefer the AD over this situational effect on a skill maxed last but at least I&#039;d consider this fair.**\n\nBTW: His laning vs many picks feels much riskier now because Corki was one of the few mids running full MR glyphs instead of CDR/lvl. He also got mostly armor instead of base and scaling HP like the mids he faces.","replies":[{"poster":"Zane Zephyr","date":"2017-11-21T04:36:46.710+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can almost guarantee it's because since there's only base MR now his auto attacks hurt a little bit more than they probably should since they do half magic damage, which is why only his base AD is going down for now. \n\nPretty much knew it was going to happen as soon as I saw it get the buff it did.","replies":[{"poster":"LaughingStapler","date":"2017-11-21T04:42:29.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zane Zephyr,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=B5tB9GQH,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-21T04:36:46.710+0000)\n>\n> I can almost guarantee it&#x27;s because since there&#x27;s only base MR now his auto attacks hurt a little bit more than they probably should since they do half magic damage, which is why only his base AD is going down for now. \n> \n> Pretty much knew it was going to happen as soon as I saw it get the buff it did.\n\nHis autos were changed to do 80% magic damage. It's true that he got better but the question is whether this isn't a kneejerk nerf. Personally, I'm not at all concerned about Corki. He is quite predictable (even his Package is telegraphed) and he doesn't bully people in lane like he used to after his rework. In fact, he's a fairly timid laner now. Until they get Package, I don't see them try to do anything. Kat benefited a ton though and I'm genuinely terrified of facing a good one. She even has a great winrate in high ELO. I'm not sure what is doing it but she's scary as hell at all points of the game for me. Corki just seems to hover between very slightly OP to subpar and usually the needle points to subpar. He's virtually never reliably good for a long period, like you see with Fizz or Ori for example.","replies":[{"poster":"Zane Zephyr","date":"2017-11-21T05:17:07.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean 80%, apologies, and as I said I don't think it's a sudden \"lets wreck corki\" nerf but moreso just slight toning down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-11-21T07:44:55.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":">and he doesn't bully people in lane like he used to after his rework.\n\nIncorrect. He's a lane bully because he's a ranged AD champion, so he can start D-blade, win AA trades and heal off creeps as he CSes. Assuming Corki is a playable mid he will always be a lane bully, same goes for any other ADC mid because they get favoured in early itemisation.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Not Surrendering","date":"2017-11-21T04:55:49.182+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"We're still looking at changes to Malzahar, but wanted to see how his keystones shook out (specifically how good he is with comet), as he is one of the best Aery users and so determining how much this would move him and what his next best options are. \n\nWith regards to Corki and other champs who deal primarily magic damage, but did not run magic pen marks, they just deal a lot more damage in this Preseason due to the lack of magic resist runes (Corki went up almost 5% at high MMR, which for context is essentially equivalent to increasing his Q ability by ~60 base damage).

I get that he's better than before but I don't see evidence that he's out of line (he was performing terribly in Diamond+ before 7.22) . I expect that Diamond+ is considered high MMR. Right now I'm getting these stats on lolalytics for Diamond+: 51.61% average winrate, 48.28% winrate past 40 minutes (late game is supposedly a plus for him but this appears to be a myth in practical play). \n\nI think the mistake being made is the assumption that he was just fine and balanced in 7.21 so a winrate increase is a bad thing. He had a 46.5% winrate in Diamond+ for several patches and he had a modest pick rate. He's also not the type of champion like Yasuo or Zed who just attracts a lot of players purely for some highlight reel plays. I think his prior AD nerf was due to competitive inertia and not so much because he deserved it. \n\nIf you really want to do this, what do you think about giving his W trail a slow that scales with levels as I explained in the post? Corki has very asymmetric strengths. He's pure damage with absolutely zero CC and most of it is single target too so he doesn't excel in all teamfight structures. Thus, for him to be decent, he needs to have a lot of damage, especially late game, or he's not worth picking at all. The problem is that all these asymmetric champion designs, as fun as they may be for players like me, inevitably can be frustrating to play against because their one strength tends to be magnified a lot in order to offset the fact that they're not well rounded. Corki doesn't get many complaints but others like him have in the past. People naturally remember painful encounters with a champion much more vividly. It's just how human memory works. The times they win and find a Corki useless and too late to hit his spikes, they'll just think that it's normal because they are so much better players etc. I've seen it in poke all the time. Every loss is the cards, every win is skill. :D\n\nI remember that AP Tristana was really hated by some players even though she actually was a pretty weak pick if you just avoided some basic mistakes. All she had was her 1 shot combo and if you itemized properly and didn't snowball her, she was a huge liability with no waveclear or real contribution but people just saw that potential or were scarred by some games where she popped off. Thus, they bandwagoned around the idea that she was OP. She was just a gimmick and I don't regret that she's gone but my point for Corki is that he also has nothing else besides his damage (Package too but that's not reliable or that frequent). \n\nThus, if you want to really reduce player pain due to his asymmetric strength, make him more well rounded at the cost of some damage. My idea for his W to have a scaling slow is an attempt at doing that. He probably still won't max W 2nd just for a small slow but it gives him a bit of indirect power, self-peel if they chase him etc. It's probably quite viable to lower his damage if he starts to have something like that. It doesn't have to be W but it has to be something and then you can nerf his damage. When so much of a champion's power budget is in one area, it's easy for people to think that champion is OP. Illaoi was similar because of her crazy ultimate damage. There were numerous threads about her and yet she didn't perform great overall.","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2017-11-21T06:25:44.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ofart,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=B5tB9GQH,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-11-21T05:26:38.738+0000)\n>\n> I get that he&#x27;s better than before but I don&#x27;t see evidence that he&#x27;s out of line (he was performing terribly in Diamond+ *before 7.22*).\n \nBut that's just it.

In fact, his ban rates have never even been high. What is high ranked for you? Diamond+ is pretty damn high (probably D4-D3 MMR average) and he's nothing special there. The idea that Diamond+ and Masters+ are such different environments that a champion is completely broken in one but not the other tends to be BS. We're not talking about Bronze vs Plat+ here. Diamond+ players are quite capable of utilizing a champion like Corki well. The difference isn't some super amazing mechanics or perfect CS ability. It's more about map play than anything else. \n\nLee Sin is also a poor example since he has a huge play rate and an irrational appeal to many players. His winrate is dragged down by a lot of really clueless Lees or even people with 100+ games on Lee but 43% winrates. Plus, even if you were right (and you're definitely not), if the champion can't even be in a balanced state for players in Diamond+, who is he for? If we're saying that he has to have awful winrates everywhere so he's balanced for top Challenger, that just doesn't add up. That means he'd need a rework. I don't think that's true though. Diamond+ is plenty representative and once Challenger winrates have large enough samples to be relevant, I doubt that Corki will be seen as a problem there either.

His Diamond+ winrate is lower than at lower tiers. That's actually the thing, a 5% winrate jump at high MMR is indeed insane but ONLY if that champion had a respectable winrate to begin with. You wouldn't see me making a big deal out of this if Corki was sitting at a 55% winrate in Diamond+. When you start at an abysmal 46.5% winrate in Diamond+, that 5% jump does not look impressive. 51.5% is fairly average and like I said before, his late game stats are also not overwhelming (48% winrate past 40 minutes). Besides, if players felt he was a problem, his Diamond+ banrate wouldn't be under 0.5%. Corki is often overrated at times when he's simply balanced and viable (due to the biases I outlined in the OP).

When talking about statistics, average is a range, not an exact number. 50% is absolutely average but anything between ~49-51% also falls on that spectrum. You also need to filter out a lot of random trash like Nasus and Gragas mid. Corki is average among the mid laners I consider viable, not the entire roster.\n \nThere are too many factors that go into winrates to be able to suggest that every champion who isn't exactly 50% winrate is somehow imbalanced. What's the pick-rate and what kinds of players are attracted to that champion? Is it primarily a counterpick or situational pick (champions should excel in their niches)? Do players of that champion tend to have more experience than average? Is the meta especially favorable to that champion? Are people failing to counter said champion properly? etc.\n\nLet's look at some other super OP mids in Diamond+ with higher winrates than Corki:\n\nZilean 53.6%! A low pick-rate team oriented champion with a revive doing well in a more assassin meta! Where's the nerf hammer?\nXerath 53%! A sniper excelling in squishy metas is doing great and even with a higher pick rate than Corki!\nMorgana 51.7%! Better nerf now!\nTF 52.8%! Will this champion ever perform badly?\nHeimerdinger 52.6% Holy shit!\nAurelion Sol 52.2% Always needs more nerfs!\nAnivia 52.2%! Ice cold man...\nPantheon 52%! This super mechanically challenging pick is outperforming Corki by nearly 1%!\n\nand let's not forget the runner-ups with ~51% winrate too and clearly in need of nerfs like Corki:\nZiggs 51.4%!

He was incredible prior to his rework and just as strong. I had a wide range of success vs plats, diamonds, challengers using him in solo, rank 5's team over the years. What is really disappointing is how many champions have been changed and lost their identity in the process. While malz has mostly retained most of what he was many others have not. Unfortunately when champions like Ryze needed to be reworked like 3-6 times since before season 1 people like me begin to lose interest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saggitairre","date":"2017-11-21T19:24:59.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PhRoXz0n,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=B5tB9GQH,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-11-21T04:55:49.182+0000)\n>\n> We&#x27;re still looking at changes to Malzahar, but wanted to see how his keystones shook out (specifically how good he is with comet), as he is one of the best Aery users and so determining how much this would move him and what his next best options are. \n> \n> With regards to Corki and other champs who deal primarily magic damage, but did not run magic pen marks, they just deal a lot more damage in this Preseason due to the lack of magic resist runes (Corki went up almost 5% at high MMR, which for context is essentially equivalent to increasing his Q ability by ~60 base damage). Leona is another one in this category and also got an additional damage source from aftershock.\n\nSo just out of curiosity, why do we not try to balance by giving some champs a bit more base MR then?  My problem with the current rune system is that damage champs get benefits from runes right from the start.  I have always liked to play tanky supports and divers like Leona or Alistar.  I have to wait a full 10 minutes to get the benefits from the Conditioning rune.  I think it would help some if those stats were given out at the start of the game, instead of 10 minutes in.  Currently 10 minutes is half a game.\n\nIs  there a reason for that 10 minute wait on Conditioning?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YambrinZ","date":"2017-11-21T11:27:19.774+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Corki is an adc that goes mid though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bob the Toastr","date":"2017-11-21T06:29:03.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of his damage is single target?

Corki builds as an ADC and outside of the early game, his primary source of damage is his autos. The longer the game goes, the less damage your abilities do by comparrison. In fact, using Q in a fight late game is often a mistake because the time it takes lowers your DPS compared to just autoing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Japan","date":"2017-11-21T06:38:34.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"His roaming is extremely good and his burst is rediculous.

WW is also doing much better without Sejuani and Zac running around (or being much weaker). He too is great vs squishy comps. However, I don't think WW is OP just because he has a favorable meta (probably not even good in Masters+). The same goes for Corki.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2017-11-22T01:43:33.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You say {{champion:42}} is single target but everyone of his abilities is AoE, sure his main source of damage is his {{item:3078}} auto attacks but he still has a pretty decent amount of aoe, more than a lot of champions.

If you were referring to their \"point and click burst\" Anivia's is reliant on using another ability like her annoying to land Q or fully grown Ultimate while Corki just has to be in range of a target and auto attack them after throwing out a charge of his ultimate.
