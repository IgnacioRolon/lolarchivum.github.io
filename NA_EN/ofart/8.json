So far 4 this year and we have more coming.\n\nI totally disagree with the previous poster who was disappointed by 4 champions per year. 4 is already a lot and a balance nightmare given the large existing roster (Riot has done a good job though).  It isn&#039;t sustainable and will make the game unworkable from a balance perspective if it persists. It&#039;s already impossible for Riot to test and balance every comp. permutation. It becomes exponentially harder as you add more champions. \n\nAlso, what exactly is the need for more champions when there is so much of the roster left unviable for higher level play? If the whole roster was equally viable, that would be like adding 25 more champions in one stroke. Consider more champions like adding new ingredients to a dish. Having just a few ingredients may be too bland but if you continue adding more and more, it eventually becomes an unrecognizable culinary mess and is made worse by each new addition.\n\nPeople who want many more champions are myopic and not thinking about the game&#039;s long-term health - at least if you want it to be a competitive endeavor and not a joke like NeoPets. Personally, I&#039;m only interested in a competitive game and self-improvement. In fact, that&#039;s why I hated the idea of DQ (where some guys play with 4 friends and get the same rank as a solo player despite different skillsets). If I don&#039;t consider this a balanced and stable game which lets me isolate my own performance, I wouldn&#039;t play it anymore. \n\nI already played it far less this season and part of it is DQ but the other is that I can&#039;t accurately assess improvement when the game is so incredibly unstable. Way too many core game elements are changed every few months. One&#039;s performance 5 patches ago may have little correlation to current performance. Of course, this matters in a much more serious way for pro-teams and pro-gamers but I think everyone wants to feel that their mastery is growing in a non-artificial way when investing a lot of time in an activity. I've even started some guides a few months ago and worked on them every week or two only to eventually give up because I basically had to rewrite them after 2 months due to how much the game changed. I value games like chess or poker where there is incredible complexity/room for growth but also a stable ruleset so that your improvement doesn&#039;t get erased every year. \n","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2016-09-14T19:47:56.101+0000","up_votes":69,"down_votes":8,"body":"I definitely agree with your core argument that more is not better.

Just compare any 2010-2012 champion kit to a 2013+ champion. Kits or lore are much more complex and also more coherent. Look at champs like Zyra and Ahri, those were huge releases that worked well, but they didn't happen often... Now every champion is a big release and is unique to the game.

You change this game every two weeks, and my friends with kids already can't keep up with the changes, picking up games that fit into shorter play sessions for now.

Though I would appreciate and value your opinions/feelings on these types of directions.\n\nThanks for taking the time to respond to the community.\n\nI've noticed the trend in champion releases. It makes sense for a more mature game and not just in terms of balance. New champions today are way more involved and tend to occupy a better-defined niche than LoL's first 50 champions. Riot's design philosophy is also more refined and new champions may need to meet game health criteria that didn't exist then. As much as some people desire, it's unrealistic for Riot to pump out 20+ champions a year like back then while maintaining these standards and not harming the game long term or making balance woes insurmountable. At some point, it also becomes unwieldy for a beginner. My first 6 months playing this game was mostly just understanding what each champion did and how they functioned.\n\nI haven't pondered other balance solutions but I did suggest that [balancing around high-level play is logical and far more manageable than trying to tackle every segment.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/o8AXMUVu-why-riot-struggles-with-balance-response-to-riotcezium) I was making a more extreme argument there and I know the idea bothers many players but even if this was done, I don't think champion selection would be the limiting factor for players climbing in the lower ranks. Some games, like StarCraft, are balanced much more for high level play and it's not like it stopped me from getting Platinum. It wasn't even a concern and I just tried to improve. It's not entirely applicable to LoL because having 4 others on your team and varying levels of coordination among the tiers can shut down some strategies (which are factored in for balance) completely for low level play. Rek'Sai's tremor sense is probably 5x more important in Diamond than it is in Bronze because there's higher awareness and coordination in play making. Still, if this could work satisfactorily, it would save a lot of resources. \n\n___________________________________\n\nI'm not familiar with the original Dota but I don't like the idea of some champions being permanently excluded from competitive if that's the idea. Even if it wouldn't seem to matter for the average player, it's nice to know that your favorite champion may have his time in the spotlight someday and isn't just a \"noob champion.\"\n\nRotating sets of champions for ranked could make sense once League's roster becomes significantly bigger, although I think it might be too radical for most people. Imagine how mad OTPs would be when the one champion they play well is out of the rotation. Even regular players might be annoyed by not having access to some of their favorite champions for 2-3 months (more so if they bought a lot of skins and chromas or got level 7 mastery). People are more attached to LoL champions than card game characters and also have to invest way more to become good at them mechanically as well as strategically. It could be an option for LCS but again, it might alienate viewers to know that the pros are playing a different game than them. While it would allow Riot to make that segment of the roster really balanced (perhaps seeing new strategies too) and would make ranked more friendly for novices, I think too much is sacrificed or at least players aren't ready for it.\n\nI definitely like the idea that each champion picked would be cut out of the pool in a series. While it might put an unusually high emphasis on early drafting, it would also force pro teams to have deeper champion pools and play something more similar to the game we play in ranked (where there are more random picks). When there are more diverse picks, there are more diverse strategies too since each champion tends to have a niche/comp where they really excel. It'd be way more interesting to watch and encourage regular players to buy more champions when they see a lot of the roster used. \n\nI'd expect more interest in the pro scene as diversity increases and this can bring more money for pro teams as well. It would also change how players are recruited and valued. The emphasis would shift to more well-rounded players rather than \"Elise, Nidalee, & Rek'Sai God\" etc.. In turn, this would make streams for ambitious or already pro players more exciting because they'd have to practice a larger pool. Moreover, needing more breadth would be a big boon to veterans who have more experience from different seasons and metas when the staple picks were entirely different. Increasing the value of experience would extend the career of the average pro and I think we can all agree that pro gamer careers tend to be too short. Sometimes this dissuades even very skilled players from attempting it.  \n\nFavoring more breadth over depth would mitigate visible balance problems too. Knowing that they can't rely on just a handful of picks and strategies, pro teams wouldn't be able to specialize as heavily so even if a champion like Azir were OP, it wouldn't be exploited as hard against the rest of the roster. It would simply be too risky to devote that much time to a single champion when it can only be used one game (they'd probably need to win 80% to justify the weakness in later drafts). \n\nMy initial concern was that the roster might still be too small to support this. Suppose that they pick or ban ADCs and by the deciding game, one team first picks the last remaining ADC. Now, the other team might be at quite a compositional disadvantage if they go Yasuo or some APC bot. Is this really a realistic issue though? Banning out an entire class will leave many other strong picks up and wouldn't make that much sense. Moreover, bans can be changed in some way to prevent this (for example, not allowing more than x bans from a primary class). With 5 bans, if each team were to ban only ADCs in the last game, there would only be Kennen, Morde (sort of) and Urgot left. With 3 bans, there's no issue and I don't think this is a realistic scenario (nor is it the end of the world). \n\nAlthough I know promo series are good to give a sharper sense of progress, they're a bit artificial and implementing this idea for them too would encourage the same things mentioned before. OTPs would suffer a bit and players would be rewarded for being more well-rounded. Ultimately, it's more fun to have variety but there's a sense that you're taking away from your ability to win. This idea would nudge players into expanding their roster without feeling guilty about sacrificing immediate progress. I guess the main downside is that new playrs would need a larger roster for ranked (with the upside being that this would also apply to smurfs).\n\nI doubt you guys are planning this for next season but I'd very much like to see it and I think it would be good for pretty much everyone. Sometimes competitive diversity isn't what it should be not only due to viability but just because there's not enough advantage to it and there's a certain inertia to the picks proven successful. If you've practiced 5-6 generalist mids extremely well, why bother investing a lot of time becoming good at another equally viable mid? You can't really be banned out and is surprise value enough to justify a champion you're less skilled in? Now there's a reason for more exploration.\n\nbtw: I had no intention of making this so long!

You&#x27;d just end up developing a tier system where rank S champs are picked game one, rank A champs game 2 and so on. \n> \n> You&#x27;d create a system where pick/bans are incredibly predictable as well, because if you&#x27;re Red and you ban a champ out game 1 it becomes imperative that that champ stays banned every game. If you ever let let that ban slip then you have to try to fight a god-like champion with a far lower tier champ.\n> \n> Of course you&#x27;d have no reason to let bans slip as Red side at least. There&#x27;s no need for reactive bans. If the enemy team pulls out their secret Heimerdinger jungle (yes this happened) that you have no idea how to counter you don&#x27;t have to worry about banning it. There are no reactive bans and with that a large amount of pick/ban strategy is lost. You lose value on unknown pocket picks because the enemy team doesn&#x27;t have to ban them out or risk losing to a pick they can&#x27;t play against. Sure it wins you a game, but currently unknown pocket picks can win you a series by forcing the enemy team to ban your random arse champ and play the rest of the series with a 1 ban disadvantage.\n> \n> Additionally you are giving blue team a huge advantage in game 2. Let&#x27;s say in game 1 {{champion:421}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:22}} and {{champion:60}} were banned out. These champs are valid picks in game 2. This means you create a scenario where blue team always wins the pick/ban phase.\n> \n> Blue always gets to chose from what ever left over S tiers there are. For example\n> \n> Blue bans {{champion:60}} \n> Red bans {{champion:421}} \n> Blue bans {{champion:41}} \n> Red bans {{champion:79}} \n> Blue bans {{champion:59}} (let&#x27;s say)\n> Red is now forced to ban a lower tier champ, we&#x27;ll say {{champion:126}} for argument.\n> Blue now gets to chose between {{champion:22}} and {{champion:150}} \n> \n> And if Red bans {{champion:22}} or {{champion:150}} then Blue gets the other uncontested. If this sounds familiar that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the scenario {{champion:82}} and {{champion:122}} were in during S5 worlds. Red lost bans because of their existence and as such were at an extreme disadvantage. This creates an extreme sum of pressure on Red side in the exact same way.\n> \n> This creates polarised games which are decided on a single pick. You end up with a game of &#x27;who carries harder, the Ashe who slipped or the Gnar who slipped&#x27; while the other 8 champions are relegated to supporting their vastly superior ally.\n> \n> This also means that in round robin group stages where teams play best of ones their champ pools are entirely different to the best of fives in the bracket stage. You can a theoretical team who is the absolute best a tier A,B,C and D champs but worse at tier S champs than the rest of their group. This team could be the best in the world in games 2-5, that doesn&#x27;t matter however because they aren&#x27;t the best at game 1, and the round robin is simply &#x27;play game one 6 times in a row&#x27;.\n> \n> This also changes the dynamics of regions who play Bo2 vs Bo3 in groups. Regions who play Bo3 have to know how to play tier S,A and B champs in groups while Bo2 regions only need tier S and A.\n> \n> Basically this sounds like a good, if somewhat cheesy idea until you actually think about the more in-depth ramifications this system would have on the game. Once you think about these effects it&#x27;s one of the worst things you could do to pro play.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
