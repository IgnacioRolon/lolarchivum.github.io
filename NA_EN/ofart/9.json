Everything in this game should have a time and a place to shine. These runes, along with many others such as Critical Damage lack a strategic niche. They are simply outclassed and I hope Riot will look to buff some of the most underused runes. Even a 10% buff on Hpen Quints would make me actually have to think when considering a rune page on some champions and I like that. I don&#039;t want to just mindlessly use the same cookie cutter runes with almost no strategic consideration.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-22T05:49:43.382+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're much more efficient than mixing armor and magic pen, if you ask me.

Nightblue3 said this so go ask him if you disagree. \n\nAlso, building damage is not good for many champs like jax and irelia because they just get bursted. In fact, you can only build tank items with little variation. \n\nGoing hecarim jungle or khazix top is less viable to due nerfs. Hec has to go top and kha has to go jung to be most effective. \n\nAnd what about spell vamp and energy per level runes? Lol. I regret buying spell vamp rune. So useless. \n\nBUT. On the other hand, it does save IP or RP (for rune pages) if you use the same runes. \nI'm just pointing out both sides. 10% buff could be interesting actually and other runes as well. But could lead to vladmir being OP and other runes such as flat magic pen or armor pen useless, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xengre","date":"2015-04-22T06:46:57.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"%HP runes need a buff, dead before even being released... how sad.\n\nI don't think Riot has recovered from the terror of full page Crit Dmg rune Shaco even though, now, they are absolutely worthless (sure would love a refund for those runes).\n\nHonestly, I see Hybrid Pen as niche but not valueless. If they were buffed even a little bit above their current stats I think they would crowd out a lot of rune options for some champs. You can also get Mpen off blues and the armor pen is pretty solid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ofart","date":"2015-07-17T09:08:51.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually considering these on Kog'Maw.

It is especially difficult with the having so many hybrid defensive choices.  Before you could see what the enemies were building defenses in and pump up the other stat to counter but now they are guaranteed to have both armor and MR so it's either build {{item:3135}} AND{{item:1043}} (making you either weak or squishy) or just be the guy that hopefully kills the adc (who will have GA {which is armor/MR} so you might kill them once but with all adc's having their own escapes and peelers even that can be impossible and you will NOT be able to kill them after the GA brings them back) or you just cost your team the game.\n\nYou've made enough duel defenses riot how about a duel offensive choice to balance the game out?","replies":[]},{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2015-04-22T16:02:35.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old post, but relevant:\nhttp://www.reignofgaming.net/blogs/a-different-view/diff-the-ender/23126-hybrid-penetration-marks-analysis-by-difftheender\n(I voted no)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Puri Puri Taric","date":"2015-04-22T11:04:08.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they are ok but then gp10s are the most op in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoMonku","date":"2015-04-22T08:42:29.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like to use them for my ARAM games when I roll a Fizz/Akali/Lulu.
