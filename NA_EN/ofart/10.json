Yes Sion's much stronger in top lane or the jungle, but as a non-traditional support, Sion is a beast, he crushes popular soloQ supports like Thresh, Leona, and Blitzcrank and can 1v1 most of the meta ADC's as well in the early-mid game. Even if he dies, he can throw on shields on his teammates as he beats the enemy down in his passive\n\nThe only flaw of Sion support is the same issue with all soloq supports...people get cocky when they're ahead, they throw games, and then blame it on the support, especially when the support is a non-traditional one.\n\nI mean I give a Jinx 6 kills in lane, then she goes 6/12 and blames me because I didn't feed her enough in lane...lol...","replies":[{"poster":"The Chain Warder","date":"2015-03-18T06:15:31.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Props to you man.
