It's WAY easier for him to be effective in a teamfight than a Kass who has to basically jump in. The mobility doesn't make him easier to play since he's melee. Viktor's natural range is worth more than all of Kassadin's mobility.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2016-11-05T13:07:01.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats just not true lol.
