Hopefully nothing that will disrupt his rotation during arcane mastery, and something that will still grant him some tools to help him keep opponents in range during the same.\n\nI think the OP is not saying that people have no right to complain without stats, but is a response to the fact that we just saw Ryze get 100% pick/ban in EU and NA LCS while the casters in both would not stop talking about how OP Ryze is. Following that, there was a flood of posts not just saying that Ryze needs a nerf, or his root up-time is too high, but that he needs to be disabled or hotfixed. These reactions need to be tempered with the fact that he has not been disruptive in solo queue and while his kit may need some adjusting, his overall power level is not out of hand.","replies":[{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-06-09T18:00:59.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LCS permabans ALWAYS get nerfed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZinniÃ¤","date":"2015-06-10T10:21:01.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't base your design decisions on the winrate of a champion anyway. Ryze has a poor winrate because he's, just like kassadin was, long to setup and most of the players who currently play Ryze are LCS watchers who still not understand Ryze is op only when he triggers his passive. (He's like an AP nasus atm. And how many Ryze I've seen rushing in teamfight w/o any stack of passive up..) \nHowever the champ has been horrific since his rework (5.9) and only a few players understood it. I am pretty sure he has a way higher winrate in 5v5 ranked games. Actually, truth is that Ryze had been climbing the statistical ladder of champions just as fast as warwick used to do regarding to http://champion.gg/. So statistically, I'd risk to say his last rework/buff was indeed overpowered.\n\nImo, the CD of the W has to be improved, yes, but the main issue about ryze nowadays is that he can trigger his passive with just a rotation of his spells (after 6) + 1. Which makes him IMPOSSIBLE to trade on lane because when he triggers his passive hes got a shield + spell vamp (as you can consider he always has ult due to passive) + no CD/infinite spells, while only limit is mana. There's literally NO champion in toplane that has a combo longer than 5 Spells (Jayce). All of the other champs have CD limitations and can't trade indefinitely. Except Cassio but she's way more mana-dependent than Ryze.\n  \nNow just my thoughts... I think you could increase a bit the CD of the W, indeed. But mainly, you have two options :\n- Or higher the amount of stacks required to trigger his passive from 5 to 6. It'd give a larger window for his opponents in lane to trade him/chunk him and would require from Ryze players to be smarter and always keep at least 2 stacks of passive up minimum instead of 1.\n- Or higher his overall mana costs just as you did with Cassiopeia, so he wouldn't be so overpowered early game.\n\nGood luck with that case anyway!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-06-09T15:16:31.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=17dZ0zXJ,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-06-09T05:56:57.790+0000)\n>\n> You shouldn't need to know Ryze's win rate in order to tell me he feels dumb to play against.\n\nAmen.

One other thing that bothers me right now is his ability to have huge aoe burst damage, during his high damage potential moments it feels like groups of 2 - 3 team members can be 100-0 without even realizing what is happening. Some people have managed to combo so fast I cant even keep track of what spell ryze is casting or when they're hitting me due to how many are going around at once, which brings problems in trying to react to him. That's more of a visual issue though, that affects gameplay.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hard4Hamsters","date":"2015-06-09T04:35:29.334+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Really it's just how early he can root someone indefinitely. It's not fun to play against, because if you get within 600 range of him when he can proc his passive, you aren't moving for at least 6 seconds. Later in teamfights your team can work around it by CCing him or bursting him down as he can't root everyone, but in 1v1's, it can be abusive. It doesn't guarantee he will win the game, but it does make it extremely annoying and it lacks meaningful counterplay in the early game. \n\nIf you're talking about winrates compared to people whining about the champion, look at Janna. Nobody complains about her, but she boasts one of the highest winrates IN THE GAME right now at 54%. And why is that? Because people don't feel like they are getting cheated when playing against Janna (mostly because she is a support, and people just assume it's the enemy ADC that's wrecking their face, not Janna's shield). With Ryze, you can walk into his range and then you are trying to retaliate when he roots you but you just can't while you take his full combo to the face. Imagine if Riot released a champion with a 5 second stun; people would say that is completely broken. But Ryze can almost root you for 6 whole seconds, you have a few fractions of a second to flash away or use an ability to escape between the roots, but it isn't easy for you to fight back against Ryze if you are in that situation. \n\nNow this isn't just QQ. I love Ryze. I want him to do well, but right now he just seems abusive. I feel like Ryze's early game shouldn't be so dominating based on how devastating his late game can be. As it stands, I feel like you need a ranged silence or stun against Ryze in lane to do well against someone who knows what they are doing. Either that or get camped by your jungler for the early phases of the game. I hope Ryze can reach a point where he can be strong but not a dominating force in lane. \n\nLet me know what you think. Good luck out there.

If his passive is down in the lategame, he is borderline useless. I've thought about one way this could work. If instead of gaining duration of his passive with ult level. He loses downtime of his passive with ult level to the point where at lvl 16 he would have no downtime other than the 5 abilities he has to use to stack it. So in the early game he would have 6 second passive and then 6 seconds when he could no longer stack his passive. He would lose 2 seconds on this downtime per ult level. \n\nThe way it's looking is that they are looking to increase the CD of his W at early levels and also lower the duration of the root at max level. I'm not sure how this will play out. They want Ryze to have the ability to Root a champion multiple times during his passive in the mid-late game, but they do not want Ryze to be able to do that at early levels. The problem I see is that people are starting to max W first anyway so if it keeps the same CD as live at max level, it won't do much. The reduction in duration might give champions an extra few steps but Ryze will have access to his Ultimate which gives him MS so good luck outrunning him. \n\nI would have liked to have seen the Ryze buffs go another way. His passive duration was doubled at early levels which is huge, and I think Ryze is going to suffer for it in the long run. I would have rather seen smaller buffs in multiple other areas in a damage increase on his Q (which happened), slightly higher mana scaling on his abilities (not more than 1-2% on any of them), more armor either base or per level (this was cut in his rework probably because he gained a shield), and a slight change to his E to have a higher bounce range (300ish) but have less max targets (4 bounces) and slightly lower maximum damage (350-400 base damage). We'll see what happens though.
