Given the state of competitive play, this may not really be objectively true but suppose it is. Shyvana and Yi are now pretty much exclusively junglers so we&#039;re not considering the effect on other roles. You can nerf the champions or you can nerf the items.\n\nIf you nerf the champions, the scope of disruption is minimal and limited to two champions. Alternatively, you can nerf the core item, Devourer or other possibly problematic items. Some suggest that Rageblade should be nerfed to address these junglers and in principle this makes sense. Ideally, you want to nerf more specific items deeper in the tree rather than very general ones since that typically creates less disruption. However, Rageblade isn&#039;t actually core on either Yi or Shyvana. If you look at Masters+ players on the Korean ladder, you&#039;ll find many Yis and Shyvanas opting for BoRK or TH without ever buying Rageblade. Thus, if Riot wants to nerf an item to address them, it probably would have to be Devourer.\n\nUnfortunately by nerfing Devourer, you create far more disruption than just nerfing the champions because that affects ALL junglers who may opt. for that route. This includes possibly abuse cases like Shyvana and Yi but also dozens of others like Kench, Nocturne, WW, Vi, Volibear, Ekko, Aatrox, Kindred, Kayle who aren&#039;t even an issue right now. In fact, for many of these, such as Volibear, Vi or Ekko, Devourer isn&#039;t the best choice anyway. However, nerfing the item reduces the cases where it&#039;s situationally strong or at least viable and lowers the diversity of Devourer junglers in general. For example, Devourer Vi may not be ideal but it is excellent vs tanks and so it may be a decent choice vs tanky teams with weak early games. Nocturne (especially in high ELO), tends to go Warrior but if your lanes are early game oriented and won&#039;t need help, you may prefer to pack a bit of a stronger punch late game. After the proposed Devourer nerfs, taking Devourer situational becomes a thing of the past. It simply won&#039;t be worth it except on the best users of the item. In effect, all it does is polarize the viability of Devourer junglers even more towards Yi and Shyvana while leaving currently mediocre Devourer junglers like Nocturne or Aatrox completely in the dust. It creates a lot of disruption for many junglers and in effect reduces both build diversity as well as jungle diversity to avoid touching the kits of two junglers. \n\nThis doesn&#039;t seem like the right way to handle things at all even if Riot actually believes there&#039;s a problem with some Devourer junglers. The approach is akin to putting Pneumonia medicine in the water supply of an entire city instead of just providing it to those with the disease. If you don&#039;t like that analogy, consider if someone poisoned the water supply of an entire city to kill rats in the sewage system.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-02-29T20:05:04.740+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":15,"body":"We're nerfing Devourer because we believe Devourer itself is a problem.

There is a clear counterplay that should be attempted just based on the game in general to begin with, so why nerf the item when it's actually just poor play on the opposing team's part that is making them so powerful?\n\nIt's like letting a Nasus stack 300 Q stacks before attempting to gank him; it's silly and anyone with general knowledge of the game knows that you want to keep Nasus down as hard as possible, especially in the early game where he's vulnerable. But I don't see Nasus only getting 2 stacks for his Q instead of 3, or increased cooldown on his Q to prevent the stacking in the early game, while Devourer junglers are already restricted by the respawn timers on jungle camps and vision to begin with.\n\nYou're punishing the player doing the right thing and not changing or addressing the fact that the other team is failing to counter the strategy being used in the game, which seems somewhat wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"ReptileVx","date":"2016-03-04T01:37:41.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I respectively disagree with that statement. There is no \"clear counterplay to the item\", at least not in solo queue. Admittedly, in 5 v 5 premade teams, you have more objective control, more map control, more everything and you can contest objectives a lot easier. In solo queue, however, you stay in your lane and prey that you have a competent jungler that will be a lot strong than the enemy jungler and will deny him his stacks by counter jungling him non stop. \n\nWell, if we take Shyvana as an example. She has a 50%+ winrate against every jungler so I'm not sure who can kill her 1 v 1 early on (maybe a shaco with ignite). Regardless, that's not how the game is supposed to play. When you have a devourer jungle, the entire game boils down to him becoming sated. Even if he ganks 0 lanes pre mid game, once sated he can solo change the course of a game since every gank from then on will result in kills. If he ganks on top of that pre mid game and gets some kills he'll sate even faster and the game will end in a FF at 20. \n\nCompete with drake and herald you say? Imagine a lvl 5 devourer jungler ganks bot lane and pushes them out of the lane. There you go, free 5 stacks. As for Herald, in solo queue Herald is sometimes even easier to get than Drake. Just force top laner out and take it. ps: Shyvana can solo drake at 6. Prey your jungler wards drake early on. \n\nDevourer has made games very very stressful and fully dependent on the jungler stacking devourer. If you have one, you know you'll win if he has good jungle paths. If both teams have one, again it'll boil down to the jungler with the most efficient clears. Junglers are not supposed to 3 hit ko top laners that fully counter them (once sated) and are supposed to be around 2 lvls ahead of 'em. And yet, we now have sated tank junglers that deal so much dmg and are yet impossible to kill before late game. During teamfights who do you focus? A sated Shyvana that can one shot your squishies but needs 5 ppl to take down or do you ignore her and go for the ad carrier thus getting destroyed by one single tank jungler. \n\nGames are awful. If i had 10 bans, I'd ban all 10 devourer junglers every game so we can have a normal game. It's like having a Nasus with 700 stacks at 15 min every game (would you like it if a Nasus had an item that made it possible for him to get 700 stacks within 15 min?)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheAceInShades","date":"2016-03-01T00:51:12.732+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"so we getting ww buffs since you nerfed him with the original devourer, never fixed him, changed devourer which didn't help him at all, and now you are nerfing that one.\n\nWW actually got viable for that brief moment of the original devourer.","replies":[{"poster":"League of Wheels","date":"2016-03-01T03:05:20.626+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would heavily disagree.

What's the point of playing a Devourer jungler when a standard Warrior/Runic's Echo jungler has a much safer and effective playstyle? Devourer can backfire pretty hard if your team is behind, the other 2 don't, since they don't really on \"stacks\" to be strong and their jungle item is much stronger than ours until we get Sated and that's exactly why Devourer is not popular in competitive. As a Devourer jungler I have to do the same job as everyone else, plus I have to manage stacks and now I'm getting punished for it? Why? What exactly is overpowered about Devourer jungling atm? Yi doing too much damage in a tank build? Also, the amount of stacks you get is influenced by your team performance, for example you can't contest drag when your botlane is getting destroyed. This jungling style has clear pros and cons, but I'm not gonna wait few patches for you to fix this, I'm just gonna jump on the Warrior/RE junglers train and have an easier time winning games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2016-02-29T20:38:31.958+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Devourer ain't the issue, its the synergy it has with guinsoo+it's absurd synergy with yi's passive, potentially quadra hitting people","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2016-03-01T00:08:01.054+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":7,"body":"So basically you're saying we the players were right when we told you all of this months ago, but you arrogantly refused to admit it and are only just now finally nerfing Devourer when you should've done so when we said it was OP a long time ago?\n\nColor me not surprised.","replies":[{"poster":"Wipoulou","date":"2016-03-01T00:38:02.133+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think the problem is not that devourer is op but more that the item itself is problematic.

When the devourer is sated, it may be already 20-25 mins game time, and the average length of game is about 25-30 mins.\n\nIt takes a lot of risks to play a devourer jungler, your ganks are so weak in early game, and you need to spend a lot of time to farm, that means your ally are in a 4vs5 situation for 20-25 mins. Your opponents may have already been fed by your ally because you don't help them in early game. And you can't carry the game even you have a sated devourer now. It is too late. (That's why no LCS player build devourer)\n\nI know many people complain that sated devourer is op. However; If it is not so powerful in late game, no one will take this risk.\n\nI suggest to change devourer like this :\n\nSuggestion 1:\n40% AS\n20 on hit magic damage\nneed 40 stacks to become sated\n+1 on hit magic damage per stack\nkill/assist gains 2 stacks (so that jungler will go ganking, not just farming)\nFarming monsters gain the same no. of stacks as current version\nSated devourer is exactly the same as current version\n\nSuggestion 2:\n40% AS\n30 on hit magic damage\nneed 30 stacks to become sated\n+1 on hit magic damage per stack\ngain 1 stack every 30 seconds (so it takes 15 mins to get sated) (similar to Rod of Ages)\nGain no stacks by farming monsters\nkill/assist still gains 1 stack (get sated faster if go ganking)\nSated devourer is exactly the same as current version\n\nThis can encourage devourer jungler to go ganking, not just farming and be a useless jungler.\n\n\nBy the way, has master yi's alpha strike bug been fixed?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LimM9a2ajE4","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dediguise","date":"2016-03-02T21:21:59.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler, Have you guys considered making scuttle crabs worth 3 stacks in light of this development?

It's intended to be a mid game power spike that at present is coming online too quickly and contributing a bit much before it's sated. As a result we're both making it a bit harder to stack and reducing its power when not sated. While Devourer itself hasn't been changed recently players have got significantly better at optimizing collection of stacks, those from Scuttle/Dragon/Rift Herald in particular. We did look at whether we should reduce the number of stacks those monsters granted. We felt strongly though that pulling Devourer junglers into more contested objectives was really valuable though, as a way to offset the low interaction PVE play that farming junglers engage in.\n> \n> Longer term I suspect we may end up making heavier modifications to Devourer too sometime this season. It does some cool things, but the play patterns it promotes and some of the power spikes it creates have been costly to the game at times. It's also an approach that can be extremely dominant in low level play without being functional at all in top tier play.\n> \n> As to the principle of least disruption, certainly, that's a great one to consider. Do need to be careful not to fall into the trap of addressing symptoms rather than causes though, sometimes bigger systemic changes are needed.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Shyvana.\n\nCurrently she has one of the lowest top lane win rates. She is completely make or break depending on the state of devourer. \n\nNot only that but she is forced to build it and spend her game farming for it. This removes player choice from Shyvana mains forcing them into that farm based playstyle with no other options because she is nerfed to compensate for devourer being so strong on her.\n\nIMO this is such bad game design and is why I refuse to play Shyvana despite her being one of my favourite champions.\n\nI recall someone mention her as a candidate for a juggernaught update?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Grashnim","date":"2016-02-28T20:58:00.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Who is your main?","replies":[{"poster":"HayRoss","date":"2016-02-28T20:59:51.247+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ao shin","replies":[{"poster":"Grashnim","date":"2016-02-28T21:01:45.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HayRoss,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7o35rqgK,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-02-28T20:59:51.247+0000)\n>\n> Ao shin\n\nMain account.
