It was designed in this manner in order to prevent corruption.\" (See Additional Information: I CRASHED AND GOT A LEAVE/MMR LOSS.

In fact it suggests why you got the penalty too.\n\nThe \"true leaver\" had exactly 659 gold, 0 other stats. You had exactly 659 gold, 0 other stats. Everyone else in both teams had more.\n\nThis combined with what the Riot people stated earlier suggests that you either had client issues too, or you were AFK. Hence why they are saying they can not fix your demerit.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-24T20:03:58.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I looked into this for you see what exactly happened.  It looks like you were marked as afk in addition to another player, which prompted the remake vote.

Unfortunately as I said, the leaverbuster and LP refund cannot be undone. \n\nLeaverbuster will not trigger immediately with a low priority queue unless there is a history of leaving games. What normally happens is the person affected is given a 5 minute delay (for the first offense) before they can queue for a game.","replies":[]}]}
