Remember when they or you would literally just punch such into a corner over and over and over again and there was nothing they or you could do about it? You would just keep pressing the X button while you ate a sandwich, took a drink of water, etc.\r\nOr, connect with 1 combo and their HP went from full to like 25%?\r\n\r\nYeah, well this is pretty much League of Legends in summary.\r\n\r\nNothing about this game closely resembles what it was when it first came out, or 4 years ago. You know.... when it was actually GOOD and not tailored made for either A.) Call of Duty 5 year old kids and/or B.) For 15 year old Asian girls/girls in general.\r\n\r\nLane phase - Gone\r\n\r\nSustain - Gone\r\n\r\nBack in the day towers were actual towers and not toilet paper rolls that s$it out $ for every auto.\r\n\r\nGames felt earned when you won or even lost because some games would go 50+ mins long. Now, League is a game you can damn near play on you phone while taking a s$it.\r\n\r\nEvery champion these days has these year long CC AND also 1 click burst abilities. The amount of CC in this game these days makes it close to impossible to escape and even if you DO escape by the hair on your nuggs......1 click ability.\r\n\r\nHell even watching \"PROS\" play isn't fun anymore. Remember when it took more than 1 auto attack to kill someone? Well, back in those days watching pros play was exciting because \"outplays' could actually happen.\r\nWatch the \"FAKER what was that clip\"\r\n\r\nNow watch any \"outplay\" today..........it's pretty much this\r\n( X champion lands their 9 year on a 5 sec cooldown stun)\r\nWHAT WAS THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BAKANA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GASMS\r\n\r\nAs much deaths/kills are in each game you would think Riot would lower the death timers........but that would make sense.\r\nYou would think Riot would have kept the bans for Arams so it's not the same champions each game(We all know which champions I\"m talking about) but that would make sense, again.\r\nLike, what is Rito doing these days? Are they still farting in faces or flicking ball sacks?\r\n\r\nNow, all you literally can only do is group mid and have a good ole' NA clown fiesta\r\nAKA fight, fight, fight AKA\r\nLEAGUE OF MORTAL KOMBAT LEGENDS\r\n\r\nI can go on\r\n- P.S I was Silver 2 back in Season 6 so you don't have to waste your time looking up my ranked history. Just go ahead and do the \"Get gud\", \"NaCL\" jokes.","replies":[{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2019-08-15T05:03:11.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is which season was good is subjective. I enjoy tank Metas, or rather more strategic metas where there is a front to back teamfight and not 5 assassins running around.\n\nI really don't know if damage is actually the issue and long CCs has been a thing for as long as I've played, it's not like Lux, Ahri, Syndra, Sona, Sion, Shen, Morg, Thresh, etc where released yesterday. The issue is that why play tanks when they get dumpstered in lane, why play a immobile mage/AD when mobility is in a over abundance.  Why play a Enchanter/tress when old mid lane mages have been pressed bot/now have the gold from all the support items being buff over the years to make supports more resourceful. \n\nEitherway, we all have Metas we enjoy more then others, and yes IMO this \"damage\" meta has gone on for far to long, but even if it was a different meta, people would still bitch and moan. Season 4 and 5 although great weren't all as good as we remember with our rose tint glasses.","replies":[{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2019-08-15T16:18:30.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You play a tank today and it's honestly a death sentence!  So...... tanks get dumpstered in lane because A.) melee freaking sucks in today's meta and B.) melee vs Range with burst and high dmg ( the first 15 mins is lane phase - literally only like.....5-8 mins from average game times in League today) so in my opinion high damage IS the problem.  If tanks can't actually do their job....damage is too high.  \n\nI highly enjoyed Season 4-5.  Matter of fact, I didn't even put my imput during such seasons on the boards because it was honestly the most balanced(in my opinion) \nTanks were actual tanks in which would take some time to scale with items etc but would have a common ground because games wouldn't end at the 20-25 min mark like today. \n\n Assassins could assassinate but would fall off mid/late game but not be viable through the whole game like today's meta.","replies":[{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2019-08-15T20:50:55.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not that I disagree with you, but I still think damage is equal now to what it was then. The difference is that tank items no longer provide nearly as much defenses. Early S4 still included DFG and 120 AP Zhonyas, AP items gave more AP and cost less. BT still scaled to 100 AD, Lethality was Armor Pen which didn't have a scaling to it like Lethality which doesn't begin to equal Flat Armor Pen until around Lv13/14. \n\nOn the flipside, Randuins no longer gives 500 HP and 70 Armor, Abbssal Scepter no longer is around to give Mages the MPenn debuff or the 70 MR it came with. GA is no longer a item for any champion, most Tank items give less HP now as well.\n\nThe Zeds and LBs of the world still tore you a new ass, but champions like Janna, Lulu, and Karma where actually played to protect the squishies. \n\nI loved S4-6, so don't get me wrong, but I can't not remember the OP shit either. Mid was a nightmare if the other team got Kass or LB when they had silences, or even Talon. Raka and Lulu mid where oppressive and  downright unkillable machines. Ziggs or any other mage could basically stall out games to a hour so any leads you got early where useless.\n\nThose years where great and I do miss them, but they had their probs too and people bitched about them all the time.\n\nReally we need to split the difference of then and now and we'd prolly be ok.","replies":[{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2019-08-15T22:55:19.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree with you in a sense that I only buy these \"tank\" items nowadays \n{{item:3193}} {{item:3800}} {{item:3107}} I still do buy other tank items like {{item:3143}} {{item:3065}} but it feels so bad like, it's better to have engage tank items oppose to actual tank items, idk. \n\nNow Ziggs is useless nowadays because what/the only thing he was good at basically every champion can do now and that's wave clear. \n\nYeah, I get what you mean and no doubt, I'm not saying no season was perfect but I would be lying if I didn't enjoy Seasons 4-6 more than the past few years.  \n\nI actually enjoyed the earlier version of {{item:3026}}( P.S if you haven't noticed by now I was once a \"tank main\" ;]) but now it's not practical to even get if you're a tank like {{champion:31}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:78}} \n\n\n- How do you feel nerfing the cost to {{item:3140}} from $1,300 to say maybe....$800?\n- Overall, I would be happy if Riot would increase every tank item that gives MR/armor.  \nFor example \n{{item:3065}} instead of just 55 MR - give it 60\n{{item:3111}} 30% reduced slows, stuns etc to say maybe 35%\nPretty much upgrade tank items just.......slightly.......","replies":[{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2019-08-16T00:52:25.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to be a tank jungler, but a lot of that was more due to the fact the people I played with were better then me and It was more useful to be a tank in the jungle or more of a utility champion in mid then trying to be another carry we didn't need. We also need to remember, for awhile there tanks just did stupid amounts of early game damage while tanking up turret shots like they were feathers. \n \nSomething I didn't think about until after I had post that before I went to work was for a solid year and a half all the patch notes had were nerfs, rarely did we see any sort of buff, which adds to the fact that damage has been around for a long time now, we just don't have tanks soaking it up. Also S5 I believe introduced the masteries we lost to these new runes, in the offense section it was nothing but %damage increases.\n\nBut, like I said previously, I do enjoy more tank oriented teamfighting metas then 5 raw damage deals just deleting people. I miss when everyone and their grandmother weren't hyper moblie champions as well.","replies":[{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2019-08-16T01:12:34.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I\"m the same way in which I love/d to {{summoner:12}} in teamfights and soak up damage for my team and friends.
