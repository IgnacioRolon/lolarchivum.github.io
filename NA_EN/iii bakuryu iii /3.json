Every new champion that comes out has these year long CC, stun, root etc as well as a 1 hit combo that bursts just about anyone 100-0 with 1 ability. \r\n\r\n2. Towers are still S4it. \r\n\r\n3. Minions being &quot;mini-me&#039;s of T1.  Why are minions chunking me half health when I try to farm?  Not to mention their focus stays on you for ages.  \r\n\r\n4. 20 min stomps.  I understand Riot/the community wants shorter games and all but Jesus, the games are 1 sided.  Not as bad as 2017(especially in the LCS).  When I play league I would rather play 50 min 50/50 games instead of these 1 sided 20 min stomps. \r\n\r\n5. Strategy?\r\n  Remember if your opponent didn&#039;t know how to freeze/push  you could punish them for their bad play?  Well, can&#039;t really do that if games are 10 mins long and lane phase means nothing.  In this new League CS really means nothing so any good habits that I was taught by RIot/friends about be smart and cs goes to the trash and instead is replaced with just a &quot; Kill, fight, fight, fight&quot; like what we were told not to do  from high elo players when they would review bronze players about how they would just LPL it and fight 24/7. \r\n\r\n6. I&#039;m a guy but I have a booty also!  I want to get $ showing off my fat a$$ on twitch but I can&#039;t cause I&#039;m a man and not a woman.  #feelsbadman  I want $\r\n\r\n7. More tiers in Ranked.  Many league players just want to be Gold cause it gives them/me a purpose to keep playing(to be called &quot;good&quot;) for once.  By adding even more tiers to climb with brain dead animals makes little sense. \r\n  Also by extending even more tiers wouldn&#039;t that cut the pool of the LCS/players also?  What I mean is by dividing the &quot;high ranked/LCS Plat-Challenger) players that&#039;s what 10-20 or so % of the ranked players the Q times will be even longer than before for them, right ?\r\n\r\n8.  What the hell happened to lane phase/sustain in lane?   The reason why I fell in love with League was because of the lane phase itself but now, now it feels like a clown fiesta.  ~~League of Legends~~ League of Mortal Kombat 2.0.  You get killed once and lane phase is just over.... like Mortal Kombat/any fighting game you just keep getting kicked in a corner over and over and over and over until you just end your suffering at the 15 min mark. \r\n\r\n9. What happened to that bottom right part of the league client that showed players playing?  I understand Riot/Streamers want the chance of you donating and all but man, sometimes I just want to watch and not listen or hear annoying donations but instead just watch the gameplay. \r\n\r\nI love League ladies and gentlemen so don&#039;t take this post to heart.","replies":[{"poster":"Hügö","date":"2019-01-03T22:16:29.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Balance team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-01-03T15:16:17.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I don't like:\n\n* too much mobility with no trade offs\n* too much cc in champ kits that have no business having cc(assassins and ADC)\n* too much damage/burst\n* too little champ viability\n* jungle has too much impact and decides games\n* not enough runes to suit different playstyles","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abibyama II","date":"2019-01-03T15:08:26.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're posting this in a place where the people here hate the game, Riot and themselves for playing it, Probably their answer would be everything","replies":[{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2019-01-03T15:12:08.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where would you suggest me to post it?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Projectile Vomit","date":"2019-01-03T15:02:24.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk, It's pretty chill atm\n\nMaybe damage is a bit too high, but that's about it","replies":[{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2019-01-03T15:09:59.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the thing!
