I meant to post their response here, and forgot until today, but here it is:\n\n> Greetings Summoner,\n> \n> Thank you for submitting this bug report. We are aware of the issue and are working hard to get it fixed. Unfortunately, I cannot provide any estimate for the completion date at this time. To avoid confusing or disappointing players, we try to only announce these dates when we are sure we can meet the arrival schedule.\n> \n> I appreciate your patience and understanding regarding this issue, and thank you again for taking time out of your day to send us this report. Please let me know if you have any questions.\n> \n> With Regards,\n> \n> Steeb \n> Tech Support Specialist \n> Pro Noxus\n\nThe reason I'm not updating, is on a whim I decided to open match history in Firefox. It worked. Chrome was still no good, but I decided to try clearing my cookies and cache again on the off chance something changed. Apparently something did because now it works. :/\n\nSo I'm just leaving this here for anyone else who is still having issues. Can't hurt to try again a different browser or clearing your browsing data.\n\n**END EDIT**\n------\n\nThis started yesterday or maybe the day before. I try to load the Match History in browser and nothing happens. I'd been using it with no problem since it's release. I'm really at a loss as to what could be the problem. I cleared my cache, cookies, and tried 2 browsers. Any ideas?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nPS- a screenshot for reference: http://i.imgur.com/qHaMjld.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-09-19T07:12:25.249+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that the new Match History isn't displaying properly :(  I have seen reports of some players not being able to access this screen.  Unfortunately, if you have already tried navigating here from both the client and from the homepage of the website itself (as well as different browsers), there are no other quick fixes I can really offer.\n\nThe best step at this point is to [submit a ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) to our Tech Team.  They can look into the issue more closely through logs and other information and provide some additional steps to take.\n\nI wish I had more specific steps to provide >.<","replies":[]},{"poster":"coranax","date":"2014-10-04T17:13:24.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumping this for some new info in the OP...","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThreeSmokingGuns","date":"2014-09-21T03:05:44.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here","replies":[]},{"poster":"AzraphBelzie","date":"2014-09-19T15:50:58.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not only is the same thing happening for me, now my rewards for Ascension are not coming up.
