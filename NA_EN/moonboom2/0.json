This occurred to me last game and made me think. The warwick on my team forgets to take smite as a jungler. Some might say &quot;oh he made a mistake&quot;, but he could&#039;ve simply not connected and allowed his team to remake. Instead he decides to go dual top and as a top laner which was me, i had no reason to put up with this. So yes, I was salty about the situation. What did my team say? &quot;oh he just forgot smite, what choice does he have?&quot; Turns out i&#039;m in a game w/ 3-man group which ofc includes WW. So they tell the enemy team i&#039;m the toxic and flaming bastard and WW is the poor scapegoat.\r\n\r\nSo I want to pose a question. Sure, this one may seem kinda questionable whether he truly &quot;trolled&quot;, but if some1 did indeed troll you, are u &quot;justified&quot; in being salty about it? This has been brought up before, but if a player is flaming and toxic, you can mute them. But I can&#039;t make someone play seriously and stop trolling. Any thoughts are welcome :)","replies":[{"poster":"deathgod5","date":"2017-03-04T11:57:48.048+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are justified of being salty, but not justified of typing salty chat. Considering there are 4 people that have to listen to you being salty.\n\nI would report him tho and ask why he is on my lane. If they start trowing accusations, I report them too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Totalwanabe","date":"2017-03-04T21:08:12.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"if he didn't feed and played you have nothing to say, adapt to the situation play at your best that's all you have to do win or loss. end of story","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-03-04T11:19:23.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no context that excuses toxic behavior. Nobody is taking your keyboard and typing for you, and if they have to mute you then you have already had a negative impact on their game.\n\nYou are allowed to be as salty as you want to be, but just keep it out of the game.","replies":[]}]}
