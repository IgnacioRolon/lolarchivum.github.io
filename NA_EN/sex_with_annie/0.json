However, playing adc is actually challenging since it is very stressful (you die = the game in late game), you need to position well to not get 1 shot by assassins and not get caught by mages, laning can be difficult to not die from mage support and to not get caught by hook supports and other engage sups, etc. Many adcs have barely any tools that allows them to survive when an assassin goes onto them, of course there is the support but you can't do much by yourself. A mage, on the other hand, will usually have cc and they can get zhonya (adcs can take stopwatch now, but that give no stats and only a 1 time use).\nJust going to say, I don't play adc anymore and now I only play top or jungle, haven't played top on this account yet but I have played top a ton on my alternate account, managing to get d5.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2017-12-03T21:50:20.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree lets nerf Marksmen","replies":[]},{"poster":"GankedByWindows","date":"2017-12-03T21:45:26.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try building ghostblade first with comet as your keystone.

There a few good enough designs to the point that they don't need a rework like trundle, shyvana, (poppy? I swear she is still listed as a juggernaut). Usually, they have limited counter play and are oppressive in lane while being weak in teamfights due to kiting from mages and adcs. I don't think Jhin needs a buff in ms but not only due to how the ms buff counters juggernauts.\nA juggernaut by design is slow, has limited cc, and does a ton of damage if he gets close to a target. However, this design by itself will be toxic and broken in low elo and weak in high elo if they are balanced (this might be a reason darius receives nerfs even thought he might have been balanced in high elo before those nerfs).","replies":[]}]}]}
