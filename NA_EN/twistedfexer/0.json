I think the soldiers should be able to attack them, not trigger them to blow up, but at least be able to damage/kill them given you have vision of the shroom..","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-03-10T20:59:35.613+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"One does not simply touch satans possessions.","replies":[{"poster":"TwistedFexer","date":"2015-03-10T21:13:59.244+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Valid point is valid.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2015-03-11T04:54:12.831+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mushrrooms don't go in the desert.
