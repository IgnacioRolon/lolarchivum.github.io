The day before ranked ended I closed the game to log out and when I tried to log back in later it just crashed after clicking Launch. I googled it, found the generic reddit stuff that was a bit dated but seemed to be the same issue. That took me here:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#section-windows\n\nI tried everything on that. Reinstalled the game. Used the Hextech repair tool (which only makes it worse?) and still nothing. Tried installing on different drives and still nothing.\n\nHere are more recent posts just from the support forums within the last week.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/V0y0UHsP-client-620-621-client-wont-launch-properly\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/MIrFMrMs-client-wont-launch\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/efyPatx7-lol-patcher-launch-button-does-nothing\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/7BZ1Mn81-unable-to-launch-the-lol-client-launch-button-does-nothingno-eula-showing-up-to-accept\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion/xLt6v36z-client-fails-to-launch-the-login-and-password-screen-after-clicking-the-launch-button\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/qFJ2wpRv-game-wont-launch-after-clicking-launch\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/1wYNb6sc-logic-screen-not-appear-after-i-press-launch-windows-7\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/gEWyr0GM-lol-client-doesnt-show-after-selecting-launch\n\n\nOlder post of same thing: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/BOsAPExz-nothing-happens-after-clicking-launch\n\nI have an open ticket but support seems to take a while to reply (no doubt the influx of tickets from ranked ending) meanwhile I am unable to play. I got it to the point where I was able to log in at least once when I first started the computer, but my last hextech log generating killed even that.\n\nHere is the ticket number if anyone would like to review the conversation I have had with the Tech Team member and all of the results from the many tests.\n\nREQUEST #24098000\n\nThanks in advance to any rioter who can help with this technical issue. The bug is solely in the league client. Everything else works flawlessly except league. Having also found it from other sources as recent as one week in I am thinking that it may be some client bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaldra","date":"2016-11-09T15:05:17.860+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: 6.22 dropped this morning and so far the bug has not reproduced itself. Literally nothing was changed on the PC since last time leading me to still believe there was some sort (possibly still is) bug with the client that compounded over time. There were just too many instances across reddit and support forums over the last week to make me think this was an isolated incident with only one program experiencing any type of issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-10T16:31:08.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all of the updates and information.  In general, a lot of issues may have similar symptoms but aren't necessarily caused by the same issue.   It was important to go over the permissions steps to rule out that possibility, which I appreciate.  I'm glad to hear everything is okay now!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"See The Devil","date":"2016-11-10T01:16:55.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"try downloading this and replace your rads/ system folder...make a copy of your rads/systems folder somewhere.. https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204894140-Installing-the-PBE-Client and then run C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases/xxxxx\\deploy/lolclient.exe...if some error pops up click ok and replace the systems folder with the copy and start launcher","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-09T00:54:28.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By saying crash, I'm assuming you mean that the client never appears at all.  In this case, a change in your OS or security settings might be blocking the game from launching.  My recommendation would be to go over each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure your access is allowed for game files and the client to launch.  That should do the trick!","replies":[{"poster":"Kaldra","date":"2016-11-09T01:11:02.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Already did. I have run the game as admin, lowered user account settings, disabled windows defender, disabled windows firewall even with existing exceptions for league. There were no changes to the OS and no third party security tools installed. I played for a bit and decide to log off. Watched some Netflix and when I tried to get back in the bug started to happen. I've been going around collecting the same problem from different users, I think it has something to do with the new client even though I don't have it installed.\n\nI've also done all the network testing suggested on the page and from the Tech Team rep and had 0% packet loss. No other games/programs have issues. No drivers or windows updates were installed when the bug presented itself. I also cannot find a common factor between the other users experiencing the issues such as video card, os, security program, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaldra","date":"2016-11-09T01:19:25.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've edited my OP with posts, all the same problem, all happening within the last week since the last patch. I highly doubt this is an isolated incident.\n\nJust searching \"launch\" in the last week showed a ton of the exact same problem with the same generic fixes that don't seem to be working.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
