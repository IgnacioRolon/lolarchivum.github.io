I normally am supposed to have 90 ms or below, but recently I've been experiencing higher. This has even occurred when nobody else is using the internet and even in my practice tool games. The reason I know that this issue isn't only on my end is because I still get 50-60 ms in other games at all times. Overwatch, for example, gives me a steady 50-60 ping at all times. League of Legends is the only game where I experience this connection issue and I can't seem to fix it on my own. I have tried repairing the client on the launcher but it doesn't work. I would appreciate it if I could receive some help resolving this issue. Its extremely difficult to practice or play my main champions such as riven. She requires a lot of animation canceling and mechanical skill that becomes much more difficult with bad connection. Please help and thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-25T23:41:00.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having an unstable connection specifically with the game servers, which is possible even with great internet.  A repair or reinstall wouldn't really resolve a connection problem.  I suggest going over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide instead to help.
