As the title implies, I'm just curious as to whether there is any reason to bother to keep claiming my daily \"Orb of Enlightenment\" thing after unlocking the last icon.  I completed all of the rewards several days ago, but I've still been logging in and claiming my orb.  Any reason for me to keep doing this? Are there set to be any further rewards or anything?","replies":[{"poster":"Ztoka","date":"2019-07-29T21:52:26.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apparently round 2 of beta rewards is coming..

I can use Google Remote Desktop to claim it from my phone, but it's a pain due to how much of my (Limited) Cellular data it uses, plus it requires me to leave my computer on with an open remote link for the whole day.  If there's no reason to do so, I'd rather avoid it.  I've collected it every day and completed every mission, so if there's a chance of more rewards I'd prefer to continue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"p3tm4ster","date":"2019-07-29T20:18:40.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just keep collecting it out of habit.","replies":[]}]}
