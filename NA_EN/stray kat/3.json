We&#039;ve all heard about invisible projectiles and stuff.. And having it happen accidentally is one thing, but INTENTIONALLY causing it is totally different.\r\n\r\nThrough the entire laning phase she would constantly run into the bush or jungle EVERY time her Spear was off CD to throw it.  Throwing it from outside of vision usually causes it to be invisible.  She realized this, and used it EVERY time.  To the point where she would go out of her way to walk into a bush to throw a spear from it, rather than just throwing it from where she was(She actually missed me multiple times due to changing her angle to step into the bush, but that&#039;s not the point).\r\n\r\nI mean, she was blatantly abusing a bug.  It was 100% obvious that she was going into the fog/bushes PURELY to throw invisible spears.  I understand that it&#039;s a bug, and it isn&#039;t always intentional.. But this was just such blatant abuse of the bug.  Why are people not punished for doing this?  \r\n\r\nI know it&#039;s hard to prove it was intentional sometimes, but in a match like this where I&#039;m not sure she threw more than 2-3 spears from outside of the fog, it&#039;s hard to say &quot;It&#039;s a bug, it wasn&#039;t intentional&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust kind&#039;ve irks me that there&#039;s nothing you can do about it.  I understand that it&#039;s part of the game, and that you can still see some of the particles to dodge them, but she really did everything she could to abuse this bug every chance she got.","replies":[{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-05-27T00:26:49.674+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":4,"body":"...There isn't a single Nidalee player--**there isn't a single skill shot mage**--that doesn't recognize the advantage of firing from the brush.

Riot knows about it, reddit knows about, generally speaking you're the only one who doesn't know about it. I've seen more than a couple of threads about this over the year. It's definitely not a new problem.\n\nFrom my understanding it works by being on terrain that's at a lower spot and it just goes through the ground.

I have a 2 years of game development experience under my belt, and I've dealt a fair bit with QA over the past few months.  This bug seems like it's not actually difficult to repro.  Tracking down the cause of bugs can often be difficult, but a bug like this is a game breaker and should be prioritized accordingly.  The highest priority bugs are usually crashes, but things that heavily fuck with the gameplay are right below that, typically.  Things like abilities going on cd without firing or inivisible skill shots would fall under this category.","replies":[]},{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-05-27T12:44:55.901+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have Headhunter Nidalee and I've been trying to ~~abuse~~ replicate this bug for ages.
