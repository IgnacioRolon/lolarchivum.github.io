Matched with new players still trying to learn the game, as well as various returning/restarting players.  It changed drastically by the time I had hit level 5 or 6. \r\n\r\nBy then, those of us who have played before are already separated from the \"truly new\" players - This is clearly noticed by simply checking the farm of players in matches, noticing that they don't walk into towers, etc - They have basic game knowledge.  The problem is that a large portion of them are players who have been banned however many times and are currently making their #th account after being banned yet again.\r\n\r\nLow level games(I'm up to 12? 13?) are an absolute cesspool of the most toxic players I've ever seen.  EVERY game has people being toxic to the point that I get instant feedback from the reports.  Most of the games have people going AFK within the first 2-5 minutes, flaming teammates excessively, spending 15 mins going B over and over from the fountain(Looking at you jungle Raka), people hard feeding because they don't like what someone else picked(Looking at you Sona who didn't like the jungle Raka.).\r\n\r\nIt's a horrible experience.  EVERY game is extremely toxic.  They don't care, they've been banned over and over and just keep creating new accounts.  They then jump in and ruin even more games with these new accounts.   I'm used to seeing some toxicity, that's just how the community is - But these people go above and beyond.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I truly feel it's time to start implementing IP bans, or at least IP Chat mutes(Though I mute toxic players to begin with, it doesn't help when they're hard inting or teleporting to base over and over for 15 minutes.)  A player being perm banned shouldn't be able to just spend 45 seconds creating a new account to continue ruining games.   Sure, plenty of people would get around it(Could use MAC bans to avoid that, but whatever), but the majority won't successfully do so.  \r\n\r\nIt's absolutely disgusting how bad the mid level experience is.  Most of them literally brag about how many times they've been banned.  Hell, many of them their names literally say they've been banned, or aren't reformed, or have extremely toxic language involved in them.  It's to the point where I'm having to report 2-3 players from each team after EVERY single game.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething really needs to be done - IP bans aren't a perfect solution, but they would certainly help.  These players make it truly not enjoyable to level up another account.  A permanent ban should be permanent.  It shouldn't only last the 45 seconds it takes for them to create another account.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-04-26T02:10:25.612+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"IP bans are not something that exists anymore. They stopped making sense about 20 years ago. Even then they could be bypassed with a pencil and a couple minutes.\n\nResidential IPs typically change daily anyway, or are shared between hundreds or even thousands of users for wireless plans.","replies":[{"poster":"Stray Kat","date":"2019-04-26T02:33:21.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"MAC bans would make far more sense now, I'm aware of that.  They're also far less commonly implemented.  IP bans still work just fine for a great majority of people - No matter how easy it is, the average person isn't going to properly change their IP.  It could cause problems for things like college campuses where the connection is shared amongst who knows how many people, but that's always been a thing.\n\nWhether IP bans or MAC bans are used or some other method, there needs to be something more severe than \"Spend 45 seconds to make a new account\".

That first one they lose whatever they bought, but past that they don't just whale up and buy all their skins back usually - They lose a bare account that they spent nothing on.\n\n\nHell, don't perm ban their accounts - Permanently move it to a \"Banned Queue\" instead, where they only match with each other.

Riot could make it part of the client (their software would just read it off your computer), but then there would be two new problems.\n\nFirst, privacy concerns. MAC addresses are personally identifiable at least by network device. For Riot to keep track of your mac address it would be like keeping track of something that uniquely identifies you. If this information was on Riot's server it can be stolen, sold, or given away.\n\nSecond, a MAC address is controlled completely by the client. So it's easy to spoof, even more so than IP address. This makes a MAC address ban easy to bypass **and** someone could abuse MAC address bans by getting other people banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-04-26T03:18:13.722+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ðïana,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=wy5l8IHy,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-04-26T02:33:21.822+0000)\n>\n> MAC bans would make far more sense now, I'm aware of that.
