I still havent gotten honor level 3, and i find that kinda wierd, as my friend just got honor level 3. Hes lately been inting in games and sometimes even afk'ing. He loves to troll and doesnt care about the game. Just annoys me that people like these can obtain the honor level 3 status, when positive players like myself cant. He hasnt even played as many games as me.","replies":[{"poster":"Davytjuhh","date":"2017-08-08T21:17:58.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Apex Support","date":"2017-08-09T16:20:53.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is you can't get honnor level 3 in less than a month so if he got his first honnor a few days before you than thats why.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-08T23:56:21.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's the thing, if your friend keeps inting he's going to lose his honors and his rewards. This also isn't a race to get to honors 3! If you're being friendly to other players, communicating strategies, and being helpful then you're well on your way there. Take some time to just enjoy the game and you'll be there before you know it. Patience is a virtue my friend and with patience, down the road, you'll get awesome loot for being so honorable.","replies":[{"poster":"Navillus","date":"2017-08-08T23:58:49.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GoldPikaKnight,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=WalGUg8g,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-08-08T23:56:21.064+0000)\n>\n> Here&#x27;s the thing, if your friend keeps inting he&#x27;s going to lose his honors and his rewards.

It's like being nice in real life. If your'e friendly you'll find people will want to be around you and do things with you! In League, if you're nice you can make friends, get awesome loot, and get an awesome ribbon.
