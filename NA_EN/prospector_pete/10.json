If he devours a small minion or monster but doesn't spit them out, he swallows them, instantly killing them and healing himself by a portion of his maximum health.","replies":[{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2015-07-17T01:23:56.539+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been suggested [before ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/sFwtxyWA-can-tahm-kench-swallow?comment=000100000001) but it doesn't work due to gameplay, animation work, and lore reasons.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Sona Ping,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sFwtxyWA,comment-id=000100000001,timestamp=2015-07-14T16:48:11.201+0000) \n> A further issue that I forgot and to add in my first post:  It doesn't work thematically either.\n> When TK spitouts an enemy there is a voice clip that says \"Disgusting\" or something to that effect.  This is because TK does not find them worth eating.  As has been been shown in his lore, the way his hunger is satisfied, the only things he would find tasty are things that he has eaten as payment for his contract.  It doesn't make sense for Tahm to eat enemy champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-07-16T23:25:57.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, like if you wait the whole distance and it's dead, make him burp instead hehe.\n\nIt is sorta hilarious to spit out a chogath corpse or whatnot though at least :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-07-16T23:20:24.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They said they don't like the idea of dead people not leaving corpses, which kinda goes against some stuff that's already in the game, but they might be changing those.","replies":[{"poster":"Prospector Pete","date":"2015-07-16T23:21:37.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh.
