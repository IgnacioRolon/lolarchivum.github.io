That's why I think about dodging when someone picks {{champion:99}}/{{champion:76}} bot.

I never said Thresh is purely OP because of his Q. That just plays part in an overloaded kit that makes a champion OP. Blitz can't engage on a whole team with his QER, Leona can't turn fights around by bringing in another ally or saving one from being killed. Morgana can't afford to build tanky. \n\nI apologize for claiming his lack of power, because that's wrong as well. His bases are absolutely ridiculous while being ranged as well, with innate tankiness. \n\nApart from sustain I can't think of something he can't bring over another support. He's the S3 Lee Sin of supports, he just does most things better than everyone else, and even when he can't, there's still so many reasons to pick him over someone else.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-09-27T04:32:37.680+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Trundle is in fact a competitive Support.\n\nLux is also frequently played as a support","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2015-09-27T04:30:19.776+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Lux and Trundle both are decent supports no matter how much you rage over it {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} \n\nI cant understand how you can claim his base damages are high when they just flat out aren't.

Plus Morg's Q has 3 times the hitbox as a hook and theres no wind up time\n\nBlitz is about pulling one target to his team to delete them. Just because he doesnt have the same playstyle as thresh doesn't mean its worse. Blitz hooks absolutely can force a team fight though as well.\n\nA flash Tibbers from Annie can single handedly win a teamfight. Thresh can force a fight but could be suiciding in. Thresh doesnt offer the same instant lock down as an Annie does. People can dodge his skillshots pretty easily and jump out of his box. Literally the only hard CC thresh offers is 1 second of hook\n\nThresh doesnt offer the same innate tankiness as a Leona. Leona's kit also doesnt rely on her ability to land a single skill shot on specific members of the enemy team. She can still line up a decent ult even if the zenith blade misses. Leona offers 3 forms of hard CC as opposed to Thresh's one\n\nBut hey, you can take a look at stats too where he sits #15 amidst supports.
