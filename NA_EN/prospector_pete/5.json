Why is that? Usually the answer is that he is toxic due to his free stats through his passive, and sometimes how his windwall is broken. There have been some suggested reworks before, but I feel like this one is good in that it reduces his toxicity while still keeping him viable and keeping his high skill cap. \n>  **(Passive) Sheathed Blade-** If Yasuo hasn&#039;t basic attacked or used an ability for 4 seconds, he **Sheaths** his blade, causing his next basic attack or ability to gain an extra effect. \n*Basic Attack or Steel Tempest- 30/35/40% increased damage*\n*Windwall- 30/40/50% increased health*\n*Sweeping Blade- Cooldown reduced by 40/45/50%*\n*Last Breath- Suspension duration increased by .25/.35/.45 seconds*\n\nThe goal of this ability is to give Yasuo options on what to do in certain situations, while removing his free shield and crit chance. It promotes for him to wait and use abilities when it counts rather than spam them and hope that something happens. Additionally, the bonus suspension duration on Last Breath encourages Yasuo to coordinate with his team and use their knock-ups rather than his own.\n\n> **(Q) Steel Tempest-** Yasuo thrusts his sword forward, dealing 20/40/60/80/100 (+100% AD) physical damage to all enemies hit, gaining a stack of Gathering Storm for 6 seconds if he successfully hits an enemy. If he has 1 stack of Gathering Storm, he can cast the ability again to apply all of the same effects from the first cast. If he has 2 stacks, his next Steel Tempest consumes all stacks to generate a whirlwind that flies in a targeted direction, dealing the same damage to and knocking-up enemies hit.\n\n> Cooldown: 4-1.33 seconds (based off of bonus attack speed)\n\n Same ability as before.\n\n>  **(W) Windwall-** Yasuo unleashes a powerful gust of wind that extends slightly outwards from him after a .25 second delay. The windwall blocks the first projectile hit with no penalties, and then gains health. The windwall starts with 250/400/550/700/850 (+20% of Yasuo&#039;s Bonus Health) health, which decays by 20% every second until the wall depletes. If the wall doesn&#039;t get hit by a projectile, it vanishes after 6 seconds. If the wall is still alive 7 seconds after being cast, it instantly collapses.\n\n> Cooldown: 26/24/22/20/18 seconds\n\nBasically the same ability, but now it has more ability to play around it. As it now depletes quickly over time, you can decide to let it be or whittle it down with some basic attacks or abilities. In addition, the health scales with Yasuo&#039;s bonus health, encouraging him to buy more defensive items.\n\n>  **(E) Sweeping Blade-** Yasuo dashes a fixed distance through a target, dealing 60/70/80/90/100 (+25% Bonus AD) physical damage to them and marking them for 10/9/8/7/6 seconds. Yasuo cannot dash to marked targets. If Yasuo uses Sweeping Blade while his blade is **Sheathed**, it stays **Sheathed**. If he doesn&#039;t have it **Sheathed**, he **Sheaths** it after dashing through 3 targets within 5 seconds.\n\n>  Cooldown: 1/.8/.6/.4/.2 seconds (not reduced by cooldown reduction)\n\nAlso basically the same ability, but now synergizes with Yasuo&#039;s passive to allow good Yasuo players to be more effective with it. Also rewards Yasuo for already having his blade Sheathed by reducing the cooldown to the current cooldown.\n\n> **(Ultimate) Last Breath-** Yasuo dashes to a targeted knocked-up enemy, causing all knocked-up enemies in the area to be suspended in the air for an extra 1 second. Afterwards, Yasuo deals 200/300/400 (+150% Bonus AD) physical damage to them and automatically **Sheaths** his blade.\n\n>  Cooldown: 80/55/30 seconds\n\nBasically the same ability, but without the armor penetration.\n\nThis rework aims to reduce some of Yasuo&#039;s toxicity by increasing his counterplay, while keeping his skillcap high and his kit viable. Now, Yasuo has to choose what effect he wants to have, in addition to having to rely on his teammates more. Some of the numbers might not be perfect, but I&#039;d rather focus on the kit itself rather than the values, since I&#039;m not the master on balance.

Ok, that means he no longer scales well into the late game, he lacks the inherent tools to chew through tanks the way other skirmishers do, his laning pattern is now 100% hit and run because he has zero incentive to continue trading blows since his Q sucks, and he also can't take ranged harass.\n\nI guess this means everyone is going back to playing top lane frozen force Yasuo exclusively because this version isn't viable in mid lane anymore. I'm not even certain he'd be good there with his slow, whatever power spike off Trinity. {{item:3111}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3742}} and {{item:3193}} would probably be his full build because his damage is trash already, might as well go full ham as a diver.\n\nEDIT: I just noticed, 850 health on the Wind Wall? The reason his W doesn't have health is both that health would encourage bad players to attack the wall instead of repositioning and also the ability is too binary in its impact to deal with having hit points. 1000 health would only be enough to eat two autoattacks from a late game ADC, but still enough to block most projectile ults. That is ludicrous.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hong Kong Revolt","date":"2017-06-08T00:16:05.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In what situations is this new Yasuo playable? After dumpstering his damage and passive shield, he no longer has the stats to fight, but his 3q stayed, so he still wants to fight. This version either runs over people with base stats and becomes tank Elko 2.0, or he's useless as a skirmisher.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2017-06-07T23:52:04.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are going to remove the double crit you should buff the Q damage.
