It was not balanced for the Top, Mid, and ADC all having TP. \n> \n> I'd like Flash to be less mandatory as much as you, but it's not gonna happen.\n\nMy noob opinion: \n\n# (1) I do like that Flash is strong, because it helps reduce the size of the mobility gap. Without Flash in the game, zero-mobility Champions would be even more screwed.\n\"Wait, how does more mobility reduce the mobility gap?\" Well, think about it from a diminishing returns perspective.\n\nThink about a game as presenting a series of Flash opportunities, where one can use Flash or another mobility option to gain some advantage: hopping over a wall to escape, or initiating a teamfight with a big CC ability, or whatever. This is rather artificial, but here's an example list, ranked in descending order of bang-per-dash:\n\n* Flash-Tibbers initiate when they go for the first Baron: Wins a teamfight for your team\n* Flash to steal Baron: Gets Baron for your team and helps you push down a tower\n* Flash to kill their super-fed carry, though you'll die as well: Gives your team a fighting chance in that teamfight for their inhib\n* Flash to escape a gank: Saves you from one death\n* Flash to dodge Blitz hook: Assures a dodge, whereas otherwise there'd have been about a 30% chance you'd be caught\n* Flash to gank a lane that's low: Lets you get a few more hits in and increases odds of a kill\n* Flash because the enemy typed \"press d to dance\": Gives your team a laugh at your expense\n* Flash into a wall: Makes your Champion wish they had a smarter Summoner\n\n(I'm using Flash there, but really what I'm talking about is a \"dash\" or \"blink\", whether from Flash or an ability. If you have three blinks, you get the top three options. If you go up to six blinks, you get to add in the next three: not as awesome as the first three, but nice nonetheless.)\n\nNow remove all mobility from the game, except that everybody gets one Flash per match. Well, you'd presumably use it on that Flash-Tibbers, or whatever you thought was the most valuable opportunity presented.\n\nThen add a second Flash per match. This one would give you less total value, presumably, because you'd be using it on the second-best option.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nPut differently, let's say we have some dashy high-mobility Champions who can take advantage of the top 30% of blink-opportunities. Adding Flash lets them expand that to, say, the top 40% of opportunities. But it also lets the zero-mobility Champions take advantage of the top 10%. Going from 0 to 10 is a lot better than going from 30 to 40; going from 0 to 10 lets you steal the sweetest plums, whereas the 30-40 options are presumably somewhat less exciting, or else you'd have nabbed them earlier.\n\n(It's possible, of course, that mobility synergizes with mobility, which would turn this model on its head. For example, maybe there are some super-high-value moves that you can do with two blinks in a row, but can't do with one. If the options that open up when you go from 1 blink to 2 blinks are much better than the options that open up when you go from 0 to 1, then adding Flash makes the gap worse.)\n\n# (2) However, I'd like to see other spells buffed to the point where it can be viable to take them instead of Flash, if you're smart about it.\nMaybe Flash fills an especially valuable role in balance. Still, I'd like to see other spells buffed to the point where someone with a really clever strategy might be able to make a flashless spellset work. For example, maybe make Heal strong enough that a resistance-tank might want it.\n\nOr at least make Ghost strong enough that it can measure up to Flash for Champions who are durable enough to not instantly explode. (Arguably, I guess that's already the case? I'm a noob, like I said, so I'm not sure.) That at least offers people two mobility options with different pros and cons.","replies":[{"poster":"iamleburk","date":"2015-10-19T01:20:16.641+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are absolutely correct. Summoner spells do not have to be balanced with other summoner spells, they just have to be balanced with themselves.

They focus on getting as much farm and surviving as much as possible, and as long as they can deny you kills pre 9, they win.

It is already an excellent tool for a team player and has many different uses while still primarily being focused on shutting down a specific individual.\n\n{{summoner:4}} I hate Flash because no matter how they nerf it, it will always be really good. They can nerf the range, they can nerf the CD, and that's it. They've done both on more than one occasion, and it stays dominant no matter what. I think the only solution for flash is to make it an innate ability for every champion and give them all an additional summoner spell slot.\n\n{{summoner:6}} This ability needs to grant either slow immunity or some sort of major tenacity steroid for it to be worthwhile anymore, since it has to keep up with people with dashes and has to wade through mountains upon mountains of slows.\n\n{{summoner:7}} This ability has and always will compete with Barrier in its current form, so I'd suggest changing it to be a heal over time rather than an instant heal (ideally it would simply divide the heal in thirds for a total heal of the same amount over three seconds, or 30-115 HP/second). This will help differentiate it further from Barrier as a long term combat aid rather than a burst negator. Alternatively, they could make it heal based on max or missing health (either as a *heal more flat amount for every % health missing* like Yi's meditate, or *heal x% max/missing health per second* for 3 seconds\n\n{{summoner:14}} This spell is a strong early kill spell, but late game it feels too useless and is outclassed in terms of playmaking by both exhaust and TP, so I would suggest making the healing reduction affect increase in strength based on champion level, capping at something much higher than now as a strong but highly situational shut down for an out of control healing champ. A cooldown increase may be necessary to compensate for the added late game strength.\n\n{{summoner:11}} This spell has pretty much run the gambit at this point and seems to be in a healthy spot, with all three smites being used and useful in most metas at the moment. Poacher's smite needs some addressing, but that's a whole different story.\n\n{{summoner:12}} The star of the thread, I think this ability has a lot of strengths but also some obvious weaknesses, and is overall a really healthy option right now. If the other changes I've suggested get implemented at least partially, then this won't be super dominant anymore, it will just be a good choice amongst many other good choices.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PeachsProperty","date":"2015-10-18T18:58:09.462+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"<---used teleport back in season1 before it was popular.\n\n\nFlash needs a change.\n\nthey dont like champions being 100% pick rate why allow summoner spell that is prolly taken 75% of the time?","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Be Rad","date":"2015-10-19T02:13:59.467+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can't believe people are actually in here defending Flash.

There are multiple kinds of boots, and they're balanced in that different champs take different boots. Mages can take Lucidity or Sorc, and can even *justify* Swifties.  There's diversity, balance, and multiple choices. \nThat doesn't exist with summoners. Which is the entire point. When to buy boots also has strategic value. It's not a free \"Oh sh*t\" button like flash.\n\nFlash just had too much usefulness in one spell. Gap closer, escape, re-positioning, dodging skill shots... There should at least be something comparable. TP comes close. But what about the other summoners...? It would be healthy for players to strategically choose BOTH of their summoners, just as players can choose which boots to buy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Loveless","date":"2015-10-19T03:02:33.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Everyone needs to win too.
