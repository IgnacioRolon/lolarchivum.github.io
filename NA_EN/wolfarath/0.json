I&#039;m taking true like mechanical skill where you can solo carry by yourself as a support. Please rito been here since s3 loved playing support since s4 but these games just seem to start getting repetitive, &quot;heal this, tank that&quot; When can we get some truly facinating support crowd control gameplay that is fancy when its pulled off and the whole team screams DAMNNN","replies":[{"poster":"Dorans Pants","date":"2018-03-26T01:42:34.133+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you playing a dmg dealer and your team is retarded?\n---> As unlikely as it may be you might have a chance to still carry the game.\n\n are you playing an enchanter or cc-oriented champ and your team is retarded?\n---> might as well go afk.\n\nand this is why you can´t carry as a support. A class dependent on your partner not being ass just isn´t interesting for anyone, who cares about individual skill expression. And even if a champ with challenging cc-gameplay was added to the support roster, it would still be outshined by literally every other champ that deals good dmg, because at the of the day, when it comes to personal enjoyment, most league players tend favor damage over everything else. And I have to say even as a support main, I am in the same boat. If some asked me who I would rather want to be, the 10/2/0 rengar who stops everyone on the enemy team from enjoying the game or the 0/2/9999 rakan, who does the same shit job no matter how ahead or behind he is, the job being:\"engaging and praying to god that your team is not worse than your enemy team.\" I would choose the catman.\n\nbut adding a more mechanically demanding support sure wouldn´t hurt, seeing how an entire support-subclass is as brain-dead and boring as it can get, with riot still trying to find ways to make them even easier to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2018-03-26T01:19:26.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The whole point of a support is you're not solo carrying, you're supporting those around you.

I say supports themselves have plenty of mechanical outplay potential, and some very very much carry the game based on how well they can play their champ mechanically. Rakan, Karma, Lulu, Nami, Thresh, Bard... These champions aren't necessarily easy to play at a high level. They require thought and with good applications of their abilities can singlehandedly carry a game by enabling their damage dealers to get free kills and gold. Don't get me wrong, you can play them brainlessly as well, but have you SEEN a good thresh or bard? It's actually disgusting how crazy some of their plays get. Or Rakan... he is the master at making some sexy plays.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malfectious","date":"2018-03-26T13:55:51.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:432}} *angry chiming","replies":[]},{"poster":"Palaver","date":"2018-03-26T13:22:42.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah sounds like you just wanna play adc. I would argue that there's champions in support class that you CAN do that with. I've never owned a game with Braum, but its possible in the hands of someone who isn't me. Thresh can carry well too if you know how to build him. Mechanically I find Lulu and Karma to be pretty challenging. And if we have a support that can do the job of an adc, then what's the point of an adc? {{sticker:sg-soraka}} ","replies":[]}]}
