When you lvl up bear stance to lvl 5, the autoattack sounds (while in bear stance) are muted, only the initial stun has a sound effect. It seems this issue is just being ignored, and I think it deserves a bit of attention, since this is an ultimate skin and it's very expensive. \n\nI recorded a video to show the bug: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mXP2x81h-k\n\nCan any dev confirm if this bug will be fixed?\n\nPD: bear stance lvls 1-4 seems to work fine. The bug happens when you max it out and the appearance evolves.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-10-17T10:23:43.568+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a known issue that will be fixed soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Boyahda","date":"2014-10-17T20:28:13.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> This is a known issue that will be fixed soon.\n\nAlso, activating Spirit Guard Udyr's tiger stance regularly makes the sound of his base skin tiger activation. I'm not sure if that is intentional but Trick2g has mentioned it a few times on stream.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yolo Swagginson","date":"2014-10-17T10:12:12.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yolo Swagginson","date":"2014-10-12T13:23:56.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump... really, Riot, can't you say a single word about this?
