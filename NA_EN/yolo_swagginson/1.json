When using Mecha Malphite skin with a chroma, W loses its animation, and the &quot;brass knuckles&quot; dissapears. The skill only shows a light orange glow on Malphite&#039;s hands.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-22T18:48:58.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! \n\nThere was a similar issue that was resolved, however, this issue is requiring more than just an animation fix, which is why it's taking longer than a patch. The TL;DR is that we're enlisting the help of engineers to help us because this isn't simply a change in the animation, but something a bit more complex.\n\nI've gone ahead and pinged the issue again to get a bit more traction on it. Thanks for your patience!","replies":[{"poster":"Yolo Swagginson","date":"2016-11-27T11:07:58.342+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you. I hope it gets fixed soon!\n\nAnd btw, the passive also loses its animation (when Malph loses his shield and when he regains it).","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-29T21:50:28.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick update here: Looks like there was a fix, but it isn't sticking in terms of building out. Engineers are still digging into this one.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"izik1","date":"2017-01-06T11:46:03.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I'm having the same issue. No animation on my W. just a yellow/gold glow around his fists.  Hope it gets fixed soon. :/","replies":[]}]}
