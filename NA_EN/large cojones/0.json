Basically the icon sits in the task bar doing nothing right. Well, it used to include a little status bar on that icon but it doesn't anymore for some reason with the new client. Instead, as long as the icon is down there, and has the black dot underneath it its working its magic. Which sucks because you can't see it working and what not and have no estimation of its completion. But I usually just let it go (cue Frozen music) and it will load within like...20min tops.","replies":[{"poster":"Martini30","date":"2017-12-06T22:04:12.722+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem, the icon disappears.
