I've got a lot of question that can hopefully be answered since there wasn't much info given in the announcements.\r\n\r\n1. What is the starting MMR? I noticed that players that would be unable to queue together for the old ranked queue can invite each other and even queue for games. Example being a plat friend of mine was able to invite players who are silver (me included.)\r\n2. As a followup to first question, will there be tier restrictions after placement?\r\n3. If I place during the preseason, will I and every other player who placed have their MMR wiped completely (think like a fresh level 30 account) or will there be a reset similar to what solo/duo queue has had every preseason. Alternatively (since this is a new queue,) will the ladder even reset when the new season begins?\r\n4. Where did team rank go on the profile portion of the new client? I've been on the new client since June and previously you could see a player's team rank on their profile. With the new patch it was replaced with flex ranks for both 3v3 and 5v5.\r\n5. Since there is now a way to play ranked on Twisted Treeline without a team, will there FINALLY be better resources for player to learn the map or will people still have to refer to Gunter's website? (link at the bottom for those interested in 3v3 resources)\r\n\r\nThis likely won't get much attention, but I want to say thank you to Riot staff in advance for any answer I may receive. I love the fact that there is now a competitive mode for Twisted Treeline that doesn't require 2 friends who are on a team with you. It was my favorite map when I started the game, but I ended up leaving it after none of my friends ever wanted to play on it (since blind pick is awful and nobody ever wanted to play team ranked.)\r\n\r\n3v3 resource: http://www.theshadowisles.com/","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-09T23:02:13.097+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll take my best shot at answering these questions. Here goes nothing!\n\n1. Flex Queue is designed to allow 1, 2 3, or 5 players who are within one ranked-tier of each other to queue up for ranked games together. Starting MMR is not something I can be specific on, but as with this year, your placement for the 2017 season will be lower than the 2016 season.\n\n2. Not sure what you mean by tier restrictions, but the highest rank you can land after completing your placements is Plat 1.\n\n3. Any ranked play during the preseason can have a *slight impact* with your placements in the 2017 season, but we'll still be performing a *soft reset* of ranked at the start of the 2017 Season.\n\n4. Ranked Team information is not in the Alpha Client at the moment, but we're adding new features all the time, so this may come pretty soon.\n\n5. Not sure, but we'll have to see what comes out during the preseason. It's going to be a very exciting ranked season in 2017!\n\nI hope this helps out a bit and clarified things for you. For places where I may not have been perfectly clear, we have a [Ranked 2017 breakdown](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/competitive/how-rank-2017-season) that should supplement this pretty well. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"angery pout","date":"2016-11-09T23:39:34.825+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for getting back to me. When I mentioned tier restrictions, I was referring to platinum players only being able to queue with players Gold 5 through Diamond 3, Silver players only being able to queue with players Bronze 5 through Gold 1, etc. I know that with the regular ranked ladder that's a hard rule, but I was unsure of what the case would be with the new flex queue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"shaco and me","date":"2017-09-27T16:45:47.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"guys i have a question for y'all. So at the moment i'm S3 in flex queue and my question is, do you get the golden border in you're loading screen next season when you're gold in flex too or only when you're gold in solo/duo queue?And the victorious skins, are those only for the ones who are gold in solo queue or also for those who are only gold in flex?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vistha","date":"2016-11-09T23:12:35.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can queue up in a premade of Silver and Plat, then it seems the \"Dynamic Queue\" ranking has become \"Solo/Duo Queue\" ranking instead of \"Flex pick\".\nBasically a Plat can queue with Silver, because in the \"Flex\" queue they are both unranked.\nAt least that's how it looks like in my profile.\nMy old rating is labeled as \"Solo/Duo\", while my \"Flex\" rating is unranked.\n\nAs for the starting ELO.\nHistorically the ELO people started with was 1200 which in the current system would be around Silver 3 or so.\n\nAt the beginning of the season there is going to be a soft reset, which will put people closer to that ELO.\nThe higher you are, the more ELO you are going to lose.","replies":[{"poster":"angery pout","date":"2016-11-09T23:41:59.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks. I knew about the past starter elo and starting MMR. Was just curious that since this is a new ranked system I wanted to see if MMR was skewed up or down based on the solo/duo ladder.","replies":[]}]}]}
