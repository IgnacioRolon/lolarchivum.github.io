","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-01-02T23:31:19.848+0000","up_votes":107,"down_votes":3,"body":"Nope, pretty truthful.  Yi gets his double hit, Ziggs has passive.  A full non cannon wave can tank 15 turret shots.  Turrets have .83 attack speed.  That is just under 13 seconds of tanking, not counting a secondary wave coming in.  We can assume Ali is not hitting the turret and instead preventing the enemy wave from crashing, as it the proper method.  At 3 minutes a tower has 44 armour and mr, as well as 2625 health.\n\nIn terms of effective health it has 3780 health.  That means we can ignore resistances.\n\nZiggs passive does roughly 25 damage, doubled vs turrets.  It has a 12 second cd, reduced by 4 seconds when ziggs uses an ability.  This means he gets one enhanced auto, Q>E, 4 second cd enhanced auto.  2 seconds later (6 seconds in) he gets another Q off, reducing the cd by 4 more seconds.  Add in W and 4 seconds later (10 seconds in) he gets his 3rd enhanced auto off.  His passive does double damage vs turrets, so that is 150 health off the turret from passive alone.\n\nThat leaves us with 3630 health.  \n\nZiggs between abilities has an AS of .66 without runes/masteries.  We can assume that with those we negate the time spent using abilities for simplicity. In 13 seconds he can auto attack 8 full times.  Without runes/masteries he does 59 damage an auto.  With runes and masteries and a dorans we can bump that up to roughly 70 AD.  That is 560 damage from auto attacks.\n\nThat leaves us with 3070 health.\n\nNext up Yi.  Yi has an AS of .68 without runes/masteries.  In 13 seconds he can attack almost 9 times.  Adding in runes he should easily hit 9 auto attacks.  That applies his passive 3 times, aka 10.5 auto attacks total.  At lv 3 yi has a base AD of 65.  With runes we can also call that an easy 70 minimum.  With E passive that is 77 AD.  That is 808.5 damage.\n\nThat leaves us with 2261.5 health.\n\nWhere is the remaining damage coming from?  Lets check the minions.\n\nmelee minions are killed first.  They each take 3 shots before dying.  They have 1.25 AS.  That is a total of just under 3 attacks per minion death.  We can round that all the way down to 2 as they take time to reach the turret.  That is 14 attacks before all 3 are dead.  They have 12 AD and do 150% damage to turrets.  That is 252 damage.\n\n2009.5 health left.\n\nCaster minions now.  They have 25.5 AD and .66 AS at 3 minutes.  They get off a total of 7.47 seconds before they get targeted.  In that time they get off 5 attacks each.  They then get one attack off before each one of them dies for a total of 6 extra attacks and a cleared wave.  That is 21 attacks or  535.5 damage.\n\nThis leaves us with 1474 health.  What isn't adding up?  Well, 2 things.  1, I was an idiot and didn't count the bonus damage champions get when attacking turrets.  This is either your bonus AD, or half your AP, whichever is higher.\n\nYi has 12 bonus damage on each auto due to his E passive granting him extra AD.  Over his 9 attacks this is 108 damage.\nZiggs has 11 bonus AD because of his Dorans.  Over his 8 attacks he does 88 extra damage. \n\nThat brings us down to 1278 health.  Even if we give Ali half the time spent stalling waves to auto attack (which he can do) that wouldn't cut it.  So how did they kill the turret?  Simple.  A cannon minion spawns at 2:15.  If the turret died at 3 minutes then it was probably that cannon wave.  A cannon minion will take fire from a turret after the first melee minion died.  It then only takes 70% damage from turrets.  That is 8 turret hits to kill it.\n\n8 turret hits takes 6.6 seconds.  That means we multiply the time to kill by roughly 1.5 (13 seconds to kill up to 19 seconds to kill)\n\nThat means as a rough estimate we can take the damage we have done so far and multiply it by 1.5\n\nWe have done 2502 damage to the turret.  That means in the extra 6.6 seconds we do roughly 1251 damage.\n\nThat leaves us at 27 Health.  Remember how I didn't count a single Alistar auto attack?  Well he can easily get in a few autos before needing to go block the incoming wave, and can technically keep attacking after it is focusing him.  That is more than enough to push us over the damage needed threshold.\n\nIt may sound super close, but there are actually more things we aren't counting.  The wave could have built up, meaning we actually have even more minions than a full wave.  I heavily underestimated on both the AD and AS runes just to give some extra leeway.  Finally I didn't count armour/mpen, which do work against turrets. \n\n... Oh I am an idiot, I didn't apply the 1.5X damage multiplier minions deal to turrets for the caster minions.  I also never did cannon minion damage.\n\nIn a non cannon wave casters deal 268 extra damage.\n\nIn a Cannon wave I missed 401 caster damage plus 255 damage by the Cannon minion.  That is 656 damage missed.  That easily pushes us past that 27 pesky health that Alistar couldn't be bothered to deal with.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nAs you can see even ignoring a lot of other possibilities like a built up wave, penetration which is naturally found in masteries in both the first two trees, CDR on ziggs giving more passive procs, better runes since I was very generous to your side of the argument when applying those, as well as damage they may have gotten on the turret before the big push we still beat a turret by over 600 health in ideal situations.  Since this is obviously not very common we can assume this was a close to ideal situation so unless they do something that costs them over 600 damage, they can easily kill a turret at 3 minutes.\n\nEdit: Some people mentioned I didn't include Ziggs W damage.  I did, I just didn't realize that I didn't make it very clear.  Turrets do not have 2625 health.  That is the health you have to burn through to get them to 25%, the execute vs turrets on a rank 1 Ziggs W.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2017-01-02T23:32:59.534+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":4,"body":"oh my god.
