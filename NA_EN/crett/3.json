I'd been farming like a beast, though, about 100 CS ahead of the next-highest player on either team.\n\nWent back to base after clearing a lane, picked up Shiv, and noticed we were dancing in mid getting ready for a fight, so I headed that way. Before I managed to get past the inner lane turret, the fight starts 5v4, and while my team's holding their own, it's a little iffy. So I ult, fly down the lane, Q as I get close - chunking their front line - and get off like 2 autos with my W. And somehow, between the burst on the Q, the bouncing blades, and the shiv proc, I picked up a triple.\n\nThey surrendered a couple minutes later (still with a gold and turret advantage), and I felt like a badass.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2015-01-22T19:54:37.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:91}} on ARAM, got poked down to like 200 hp.
