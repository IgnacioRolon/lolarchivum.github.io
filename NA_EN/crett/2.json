It feels clunky unless you play her enough times in a row to get used to it. And then one game you decide to hop on another champion, say Syndra for instance, come back to Anivia the game after, and realize just how off it feels in comparison to many other champions.\n\n-Frostbite (E) refunds its mana cost and half of its cooldown akin to Annie's Disintegrate (Q). Maybe keep the full cooldown if anything. It's hard enough farming under tower pre-6 with Anivia's abysmal auto attack animation and base stats. Sometimes you need to use Frostbite (E) to guarantee a creep otherwise not acquirable with an aa and that screws with what little mana pool you have to work with during the early laning phase to fight against the enemy opponent. \n\n-Crystallize (W) can be instantly reactivated to destroy the wall. Or if that sounds too OP, considering it's not a long cooldown ultimate ability like Jarvan's Cataclysm (R) or Azir's Emperor's Divide (R), then instead add some gimmick like _only_ Anivia being able to transition through the wall. Since she's made of ice and all... just like the wall (or she can fly over).\n\n-1% (or less) slow surrounding Crystallize (W) so that you can get an assist for using your wall in scenarios where you don't necessarily want to touch the enemy with the wall (for the 1 true damage on displacement).\n\n-The ability to reactivate Flash Frost (Q) while under crowd control effects. Or hell, just make it instantly blow up if you're CCed, so that it'll at least be useful and stun someone on your face every other time, rather than flying off into the distance and blowing up at max range.\n\n-Changing how Glacial Storm (R) works so that it can't be cancelled by enemy crowd control or your own Zhonya's active. Or half its cooldown if cancelled, so that you're not stuck flying around like a fish out of water for the next ~5 seconds of a team fight that may end before the given time interval. If going down this route... have it cancelled when egged because otherwise getting egged and having your ulti underneath you sounds toxic as hell and/or a waste of mana. \n\n-Update Anivia's Model and Textures even though it already happened sometime ago. It's just not on par with some of the newer models and textures.\n\n-Btw, is Braum's Unbreakable (E) supposed to block Anivia's Flash Frost (Q) stun? I'm almost positive that if Morgana lands a Dark Binding (Q) on Braum with his Unbreakable (E) up it'll still snare him at the very least even if it blocks the damage. Please disregard if I'm wrong with one of the two interactions.\n\n-Stuff that I've heard suggested over the years, like increasing the range on Anivia's Frosbite (E), is a nono. Making it into a skill shot - nope. Increasing the projectile speed of her Flash Frost (Q) is debatable because the tradeoff would most likely be its damage output. Drawing a wall like Rumble's ult / Viktor's Lazer seems like it'd actually net you less picks due to it not being as prompt as simply having a (snap!) perpendicular wall, but can be decent if it works right. Avoiding unit collision or having a base ms buff due to being a bird are _meh_ ideas . I don't even know how to react to the \"Crippling\" people in your ult that I heard once. And more that doesn't come to mind.","replies":[{"poster":"Silk Underwear","date":"2015-09-06T03:02:53.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You haven't had fun until you've used your W to enable a Yasuo ult :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mandaari","date":"2015-09-05T20:16:14.707+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really doesn't need much change.

Farming with her is a bit of a pain too, due to incredibly clunky AA animations and her only reliable farming mechanism costing a lot of mana.\n\nMechanically-wise, however, I find that her kit has very little need of change, every skill plays a purpose and nothing feels like filler, and her skillset gives her a very definite role even when mages tend to be samey: She's very much centralized around movement control. Her R and W skills can be used to control where the opponent can and can't move, and her Q and E are used to punish opponents who don't move cleverly with CC and tons of damage. If anything in her kit needs to be shaved off to compensate for a power increase, maybe her R + E combo, since that can be rather punishing at times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EUW Dogs","date":"2015-09-05T21:34:48.490+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She needs something against all the dashes.

My only ideas (she's pretty much all I've been playing since s3) are a look at her mana costs, a slightly longer E range (not a skillshot, but i find myself stutter-stepping a lot of the time trying to cast), a change in her aa animation (it's rather clunky when trying to farm compared to other champs), and perhaps some newer ability icons. Other than that, she is a well thought out and very fun to play champion. \n\nI do think that being able to either activate Q (or having it auto activate) when CC'd would also be a very nice change. It would allow her to still have some presence in the teamfight even if she is soloed out at the beginning, allowing her team to engage instead of being weary of fighting 4v5.\n\nI have to disagree with what some of the others in this thread have said, I think W should stay how it is, other than possibly being able to destroy the wall after a second or two.

It would be cool if it had a facing forward spikes that applied frost and damaged enemies that run into it. So like, she flaps her wings forward and the air freezes in that direction? It would be nice, because when she is backing up and trying to peel super fast champions off of herself, at least they have to deal with the threat of walking into her ice fields and walls. It would also retain her vulnerability of dying once people are on top of you. \n\nI have no problems with her Q. Her E is a little boring.
