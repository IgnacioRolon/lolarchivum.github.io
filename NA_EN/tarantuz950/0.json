I was hoping to talk to someone on phone support to better explain and give details on the account in hopes of recovering it as I had all the champs up to when I quit playing unlocked on it and a large number of skins and stuff.\r\n\r\nAlso what the heck happened to the summoner names? I logged into this alt account I made to play with some friends when they wanted to try it out a long time ago and my name was not a random assortment of letters and numbers but it seems to be now.....","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-26T17:43:26.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) that will allow you to submit an email address that you do have access to.

I have the e-mail saying my ticket went in and to wait for a response but even the link in the e-mail to look at or update the ticket just brings me to a 404 page. Is there any other way of seeing if my ticket actually went in or should I just send another one?\n\nHow long should I expect the response and such to wait? also Is there anyway to fix the name without paying for a rename?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-27T15:07:36.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's your ticket number?  I'm happy to check for you, but the AR form doesn't require logging in so you won't see it in the ticketing center.  Instead, you should expect an email with the address you submitted in the form.  Our account team should also be able to assist with a name change at not cost if it was due to inactivity or someone else.","replies":[{"poster":"Tarantuz950","date":"2017-09-27T21:52:47.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the reply, Got home from work today and had a e-mail with all the links needed to fix the account so I won't need help with the ticket.
