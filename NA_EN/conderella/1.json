The lag i get is mostly delays. Example: lets say someone was banning syndra, i would have to wait about 3 seconds after they banned, for me to see they actually banned the person. Does anyone know if there is a solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Conderella","date":"2017-02-17T15:42:23.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It didn't cause a change","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-14T05:45:22.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you running fairly *low-end* hardware?
