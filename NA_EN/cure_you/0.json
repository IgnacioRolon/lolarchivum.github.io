But apparently this also applies to videos on the topic. I watched the video and then went into a game to try and win my D2 promos, but when I got into the game I was greeted by my client crashing every single time I got into game. Up to 4 times before I realized what it was and closed my browser, which allowed me to get back into the game but ultimately lost because of how long it took me to get it to where my client wouldn&#039;t crash as soon as I got into game. I&#039;ve never had my game crash in that manner in the 7 years I&#039;ve been playing. I&#039;ve had bugsplats before but never 4 consecutive automatic crashes. I&#039;ve had other friends tell me the exact same thing had happened to them, all involving the video by vandiril\r\n\r\n\r\nClip of 2 of the crashes happening: https://clips.twitch.tv/SourCloudyAlbatrossArgieB8\r\n\r\n\r\nClip of the 4th crash and me closing the browser: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/357496529","replies":[]}
