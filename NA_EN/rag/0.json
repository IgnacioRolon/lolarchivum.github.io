Giving you 32 mana every time you cast E \n\nEdit 3 - Also works with seekers armguard. So basically every unit killing mechanic in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"LQ360MWJ","date":"2018-04-05T20:27:26.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Irelia's e stun duration on tooltip is also wrong, it suppose to be shorter at level 1, and goes up as it levels, but right now it just says 0.75 stun duration regardless of level.
