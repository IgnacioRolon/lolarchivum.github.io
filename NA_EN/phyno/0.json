A majority of tools i would need to be a good player, but i still find i lack. A little insight, I just started this game about a year ago, i was placed at S5 at the end of my placements last season, even made it up to S5 promos but stopped playing ranked, that was mostly due to fear, probably could have gone higher, who knows. I havent yet played my placement games for this season yet but i feel i am not there yet. I dont know how to single handedly carry a game, that probably happens once in 5 to 10 games. I think i am a decent player but i know to be better i will need help so i was hoping a high level player or two or more can teach me and actually see it through not just talk, look down on me and just cast me away. I really want to get to gold and willing top put in the leg work to accomplish it, might sound strange but it has always been a dream of mine. So please help me.\r\n\r\nThank you {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"xl Kirito lx","date":"2016-03-07T19:49:24.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm typically hanging around in the chat room: Sword Art Online\n\nCome by sometime, we can play a game or two.

Or are you saying you hang around swort art alot but if i am on league we can play together? lol just abit confused","replies":[{"poster":"xl Kirito lx","date":"2016-03-08T02:32:22.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a chat room referencing an anime.  Albeit it's a deserted one.  But it's mine. \n\nI'm saying, you seems like a good enough sort.  If you want help from a relatively high mmr player, I might be able to help.  To do so, I typically like to see how people play the game, how they react to specific situations, and how they play from behind.  I can look at your match history, and critique your builds all you want, but that only goes so far to actually learning.","replies":[{"poster":"Phyno","date":"2016-03-08T05:34:57.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh i see sure, so what do i do next?

For me its renekton, jax right now.\n\nKnow these champions in and out.  This means pretty much every match up you face. How much damage you do at which stages of the game. what are your win conditions (what do you need to do to be able to win as them)\n\nFocus on roughly 2 things each game until you master them from this list\n\nCS - have it above 100 at 20 min, the higher the better, if possible aim for 130\n\nDeaths - try to die less.  this one goes without saying but straight up think about it while playing.  \"what can kill me right now?\" can i go into my jungle and be safe? how much damage can my opponent do right now if they all in me?  where is the jungler last seen? (usually gank mid or top after first clear so care) etc.\n\nCD of summoner spells - know when the opposing laners summoners are up. Be careful when yours are down.\n\nCD of the opponents spells - This is the basis for all trading.  This requires trying out a lot of champs and especially knowing the match up of your champs.  a good example is fiora or jax who waste their long cd spell (riposite and counter strike).  \n\nWatch all of phylols channel.","replies":[{"poster":"Phyno","date":"2016-03-08T01:39:47.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks sounds like alot of things but i am willing to put in the leg work. The knowing how much damage i do and the enemy that is something i have never done before even though i have heard numerous times about that. Also never really paid attention to passives until now, just so many factors in the game to consider to become \"good\". \n\nI was wondering, would you teach me or help me? I know from the sound of things you know what your doing and what i have noticed with good players is they either lack the ability to teach because they feel EVERYONE should know it or they just look down on others. Its really a booming trend in league now. So if you could coach me each on these points then i would be really grateful, except csing i think i have that down already maybe need to work on csing under tower","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkGargos","date":"2016-03-07T19:26:28.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would not worry about ranks...\n\nAs long as I can see...Solo queue rank means NOTHING.\nI got promoted, played about 5 games with guys with no masteries, no jungle, -15deads minute 10, etc...Then got demoted and found a nice team...hurray, NOW I'm a good player again...wtf...\nI can do almost nothing to win a game with losers so why should it be my fault to get demoted if I done it right at my lane...this sucks....","replies":[{"poster":"Phyno","date":"2016-03-08T01:11:31.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea i think about that alot, only if ranked was not like that but it is, at least now we get to choose our team mates if we want and play ranked with them.
