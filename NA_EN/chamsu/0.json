Ive been dealing with it by turning off the sound but its getting more and more irritating the more i cant hear the actual game. its obviously not our macs if its every persons mac having the same issue which is what Riot thought it might be when I put in the ticket but thats literally saying every person who uses mac got a problem on it as soon as Patch 6.6 came out and that would be way too big of a coincidence. Please Riot, check whats going with the mac client, its not just 2 or 3 people.\n\n- Massive FPS Drops when sound is on ","replies":[]},{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-03-29T22:54:31.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you getting any specific errors?
