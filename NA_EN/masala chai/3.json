We all know that people just started playing her midlane.\n\nI&#039;m curious what to know as what you classify Diana as in your hearts, is she an AP Burst Diver? or is she an AoE AP Assassin? Or are you going to change her numbers around so that she becomes that Jungling AP Bruiser that you always wanted her to be.

Is it safe to say then that light fighters are getting the \"skirmisher\" designation then? I know in another thread you had expressed some reluctance.\n\nEither way, in regards to divers, I have a small interest in boxing (very small but I went down that rabbit hole one evening for some reason, I digress) and when you say things on divers (indirectly) like:\n\n\"assassins generally have avoidance instead of durability, patterns without ongoing AA dependence, and ways out of a fight\" \n\nit makes me think of a style of boxing called \"in-boxing\", \"swarming\", or \"crowding\".  From the Wikipedia article:\n\n\"The swarmer (in-fighter, crowder) is a fighter who attempts to overwhelm his opponent by applying constant pressure. Swarmers tend to have a very good bob and weave, good power, a good chin, and a tremendous punch output (resulting in a great need for stamina and conditioning).\"\n\n\"They also tend to have a good \"chin\" because this style usually involves being hit with many jabs before they can maneuver inside where they are more effective.[2] Many swarmers are often either shorter fighters or fighters with shorter reaches, especially in the heavier classes, that have to get in close to be effective.\"\n\nIts not perfect seeing as its an apples to oranges comparison but its just my two cents. People may not know what in-boxing is but crowding and swarming are concepts I would imagine they are familiar with as designations.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2016-04-17T09:14:24.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skirmisher,interesting.\nSo,the Fighter role is composed of Skirmishers,Juggernauts & Divers?.....Yeah,I think that covers all the Fighters.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mhihnj","date":"2016-04-17T12:14:21.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">his alpha strike\n\nwha....","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2016-04-17T12:26:51.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In this case, alpha strike refers to the initial burst.\n\nAlpha Strike is the name of Yi's Q.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2016-04-17T08:32:33.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So that's to say champions on the border between two classes might see smaller scope changes come a class update for either class, like the really light changes for Urgot during the Marksman Update?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-04-17T08:52:52.561+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Potentially yeah.

Anyone who plays AP Diana would know this. You clearly dont play her. And if Zed is still seeing play in the pro league pretty sure back line deleting is still highly desireable. You should probably go watch her spotlight where the very first class word to describe her is assassin. So She's an assassin that builds AP and deals magic damage. Sounds like a melee mage/assassin to me. She does just enough but to put this in perspective for you Tank Ekko is considered broken. This is something whined about by the community and even pros that play him outright feel that he is too strong. See how that works? If something is too good it gets pro play.

She isn't especially durable she ends up with maybe a few points of MR than Zed if she has MR blues and goes Abyssal and no one is claiming zed is tanky.

Have you never played against a Q max Leblanc. QRW and you will be dead or close to it just after one item. Also, her ult is interupptable.

You can stop her mid ult.\n\nYou think A fizz using e to land on top of you dropping a shark on your face and then dashing through with Q is easier to dodge than a skill shot that hooks. if you can't dodge a max range Diana Q that you mentioned in particular thats literally on you unless you get creep blocked which is about positioning. \n\nThe only way a Diana is diving you at level 6 is with jungle help which is coordinated or if you were already softened up and you have no CC or somehow miss every ability. Literally just play Ahri or Lux and as soon as she's under tower use light binding or charm and she will die period. \n\nDiana's job is to dive the backline and erase a squishy member. You're the one saying she is too good at that. Champions that are too good at their jobs win more games. Voli is super strong because he has damage that scales on health which he builds to be tanky and still gets to chomp on people and his ganks are pretty solid. He's not in pro play because coordination shits all over him. And you've clearly never played against a Talon as Diana after getting set behind by a gank because getting bursted by Talon pre hourglass is pretty easy.\n\nAlso the main strength of the shield is in its scaling and needs levels. Her shield is not allowing her to tank 4 tower shots and come out alive. If that happens you messed up. You dropped the ball. No one should dive you one v one at level 6 and take a bunch fo shots without dying.\n\nI think you dont want to accept that maybe just maybe you goof agaisnt her and probably get into your own head. I bet you play stuff like Ziggs or Karthus against her and then get mad she's bursting you out. Calling someone tanky when they will never get to some ridiculous status where they can get focus fired is deceptive. You are not being honest when you say that. I just played a game as her and if I would have run MR blues I would have had 65 MR at level 18 and then if I had built abyssal maybe about 110. Is that really what it means to be tanky in your eyes? That means nothing when you factor in an AP mid is gonna build a void staff and probably sorc boots and their own abyssal dropping it all back down to like 50 MR if that.","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Scott Free ","date":"2016-04-18T03:29:50.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=C9 Feel The Bern,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ddKZQNMl,comment-id=000100030000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-04-18T03:27:59.834+0000)\n>\n> So basically even though she isn&#x27;t stomping and winning a bunch of games you dont think thats a sign that maybe she isn&#x27;t too oppressive.

But she's that good at _both_, and _that_ is a problem. Of course I've already explained this two or more times before now, so I'm not really expecting it to sink in this time either...\n\n>I've played against morg mid. You lost that match up because the Diana was a way better Diana than you are more. If you had Max w she would have been under tower the whole time and taking pool damage.\n\nThat's one hell of an assumption, multiple assumptions actually. I _do_ max W first. Shoving Diana to tower all day just gets you killed by their jungler or dove by Diana if she lands a couple Qs pre 6 or just a single Q post 6.\n\nEven if it weren't for those issues it's not that effective to try to shove Diana all day. Her waveclear is pretty good, in part thanks to her passive. Also Morgana has ridiculously bad mana early on, shoving waves all day with W leavers her oom really fast. Trying to use a lot of autos on minions to aid your Ws as Morg leaves you a lot more vulnerable to poke because locking in that aa animation makes it nearly impossible to dodge fast abilities like Diana's Q so you have to be really careful how and where you use them if Diana's Q isn't on cd.\n\n>Her shield relies on scaling as in it stays at one point until level 8 and she won't have substantial AP until later\n\nWhich is one of the reasons she's not that great against ganks pre 6. Though saying it stays at one point until lvl 8 is a bit of a stretch. She tends to back one to three times before lvl 8, in part because she has TP, and usually buys some extra AP while doing so. She might also have scaling AP runes. It might not be \"substantial AP\" but it still matters, especially when repeated several times over the course of laning.\n\n>Saying she's tank because she has 53 MR is bad because that's normAl for melee champions.\n\nYou're _really_ bad at understanding what I write... MR/lvl alone doesn't make someone tanky, and sure as hell doesn't make someone a tank. But particularly when combined with hp or effective hp (such as her shield...), it can contribute a lot towards making someone tank_y_. She often buys abyssal scepter first when her lane opponent is a mage, further increasing this effect.\n\n>Complaining about her outplaying aka anticipation is also illogical. You were playing Morg who has one if the craziest weird hit boxes in the game but I'm sure if I said she was too good at killing people you would laugh.\n\nI never complained about her outplaying anyone. Morg's only hitbox shenanigans is the width of her Q and ever since the update to her spell textures it's not that far off. Still, I don't laugh at people who complain that they got hit by it when it clearly didn't hit them visually.\n\nMorg is actually awful at killing people, but that's not Morg's job. If someone complained Morg is too good at catching/ccing people their complaint would at least make sense, though considering the speed of her Q (and the fact that it isn't passthrough) and the long channel time of her R, I'd be inclined to disagree. People regularly complain about the root duration on Morg's Q, and yeah, at max ranks it _is_ long. Without that duration her W damage would be almost a non factor 1v1 and setting up her own R stuns would almost never happen. However, her long Q root can be pretty oppressive when she has allies to follow up, which is a big part of why Morg support (who maxes Q first usually) is a thing.\n\n>There is no point in the game where a Diana can safely dive a Morg unless she's reAlly or morg misplayed. Ask other Diana players. It just doesn't work. You go in she presses R activates black shield drop a pool and q riots once the stun is over and you die there or base.\n\nI'm gonna assume \"really\" is supposed to say \"really fed.\" The problem is that Morg doesn't survive Diana's burst, despite black shield. So the R stun never happens. The Q root isn't long enough early on because as mid Morg you're maxing W first. Morg's W does increased damage based on missing hp. Morg can't really poke Diana down before hand without running oom using W or landing Qs Diana should never be hit by. Plus Diana's shield in trades and while diving keep her hp high for longer than most.\n\nLater on, Morg's Q will go up in ranks and she gets decent AP so her burst damage from Q + R is a lot higher, making her W even more effective, but at lvl 6 none of this is the case. Diana's shield also prevents damage, reducing Morgana's healing from her spell vamp passive, reducing her effective hp a little. So Diana combos Morg, Morg's R never does its secondary damage or stun, and Diana casually walks away with ease...\n\n>You're basically saying you want her nerfed because you're bad at playing against her.\n\nWhen did I ever say I wanted her nerfed in this thread? I don't want Diana straight up nerfed, I want her power shifted some. I want her to have some counterplay post 6 besides \"throw cc at her and pray.\" I want her to not be quite so damn snowbally due to scaling both offensively and defensively in large amounts, and both from the same stat (like Riven, who is a problem for the same reason). I want her weaknesses to exist without having to out number her.\n\n>And I've played against enough maw Steraks adds to know that one spell rotation is hot killing then anymore.\n\nEarly on no, but by the time most people get those items Diana often has some AP as well. Her sustained damage due to her passive and low cds means can still get the kills in a lot of cases. The champs that can rush Maw vs her can be a bit of a problem sure, but she can roam well, especially with TP, and find kills elsewhere easily. Still, maw and sterak's are effective against her and this season have hurt her win rate. And yet her win rate is still fine...
