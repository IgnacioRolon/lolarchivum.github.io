Here in riot we have solution!","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":95,"down_votes":24,"body":"Let us give you the worst players in the game in order to lose you gotta be 50% win ratio boy anything higher than that its trigger us!\n\n&quot;But dude if you lose its just that you play with better players dude that why you lose you just got higher in MMR &quot; (Some random person would say)\n\nSo i was like maybe they are right so let me check their OP.gg to see what is going\n\nMy team -100 MMR than me 1 division lower than me their match history full with negative scores and defeat \n....ok i guess the enemy team would be the same... NOPE\n\nEnemy team same MMR as ME! not my team! everyone normal games in their match history\n\nSo its pretty much obvious that riot give you lower players than your self and enemies that is in your elo in order to make it no possible to win \n\nSo my question here is why? why i get the players that are lower than me when i am on winning streak? and the enemy team is on my lvl? why is that system exist?\n\nBut to be fair that happen in the opposite...if you have a losing streak you will get the exact opposite....\n\nWtf is that system riot? i dont really get it why it exist and not this is not illuminati stuff i mean we have OP..GG to check the enemies and our team..we see that the matches are unfair WTH riot?","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2017-05-29T04:59:46.208+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":7,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"nice

I'm not though I'm in platnum. I honestly believe that your hidden elo numbers keep you matched up with people to try and MAINTAIN that elo. Here's why. I have been kicked around from anywhere to bronze one to platnum one throughout my years of playing. Anytime I get dropped a division I have to play like 5 games and I basically auto gain a rank when I win one game. This is because my elo is higher than the players I am playing with. However this works in the opposite way as well. Say I'm gold 3 And trying to rank up but my elo is lower than gold 3. Riot will match me with a team to try to lower my rank so it matches my hidden elo. When your rank matches your hidden elo it becomes impossible to climb because every win makes your next game not in your favor due to how slow hidden elo actually goes up or down. So if you reach platnum 1 and you want to get into diamond but your hidden elo is platnum 3 your probably not going to get into diamond. Or if you do manage to get into diamond you better hope you get a lucky streak of games so you don't get demoted..","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pathfinder Yasuo","date":"2017-05-29T20:12:33.621+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"22 loss spree\n15 win spree\n15 loss spree\n\ndemoted from d3 to p1 ecks fucking dee","replies":[]},{"poster":"Civafu","date":"2017-05-29T15:47:01.162+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/uYw5Bj9.png?noredirect\n\nThe week just started but I can already see I'm going for P5 before it ends.","replies":[]}]}
