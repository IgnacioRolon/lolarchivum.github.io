I&#039;ve run into a major problem in league of leagues. All around I find myself to be a decent player and I&#039;m trying to climb out of bronze to prove it, but Here is the problem. I find myself always camped every game and I can&#039;t find out why. I play ADC and Mid as my primary roles, but even when I play top lane I find this to be an issue. I usually find myself ahead of even in lane and the all of a sudden it 4 v 2 or 4 v 1 tower dive (who thought bronze could tower dive). At best I trade 1 for 1. I keep my lane warded quite well to see this coming to back off, but that&#039;s when the tower dives come in. Afterwards the other lanes are in my lane or the jungler always is. I can&#039;t farm at all during this and it causes me to fall massively behind. I usually can&#039;t get any help from my team (YAY Bronze) and they usually flame me for being camped. I have changed my champion pool because I thought it was that, I&#039;m played more passively, I&#039;ve begged and pleaded to my team for assistance, and I even walked away from the towers just to get chased down and killed. I can&#039;t figure out why I&#039;m always camped and how to stop them. I need advice and badly. I&#039;ve lost my last 10 games because I couldn&#039;t do anything from being camped. Please help with any advice you can. Please don&#039;t trash talk or flame in chat, I&#039;m asking for honest advice. Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Killer3000189","date":"2017-09-05T02:36:41.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're being constantly camped as hard as you say you are then constantly let your team and jungler know so they can get free objectives like mid and jungle push out mid tower or jungle gets drag/rift/ or he can counter jungle so the enemy jungler gets behind","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elohaven","date":"2017-09-05T02:31:15.832+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's play a game.

The problem is at low   elo you can't rely on your team to capitalize on all the heat you're bringing to yourself so it all goes to waste eventually. \n\nMy suggestion is to be proactlve instead and use your lead to roam first and get your team ahead as well so the enemy won't be able to focus on you with impunity. Plus they can't camp someone who's roaming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhantomGG","date":"2017-09-05T02:37:21.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly if you are truley \"Good\" mechanically than what is most likely happening, is that you are fluently out playing your fellow laner, which is causing you to be more pushed. You have the mechanics to win lane but you lack the game knowledge to stop and go \"Am i about to be ganked? where is the jungler?\" \n\nI see this happen many times with my bronze and silver friends who have mechanics but terrible game sense. They win lane, they heavily push but it's because they win lane that gets them camped.\n\nTLDR if your pushing lane, you are a easy target for the jungler.\n\nEdit\n\nSolution: Get in some deep wards, remember to buy a pink every time you back. Once every twenty seconds stop to ask yourself \"Am i in danger of getting ganked?\" \n\nThis will help you out greatly\n\nedit 2\n\nMany junglers often put it on their to do list to shut down who they feel is the best player on the enemy team, so this can also be it if your telling the truth.
