I tried restarting the game 2 times then i got fed up and had to restart my whole laptop just to get in game. Needless to say i was out for 10 mins and already lost tower on my lane; we lost(also i was playing with a rito employee). Side note since im here, I also get a bug where my hub, minimap, score/time/cs screen is gone(from earlier games). It was completely blank asides from my char and the backgrounds and i had to restart the game to get it back... any help?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-26T22:13:02.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you've connected to the game but a driver issue or something else failed to render the game.
