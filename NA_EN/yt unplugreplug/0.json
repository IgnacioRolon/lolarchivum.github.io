I think the only reason people didn't use it as much is because the whole system itself was more or less neglected. I mean, I don't think I've ever seen anything in the patch notes for years about item sets, and items from Nexus Siege are still in there from devs just not bothering with it.\n\nI know RIOT is trying it's best to cater to as broad of an audience as possible, and I won't criticize you for being busy or not catering to everything **_I_** want from the game, but if even a basic item set system could find it's way into the full launch of the new client, I'm sure a LOT of people would be happy. Bonus points if you can maintain and care for the system, and maybe even bring attention to it every once in a while :)\n\nThank you, Huevo! :D","replies":[{"poster":"DSG Shinigami","date":"2016-11-12T20:09:26.215+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"believe it or not, your input does matter. riot has changed things due to what the community has said about it before. like Lux's original form.

And I'm not trying to be rude when I say that, it is just that you seem to be making some bad assumptions here. Many people who use item sets have it set up so that they have essential, defensive, offensive items, maybe even some situational. They might also have a six item build with some other items to switch out underneath if needed for certain situations. People for the most part aren't making inflexible item sets, they're usually pretty flexible from what I have seen in my own builds, my friends, and those shared by the community. The situational thinking is done before hand when making the set, that way they don't have to worry about it as much in game. For instance I may have up to four core items in my builds, with some defense and offense choices. These choices are those that work best with the core items and kit, but can be interchanged with other items. I do this because it takes me a while to think up which item is the best for my current in game situation from all the items, it helps speed it up a lot to have a small subset to look at of three items. \n\nWhat happens in game when I have to think of the items to buy is I lose focus of whats going on in the game, I might miss the fact I'm getting ganked, miss an easy skill shot, or not notice I've reached lane and am standing in a minion wave; basically I get distracted by it and my performance drops considerably. Without item sets I would be a potato for the laning phase as I try to figure out what it is I need. With item sets I can spend that time putting full attention the game and predicting my enemies movements, predicting the timing of enemy ganks, and calculating how much burst and dps me and the enemy would do to each other if I engaged at any given moment seeing who would come out with more health. \n\nAlso item sets are a great tool to learn how to build a champion. There are some lesser played champions with the only guides for on the internet that you can find either being from seasons ago, containing removed items, or they just don't make sense/work. For champions like those custom item sets are an essential tool in figuring out which items work. For instance when I started playing I bought Warwick because the idea of a life stealing tank really appealed to me, however his recommended page wasn't very good, it called for a full tank Warwick, completely ignoring the life steal feature I had bought him for. So I made a custom item set, starting out by listing out every item that from description seemed to work with his kit. I would try some items together trying to balance his stats, would find some not to work, and remove them one by one. After about two months of trying to figure out a build that actually worked(and my friends constantly telling me it wasn't possible, that he was unplayable), I made a few builds that worked. I went back to look at the guides online and none had the build. My point is that it can really help with learning a champion, bots really only help you learn the kit of a champ, they aren't challenging enough to see if a build works beyond if it is completely worthless. And yeah you should know what to build in different situations if you know the champion well enough,but then there's those that don't and I don't think ten boring bot matches is going to change that, especially when they don't last long enough to build items. Also even if I know the champion I still end up zoning out a bit in lane trying to think of what to build, that or spend an extra 20s at base. Frankly some people just aren't mentally wired to play and consider their build at the same time.","replies":[{"poster":"Xeniphon","date":"2017-03-01T10:15:57.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sir, have hit THE NAIL ON THE HEAD! {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n\nGive 'em a prize.
