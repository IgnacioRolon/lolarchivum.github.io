Riot please add them back. They are so useful for making builds and in game it is so convenient to have your items right in the tab instead of having to type in the name it saves so much time. It cant be that hard to bring Item Sets back, so please i&#039;m begging you Riot to please add them into the new client. (Other than that i love the new client, super slick. Good Job :)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-11-09T21:52:17.857+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion/GVtKEY5V-alpha-client-item-sets?comment=0000","replies":[]},{"poster":"BuffLeeFFS","date":"2016-11-16T19:28:36.197+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I really want them back , please riot. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Timotool","date":"2017-03-19T20:50:13.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot pls.
