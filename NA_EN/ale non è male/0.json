AI counts, just no customs).\n- Own Gangplank before the event ends on August 10th at 2:00AM PST.\n\nIf you did the above, you'll receive Captain Gangplank within the next three days. :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-08-10T21:20:27.951+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't have to own him when you played.
