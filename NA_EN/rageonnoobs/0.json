I cannot get into the details of what we are notcing during the game. Basically how it works is that if I were to let you know what was found then the players who are trolling or intentionally feeding would just move on to another way of trolling and we would always be one step behind them. that make sense to you ?\r\n(08:22:54 PM) RageOnNoobs: Ive played this game for years and i dont understand. How was i intentinonally feeding\r\n(08:23:45 PM) RageOnNoobs: I want a reason to why as to why i was banned not because of what someone else thinks i was doing\r\n(08:24:01 PM) RageOnNoobs: Everyone has bad games. This is a 1 game ban\r\n(08:24:08 PM) RageOnNoobs: I got reported in 1 incident\r\n(08:24:16 PM) RageOnNoobs: And ive been banned and lost my honor\r\n(08:24:44 PM) Cammy White: Well I wish I could tell you but I cannot get into specifcs of what we noticed during the game, but this is clearly intentional feeding and we will have to keep it in place.\r\n(08:24:59 PM) RageOnNoobs: Do you actually play this game?\r\n(08:25:21 PM) RageOnNoobs: Because i want to know as to why im banned and youre giving me no answers\r\n(08:25:41 PM) RageOnNoobs: You cant give me specifics because you dont even know what i did wrong\r\n(08:25:58 PM) RageOnNoobs: Thats why im mad. What did i do wrong?\r\n(08:26:09 PM) RageOnNoobs: Did i run it down mid?\r\n(08:26:12 PM) RageOnNoobs: What did i do?\r\n(08:26:29 PM) RageOnNoobs: Is there a manger i can talk to\r\n(08:27:11 PM) RageOnNoobs: I just dont like getting banned for no reason.\r\n(08:27:13 PM) Cammy White: I already explained our stance on Intentional feeding and I know this is not what you wanted to hear, but we cannot get into details with you on how we noticed this, from what I explained prior\r\n(08:27:28 PM) RageOnNoobs: Then explain to me what did i do that was intentional\r\n(08:27:42 PM) RageOnNoobs: Do i report everyone for intentinally feeding?\r\n(08:27:48 PM) RageOnNoobs: No\r\n(08:27:53 PM) RageOnNoobs: Everyone has bad games\r\n(08:27:59 PM) RageOnNoobs: What dont you understand\r\n(08:28:14 PM) RageOnNoobs: The logic\r\n(08:28:26 PM) RageOnNoobs: Banning someone for no reason\r\n(08:28:50 PM) RageOnNoobs: Do you actually watch the replay when you ban somoene?\r\n(08:29:01 PM) RageOnNoobs: Or do you take someones word for it and just ban them\r\n(08:29:21 PM) Cammy White: I wish I could get into this with you but again I cannot discuss what was found, I know that this is frustrating but there is not much else I could tell you beyond that we did notice and confirmed that you were involved in Intentional feeding\r\n(08:29:34 PM) RageOnNoobs: How so\r\n(08:29:37 PM) RageOnNoobs: Explain please\r\n(08:29:58 PM) RageOnNoobs: Youre just telling me that i was intentionally feeding yet you cant come up with an answer\r\n(08:30:55 PM) RageOnNoobs: Is there someone i can talk to\r\n(08:31:00 PM) RageOnNoobs: I need to resolve this issue\r\n(08:31:14 PM) RageOnNoobs: Is there a manager i can speak with\r\n(08:32:05 PM) Cammy White: You have reached the highest point of escalation and even if you were to speak with another agent they would tell you the same thing. Since we have gone over this several times I will have to close this chat to help other players, was there anything else you needed before I go ?\r\n(08:32:22 PM) RageOnNoobs: No i need to resolve this\r\n(08:32:30 PM) RageOnNoobs: You are banning innocent players\r\n(08:32:40 PM) RageOnNoobs: If you go i will post this on reddit\r\n(08:33:08 PM) RageOnNoobs: i want reason with actual facts\r\n(08:33:09 PM) *** Cammy White left the chat ***","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-07-01T21:31:48.468+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watched the replay (as anyone can do for ranked games within 20 games), and I'm pretty sure I can see the point where it would trigger the system.\n\nAt around 6min you go from the enemy jungle to die to the mid tier 1 tower from max health, making no effort to get out of tower range (in fact, it looks like you intentionally stayed in tower range).\n\nImmediately after that death, instead of going back up to top you go back to mid and towerdive Leblanc that was two levels higher than you.
