I started playing this game around the start of season 2, I had seen my friends playing it and really just wanted another way to connect with my friends and have a good time ( a 5v5 team game? yeah that&#039;s one of the best ways to do it). When I started I of course was a total noob, so bad to the point that I didn&#039;t understand the item building system, but of course I got better. Once I got up to the skill level of my friends we would spend hours playing together and have the best of times. Those were the good days. And now things have taken a turn for the worse.\r\n\r\nNow none of my friends play anymore. The game is nowhere near as fun as it used to be. I miss the days where a player could make a mistake and not get harassed for being &quot;the worst player in the game&quot;. This game has degraded into a cesspool of whiners, trolls, and simply some of the most horrible people that I have ever encountered. I would be hard pressed to say how many times I have been told to kill myself, or uninstall, or that someone was going to go kill my family, all this nonsense over a GAME. The sad part is, this happens in every single ranked game. In every game there is someone on the losing and even sometimes the winning team who is harassing one of their teammates because they absolutely are the reason why they are losing. I&#039;m not here to complain about bronze hell (yes I am a bronze player) I&#039;m simply here to ask you to allow US your loyal player base to fix this. Bring back the tribunal, ban IP addresses after a player has received so many bans. Just do something.\r\n\r\nAll in all I just want to say this. Please Riot  give me back my league of legends. Give me back the good times that I used to have while playing this game. I sadly have nearly reached the point of giving up on this game. I just want league of legends to become an enjoyable experience again. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nArk the Valiant","replies":[{"poster":"Ã¾latypus","date":"2017-03-11T18:11:44.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really hope riot responds to at least one of the posts like this... across the ladder toxicity is reaching disgusting levels.

It does not help you get better, all it does is trigger you with the retards and what have you. 2) before every game type /mute all. and if you don't like the idea of muting everyone before a game simply mute someone right as they become toxic. you don't have to deal with that nonsense. And i can not re-iterate this enough, never NEVER under ANY circumstances respond to a troll, okay? Just don't. Because your punishment will be far worse even if \"they started it, it wasn't my fault.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"FEDXSai","date":"2017-03-11T03:48:26.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"uh i guess my advice would be play it safe so you don't lose credibility.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-03-11T03:04:28.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the tribunal is the same as IFS...\n\nThe IFS punishes based on what the community deems as unacceptable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FEDXSai","date":"2017-03-11T02:04:20.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why dont you just mute the cess pool? the reason why bronze players get pissed is because theyre afraid of actually being bad at the game, make smart shot calling decisions and they will respect you. if not then i would say play norms and random games modes more often since you cant put up with impatient players. i would say adding mics would make this game a lot better, maybe add a call limit where you can only speak for 4 secs? just be what they ask you until they realize how big of an ass they're being. its harder to calm down from anger than it is to empathize and apologize to the person your toxxxxxxx'in","replies":[{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2017-03-11T02:20:05.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't matter if you are a challenger smurf at bronze with 20/0, while your team is 0/10.
