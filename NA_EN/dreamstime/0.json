No! This was the best thing ever!\"\n> \n> im ready for my downvotes\n\nYou deserve your downvotes.  I played teambuilder almost every day from first day it came online.  Always had people to play against.  In many games even though I don't do ranked I got to play against gold, platinum and occasionally even diamond players by their borders.  I think a lot of people played and liked teambuilder.","replies":[{"poster":"killferd","date":"2016-01-15T13:50:23.833+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"me, my brother and four cousins, one's wife......

I've had the most fun and I've met the coolest people because of team builder. You could've done things people would consider off-meta but team builder just accepted it. Want to play Soraka jungle? Go for it. Sure you had to wait a long time but you would eventually get picked. If you got in-game the captain and the other people CHOSE to let you stay. They could've kicked you or rejected you instantly. They knew what they were getting. Let's say you just bought Kennen or something and you wanted to to go top to try him out. You would be accepted and then to your surpise you see Amumu jungle, AP trist mid, Gnar Adc and Heimer supp. You somehow made it to a full yordle team. You decide to stay in the team and you end up winning the game. Everyone had fun and you all add each other afterwards. After that you can do comps together like all demacia, all noxus, etc. You will never see that in the new champ select. New champ select will strictly be what's fotm/meta. You won't be able to play Vladimir mid because that's clearly not meta even though you're a Vlad main since his release. The new champ select is perfect for RANKED. No more trolls complaining about not getting their main roles. So what's left? Blind pick normals? The place were everyone complains about not getting their roles and people just instalocking? You had freedom in teambuilder and riot is taking that away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dreyrr","date":"2016-01-15T03:19:35.877+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I really would like to see in the future (since that I can still use team builder) is that there is a queue where I can grind a freshly bought champion between bots (if I want to) or ARAM and Draft Pick/Ranked. I mean: if I want to pick a primary and secondary role and I'm still learning some champions and/or their/other roles to get better, then the chance is significantly increased we will lose the game when I would need to do a new champion on a lane where I am not used to. \n\nAlso, I know that you could have a harsh time when you are in Team Builder laning against a champion you just can't beat. What happens? The learning potential is the matter of fact you will get in the game. You won't or can't play your best, but you will learn so much about champions. I think Team Builder is for the people who are in between 30 and Ranked and casuals. If you go directly into Ranked, you will end in bronze V, most likely.  \n\nLearning against bots is something what should be done one time to learn the abilities, eventually. But mostly I play ARAM to check what abilities can do / get used to what they do and after that I grind the champions I own in Team Builder.\n\nAnd for the casuals: I love to play a game where I can just play what and where I want. That takes like an hour maximum. Since I have less and less time because of my study, I cannot afford to potentially waste 3 hours to finally play what I want on that day. In the new champion select, the champion could be banned according to the meta or be picked by another (or you just have the wrong role for it). Despite that games take long, it would be mostly a time-waste. And yes, that will bring more trolls.\n\nLong story short: Team Builder is a practice mode between 30 and Ranked for specific champions and/or specific roles. It offers more than the bot games and ARAM (which aren't representative due to respectively the chicken-outs / laning / placing wards of bots and the teamfights). The game should have a learning potential and Team Builder was the way to go for people to prepare for Ranked or even Draft picks. \n\nAnd I saw a employee of Riot reply in another thread: blind pick == team builder. The correlation is in my opinion just not right when Riot releases a mode for (ranked) draft pick and take away the supported (improved) mode for blind pick (eliminating trolls). Although I am sure that the team builder 2.0 for Blind pick will be imminent. \n\nLastly, don't get me wrong. I love the look of the new champion select for draft pick and ranked. I know that it was needed for the continuity and I will definitely use it sometime. It will help the people who are beyond the training part for several champions and roles. Although there is a part of the community that loves blind team builder due to valid reasons like learning or having less time. I mean: the average player is someone who is working already or on a university for a bachelor or master. Through the years, they will have less and less time. That continuity should be taken in account too. \n\nP.S. I am not the best league player, but I have fun and I'm willing to learn. Taking away Team Builder is taking away the opportunity to learn the game properly for me and maybe most players or the opportunity to have fun / casual play. And I guess that games all have to have an element of fun. That is one group of players. The other one are the competitive people for whom this update was needed and is great.","replies":[]}]}
