With supports being less popular than average, this would allow people to grind some games as support for their fair share and then not worry about it for awhile.  Basically this gives people a little more freedom in it lets them choose to support instead of being autofilled when they don&#039;t want to.  This way they&#039;ve done their work as support so they are protected from auto fill.  Also, if someone is planning on playing 5 games in one day, they can queue up as a support for their first match and then they won&#039;t have to worry about it for the rest of the day.  \r\n\r\nI mean non-supports still won&#039;t like having to support, but at least this way they can put their needed support games into a bank and forget about it for awhile.  \r\n\r\n**Why this is good for support secondaries and mains:**\r\nAre you a support secondary player who is always getting support?  Would you like to play your main role more often?  Well with this banking system you can go a few games in your main role without worrying about putting support as your secondary and getting it again.\r\n\r\nFor support mains who&#039;d like to play their other role every now and then, this would let you get mid or jungle or whatever out of your system for awhile instead of being pulled into a support because of autofill despite playing 90% of your games as support.","replies":[{"poster":"WingsofGulgazor","date":"2017-03-16T21:33:27.413+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a support main sometimes I wanna play something else so it would be nice that after say 40 games of support that if I want to play 5 games of mid I can guarantee that spot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2017-03-16T18:33:43.890+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except, people don't just get autofilled to support.

I honestly dont mind playing support when i'm autofilled in that position. What i despise the most, though, is being autofilled as adc or jungle(this role used to be fun for me but, i now consider it too frustrating) and it happens more often than getting support. Personally, i consider autofill completely unnecessary, especially after playing endless games in the old teambuilder.....","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2017-03-16T18:06:36.583+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm.

Numbers could probably be tweaked. 20% is a little more than needed probably since support mains do exist afterall.

Let's say jungle or ADC gets a lot of autofill.  With this system in place you could either do it per role, or have it set up such that as long as you are playing one of the common autofilled roles the required percentage of the time, you are free to play your main two the rest of the time.\n\nPart of me thinks that as long as people could see a number, then some people will be a little more proactive about playing a needed role.  Even if they don't, they won't be able to complain because they know they aren't queuing in a needed role often enough.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2017-03-17T01:19:25.996+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would also allow you to go into all your support games knowing full well you will get that role and prepare rune pages accordingly.

They're not going to volunteer for such a system, and they've likely accumulated quite the backlog of games that they'd need to play in order to get immunity. \n\nThen you've got people like me, who don't mind Auto Fill, having been filled only once in 62 ranked games. I don't feel like I need Auto Fill protection, so why would I queue up Support? I'd need to play about 15 games of Support straight in order to get protection for a single game. At my current rate I could play over 900 ranked games before being Auto Filled into Support that often.\n\nIf the system somehow got everyone to chip in and play at least 20% Support, you'd have a situation where Support is more popular than another role. You'd have 20% Top players, 20% Jungle players, 20% Mid players, 20% ADC players, and 100% Support players queuing up for it. So now you need people to play Jungle, or ADC, or whatever else 20% of the time as well. Eventually, the ideal system comes down to each player playing each role 20% of the time, instead of the playerbase being more or less divided into 20% chunks that play their desired role 100% of the time.\n\nMaybe I'm just missing something, but I don't see how this plan is suppose to be better than the current system.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2017-03-17T00:50:01.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The improvement works for players who are logical.\n\nNon-supports or whatever is in demand have to know that from time to time they are going to get autofilled.  So basically they'd know that if they don't queue as a support soon, they are going to get it whether they want to or not.  \n\nThis would also work in that if you get autofilled a lot, say to the point you've got more than 20% of your games as support, this system would act as a short term protection for you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-03-17T06:07:57.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be fine with this so long as it calculated the percentage from games played after the implementation.
