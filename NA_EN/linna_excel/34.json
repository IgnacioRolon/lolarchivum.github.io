While it doesn't cost so much, the stats are meh.  Only 50 AP, 10 mana/5, 10% CDR,and 20% spell vamp.\n\nReducing the AP it gave its buyer by 30 and adding the mana turned off a lot of people who used to get it and frankly it is difficult to justify now.  There are just too many other good options out there for AP champs.\n\nSo how do you fix it?\n\nI was looking at Athene's when it hit me.  This item need to build out of a chalice and work similarly to Athenes.  Here's how I'd fix it.\n\nFirst the recipe.  I'd make it {{item:3145}} plus a {{item:3028}} and set the total cost about 2500 gp.  Then I'd redo what it gives you stats wise. \n\nHere's what I'd have it give:\n40 AP\n40 MR\n10 Mana/5\n10% CDR\n\nThen I'd add the following passives\n20% spell vamp\n+1% mana regen per 1% missing\nOn a kill or assist, you get back 12% of your health (it'd also share a unique name with Athene's mana version so you can't double up).\n\nSo I'd essentially remake it into Athene's for AP champs who'd prefer health sustain.  No it won't give a lot of AP, but I think the bonus MR and the new passive would make it much more appealing overall.\n\nThat's great (I hope you are saying) but what about people who just want spell vamp... the manaless champs.  Well, not to worry, I have an idea for that too.  I was thinking ahead to make those players happy as well.\n\nThe Excel Scepter (I'm sure this name will get changed of course) :(\n\n{{item:1026}} + {{item:3145}} + 740 GP = 2800\n\n* 100 AP\n* 20% spell vamp\n* Passive: on hit, you do 10 (+.10 AP) magic damage and gain back that much as health.\n\nThis new items does 3 things: improves spell vamp itemization, particularly for non-mana champions.  It will diversify AP builds more.  Finally it'll give another item for AP on hit players to look at like kayle and teemo players.","replies":[{"poster":"PirSultanAbdal","date":"2014-02-20T10:36:09.534+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm sorry but you are missing a vital point.\n\nSpellvamp items were meant to be AD-lifesteal counterpart for mages. Back to then when Lifeleech was in its prime time, you could fill your health with 2-3 shots and stacking BTs on AD carries was a thing. Riot nerfed both lifesteal and spellvamp for early and mid game. They wanted game to be more dynamic.\n\nWhat spellvamp seemed to causing problems was, unlike AD, there was no power limit for AP champions. AP was limitless power, you could increase your AP with Rabadon by %, there is no alternative for it on AD side. Your autoattacks and on-hit spells were only things you could rely on, if you were stacking lifesteal. But in a chaotic teamfight, you cannot guess how many times you will land a skillshot or autoattack successfully before you die or untill you have no power to fight and have to run away.\n\nYou don't have much to worry about how many spells you'll be able to hit before you die or unable to fight anymore and run away. That's because mages (who mostly benefits spellvamp) are fairly safe or has mechanics to help them to get away with that sticky situation without any harm.\n\n\nBut yeah, the biggest reason Riot dislikes spellvamp (and the reason casual playerbase in this community whines) is, there is not really a hard limit for ability power and magic damage. Think about this:\n\nLich bane is Trinity Force's AP counterpart. Whilst Trinity Force's spellblade won't scale with AD or anything, Lich Bane actually scales with more ability power you have in your disposal.\n\nAlso that's another reason why non-spell effects won't proc spellvamp (for example lich bane's spellblade effect and Arcane Blade mastery) is to limit the incredible power of combo mages and safe casters.\n\nUnlike spellvamp, lifesteal procs almost every non-spell effects if they are dealing physical damage (for example, Sheen and Trinity force)\n\nCurrent WotA is amazingly slot inneficient and there is no reason to buy it over gunblade. Gunblades active is also lovely and scales with AP and procs spellvamp too.","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2014-02-20T17:12:15.982+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always thought the \"equivalent\" (if you can call it that) of Deathcap in AD was Infinity Edge; Spells can't crit and never will be able to.

But critical chance is completely chance-reliant factor. The number generator works different in this game, but it really doesn't matter unless you are Yasuo and/or have %100 crit chance. Then what you say can only be applied to those who has GUARANTEED critical damage and/or increased critical damage through runes and Infinity Edge.\n\nHowever, the magical counterpart of this item, Rabadon i mean, as you think, GUARANTEES to increase your every AP relevant ability/item.\n\nAlso, even when you have a guranteed critical damage, it also requires you to autoattack your target subsequently to be efficient or equal with AP counterparts, casters and combo mages i mean.\n\nCritical chance is still not as much effective as a pure Ability power and Attack Damage is no match to Magic Damage. Also keep in mind that there are so little item choices to counter AP/magic damage dealers, whilst there are many alternatives to counter AD/autoattack reliant champions such as FH, Randuins, Thornmail, Ninja Tabi, Doran's Shield, tier 1-2 defensive masteries etc.","replies":[{"poster":"NoxiousIce","date":"2014-02-21T09:18:22.092+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except that most spells don't automatically hit, and most spells don't have basically no cooldown. A late game marksman build will have you dealing 500+ a hit, at 2 attacks per second. \n\nOnce a mage throws out their abilities, most of them are done, they have to retreat from the fight. This is why there is less itemization against magic damage than against physical damage. If the mage cant burst you, its over, they've lost. There are exceptions of course, but they usually have marksman or lower levels of health to compensate (I'm looking at you Cassiopeia).\n\nWith AD you get high damage in exchange for a chance at medium damage. With AP you get high damage with a chance at no damage. The chance is still there, its just that one has inherently less counter play.\n\nThe reason why Riot ACTUALLY has a problem with spellvamp is more based around the fact that it is ridiculously hard to balance due to cool downs. Most marksman have within a very limited range the same attack speed. Cooldowns vary wildly. \n\nAdditionally because of the nature of mages Spellvamp is extra hard to balance for in team fights because while marksman with life steel basically get HP/5 based upon their attack speed, and damage, casters get bursts of HP which means that spell vamp can rapidly change fights in unpredictable manners. Versus life steal which is very predictable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NeroUS","date":"2014-02-20T21:39:46.463+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3102}} {{item:3065}}{{item:3139}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3174}} \n\nNot enough counters to AP damage?","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-02-21T08:38:46.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most AP based champs wouldn't think twice about any of those save athenes or if they were desperate, SV.","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2014-02-21T19:01:24.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are just saying mage-counter items in general (which is what I was led to think we're talking about currently), I would say all of those except maybe{{item:3091}} are commonly bought and good items.

Getting that as an AP champ is basically saying you aren't going to be doing any damage.  It's not bad, but it's not as helpful for the position.  SV is nice with something like spell vamp, but you need the spell vamp to begin with.  And unlike veil it helps you out as an AP champ with the CDR it gives.\n\nI mean there might be times when you want veil as an AP champ, but that's pretty conditional if you ask me.  It's the sort of thing you rush if you are behind against Ahri... and she's not that common a pick anymore since they nerfed her.  That said, it's best on bruisers.\n\nThat leaves SV (good overall but isn't helping you get kills that much), treads (conditional buy depending on the game), and Athenes (good all around for most mana based AP champs).","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2014-02-22T16:32:45.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I don't really think buying MR items is worth it on an AP mage even if you are behind. If you really want defensive items, buy health; mages are generally going to be squishy regardless of whether they're ahead or behind (a few exceptions like Vlad, etc) and their money is just usually better spent on damage/CDR items.\n\nEven if you DO buy a defensive item, health is better for when you are getting bursted ({{item:3027}}  and {{item:3116}} give great stats for this), and a {{item:3026}}  GA is great on assassins, and also has some MR (might do fine on other mages too). \n\nOverall, I just think the reason there are less MR items is because of the unreliability of spells when compared to auto attacks (the equivalent of primary damage output for most ADs). Once an AA gets fired, it's going to hit, and the \"CD\" on autoattacks is always relatively short, especially on ADCs. Thus, more Armor items are available than MR.\n\nOne more note on Spell Vamp, it's a lot harder to balance than Life Steal. Sure your rate of attack is going to change and is a little different between champions, but it's going to be close enough that you can balance for lifesteal. Spells on the other hand wildly differ on cool downs; A Lux is going to spell vamp in bursts, but then isn't going to get anything for 10+ seconds after her spell cycle. Ryze on the other hand can machine gun spells and spell vamp is going to be OP on him if we balance it for someone like Lux.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pollyanna Wright","date":"2014-02-26T00:33:12.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maw is a joke.

You can't even get wraith anymore because riot made that jungle only.  Also an ADC can sit back and sustain himself just by AAing minions.  Most AP champs have to trade in mana to sustain via spell vamp.\n\nMy opinion is the sole reason riot hasn't been forced to add another spell vamp item is that AP mids have the luxury of laning alone.

While you still need to get in range, you only stay in range for a very short amount of time and retreat afterwards, waiting for your next rotation to heal, giving it significantly less counterplay than lifesteal.\n\nAnother point is that someone building lifesteal either builds complete glasscannon adc or only has limited use of it because he is not focusing all his items into autoattacks, but also relies on abilities to deal damage. This autobalances itself so that the highest sustain is given to the squishiest champion. (Either that or you're Nasus, this is not a Nasus thread)\n\nSpellvamp however scales with ability power (not considering ad casters here, they have lifesteal). Ability power often can be effeciently splashed with survivability like Zhonya's, Haunting guise and Abyssal. This means that the autobalancing effect of lifesteal doesn't work as effectively for spellvamp. \n\nLastly, not many champions need spellvamp.
