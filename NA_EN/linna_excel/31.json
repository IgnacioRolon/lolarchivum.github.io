SKT seems to be playing weird, they can't seem to win early game. I don't know but  I hope they fix it up.\n2. I don't think there will be any upsets. C9 vs WE\n3. RNG is #2 in China. SKT destroyed EDG despite being at 11k gold deficit. It seems the chinese teams can take a lead but can't do the team fights as good as the korean teams. That strategy will probably work against RNG too. Pick late game champions and win the team fight late game.\n4. C9 definitely has a chance. I don't think TSM is a good representation of NA. I'm not saying they aren't #1 and don't deserve it but they suck internationally. The way C9 played vs SKT and EDG early game tells me that C9 should do well vs WE. I think C9 had it tough vs EDG because of the draft (cait or j4+galio).\n\n\nI think all the fights will be interesting to watch,.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2017-10-15T17:24:23.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think C9 lost to EDG mainly because they picked the graves jungle when they needed shen more.

Last week he was ahead so he can deal damage and bully the jungler. \n\nAlso, i think the bans will have to include\nJ4, Galio. That combo is what really did it for C9.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2017-10-15T17:57:27.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think J4 was bad to let slip through, but I think not banning galio was worse particularly given they didn't take the early shen pick.","replies":[{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2017-10-15T18:15:44.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Linna Excel,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=3HABqzNf,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2017-10-15T17:57:27.450+0000)\n>\n> I think J4 was bad to let slip through, but I think not banning galio was worse particularly given they didn&#x27;t take the early shen pick.\n\nYeah, the J4 cant dive but with a Galio, he can dive cuz he gets huge damage reduction.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mazariamonti","date":"2017-10-15T17:54:35.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
