I&#039;m glad the academy skins are coming out, they all look good for their price point.  However why are they on multiple champs when there are other themes that would look good on multiple champs but are relegated to a single one?","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-08-09T22:16:14.645+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently lower scope skins are being designed in groups. We brainstorm a theme that could work on multiple champs (Dark/Light Knights, Dinosaurs, House of Cards, Academy) and then choose a bunch of champions that meet some criteria (work well with the theme, will look good without effects/animation support, haven't had a skin for a while). We do a rough spread of concepts of those champions and what they could look like then, based on those sketches, we choose the strongest skins from among them to go into production.\n\nHigher scope skins like Star Guardian Lux require a lot more work from a bigger number of people. A group of 5 star guardians would require a huge amount of work and mean the team couldn't work on any other skins like Legendaries or Ultimates for a long time. So we can do it, but it's it's a big investment in a single theme so we'd have to be very confident that it's a theme a lot of players are going to enjoy.","replies":[{"poster":"Celio Hogane HD","date":"2015-08-10T12:49:24.490+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"So now that you guys know everybody loves star guardian lux... we will get more?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-08-09T22:35:36.850+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thank you Kindlejack.  Is it possible for riot to go back and add a theme like Star Guardian to someone else even if done one at a time?  It always feels like there's a few ideas that one champ has that would look great on some others but if it isn't a pool party, harrowing, or christmas skin, it's less likely to be ported over.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-08-12T07:20:33.801+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it definitely is!
