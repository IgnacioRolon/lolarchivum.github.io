Sure not having gold to buy items sucks, but if you support long enough you get used to it.  Yes no one gives you a lot of credit and you get all the blame, but as the team&#039;s stay-at-home-mom you know you&#039;ve got a thankless task that needs to be done.  Yes some champs are more passive than you&#039;d like them to be, but every time those champs aren&#039;t completely passive riot nerfs them back into being passive because everyone in live balance has two butts to poop on your main with... politicians are two faced while game devs are two butted.  \r\n\r\nHowever, I think it&#039;s the lack of XP that in the end really turns people off from supporting even if it isn&#039;t the obvious thing.  I mean think about it.  As a support, the one thing you really have to scale on is levels and because you are warding, roaming, clearing wards, not CSing, etc you are going to quickly fall behind in levels compared to the rest of the team.  A lot of supports can&#039;t come back in the level department very easily.  Let&#039;s say there&#039;s a large wave of minions bottom.  How many supports WHO CAN&#039;T GO MID have the kits or the damage items to quickly clear a wave to catch up in gold or levels?  No many.  Even if you did, a support on his own is just begging the other team to pick him off while your team is raging at you to group after you ward the other side of the map by yourself.  And when your team is grouped in a lane and CSing, how easy is it for the support to get CS then when you&#039;ve got an ADC, AP mid, toplaner, and jungler competing for those CS as well?  It&#039;s not. Plus you aren&#039;t getting very much XP when a minion is split 5 ways.\r\n\r\nI mean yesterday Meddler, _who is a bloody support player_, mentioned his thoughts on supporting issues and having to deal with not having XP is so second nature to him he didn&#039;t even think about mentioning it.  He&#039;s so used to being 3 levels behind his team, it didn&#039;t even register to him that non-support mains don&#039;t like being that far behind people nor do they know how to play well while lacking levels as much as they are lacking items.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s why no one supports: you&#039;ve got to take all the blame unless the jungler pissed off the team, you get none of the rewards, and the one thing you need most to do your job (levels as that&#039;s the only thing you have to scale off of) you don&#039;t get... because you are busy doing your job.  I mean not being able to buy the fun items that make your damage go up is an issue for the non-mains, but as far as the role is concerned doing your job properly makes you miss out on XP as much as it makes you miss out on gold.\r\n\r\nSupporting is the only role in the game that punishes a player for doing his job correctly, not just in terms of no GP or fun items, but in terms of no levels as well.  Here&#039;s a thing about game design that I learned by reading rosewater: players do what you reward them to do.  Being support isn&#039;t as intrinsically rewarding as some of the other roles in the game.  It wouldn&#039;t surprise me if a lot of people became support mains only because they like the shorter queue times and they seem to win more in the role more than because they really enjoy supporting.  I read a long time ago that in MMOs maybe 10% of the player base tops gravitates to the healer/support classes.  Last time I checked, riot needs 20% of its player base in the queue to be either a support main or secondary/fill (also known as support mains).  \r\n\r\nSo if you aren&#039;t someone who naturally gravitates towards that role, getting punished by both your fellow players and the game itself is quite a turn off.  A lot of players like big numbers.  Unless you are counting healing done on soraka, supports don&#039;t put up big numbers.  A lot of players like getting kills.  If you are on support and get more than 1-2 kills, you run the risk of getting flamed by your team.  A lot of players want to get a pentakill.  Supports are the rarest class to get a pentakill.  Players want to do interesting stuff all the time.  Supporting means making sure your team has vision when any bush can contain the enemy team and no you don&#039;t have enough wards to ward every single bush there is. \r\n\r\nWant to push an objective?  Supports can&#039;t do that alone.\r\nWant to clear a lane or the base?  Many supports can&#039;t quickly CS even if the game depended on it.\r\nWant to split push because your team can&#039;t win a 5v5?  Can&#039;t do that on support.\r\nWant to sneak/steal a dragon?  Supports can&#039;t do that... I tried to steal a dragon with sona once because our jungler was AFK, it didn&#039;t work out so well.\r\n\r\nSo not only does the game punish you, you are also extremely dependent on the rest of your team because a lot of the things **ESSENTIAL TO WINNING OR SAVING THE GAME** that does not involve vision are things support players can&#039;t do alone.  That&#039;s why supporting sucks to most people.  You are entirely responsible for vision when half of your team won&#039;t look at the minimap but you are completely dependent on your teammates for a lot of the things you need to be able to do to win the game.  \r\n\r\nMore XP won&#039;t solve all the problems, but it would take a big one a lot of people don&#039;t think about away.\r\n\r\nA month ago, [I suggested](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/i0LYvarP-id-like-to-request-a-small-buff-that-would-benefit-all-supports) that sightstone give XP to players who are close to teammates with more levels than they are.  Maybe riot should consider one of the core support items like sightstone or the GP items give supports XP as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-11-15T19:03:18.437+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":3,"body":"XP deficits for supports are something we'll look at too, with you there.

Making the bonus xp item sightstone: reduces likelihood you play a support that doesn't want to buy the item to begin with, incentivizes buying sightstone -- reducing their early game damage output as opposed to the gold gen item, increases chances for non-full-ap supports to punish the full ap support by giving the sightstone support faster xp gain (and therefore levels) if they weather the damage of the full ap support. So the Nami or leona who builds sighstone instead of upgrading their gold gen item on first back can weather the storm of the enemy support brand or vel'koz or leblanc and then punish them when they hit level 4, 5, or 6 before the full ap support brand hits that level. \n\nAfraid it gives jungle lee a huge advantage? Most in solo/dynamic queue want the damage and want farm -- not sit mid and gain xp and miss out on gold income. And if they do sit mid... the enemy jungle gets a gold lead on them and probably and xp lead too because they're getting full xp while lee gets less than 100% xp for creeps dying to his mid. If enemy mid plays safe and doesn't feed, eventually his jungler who is ahead in gold/items and probably xp can start ganking mid and punishing the sightstone lee for not farming enough. Plus, buying sightstone means lee misses out on the damage he'd otherwise have from warrior's jungle item early on. So there is tradeoff  -- the slight bonus xp is probably outweighed by the loss of gold (not farming) and loss of potential damage/tankiness (jungle item) unless the jungler is succeeding in killing the lane he camps basically every time the enemy is in lane.

But the website isn't letting me discuss it on your original thread. \n\nqueuing \n\nBEFORE I GO INTO THE ISSUE OF THE SUPPORT ROLE BEING UNATTRACTIVE, there's a bunch of guys who will happily play mid+support but they are currently queuing as mid+top. the reason they do that is that if you put secondary as support you will almost always get support. If you guys can make the secondary role selection work **properly**, they will join the group of players that occasionally play support. This should help quite a bit. \n\nI thought long and hard about what to say to you, how to express what I believe is the problem with the support role as a whole, and why it is not being played more.\n\nAnd then a miracle occurred and providence dropped the answer right into my lap. \n\nTL;DR : You want support role to be more attractive? Make this happen: {{champion:27}} {{summoner:11}} \n\n\nNow, for a answers to your actual questions:\n\n**Laning patterns & Pre-game choices**\n\nThe core advantage of the support as a class is the lack need to actively farm. This opens up supports to do all manner of wonderful things. For instance lane pressure, ganking, counter jungling, roaming, tracking the enemy jungler...\n\nUnfortunately supports are kept out of all those wonderful and INTERESTING things due to the need to protect the special snowflake we call \"ADC\". In the pre game support players are constricted to champions and summoner spells that are relevant in that context, and the laning pattern is very much dependent in the well being of the ADC. \n\nFor instance ganking the mid lane (fun) is heavily gated by the ADC getting dove by the other support. Therefore you are required to stay and babysit (not fun). \n\nIn addition, supports are also given a bunch of \"power without agency\" tools: items like athene's unholy grail that allow supports to be impactful, but only when someone else is making the decisions (because a heal is worth more on someone with big stats, and is balanced around being worth more).","replies":[]},{"poster":"RisenDarkKnight","date":"2016-11-16T21:00:06.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think supports really need anymore gold.

Brand and LB have a single, conditional, hard CC that is minion blocked. Morgana has a single, non-conditional hard CC that is minion blocked, plus her shield and ultimate. (I also almost never see LB support...) VK is more debatable because he has his unblockable AoE knockup on a non-ultimate cooldown, but I think Morgana still provides more utility than him.\n\nOn your story... I 100% agree with the moral post-6. But how on earth are you doing anything to Brand pre-6? Why is he in your E range? He should be able to safely poke you from outside its range. And if you're totally zoning him + ADC from minions, he should be hitting you with a fair amount of poke.\n\nI don't play Brand, but I play a lot of sup VK. I absolutely destroy hard-engage supports that rely on a linear skillshot (Leona, Blitz, Thresh, Nautilus) in early game most of the time. Leo and Naut change at 6 (and then proceed to kill me every time their ults are up unless I have both Flash and a countergank ready). But giving 5 kills by level 5 sounds like he just didn't respect Leona's range.\n\n*Of course, this doesn't apply when there's a great skill gap between the players, and this is only from my experience at my MMR level.","replies":[{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2016-11-17T07:46:46.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does depend on your rank and skill level as well as that of your opponents in lane and your own adc. Personally, I pulled this off having not mained support since 2 seasons ago in upper silver or low gold tier -- can't remember which I was at the time. Obviously higher rankings mean brand has more accuracy with his pillars of flame; however, you probably have an adc and support who are better at dodging them than I am and better rune pages to deal with your matchup. Not sure how that all evens out. But if you learn how the brand support operates and he uses a pattern, you can abuse it -- there is a small window for you to dodge his pillar of flame. After that, it's just waiting for leona's lvl 2 or lvl 3 power spike (lvl 3 spike is strongest next to getting your ult) and punishing brand whenever he goes in for damage. To increase his chance of landing damage, he can't be max range. Either he stays max range and you dodge most of his damage and threaten his adc, or he gets somewhat closer than max range and you can e him when he's casting pillar. Note: this ONLY works if your adc actually follows up with good damage and has strong pre-6 damage (ex: corki, mf, vayne is prob ok too). Simply put, it's much like the world's matchup between tsm and rng (http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/TRLH1/1001890201?gameHash=6751c4ef7ef58654&tab=overview) where tsm had the stronger poke and sustain lane, but rng had the stronger all-in. You abuse the fact that neither enemy laner (sup and adc) can tank half the damage that your support can. Once you have the cc to force an all-in engage, you either end up getting a kill advantage or summoner spell advantage. If brand or the adc want to flash away and heal to narrowly avoid death, great -- no need to flash after them to secure the kill -- they are dead next time you all-in them. Key thing is to know when to engage and to try to pull as much focus of enemy damage as you can as the tanky support. If you do it right, even if they focus your adc, you win. You stay long enough for your adc to get off max damage via autos and spells and then back off, finish a kill, or chase based on how the trade went. Because you have a burst damage adc, you get one of them to half hp or so before they can both fight back due to leona's cc. If they want to stay and fight back and focus your adc, she can kite and wait for your spells to come back up. If they want to focus you, you should be tanky enough to take their damage (maybe land 2nd round of cc) and flash out if needed. By this point, if they flash after you to kill you, your adc kills one in reply or maybe even gets a double. Like you said, it depends on skills of everyone involved, what champs everyone has, and if your adc is willing to skirmish rather than ff in lane.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dokkaebi","date":"2016-11-16T18:14:26.206+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you know when the new blind+draft will be coming?

You are entirely responsible for vision when half of your team won't look at the minimap but you are completely dependent on your teammates for a lot of the things you need to be able to do to win the game.\n\nCompletely agree. I highlighted the above in particular because it strikes closest to my main concern as a support main: laddering is a nightmare and I often feel like I had little to no control over my team's losses. That the inability to split-push, wave clear, or take objectives is exacerbated by the need to ward (thus leaving precious xp/gold behind in lane) is just icing on the cake. \n\nI figure everyone finds reasons to hate their ELO at some point, but as a support main it often feels especially impossible to overcome without switching to a more popular role with more personal agency.","replies":[{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2016-11-16T16:09:33.618+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah you need your teammates to have some minor degree of intelligence -- something that's severely lacking of late in ranked play. You can crush bot lane with a mediocre adc if you are a good support only to lose game because rest of team solo invades, refuses to listen to your pings when baron/drag is free for the taking and they they rush there 2v5 to try to stop enemy from doing it not 30 sec after refusing to take it for free when you pinged it was safe and a good idea to do it while enemy was all halfways across the map except 1 random enemy player. But coming from a guy who mained support for 2 yrs and then swapped to top, stick with support if you enjoy it (at least somewhat enjoy it) - other roles give many of the same frustrations. I find myself camped all laning, unable to get jungle to do a single gank for me even though we could snowball 2v2 very hard instead of leaving me 1v2. Meanwhile my mid is losing and failing to mia when enemy mid roams top to keep me down or bot to grab free kills on a lane that goes 0/10/0 in a 2v2 when enemy jungle never ganked their lane once. So yeah, you might have a chance to carry your team more, but you can also be just as helpless and collect all the blame. Enemy top is 7/2/3 while you've died 2 times in lane due to being 1v2 camped all laning? Clearly it's your fault he's fed and not your mid for whom you spent 75 gold and your time warding for and calling mia well in advance to give him time to back to safety before your toplane opponent could get there. It's definitely your fault your mid ignored 3 pings to back off and avoid feeding your toplaner. So...If you enjoy support some, stick with it and try to find a decent adc. Don't get after them too hard for the little things, and pick the right time to discuss it -- ex: not in the middle of a teamfight or 2v2 in lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LycopolisKing","date":"2016-11-16T01:53:27.310+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my God.
