They refer to it as \"The Pipeline\". As far as we know, **Sion** is receiving a confirmed  kit rework and VU, **Warwick** is also receiving a kit rework with a possible VU, and **Karthus** is receiving a VU all before the end of the year (hopefully).\n\nOn a *needs one* basis, I'd say Mordekaiser, Taric, and Kassadin could benefit from a Visual Update along with some kit updates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2014-05-14T00:42:35.650+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't maintain an official list because we really dislike setting expectations for things that are so far out in the future that a million things could change between now and then. We do confirm we're working on stuff that should be out in the medium term. So yes, we are currently working on a visual update for Karthus and a full relaunch (visual update + new kit) for Sion.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMÃ¥rvelous","date":"2014-05-14T00:56:41.015+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldn't it be better to just say that EVERYONE is on the list for a VU? I mean, even since your last champion (Vel'koz), Braum has brought new stuff to the table in terms of VA quality, quotes, special interactions, etc. \n\nSure, it makes the oldest champions look kind of archaic with their voice lines but knowing where League has come from I don't blame you guys one bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2014-05-14T12:43:40.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking new voice packs honestly.

Again I hear you guys working on him, but honestly I don't believe you guys. Not to sound negative but it has been (excuse me if I'm wrong date wise) over a year or so now since you guys mentioned this. I'm glad some of the riot members are trying to confirm their overall goal and direction, and I'm grateful for that; however, it feels like you guys have done nothing but pushed him aside for other champions (balancing changes to professional picks) and other stuff (V.U. and new champions: sure Braum took forever but at least he's out and done). I'm just worried it won't ever happen until another year or so.\n\nLast note: Like you guys and respect you all; it just feels you're under geared for all the work you have.","replies":[]}]}
