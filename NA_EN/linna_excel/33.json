For instance you could have a reverted form of rylai&#039;s that&#039;ll keep the current items name.  Then you could have the AP+Mana+CDR item meddler was talking about.  Then perhaps you could add an item that trades in the HP for some form of sustain.\r\n\r\nFinally maybe riot could add an AP+HP item that isn&#039;t rylai&#039;s or RoA (different passive) for people who want a lot of AP and HP.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-10-07T22:07:06.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3030}}  <--- ?

Protobelt is OP too, very strong on any aggressive burster for its cost (DFG lite). Only Eve and Kennen and kinda Vlad or Mordekaiser really care for its little thrust aggressively, but the cooldown is still low enough to abuse as waveclear or emergency getaway\n\nOddly if you have both Protobelt becomes GLP [ice cannon] basically that thrusts. But I've only seen Kennen afford to build that combination of items, though I do it on Morgana mid as well, and it's a good build that helps her land Q","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-10-08T01:24:26.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mages already have an issue getting everything they need. splitting rylais up would just make it kindof unbearable lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sohleks","date":"2016-10-07T21:58:04.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My one concern with that is by making more of them we could be sort of endorsing a world where everyone buys em all the time becoming staple core items for each class. And if one is better stat'ed than the other especially in favor of ranged it'll feel bad for the guys left out.\n\nBut the point of splitting them up IMO is to ultimately build them each class without overstat'ing them, while keeping it somewhat viable for each class. Maybe if everyone had a slow option and the stats weren't overpowered too some players on a team can opt into it while the others go after alternate needs.\n\nAnd I still kinda of question if maybe the passive's strength itself is just the issue. And if we split the item into two and the slow is still OP boy we're gonna look mighty silly.\n\nI wonder if people are _tired_ of Rylias and Mallet atm\n\nBecause making more of them may trigger an arms competition. And it homogenizes the classes a bit maybe. At least make the mechanics of them different enough they don't look the same.\n\nAnd a guy above me mentions we already have {{item:3030}}  and it's underused","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2016-10-07T23:00:23.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO rylai's should always be something worth considering.  It fills an important need: ap mids have an option to provide soft CC if their team needs it.  It also has great stats ATM.  \n\nHowever that said, the more I look into the item, the more I'm wondering if it's just the forums being the forums.  I mean aside from Aussie, it seems like it's not a core item on that many champs according to champion.gg.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zero Skill Tank","date":"2016-10-07T22:50:38.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they should make it too.
