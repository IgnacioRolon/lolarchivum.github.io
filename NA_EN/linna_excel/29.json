However with the change of the meta and her last tweak, she seems to be morphing into a solo-lane tanky pusher instead of a true support.\r\n\r\nI blame Annie and every other mid who's going bottom.  But that's something else.\r\n\r\nAnyways, we know riot hates pure healers, so I was thinking maybe this new role is good for her.  Maybe she's in a better place being a solo-laner who can also support from time to time.  \r\n\r\nSince a rework for her is coming sooner or later (this year I heard) maybe she's better off being a tanky utility mage first.  Maybe that's how riot should rebalance her.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo that makes me think, how easy to balance would she be if her W was a self-cast only skill?  She'd still have her wish for healing teammates and getting that big heal.  But with AB being self-cast only, she wouldn't be toxic per riot's definition.","replies":[{"poster":"Evelyn Endwise","date":"2014-02-03T22:01:26.396+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-02-03T23:46:33.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this were S3, I'd agree with you completely.  However you have to rebalance according to what's going on now and what you want going on in the future.\n\nShe's getting to be a little more popular as a top/mid/niche jungler and right now and for the forseeable future, the support position needs either a kill lane champ, or a CC initiation champ.  Soraka is going to keep her wish from what I've read so going forward, I don't see her fitting bot.\n\nThe other thing about her is riot hates dedicated healers.  If Astral Blessing was self target, perhaps with an AoE passive, it'd be a lot easier for them to rework her into a healthy spot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Firefox711","date":"2014-02-05T20:58:24.531+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct me if I'm wrong, but Soraka was originally designed to be a defensive support, something that new players could pick up and learn the game through those means. \n\nHowever to me, I look at Sona as a good-recommended support for newer players to pick up, that can also be played defensive AS well as offensive. There is balance in her kit.\n\nThe problem becomes when she's able to play so defensive, that it makes interaction at bot lane equal near-zero. I think Soraka's orginal concept as a \"defensive support\" needs to be scraped/changed still. I still think she should maintain support as her main role, but it can be improved.\n\nSome suggestions:\n\n* an offensive alternative added to her Astral Blessing (W), just how Lulu's has both a defensive shield and offensive harass with her (E). \n\n* Allow Soraka the ability to choose between Single target dmg vs AoE dmg on her Q\n \n\nI would just want more interaction with Soraka, instead of the common \"I poke/harass you, and then she (W)'s to heal it all up and we repeat again\" Granted, the new changes to her this season made this much better. But I still think there are things we can do to make her an interesting support.\n\n Her changes with her Infuse (E) was good. And I'd like to see that continue in her Q or W, or both. Preferably both :-)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-02-05T22:57:17.442+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"In general, we're cool with champions going multiple places, as long as it's healthy everywhere.\n\nThing is, her W being self-cast only doesn't really solve anything. It's just non-interactive \"Do you have enough mana?\" sustain. That's why we tried upping the cooldown, making it a huge short-duration armor buff, changing the values via her passive...\n\nIf Soraka totally works as a healthy solo lane pushers -> teamfight support, then that's awesome. I love seeing lanes bring in new roles.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-02-06T04:50:47.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response. I kind of get that it being self cast might not be enough, however that proposition was to get her away from being just a healer, which is toxic.  The fewer people it can heal by definition would make her less toxic.\n\n\n\nHowever for the sake of the argument isn't running out of mana something that can happen from interactions?  Isn't it there so you have something you have to manage and the other side has to make you expand?  No it's not a quick interaction, but why do all in game interactions have to be second to second?\n\nPhreak, as the shoutcaster for the LCS you know that something which happens early on can have a huge impact later in a match.  Be it a first blood, lane swap until 6, or taking an early tower to change up where the pressure is on the map later on.\n\nI mean why is CSing and trying to keep the other lane from CSing for the first part of the game so important?  Because it's a long running, ongoing interaction whereby you are trying to get a superior gold position by having more CS and a superior map position via pushing the lane.\n\nI'd like to argue that running out of mana and interactions that require a non-instant time frame are fine for the game.\n\n\n\nAlso, what about baiting the W and then letting the armor buff run out before going all in?  Isn't that interaction?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-07-01T21:34:35.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may be interested in this [thread ](http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/live-gameplay/hAYxilGM-what-to-do-about-soraka-in-the-meantime-morello-vesh)I just made.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-07-01T21:34:17.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may be interested in this [thread ](http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/live-gameplay/hAYxilGM-what-to-do-about-soraka-in-the-meantime-morello-vesh)I just made.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IXI R3V3L IXI","date":"2014-02-14T05:42:24.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**I consider myself a main support player, but i'm not as hardcore as other players in league. Lately i've been practicing a lot of champs to bring variety and flexibility to my bot lane, either SR or TT (place in which I run AP carry/ CC duties for my team. Soraka at first was my choice to win by sustain. Usually ran it with Ezreal or Varus and  just out-healed any other support in game. The problem is that once you start playing more, learning more, you start craving more action. Soraka just doesn't fit IMO with the current meta at bot, and probably will be super weird bringing her to TT. If a rework should be considered, I'd like to chip in...\n\n* I don't think her ulti should be eliminated. A trademark of her's is to \"assist from bot\" to any close call in the map. This I consider it her signature of play, A way of influencing the match in favor of your team and, in a certain way, free assists if well managed.\n*  I do believe her playstyle is way too linear in bot lane: long cooldowns, waiting for confrontations, heal, silence, banana. Rinse and repeat, except for the mana donation you'll give to your carry in between, if he choose to stay after the confrontation. \n*  Late game with her is basically devoting your time to ward, map awareness and peeling for the carry. Usually going tanky to gain more time until something happens to either you or your enemies. With the exception of some players, which just go in  with AP/tanky builds and spam Q to weaken some opposing tanks/bruisers. \n\nI'd like to see her being used more, but in a lane that has evolved into a battleground of it's own, she does need some help. Let's say; Bring a new approach to her kit: STANCES.\n\nInject her kit with a more decisive approach. One ability could act as a toggle switch between said stances. Let's say heal/peel stances. It would open up her gameplay by adding 2 more possibilities to her kit, without sacrificing her identity. I'd recommend eliminating her Q, since it is just a spamming ability that only requires to be in range, and adding a toggle mechanic that gives to auras to nearby champs. (health regen at def/ mana regen at offense). When defensive she could keep her W and her E. But the E should lose her mana consumption  benefit and retain the silence just in case she has to defend herself or peel for a teammate. On the other stance we could see changes in W, E, and even R. These changes should give her more utility, maybe some skill shot with some vision or some AoE CC as the \"offensive stance wish\". \n\nIn the end, Soraka just need to be more fun to play with, and sitting there, filing bars for the carry, and spamming Q is not that fun. IMO the \"stances\" fit very well with her current lore,and would add more playability into a character that needs more tools to be able to contend with champs that are currently dominating bot lane. \n**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-02-05T23:54:16.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd honestly prefer all supports to be played as solo laner, but Riot does't like that.

In S3 it was a combo of tanky and CDR with Rylai's and Laindy's being your sources of damage.  In S4, I think it's mostly the same.  Lots of tank and CDR with maybe 2 AP items at most.","replies":[]}]}]}
