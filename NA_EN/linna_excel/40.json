She's the evil queen.  The dark fairy.  The dreaded stepmother.  She's older and established.  All she wants is more power.\r\n\r\nI think LOL needs a champion who can act as a counterpoint to her.\r\n\r\nI'm talking about a disney princess style champ.  Someone who is hopeful, positive, upbeat, optimistic, and a mix of innocent and naive.  \r\n\r\nSo here's my thought: bring back the original concept for lissandra (swordwoman), rename her (lisa, lissa, andra, whatever), and make her the thematic counterpoint to the current Lissandra.  Make this new champ want to unite the freljord to stop Lissandra, but not be supreme ruler of it all.  Someone who wants to stop the evil villain and try to be friends with the other tribes afterwards.\r\n\r\nHer entrance into the league is natural: she's looking for allies.  She's hoping to unite Sejunani's and Ashe's tribes.","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2014-03-21T16:36:30.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's wrong with Ashe? I know she's not the exact counterpart you have in mind but lore-wise she is the hopeful, optimistic idealist \"Princess\" (now queen) that at first is friendly and allies with Lissandra despite Lissandra's subterfuge. She balances out Lissandra's raw want for control with compassion and understanding of unity.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-03-21T17:43:46.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ashe would work, but it doesn't play off of the theme of the evil female trying to deny the good female her inheritance.  In this case it would be the frostguard tribe.  It'd also be better if our heroine knew the truth but no one around her would believe her.  \n\nAshe's biggest problem in this scenario is she's already the leader of her own tribe.  She's already powerful.  If you want someone who's struggling to overcome the odds, it'd work better if she were on her own or had more limited resources.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nox Serpens","date":"2014-03-20T19:07:44.386+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She isn't hoping to unite the tribes. She is looking to re-subjugate them. She is one of the frozen watchers. She is fighting to take over the freljord again and then make the ice take over the world... Look into the story behind the howling abyss and think about the relationship the ghost shopkeeper has with sejuani and ashe. Lissandra doesn't need a counterpart. Her counterpart is all things living. She needs an ally or an underling that she can name as her champion once she becomes queen.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-03-20T22:29:31.736+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, if Lissandra is the evil queen, then we need cinderalla, snow white, or sleeping beauty.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Valenten","date":"2014-03-17T09:59:30.117+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do I smell a potential sister to Tryndamere?

I want more Freljord champs, more female champs, and especially more female fighters. It would be neat if this princess was more on the \"tanky AD bruiser\" side of fighter, rather than simply being another fragile melee AD carry. I can imagine a princess whose main virtue is her unshakable optimism, her will to move forward, and her superhuman capacity to endure whatever life throws at her.

Noone except the League and the Champions within, knows the true identity of Lissandra, that she's the leader of the Frostguard tribe. However, Sejuani and Ashe are the same as Lissandra, everyone of them wants to be the ruler of the Freljord - Lissandra is only \"Super Villain\" because of her deep desire of freezing the whole continent with an Ice Age.","replies":[]}]}
