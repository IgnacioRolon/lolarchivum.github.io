What is riot thinking?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Runeglaive looks weird IMO; I&#039;m not sure why riot is trying it out.\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s not that many AP junglers much less ones that spam spells enough to want a spellblade effect.  If you wanted that, you&#039;d probably get LB anyways for the move speed and more AP.  \r\n\r\nI could see this on Sejuani only because TF is nice on her, but she&#039;s going to still want cinderhulk and go TF if she gets really fed.  Evelynn is another possibility but I don&#039;t think this would be bought on her because she&#039;d want the more stats that TF brings for AD builds, she doesn&#039;t need more mana so much, and AP eve would probably like the raw power and more CDR of magus.   Elise is more of a bruiser I guess and I think she&#039;d want cinderhulk as well.  Vi wouldn&#039;t want it despite liking spellblade because it has no AD and she&#039;s got no AP scalings; she&#039;d get TF instead.  Jungle Leona is rare and is more of an AD bruiser than an AP bruiser; she&#039;d want cinderhulk instead.  Jungle Akali isn&#039;t popular enough to justify this and she&#039;d want more AP.  Fiddles wants more AP from magus.  Jungle Kayle is probably not going to like the loss of CDR and the lower AP.  \r\n\r\nWho&#039;s this item for Riot? Honestly which jungler wants no mobility boost the other complete spellblade items gives and something with stats that are weaker than the other two items overall?  Just about all of your AP junglers are going to want cinderhulk more as they are all either tanks or bruisers.  The ones that aren&#039;t want more AP and/or CDR from magus.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-06-12T22:46:59.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably for anyone that uses Lich Bane, and wants more mana but not have to stick with Ranger's Trailblazer.
