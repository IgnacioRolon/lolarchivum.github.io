Even with good quality modern compression, filling a 1080p screen at 30hz requires far more numbers than the game state of League.  If you think about it that way, you can draw a relation between, say, knowing the position of a unit - 3 32-bit numbers, to the color of 12 pixels with 8-bit color channels.\n\nThat particular comparison isn't fair to video - the compression techniques there are very well developed past the concept of sending individual color information, but the general idea illustrates why the difference is so big.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2017-12-15T04:27:30.049+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.
