Vel'Koz has had that rank for a while on my profile, but now that I have level 5 on him he disappeared from the 'top champions' and 'in progress' board. When I look him up at the 'all champions' page it does show the red ribbon; he just disappeared from my profile. Anyone else having this bug?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-17T00:59:57.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is working as intended!
