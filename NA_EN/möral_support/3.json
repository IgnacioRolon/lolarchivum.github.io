(MY OPINION)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":32,"down_votes":9,"body":"So, in today&#039;s meta, the top AP junglers are as follows. Nidalee, Elise, and Diana. The reason they excel is because they rely on spamming their abilities and then auto attacking afterwards. \n\nLets take a step back to season 4. Magus was still in the game.  Anyone who wanted to jungle AP, could. This allowed Fiddle, Karthus, Nidalee, Diana, Elise (NERFED AT THE TIME), Akali, and Karma, to all be viable. When they removed magus for an AUTO ATTACK based damage amplifier, they altered four of these champions. \n\nKarthus and Fiddle, for example, now have to auto attack to deal damage to a camp. (And for Fiddle it lowers his clear time 35%. Yes i did the math for real.) (Karthus has the slowest auto attack animation in the game. This DEVASTATED his jungling ability.)\n\nWhy I bring this up:\nI played a game about three days ago where I was playing jungle fiddlesticks. I noticed now that he has a hard time clearing the camps when he has to stop and auto attack. (This is when I went into a custom game to calculate how slow it took and then compared it to a youtube video&#039;s clear speed of magus.)\nI felt as if, in every aspect, the only VIABLE ability power junglers were being forced down my throat. I compared all the other junglers&#039; clear times and noticed how Elise, Nidalee, and Diana ALL gained valuable buffs to their kits with ruinglaive added. (Elise may not be reliable in this aspect as she was NERFED when magus was removed.) I really felt like these champions were GIVEN their ability to succeed and Riot took the others away. I feel ruinglaive  really take away from Ability Power jungling and its diversity. \n\nWhat I feel should happen: \nMaybe alter the makings of Runeglaive to BETTER fit all AP champions when they jungle. Perhaps give them a DOT that scales with level. (FOR INSTANCE: Put 25dmg/second for 4 seconds at level 6. 65dmg/second at level 12. 100 dmg/second at level 18. All damage is magic damage.) ( I dont want this to be OP so please comment how it could be tweaked to balance.) The damage DoT would apply once magic damage has commenced and it only can apply ever 6 seconds. (WOULDNT APPLY TO MINIONS. AP {{champion:81}} WILL NOT RETURN.)\n\nAgain this is simply my opinion I don&#039;t mean this in any rant form or anything.\n\nEDIT: I meant it to say Fiddle's EARLY GAME Clears. *MY BAD*\n\n**ATTENTION** I have created a survey for this, please check it out! http://strawpoll.me/5606310","replies":[{"poster":"Khell DarkWolf","date":"2015-09-28T06:56:40.538+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":2,"body":"Both Magus and Runeglaive should have co-existed in the game, just like Devourer and warrior's enchantment was allowed to co-exist because they catered to two different AD based junglers based on playstyle and trends.\n\nThere was no reason to remove Magus in the name of diversity.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-09-28T22:58:00.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Uh.. no?

I also preferred magus on Malz jungle since I was just going to buy a tear and my strategy as to power farm and scale. Which is similar to what you want from Karthus. You're going a bit overboard by saying it devastated Karthus' clear though. \n\nGlaive opens up a lot more options for AP junglers in the early mid game. With glaive you have mana regen and can damage camps heavier without spending mana. This allows junglers to stay on the map for longer and keep up in farm to their tank and bruiser counterparts. Overall, I'd say it slightly hurt a few junglers and heavily buffed a bunch of others in the way they really needed to become viable.\n\nAny other junglers that don't like glaive?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2015-09-28T03:04:11.845+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"magus was alright, anyone who used AP could use it. but Runeglaive, ehh... it's useless if your autos blow, why spend money to enhance something you never use","replies":[{"poster":"Partholonian","date":"2015-09-28T23:47:26.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LadyRenly,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ibcyFrAE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-28T03:04:11.845+0000)\n>\n> magus was alright, anyone who used AP could use it. but Runeglaive, ehh... it's useless if your autos blow, why spend money to enhance something you never use\n\nI think you're thinking about it wrong.

Problem was, there really weren't any AP junglers. The only viable AP junglers were the AP champions that could both clear well in the early game and didn't have severe mana problems in the mid game either by having mana-efficient enough clears that Trailblazer could fix those problems by itself or because Trailblazer and a mana item or two could fix those problems and your champion had a strong enough early game it didn't matter whether you lost power early game due to those mana items.\n\nRuneglaive made it so that a larger subset of AP champions COULD jungle by removing those mid-game mana constraints, with the exception of a few extreme outliers. The problem? Runeglaive was not nearly as universal a fit as Magus was. Not every champion wanted to use a sheen proc in PVP combat, and those that did were the AP assassins that were already strong in the jungle, while Runeglaive's sheen proc normalizes the clear speed of every champion in the jungle to similar speeds (except for Fiddlesticks and maybe Karthus (don't forget Karthus can still technically auto attack between Q casts)), meaning that the only time clearing strengths matter is the early game. That gives us the same jungling champion pool we had with Magus, except it doesn't have Fiddlesticks, because even though more champions could jungle isn't the same thing as more champions being good junglers.\n\nPersonally, I've had a lot of fun playing Runeglaive. I had fun trying out some almost-there jungle picks like {{champion:90}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:143}}  and some more off-the-wall jungle picks like {{champion:112}} {{champion:99}}  that are all viable almost exclusively because of Runeglaive's mana regeneration, but I've also accepted that Runeglaive isn't good for diversity.\n\nWe can't have Magus or Runeglaive because they both reduce diversity in their own ways. We can't have both because it still restricts diversity to those that are already good. We need a new item that promotes diversity without restricting it the way either of those items did.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-09-28T12:42:40.212+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think neither Magus nor Runeglaive are the best fit for AP junglers. As you mentioned, Runeglaive only caters to a small fraction of AP junglers who were already advantaged when clearing (i.e. by blending autoattacks in with spells), to the detriment of mages, but at the same time Magus was just a boring enchantment that didn't offer anything unique to AP junglers and was often sold or ignored entirely in favor of Morellonomicon. I also think there's a deeper issue of early clears being so painful for mages, regardless of which enchantment they get, that it would prevent them from becoming as popular as, say, {{champion:131}} or {{champion:60}}, even if they get the perfect enchantment afterwards.\n\nYour idea of giving AP champions a DoT to help them clear sounds good, and I think that could actually be brought right down to Hunter's Machete: since the item already has a DoT, giving it an AP ratio would allow AP champions (and only AP champions) to have a better time clearing right from the get-go, and would solve the core issue of mages suffering in the jungle due to having large cooldown and mana gates to their spells early on. Aside from that, I think the ideal AP jungle enchantment should probably mirror Luden's Echo: moving, autoattacking and dealing spell damage would build up charges, with the charge generation increased against monsters, and at 100 charges your next instance of spell damage deals bonus damage, scaling with AP (perhaps even max health damage, to  help burstier mages deal with tough monsters, as well as have some more gold- and target-agnostic power), though to just one target, likely the most wounded and prioritizing champions and large monsters. Since AP junglers tend to be better at inflicting AoE damage than most other champions, but often have a tough time dealing with big monsters when their cooldowns are down, it would allow mages to clear more smoothly, while still benefiting AP autoattackers as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Bouffon dAnglais","date":"2015-09-28T13:42:01.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just make the Machete's passive effect proc on spells.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"idoki","date":"2015-09-28T11:31:56.239+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Both should have existed together.\nJuggernaut should also have stayed, as not all tank/bruiser junglers benefit from {{item:3709}} bonus %HP and rather have the tenacity Juggernaut gave ({{champion:72}}  {{champion:102}} [if sated devourer didn't exist] {{champion:32}} etc).\n\nThe whole 2 paths for each stat is explained very well in stonewall's video from a while ago:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWJnA8VkAsE","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lintu Puck","date":"2015-09-29T03:51:44.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Lets take a step back to season 4.

Then we can remove {{champion:76}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:131}} because they were mostly played in solo lanes anyway ({{champion:131}} would jungle occasionally, but she was mostly in a solo lane). {{champion:60}} always built the tank item and {{champion:28}} built the AD or tank item. That leaves {{champion:9}} being the ONLY competitively played AP jungler. {{champion:60}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:76}} and {{champion:131}} all received nerfs and/or reworks in their kits over time, and they were not played much anymore ({{champion:76}} was awful because it took a while to finalize where they wanted her to be in terms of power). But in the jungle, the only junglers who were building the AP item were {{champion:9}} {{champion:76}} and the occasional {{champion:131}}. Now that Runeglaive took the place of Magus, we see {{champion:60}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:105}}{{champion:245}}  all being played in the jungle with the AP item, even though {{champion:245}} and {{champion:105}} build the tank item more often than the AP one. Jungle diversity actually rose with the addition of the Runeglaive. Yes it hurt {{champion:9}} a lot, but balance changes directly to him can bring him up to par with laners and possibly supports, because right now he doesn't have much identity anymore. But diversity in the jungle is higher with Runeglaive, because before it came along there weren't many AP junglers that were being played outside of normal games (there were really only 1.5 {{champion:9}} and sometimes {{champion:76}} ), and they were mostly cheese anyway. No one played them in ranked games unless they were 100% committed to the style, but they were a minority.
