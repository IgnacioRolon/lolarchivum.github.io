Her W just has a long animation, so once it's started it's going to finish (unless she dies before the animation completes). Similar to this, you can't knock Lux or Ezreal out of their ults, as those are just long animations. You also see this with jumps/dashes. If Ezreal starts his E animation right as CC is about to hit him, he'll still blink to the target location and then be CC'd once he gets there.\n\nEdit: I had her abilities mixed up (have hardly ever played her, mb). The above holds true for animations. What's been said by others about the empowered auto is correct.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-06-30T16:17:31.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Illaoi W is an empowered basic attack. Basic attack are not interruptible once their animation started. So yes, this is intentional. It's like how the arrow from an ADC will still hurt you even if you stun the ADC while it's still in the air, or like how even if you flash out of range of a Malphite basic attack it will still hurt you as long as he started the animation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shuyin178","date":"2017-06-30T16:07:53.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of champions whose spells go off even when interrupting CC (like Knockups and stuns) hit them, so this isn't just restricted to Illaoi.","replies":[]}]}
