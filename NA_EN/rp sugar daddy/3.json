Ive played a few games here and there with her, and it &quot;works&quot;, just trying to optimize it as much as possible.\r\n\r\nFor a build i think (Not in a specific order)&gt;\r\n{{item:1401}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3512}} {{item:3102}} .\r\n\r\nGives out 30% CDR sadly, but 40% if you get blue, which should go to mid anyway so meh. But has plenty of HP, Armor and MR stats. Plus with her entire kit, she has SO MUCH ganking&amp;lockdown potential that it makes up for her slower clears, which i could almost compare that to rammus or malphite. \r\n\r\nWhats yalls thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"TheMightyLamp","date":"2018-10-08T14:12:48.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"leona jungle. sure. tank leona jungle? no lol, go on hit or full ap, it's a ton of fun and actually pretty strong besides the fact you get one shot easily","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-08T23:24:47.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leona would not really be worth jungling due to effort - Reward.

Even tanks designed for the jungle are weak at the moment due to the importance of 1v1 deuling power.\n\nAt least she wont lose scuttle fights, as she wont ever make it to any, being too slow to clear.   It can sort of work as bad cheese (seen it done), but that was in the old days with real fat catch up xp.  When you're 3 levels behind the enemy jungle, you're really going to wish you were on something else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2018-10-08T16:34:06.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have no intention of climbing, then Leona jungle is just meh. Her waveclear is seriously crap, her passive does nothing, and you're highly vulnerable to invades.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2018-10-08T16:26:08.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As others have said, it isn't as good as meta-junglers, but it is certainly something that can work, and could even be good. Really anyone CAN jungle, but the biggest hurdle for any jungler is their first, and sometimes even their second full clear. I think absolute worst champion you could ever attempt to jungle with would be Azir, but if you could struggle through the first part of the game, he can clear jungle camps really fast. \n\nAs you said for Leona, she has a lot of hard cc, which is great for ganking. \n\nHer decent base health and bonus resistances help with her ability to mitigate damage while clearing. Her auto attack reset and AOE damage really helps with her ability to clear with decent speed, but not fast. I'm not sure about her mana sustain, but the Blue buff and jungle item will really help with this matter. Sheen /  Iceborn Gauntlet would nearly solve any mana issues all together. \n\nI don't think full damage is really the best way to go about it though. As I said, her clear speeds are not ideal. Building more damage will be important for her to keep up with her team and to have an impact when she engages. \n\nHer auto attack reset actually makes Tiamat / Titanic Hydra pretty valuable, despite the fact that she doesn't scale on AD, but it does have good synergy with Cinderhulk. I don't know that Stalker's Blade would be 'better' than Skirmisher's Sabre. You're already layering a lot of crowd control from her kit and with Iceborn Gauntlet. The Challenging Smite will actually work to her advantage because it gives her 20% damage reduction, and increases her damage output with a true damage burn. \n\nPersonally, I would decide on the rest of my build situationally. If you're ahead, go for more of a bruiser build so you can help your team snowball. If you are behind, you will need to be able to help your team defend and teamfight around objectives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-10-08T15:11:36.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can she?

Also her first clear is awful and while she has good cc she lacks mobility to make good gank, Predator might solve that but domination primary is not exactly what you want to use for Leona.\n\nSo if you get resolve primary instead I recommend to take Sorcery second, Celerity+Waterwalking and take {{item:3117}} (swap for mercury/ninja if the game goes beyond 25minutes).\n\nAs for items.\n\nConsider {{item:3800}} , will help with ganking and engaging. Right now tanks aren't so tanky anymore, the best defense is offense, if you activate this enemies will have to run and won't be able to attack you (and if they don't run they should die).\n\nSecond item to consider is {{item:3190}} , a lot of tank junglers builds this, and on Leona it makes much more sense.\n\n{{item:3143}} is not so good lately, it used to be anti-crit items but right now crits deal true damage so it doesn't help. I would say {{item:3742}} is better for the ms + bonus damage.\n\n{{item:3512}} has great passive, but it doesn't make much sense to have this on a jungler other than Udyr. To use this to full potential you want to splitpush but Leona excels in teamfights so not so good choice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wilyum","date":"2018-10-08T14:12:39.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably not, she lacks sustain and reasonable clear speed.  That being said anyone can jungle there are just better picks and you will have to rely on team a lot until at least Bambi.  \nIf the enemy jg invades and you don't have any lane priority you're toast. \nAnother thing is her ganks pre-6 would be weaker than most others if the laners have wards unless you took predatot","replies":[]}]}
