And ive added my own little bit to the bottom.\r\n\r\nPretty much the title. I do not want to play with/against premades when I play solo. The reasons have been said too many times in boards:\r\n\r\n*     groups with toxic players are much worse than solo toxic players, because they defend each other and coordinate their flame\r\n    even non-toxic premade groups tend to not communicate with their solo teammates\r\n*     in addition to the previous point I have witnessed in many occasions how premade group do not follow a good initiation by the solo player, while following the wrong one, as long as it is done by their premade. It is not always the case, but I have seen this happening. Believe me - the feeling when you land 5-man sej ult, just to see how your teammates recall at full HP is pretty discouraging\r\n*     in addition to the previous points - I cannot count how many times I&#039;ve seen solo players camped like hell, often by 3-4 man ganks (by the enemy premade groups) while his teammates only help each other\r\n\r\nI can conclude - when I get matched with a big premade group I feel like I have next to zero impact to the outcome of the game. I will win, if the premade group in my team is better, and I will if the enemy team premade groups is better than mine. Unless i get 25/0 or 0/15 my individual performance have next to zero impact. And no matter what happens I cannot find the most important part of the game - FUN.\r\n\r\nSo, some of you will say &quot;You haven&#039;t played ranked this season, how can you judge&quot;. Well, I play in normals. That&#039;s the situation I see in normals, and I have no reason to think it would be different in ranked. And I prefer being unranked, than having a rank I contribute nothing, based on how good premades I am matched with.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nTo add on to this. I can NOT play Ranked any longer. Last season i was Gold 2, had a leona with 85ish games, 78% win rate, a Noc with 200+ games, a 67% win rate and a Teemo with 50+ games with a 65ish% win rate. Now? I barely have half those, was placed in silver 3 (I was trying to be like chickenwrap, bombed my placements with shaco), barely climbed to silver 1, just to start losing back to back, now in silver 4.\r\n\r\nDid i lose because of myself? Sure did. Why though? I got discouraged. As Awesome said above, when 4 other players are not fully committed, do not communicate to you, bash you for little mistakes, even for picking a champion thats out of meta {{champion:38}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:83}}, they just mad dog you the whole game, even if your winning and barely losing in CS.\r\n\r\nI have had SEVERAL games, to where the problem wasnt even on my own team. Having 2-3 solos with one duo or a 3 man team on ours, while theres a 4 man on the other side. and all 4 jungle invade you at 5 minutes, tower dive you at 7 minutes, fully coordinated while your team is doing something you would see on a DanteAxeProduction video. This has become out of hand, its singling out solo players. It has made me not to want play Ranked any longer due to this. Heck even in Normals theres problems with premades.\r\n\r\nSoloQue for Ranked.\r\nTeam Builder needs to be back for normals as well.","replies":[]}
