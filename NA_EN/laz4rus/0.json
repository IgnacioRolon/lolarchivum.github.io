The only fix I have found so far is to force shut down my PC which inevitably makes me join into games late. As a result of this I was put in a low priority que for leaving games. I don't think this is fair because it is not intentional or at any fault of mine. There is an issue with the client that I have no control over. My computer runs everything else fine all the time and I rarely have anything else open when I am playing league besides maybe music or obs, neither of which I have been using when this occurred. All three times I have done my best to reconnect as fast as possible and have won 2/3 of the games. It would be really cool if the que restriction was removed from my account. Thank you for your consideration.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-05T17:22:11.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This freezing has been an issue for a few players, and might be caused by a recent Windows 10 update that's auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).  Disabling that should help get this fixed up!  The only way you can remove [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) restrictions is by playing consistently without interruptions.

My point is that the restriction which was imposed on me was due to a problem that I was unaware existed and as such, had no control over. I can not be at fault for something, by definition, if I had no control over it.\n\nAn hour and forty minutes of restriction time due to a problem that I didn't even know existed is not in any way a fair punishment and is quite simply absurd. Especially absurd because it is exactly the opposite of what the system was designed to do as it is my assumption that the system was implemented to punish people who were leaving games or going afk intentionally. Am I correct on that assumption?\n\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Splitrailx","date":"2017-09-08T21:29:35.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same issue, and have since disabled the xbox thing after a google search for why my client was locking up.    Silly with the rep I have that a couple lock ups makes me wait longer to que.   My lock ups always seem to happen in game tho, rather than in loading screen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LAZ4RUS","date":"2016-10-06T00:17:40.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disabling the game bar does not completely fix the problem","replies":[]}]}
