I have in game 100 fps with settings on all high that inst problem because my graphic card is good she isnt bad like my cpu wich is 2.6 dual and ram 3gb. When i finish game i can go to pee to make some to eat and etc. It takes more than 2 minute to load stats after game to see fcking stats. I can hear when loading stats sounds of typing in chat and etc but circle going on and on. I must to turn off client during game and enable low spec because i have very high lags in game when is client enable. Now question is riot how u cant make this new client to be like old one. Old one hasnt open client during game but work perfect and take no time to load game stats? What u trying to do, i mean u wanna to make thing better but u only make things worst. Couple of my friends have same problem. Please fix that we dont need new stats or smth just make it to work property. U enable low spec mode wich means to disable lot of animation who dont take cpu and ram so much so u didnt nothing.\r\nHere what to low spec mod.\r\n- Disable animation in lobby (just some of all)\r\n- Disable skin animation like spirit guard udyr and etc\r\n- Nothing more\r\nMake things to be like old client in this case what i talking about, many players have same problem like me, we dont have i5 and i7 cpu like u in riot. Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-25T16:48:16.801+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Closing client during match, could be playing a part in getting you to the post-game screen.  It may take a bit to reload the client when the match ends, and that time can vary based on your specs and even connection.  Another factor here could be the stability of your network as it attempts to transition back to pvp.net.    If you want to continue using the close client option that's fine, but in the meantime I suggest going through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure there are no hiccups causing you to load between the client and the game.
