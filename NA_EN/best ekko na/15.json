This guy wasted a lot of time, he died 2-3 times, and ultimately he pissed our whole team off and costed us the game. Meanwhile he responds to everything in the chat with \"I'm not 12.\" and \"lol\".

It's troll if your lane is empty, wave about to hit enemy tower, and you back with health, mana, and don't even try to hit the tower while players are dead.

The fact that they are soo heavy with the ban hammer and punish anyone from trying to leave a game like this is proof that Riot prefers trolls over anyone who actually tries to play. Leveling up is the worst because it's nothing but bored plat smurfs and trolls who made new accounts.

A single troll will destroy hundreds or thousands of matches for others before they get punished, and even then the punishment won't prevent them from continuing to troll, whereas everyone who tries to fight the troll gets punished as well, and those who try to escape the trolling even get punished immediately by LeaverBuster.\n\nEven if you do nothing at all, you are still being forced to actively play a lost and un-fun game while being harassed at the same time for up to an hour.\nThat is clearly giving the trolls all the power.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwiftSwifties ","date":"2017-08-27T06:42:17.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean i used to \"troll\" to have fun.
