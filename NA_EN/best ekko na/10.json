As someone who plays melee champions, I sincerely feel that she is god damn nearly unreachable. Without Flash, there&#039;s no way to get her late game because of her ridiculous range. Then, even if you can reach her, she has too many tools to get away from you. She can Rocket Jump, Flash, or knock you away with Buster Shot. \n\nIt&#039;s not like Tristana&#039;s &quot;kit&quot; is weak by any means. After Tristana&#039;s little bomb rework, she gained far more power than she lost. Tristana literally kept every ability in her entire previous kit, with even more added on it. Let me tell you, it really shows too. Not only in professional games.. where she is picked constantly, but also in everyone else&#039;s games. According to OP.GG, Tristana is still sitting as the 3rd most winning ADC.. that&#039;s even after getting nerfed.\n\nAll the players spamming that freelo Tristana will hate me for saying this, but I honestly believe that her extra &quot;range&quot; passive should be removed. Tristana gave up nothing for that extra power on her E and it doesn&#039;t feel fair at all that Tristana can have that insane range and also still do massive damage to players and towers (even at the same time), without having to worry because if someone gets close she just jumps back or shoots them away with her ultimate.\n\nCaitlyn is supposed to be the &quot;long range siege&quot; champion in League of Legends, yet she doesn&#039;t do anywhere near the damage to towers. Caitlyn can&#039;t knock you away, her E animation is fairly slow, she&#039;s far weaker than Tristana who wasn&#039;t initially even meant to fill that role (and yet does better at the job than a champion supposedly created for it). Sure, it&#039;s not really a big deal if there are multiple champions who are &quot;siege&quot; champions, but Tristana simply has way too much range and safety for the amount of damage she deals late game.\n\nMaybe I&#039;m crazy, and this isn&#039;t the right answer, but I don&#039;t think Tristana will lose much if her range is taken away. She&#039;ll still be very strong, the only thing that&#039;s going to change is that Tristana players won&#039;t be able to just go on auto pilot once they have a lead and fall asleep hitting the A button on everyone from a mile away.","replies":[{"poster":"Hayaishi","date":"2018-02-24T08:17:23.160+0000","up_votes":49,"down_votes":16,"body":"She's low risk high reward.\n\nShould literally be gutted and never allowed to be viable again until reworked.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2018-02-24T08:32:03.835+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":6,"body":"tank is not allowed to buffer cc {{champion:516}} \n\nmarksman is {{champion:18}} \n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2018-02-24T08:48:09.033+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"It'd make sense if she didn't have the most range, a jump that can go over walls and resets, and a hard knock back.

I don't think the answer is to nerf tristana. Her kit hasn't really changed aside from a small nerf to her E i believe last season and now her ult CD. I think in order to bring her back in line you need to buff her counters of lane bullies since they are all garbage. Get the lane to hard shove force her under tower where she has a hard time farming and this allows you to not blind pick her. \n\nAs for cait she got hit hard last year (which was right to do, and yes I am a cait main) but the fact of her state right now is she fair. Shes ok at everything and excels at nothing. You can pick other champions who can do what she can currently do and other things on top of that. Her low HP in lane makes it hard to engage since if you get all-ined you pretty much are dead. Her trap duration is so short at low ranks that the damage is unreliable so people max Q to get some damage. Most cait mains either max Q or go 3 points into Q then max traps. Her E isn't a problem either its been in a good state. The real problem is her ult. Her ult right now is used more for poke damage than execution and with body blocking it with a tank makes it a wasted ability. She definitely needs some sort of buff to make her a bit of a lane bully again. As to what that buff is I am not sure without breaking her. I thought an ult rework of making it like 200/300/400 guarenteed to hit (not body blockable) and have it scale with AP instead of AD so it doesn't get stronger and is used as an execute of carries after a fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2018-02-24T17:08:33.625+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tristana isnt the third highest win rate ADC.\n\nShe is barely number 8 at an almost ideal 50% (50.05%).

I think riot should simply nerf late game ADC&#x27;s as a whole instead of nerfing tristana alone.\n\nNot that other ADC's deal any less damage, but I find that they can be dealt with in their own ways. Twitch / Caitlyn both have a lot of range, but they do not have the same amount of \"safety\" that Tristana does in team fights. Corki / Ezreal / maybe even Varus, have long poke range, but they deal a lot less damage as a price for staying long range. If any of them want to be useful for their team, they have to take the risk of getting into auto attack range, which makes them less safe. Vayne has stealth, but again is fairly short ranged. Jhin / Graves both have reloads on their auto attacks, and neither are really long ranged. Draven has his knock back and movement speed boost, but once again he doesn't really have a lot of range. Xayah only has one tool to escape and it's her ultimate.\n\nThere simply is not another ADC on Tristana's level. After level 16 she's the longest ranged ADC in the game with an escape tool, self peel ultimate, tons of wave clear, and massive damage to both towers, and champions. Tristana has all the strengths of every other ADC in the game, without any risk whatsoever. It doesn't have much of anything to do with her early game. Tristana's kit in itself is the problem. She's allowed to have access to literally everything that makes all the other ADC's strong, and doesn't have any downsides.","replies":[{"poster":"TopperH","date":"2018-02-25T16:17:18.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And Twitch gets to shred your whole team at once.
