Even if we include other abilities they generally fully reset or get time off their CD when a condition is met.  A quick look for ult resets/extension gave me this list:\n\nExtensions-\nAatrox's ult is a buff that lasts 10 seconds and is extended 5 seconds up to 10 seconds per takedown\n\nKatarina's ult doesn't reset, but she gets 15s off CDs per takedown\n\nMaster Yi's ult is a buff that lasts 7 seconds and is extended 7 seconds per takedown\n\nVayne's ult is a buff that last 8/10/12 seconds that is extended by 4 seconds, up to the max duration, per takedown within 3 seconds of her damaging them\n\nResets-\nDiana's ult fully resets if she hits someone affected by her Q.\n\nDarius ult resets on kill w/ 20 second reset that becomes a full reset at rank 3\n\nPyke's ult is the same as Darius's resetwise except it never fully resets\n\nSo, ya good one.  Unless I missed someone the only 2 with ults to reset and hold are Pyke and Darius.  As was mentioned earlier Pyke's ult CD doesn't start ticking down til you're done with it.  Darius's CD starts on first cast.\n\nAnd yet again as was mentioned the 20 seconds feels like the least abusive part of the ult.  Most reset kills are done in quick succession within 5 seconds.  If the ult was too good or the champ was OP you'd go elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Barkley","date":"2019-07-18T14:27:39.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Be careful if that joke flying over your head.
