Let me just say, I don&#039;t want to feel that way. I like to play whatever I feel like playing, whether that&#039;s Riven Bottom, Karthus Support, or Nami Top. The fact is however, the results are never there. Not only are unusual picks not designed for their roles, it causes players to tilt and makes them not want to play as a team. In a game of 10 strangers, no one wins when one player picks a champion not designed for their role.\n\nDon&#039;t get me wrong, there are a lot of talented players in League of Legends who can  find and do some awesome things. Zoe and Ezreal Jungle in the past, Ziggs when he was played at Bottom, they&#039;re creative and I&#039;m not here to talk bad about the players who are successful with champions outside of their intended position. There is no problem with those who are a main of those champions and being successful, it&#039;s instead the aftermath in what happens when one of these super talented players is discovered by the rest of the community.  The upheaval and turmoil that ensues after rumors and media is spread causes far more problems in the rest of the community that plays the game than it&#039;s worth.\n\nTrends such as these never last long, because they are never intended, and only ever occur because of one talented player standing out. This one aspect alone signals a flag that random picks outside of intended roles simply shouldn&#039;t exist. I&#039;ve made posts about this in the past, and they&#039;re always down voted because everyone loves thinking they are unique. The reality is, this game has existed for the better part of 10 years now, and there&#039;s nothing that hasn&#039;t been tried already. It&#039;s not unique. Someone in the last 10 years, has tried everything you are thinking, and there&#039;s a reason it&#039;s not mainstream. Besides patches made by Riot intentionally relocating champions, such as what was done with Vi, champions are played exactly where Riot intended them the majority of the time. I think it&#039;s fine for pre-mades, but in ranked it actually borderline disrespectful to play fringe picks. Hell, your team might not even know how to play around it.\n\nSeriously, with a few implementation keys, there are so many problems that can be improved by just role locking champions in solo queue.\n\n1. Problems with players getting upset about their team&#039;s picks will decrease, teams will be more likely to work together.\n2. Players are less likely to tilt from having to play against fringe picks such as Lucian top.\n3. Champions can be better balanced, knowing that outliers (in solo queue) will be less likely to dominate from changes.\n4. Timers can be shortened in champion select (solo queue) as players not only have less to think about but also won&#039;t need to trade champions with other players.\n\nJust tweak the ban phase a little (in solo queue), so that it&#039;s not possible to ban out the entire marksman pool, tie champions roles, and boom. The quality of solo queue just increased dramatically. Happy teammates, quality champions, quality matches. Sure there will always be players that find ways around the system, but things like that usually are not large scale.\n\nAlso, yes I know. You&#039;re upset because now you can&#039;t trade and counter pick in a queue with a bunch of strangers, but that&#039;s another system that I take up issue with. I&#039;ve seen so many times where trades are botched or result in disasters. Players often forget to trade, don&#039;t own the champion for the other player, accidentally take the wrong summoner spells, or simply don&#039;t pick at all resulting in them unintentionally dodging. This happens quite a lot when players trade in Silver tier and I immediately start worrying the instant I see someone trying to arrange one. Botched trades almost always end up with the same result as a player fringe picking a champion. I personally don&#039;t agree with that system and I wish it were gone.\n\nAs for which champions go to what roles, Riot would be the best judge. They see the data, they balance the game. Riot understands which champions are supposed to be where, as well as which champions are the most successful in each role. The idea isn&#039;t to stop players from playing the champion they desire in the role they love, and I&#039;m sure Riot would make the correct decisions as to what champions would be included where. The idea is to create a more enjoyable environment by reducing unintentional griefing and taking measures to prevent player harassment and bad situations before they occur.\n\ntl;dr:\n\n* Implement role locking (in solo / duo queue only) for known champions intended positions.\n* Adjust ban phase (in solo / duo queue only) so Marksman cannot be completely banned out.\n* Reduce timers in champion select (in solo / duo queue).\n* Remove champion trading (in solo queue, for players who are not queued together).\n\nWhile others might argue or disagree, I firmly believe this is the right move (for solo queue) to help make the game better and more enjoyable for more players. I do think in other modes, players should be free to co-ordinate and test freely, but solo / duo queue is a competitive environment and the less room players have for creating tilt and disturbances the more peace of mind everyone can have while playing.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-10-06T22:42:58.770+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"No","replies":[]},{"poster":"Misses Old Talon","date":"2018-10-06T22:41:00.014+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, remember when ezreal and Taliyah at a point in time were top tier junglers?

Yes it doesn&#x27;t matter if an idea gets up votes and downvotes, but an idea going against longstanding policy is not gonna get traction.\n\nAs for the rest of it (talking about Riot's policies), Riot has went against their own policies many times in the past. This is Riot Games, I mean you really expect Riot to uphold things? They are often rebuked and harassed by the players for everything they do, which leads to them adjusting parts of the game and not always for the better.\n\nMaybe no one wants it, but it's the right decision and it's the direction Riot has been steering (maybe without realizing it) for the past two seasons. More and more Riot has been re-working, re-balancing, and removing parts of champions which enable them to play into hybrid builds and multiple roles. All of Riot's experiments regarding \"diversity\" have failed and led to them having to excessively buff then nerf, champions who they have tried things with. This includes things such as Mordekaiser, Kindred, Ziggs, among quite a lot of others.\n\nThe only two things that leads players towards trying a champion outside its intended role is either trolling or abusing some aspect of the champion which is out of balance.\n\nWill Riot do it? More than likely not. \nShould Riot do it? Absolutely.\n\nI am going to be more and more pro-active about pushing this issue because it's a massive flaw in the game which leads to many problems.","replies":[]}]}
