For example we have items such as these:\n\n|{{item:3001}} | {{item:3194}} | {{item:3065}} | {{item:3190}} | {{item:3231}} | {{item:3102}} | {{item:3512}} |  and obviously | {{item:3163}}|\n\nTo put this into perspective, there are two Magic Resist items for Ability Power, and two for Attack Damage.\n\nMagic Damage: |{{item:3001}}| {{item:3102}}|\n\nPhysical Damage: |{{item:3156}}| {{item:3139}}|\n\nIn this regard, both damage dealers are on near equal footing when it comes to available defenses for magic resistance. If you are still worried about it, there&#039;s still a few other items available for both sides that you could be building from the list without having to worry about building Attack Damage that you do not want or need.\n\nNow, let&#039;s look at the flip side. Here are some items which are designed with armor:\n\n|{{item:3025}} | {{item:3190}} |{{item:3056}} |{{item:3143}} |{{item:3800}} |{{item:3068}} |{{item:3075}} |{{item:3306}} | {{item:3512}} | {{item:3026}}| and once more, obviously: |{{item:3157}} |\n\nFor Magic Damage champions, this item is available: |{{item:3157}} |\n\nFor Physical Damage champions, there is: |{{item:3026}}|\n\nIf either side is still worried about it, there are a decent list of Armor items which are neutral and can be shared between both Attack Damage and Magical Damage champions.\n\nSo, the next time you want to complain about (insert bias&#039;d champion pool here) vs (insert bias&#039;d champion pool here), take a second to remember that game balance goes far beyond the short sighted reasoning and twisted logic you are using to support your desires.\n\nBoth Magic Damage champions and Physical Damage champions have two items for Magic Resist, and also one item for Armor. \n\nThey are equal.","replies":[{"poster":"Fízz v2","date":"2018-10-03T17:41:09.153+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":20,"body":"but {{item:3157}} sucks unless you use the active  well and {{item:3001}} is a tank item\n\nad > ap :]","replies":[{"poster":"Best Ekko NA","date":"2018-10-03T17:45:14.082+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":9,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fízz v2,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TlzEjE8o,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-10-03T17:41:09.153+0000)\n>\n> but {{item:3157}} sucks unless you use the active  well and {{item:3001}} is a tank item\n> \n> ad &gt; ap :]\n\nTank item? \nIt scales your damage, the more damage you build the more amplification you get from it.\n\nI fail to understand your logic, it increases your damage 15%, how does it become a Tank item?\n\nIf you start early game with 30 AP and deal 150 damage with your ability then it gives you another 22.5 damage.

Very few champions besides maybe Aatrox, Garen, Riven, and Graves, have abilities that actually scale total AD.

Consider the following, a long time ago games were slow and generally required wise use of your gold and timing in order be as efficient as possible and win trades, lanes, and games against the other team. This led people to be very picky about the type of items they were building -- wasting anything meant that you might not actually be able to win against your enemy because every stat you gained mattered a lot.\n\nFast forward a ways, most players can agree that games are fast and damage is insanely high. Gold efficiency has lost most of the meaning that it used to have. League has transformed into a game about snowballing and almost completely removed the aspect of strategy and slow methodical gameplay. The problem with this is, the player base still thinks identical to the past, when things like how viable an item was mattered. This means that some items which might help them in certain situations, players aren't purchasing because they've been trained over several seasons that those items aren't viable.\n\nIt's not much different from a video that I saw Doublelift post, where he mentioned how long it took Starcraft Protoss players to find a solution to dealing with the Zerg. When you don't know the answer and it seems unfair, the most common reaction by players is to complain. The fact is however, there are a lot of options that none of the player base is trying because the meta in League has been shifting so fast and so often. The crowd of this game often doesn't help much either. Trying new things gets you flamed, and that in part is why a lot of players would rather complain than look for answers to the problem.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Need Gold 4 Tent","date":"2018-10-04T13:00:50.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's still 2 anti AP vs 1 anti AD, and top that with the fact that AD does more sustained damage  even when on CD.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZaFishbone","date":"2018-10-04T12:47:25.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unpopular opinion -> **YOURS**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nausicäa ","date":"2018-10-04T10:01:50.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think i got dumber just reading this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-10-04T00:11:10.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"~~Popular ~~ Logical opinion\n\nwhen AD damage champ itemize against AP champs they have offense + defense opinions \n{{item:3139}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3091}} \n\nall of them with unique passive that can combine any which way to form any combination for any ad champ whether its ADC/ assassin, or even bruiser\n\nwhen AP want to itemize against AD they have\n\n{{item:3157}}   \n\nif u want to INCLUDE AD + HP items then AD ALSO get\n{{item:3071}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3814}} {{item:3053}}  \n\nwhile as AP + HP we get\n{{item:3151}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3030}} {{item:2065}} \n\n\nthe DIFFERENCE is, sure we can build offensive with armor, but we can only do so with ONE item that CANNOT stack  and is HEAVILY cost efficiency gated by an active which also have a massive drawback and can easily be used improperly, and doesn't stack\n\n\nif u want to face us and build \"offensive vs AP\"\n\nyou get 6 different items all with unique passives all of which can stack and can combine and stack in any which which u want to build depending on your champ.\n\ndo AP have options vs AP... yes we do\n\nand do AD have option vs AD... no not really every much\n\nin fact practically NO ONE has Resistance option vs AD unless they are willing to sac a damage slot\n\nthis isn't about how AP champs get HP on their items...
