I think this would be a good way to give incentive normal games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quil Evrything","date":"2018-09-27T20:59:35.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nunu Jung God,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5Rjcd1EV,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-09-27T20:42:40.743+0000)\n>\n> There really needs to be some reward or motivation for people to actually use Normal mode. \n\ncontrariwise, there are too many smurfs and boosters for me to want to play ranked mode much.\n\nmy ideal mode would be something where you get NOTHING except stylepoints.. but there's still a separate screwaround mode for the \"winning doesnt matter its jsut a game\" people to go to.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Ekko NA","date":"2018-09-27T21:01:57.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Quil Evrything,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5Rjcd1EV,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-09-27T20:59:35.637+0000)\n>\n> contrariwise, there are too many smurfs and boosters for me to want to play ranked mode much\n\nThe problem naturally doesn't include everyone, there are still plenty of players in Normal mode. My issue is more the people who are not satisfied with Normal mode but don't really care about Ranked either. These players do exist as hard as it may seem to believe, and in Silver you run into these types of players more so than anything else.","replies":[{"poster":"Serevas","date":"2018-09-27T21:11:09.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> and in Silver you run into these types of players more so than anything else.\n\nThat's definitely true. Third time twitch jungle in my promo matches straight inted into every lane and made the game completely unwinnable. Cheese picks aren't a good choice for game modes where people actually give a shit.\n\nI personally think promo matches need fixed pretty severely as well, in fact I can't understand why they even exist. You win enough to get maxed LP you should rank up. Promo matches are simply unnecessarily frustrating situations in which 90% of the time you have one or more players that would have done less damage to the game if they were simply afk.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RedOpticToxin","date":"2018-09-27T20:45:28.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, there should be higher blue essence gains for Normals","replies":[{"poster":"Best Ekko NA","date":"2018-09-27T20:52:28.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RedOpticToxin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5Rjcd1EV,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-09-27T20:45:28.637+0000)\n>\n> I agree, there should be higher blue essence gains for Normals\n\nI don't think that in itself would deter the problem, I believe competitive nature is a trigger to get people hooked, especially in League of Legends. Since there is no reason to try hard in Normal mode it doesn't feel satisfying, even when you win. This makes people look at the Ranked mode and start feeling like they'd be better rewarded there instead.\n\nBasically in theory, the only true way to get people out of Ranked who normally wouldn't be there, is to introduce some type of competitive aspect to Normal mode. That's why I believe adding a point system ladder to Normal mode (which revolves around time spent and not a system judging how good you are), is a much better solution than simply increasing Blue Essence gain.","replies":[]}]}]}
