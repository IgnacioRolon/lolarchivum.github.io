Obviously, there would need to be some &quot;rules&quot; laid out in the system to prevent abuse.. but overall it would be a step in the right direction.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2017-11-21T08:17:38.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When your thread gets to at least 10 downvotes, there HAS to be something obviously wrong with your thread.

People upvote things that aren't true, people down vote things that are also very good points.\n\nThe fact is, ignorant and uneducated people exist in this world. Popularity is not, and never will be, a good way to judge the validity of something.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DariusDemiurge","date":"2017-11-21T08:17:10.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'd lose a lot of your opportunity after posts like the one regarding Morgana you made recently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-11-21T08:15:01.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Prob depends on how each person views it.\n\nSome people see downvoting as just them not agreeing to it and downvote, same with upvote.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-11-22T01:20:09.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with the premise, but it does create a problem where you give people incentive to go and comment on threads that do not need additional comments.

I look at every single thread posted in Player Behavior for the most part. I only respond to a fraction of them. If someone has already said what you want to say, there is no sense piling on with more comments (which results in spam), but a simple upvote of posts you agree with and downvote of posts you disagree with goes a long way to get good posts/comments to the top.","replies":[]}]}
