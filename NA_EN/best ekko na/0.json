And this guy is in the same boat as a lot of others. Riot is losing players on a nominal basis because they are more than happy to ban 1 person reported by 4 trolls than ban 4 trolls who were harassing 1 person. Yeah I'm not a shining example of a good player, maybe even what i'd say is average, but the reporting system is flawed and the community has devolved into a toxic mess. I've ready the forums and there's hundreds of cases where, even though the person wasn't always right in there actions/comments, its clear they were being harassed and trolled. I've been the victim of this too. In my day job I have to make decisions that have to be based on a moral compass, I hope that as a professional you would be able to do the same. By the way, have a look at ALL my chat logs, not just what I said. I don't need to be unbanned or anything, but maybe you will see what I mean.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-01-12T19:14:09.138+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Heavensflame86,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=aAnEOacY,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-01-12T19:07:31.435+0000)...even though the person wasn&#x27;t always right in there actions/comments, its clear they were being harassed and trolled.\n\nYep! Not saying the harassing/trolling behavior is okay -- those players should be (and usually are) subjected to the system themselves based on their behavior. It doesn't, however, justify an individual breaking the rules in response.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-11T10:12:50.355+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't recommend doing that, as naming and shaming is against Boards rules.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Ekko NA","date":"2019-01-11T10:16:45.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":15,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=aAnEOacY,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-01-11T10:12:50.355+0000)\n>\n> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing that, as naming and shaming is against Boards rules.\n\nI don't care, if they aren't banning these people for being complete assholes in-game they have no right to ban anyone for anything anywhere.","replies":[{"poster":"PH45","date":"2019-01-11T10:22:07.806+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rainbow Slayer,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=aAnEOacY,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-01-11T10:16:45.309+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t care, if they aren&#x27;t banning these people for being complete assholes in-game they have no right to ban anyone for anything anywhere.\n\nSo you think cause others are breaking rules, you should be also?

Even if the players who flamed you somehow didn't get a punishment (which is incredibly unlikely), that doesn't suddenly mean that no rules have meaning and all of them should be broken regardless of what they are.\n\nSecond, you don't _see_ them getting banned/punished, so you're simply assuming that they just don't. That, again, is not how anything works. You're not going to get perfectly clear feedback telling you \"so-and-so player got punished/banned! good job!\" - hell, you're unlikely to even see \"a player you reported got punished\".\n\nSo unless you've got some extraneous, out-of-the-way method of proving without a shadow of a doubt that they _didn't_ get punished...You're only left to assume.\n\n> I don't care...\n\nI imagine you would care if you wound up getting yourself a Boards ban.

However, I do not appreciate one bit playing with a bunch of ungrateful babies who just want to complain about everyone and everything the entire match, and then start throwing insults around at their teammates.\n\nIt's not a one match thing. I keep dealing with this EVERY SINGLE MATCH.\nIt's a serious problem that needs addressed. Riot needs to stop shrugging it off and trying to pretend it's not a common thing.\n\nIf I have to start recording and uploading all the shit these people are saying, in every single one of my games, and put it on blast everywhere then I most definitely will. The system is not doing a good enough job and it needs addressed by Riot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2019-01-11T12:03:40.323+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"yeahhhh...time to breathe little fella, take a break, you're clearly tilted\n\nbtw what would naming them here do? no one here has banning powers","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2019-01-12T05:13:24.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol i have a friend like that.

Not sure if this is in reference to me, but I'm ranking up my account which got placed in Iron 4 due to the new changes. I'm playing at Gold 3 MMR, and I currently have a 62% total win rate and almost an 80% win rate on the champion that I'm playing with more than 20 matches.\n\nIf you wanna reference that and \"stupid builds\" together then be my guest, but I'm not having any struggles of my own whatsoever. The only reason I am even making this post, is because I'm tired of having to mute my teammates every single match. It's demoralizing to see the negative shit spewing from these people, like them calling me trash because I don't gank for them in the first 5 minutes of the match, when they've died 3 times already due to bad trades.\n\nPlayers in this game need to learn how to keep their finger off the enter button and just play the game. I'm trying my best for teams full of players who are just standing around in base typing negative garbage towards myself and others and it's beyond frustrating. It's really shitty when  I'm coming to gank and my teammate is standing around eating loads of damage, because they're standing still typing about how bad I am, then end up dying before I can even get there.\n\nRiot needs to hammer down on players much more than they have been. Believe me, I'm no \"soft\" player, and I don't mind a little trash talking from time to time. What's been happening in my matches however is beyond trash talking, it's needless harassment that shouldn't be tolerated.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arngrim31","date":"2019-01-12T01:01:42.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Putting peoples names on here out of frustration is just gonna hurt you even more.
