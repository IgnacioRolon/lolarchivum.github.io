This really is an inaccurate way to look at exactly how strong a specific player was, and I think there should be another statistic added which factors in a players build to show &quot;potential&quot; strength. \n\nI often see other players telling me I&#039;m useless because I dealt less damage, when I&#039;m a Jungler and didn&#039;t spend my entire first half of the game trading back and forth with enemy champions. Last game I even had 6,000 more gold and 5 items, compared to another player&#039;s 2 and a half items and they were still trying to tell me that I was useless because they did a little more damage than me [to champions]. It feels really bad to be weighted in such a manner knowing that (in that particular case) I was likely the strongest and most impactful member of my team.\n\nAt any rate, I&#039;m not quite certain how it could be implemented, but I wish there were some type of &quot;power rating&quot; which gives a score on how strong you were at the end of the game. Not something that&#039;s just based purely on damage dealt, but also your items and other statistics, combined into one single rating. This would really deter those people who have inflated egos just because they did a bit more damage than someone else.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2018-05-06T17:16:09.521+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"REPORT JG ONLY 15K DAMAGE TO CHAMPIONS.

It's like a classier way of pointing out KDA without looking like \"the 12 year old that only cares about KDA to stoke their ego\".\n\nCC score for example, you can get really high by playing champs that have slows as a main part of their kit even if they aren't about cc. Dr. Mundo has 1 slow in his kit for example, but because you throw so many cleavers to do damage you end up with a high cc score even if it's only a meager 40% moveslow that most of the time doesn't have any impact (because it's being used for harass damage). By comparison you might have had that one good rakan flash+R+W that actually won a teamfight because you hit like 4 guys in it and that's a case where the cc was way more impactful. But again because of how cc score is calculated mundo looks as if he did more.\n\nTo a similar extent a lot of champs that have laning phase harass built into their kit look like they have a high damage dealt stat but a lot of the time that damage might not have even had an impact because of how the enemy can deal with it through healing/tankiness.\nAnd the inverse is also true for stats like damage taken/mitigated and damage healed/shielded. A lot of the times those stats are from un-impactful gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2018-05-06T18:09:49.190+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Death's Dance is an example of inflating damage mitigated since you then take that damage soon afterward anyway.\n\nYeah, I agree with you.","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2018-05-06T22:51:47.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recently had a game where Kai'Sa mitigated more damage than Taric because death's dance.
