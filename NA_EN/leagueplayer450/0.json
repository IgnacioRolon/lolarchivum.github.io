If someone is a well established Plat, Diamond, or Masters+ player in solo queue, assigning them a provisional rank of Silver is inane.  \n\nAnd perhaps you missed the fact that this was happening _consistently_.

I mean if I was gaining huge gobs of Elo when I actually won against diamonds and losing next to nothing for getting rolled by a Masters player, it wouldn't be so bad.
