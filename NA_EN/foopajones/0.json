One of the runes labeled as &quot;Kleptomancy&quot; drops items and grants bonus gold. One of the items that was dropped was labeled as &quot;Pilfered Potion of Rouge&quot;. Pilfered Potion of Rogue states &quot;Grants 10 (+1/Level) Adaptive Force for 45 seconds.&quot; Health Potion: restore 150 health over 15 seconds. If anyone from Riot could link me the whole list of items I would greatly appreciate it. I have looked around and I still have yet to find out all of the possibilities for Kleptomancy.\n\n\nTo some up my post I want to know what Adaptive Force does. It doesn't do extra ad or anything like that. \n\n\nHere are some of the others I saw from a post by a player named &quot;B&acirc;rd&quot;\n\nMana Potion: restore 100 mana over 15 seconds.\n\nLooted Biscuit of Rejuvination: restore 15% your missing health and mana over 15 seconds. +40 mana permanently.\n\nPilfered Stealth Ward: Place a ward that reveals the area around it for 3 minutes.\n\nControl Ward: Place a visible ward that reveals the area around it and disables/reveals other wards.\n\nPilfered Farsight Ward: Place a visible ward at a location within 2000 range.\n\nMinion Dematerializer: Kill a target lane minion.\n\nSack of Gold: Consume to gain 20-100 gold.
