Plenty of bugs occur when the client has been open too long. Is there any fix other than restarting client.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-17T02:53:55.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's probably a good idea to close out your client while you aren't playing to make sure your pc isn't getting bogged down from having to run unneeded programs for a prolonged amount of time. With that being said, you should definitely take a step back and try to troubleshoot that freezing before hopping back into the queues. Try refreshing your client first, and if you're still having random freezes try running a quick repair through the client options.","replies":[{"poster":"WillStillIll","date":"2017-07-17T21:19:32.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happened again on a fresh client about 10 minutes ago, both times I was on another account \"ProfileName\" an account currently Gold II.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProfileName","date":"2017-07-17T21:20:38.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This account, and thank you for the quick response!","replies":[]}]}]}
