Riot please fix, you added this in 5.17 and I was super excited to see the project yi dance in 5x speed. Obviously this is just a bug, shouldn&#039;t bee too hard to patch.","replies":[{"poster":"ExHentai","date":"2015-09-10T17:26:35.263+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/7GEi9Q45-project-master-yi-dance-doesnt-scale-with-movement-speed?comment=0000\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=7GEi9Q45,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-02T18:07:15.151+0000)\n> \n> This is intentional.
