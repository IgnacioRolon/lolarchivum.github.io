I used to just shrug off these post, but now they really annoy me considering the boards have no activity so over 1/2 the post are just insulting men. I have reported so many of this post that clearly have to sole intent of attacking males and nothing has been done.\r\n\r\nHow do I know nothing has been done? Well they still spam this harassment everyday. Yea they may have gotten a temporary ban at some point, but they clearly didn't change how they behave here so not sure why they didn't get permabanned.\r\n\r\nlast time i checked \"Follow the Universal Rules or you will suffer the consequences. This board will be monitored 24/7, so if you see something that should be removed, please USE the report button.\" So either they just straight up lied and they don't monitor the boards at all (they literally would have had to check it at any point in the last 2 months to see these offensive post) or for some reason they don't consider insults to men being a jerk.","replies":[]}
