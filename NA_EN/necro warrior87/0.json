Klein is fired.. You are welcome to discuss the issue, if you agree/disagree with it, or unprofessional behavior, but you may not witch-hunt a Rioter or another player.\r\n\r\nWhile we aren&#039;t taking any actions against your account at this time, please keep in mind that continued violation of the Boards Universal Rules and sub-board guidelines may result in future punishments.&quot;\r\nI removed to Rioters name so they won&#039;t get harassed, he&#039;s probably trying to do his job and not get fired.\r\nBt didn&#039;t Mr. Klein violate THE GOLDEN RULE?\r\nBe RESPECTFUL TO PLAYERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS???\r\nHonestly Riot, I was being respectful towards Mr. Klein in my previous post.\r\nI was just saying he was being unforgivably rude and I was going to quit until Riot decides to fire him OR he leaves the company,\r\nOr you know, if he grows up and decides to make a public apology.","replies":[]}
