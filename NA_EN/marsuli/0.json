I haven't seen many cases where it's actually worked reliably on any method of playing League on Linux. Unfortunately, we don't have official support for Linux, so you'll want to reach out to the amazing communities on the [**Wine Forums**](https://forum.winehq.org/) or the [**PlayOnLinux Forms**](https://www.playonlinux.com/en/forums.html), depending on which method you're using to play the game.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions. Best of luck, Linux friend!\n\nhttp://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tux-226x250.png","replies":[]}]}
