Her voice tone is good enough for a psycho, but the loudness of her voice most of the time is like she's afraid someone will hear her, lol\n\nI think it does a good job of representing the fact that she's 1) utterly manic and 2) a complete sociopath. She doesn't care about other people. Half the stuff she says is just talking to herself.\n\n\"What if I had a gun that... *shot other guns???*\"\n\"She's such a lo-ser, always ready to cry! Ta-ta-ta-TA!\"\n\nAnd a lot of what she says is a stage whisper (a fake-whisper, loud enough that everyone around can hear) because the joke is she isn't really hiding it from anyone. There's no reason for her to actually whisper, she's just doing it because she's nucking futs.\n\n\"I really need a new gun... (But don't tell my other guns.)\"\n\"I'm wearing lots 'o' belts! (For no reason at all.)\"\n\nAt the very least, the lines she says when you play against her are distinct enough that you can tell without looking that it's Jinx performing the action. \"Bye-bye!\" Time to dodge. Frantically. Hopefully in the right direction.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Eno","date":"2014-10-24T00:25:52.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those are kind words; the audio team thanks you. =)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poldy Scarecrow","date":"2014-10-22T21:39:11.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sound effects are amazing as is the voice work imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Alexander","date":"2014-10-22T21:46:08.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The sound effects are amazing as is the voice work imo.\n\nI dont like that most recent champions and reworks yell so much or just say some random stuff every time they use some skill, I find it very annoying\n\nAlso some champs like Quinn, new Sion, Lucian, Jinx have barely audible voice overs.
