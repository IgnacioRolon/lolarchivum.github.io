You Failed Us, Riot.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":15,"body":"So after playing a game with an Aatrox that as soon as they joined the lobby said &quot;F**k it I&#039;m feeding&quot; and proceeded to feed their butt off the entire game. I reported them of course. I really was wondering why people do this kind of thing. And then I wondered, does Riot even care? And so I did a little test. I started up a new character. Got them to Level 30 so it would seem relevant. And then for roughly 25-30 games straight I would enter the game and say in all chat. &quot;I&#039;m feeding all game report me if you want.&quot; and then I would harass my team and feed the enemy as much as I possibly can. Every single game for 50 games. I still am able to log in every single day. No ban. No warnings. And so I&#039;m here to say that Riot really doesn&#039;t care if you have toxic or awful team mates. So what&#039;s your response Riot? Will you care about your community that keeps you in business or will you just let people run around ruining things for everyone? Because as it stands. Your game spouts more toxicity than {{champion:27}}","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-03-01T09:03:50.510+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NightSun6,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=8weafMke,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-03-01T08:02:30.515+0000)\n>\n> And then for roughly 25-30 games straight\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=NightSun6,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=8weafMke,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-03-01T08:02:30.515+0000)\n>\n>  Every single game for 50 games.\n\nI see you documented your findings pretty well.","replies":[{"poster":"Anomander","date":"2017-03-01T09:15:14.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got to love consistency.........","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-03-01T08:07:45.623+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm skeptical.
