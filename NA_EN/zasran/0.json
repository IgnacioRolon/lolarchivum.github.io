A lot of concept art and splash illustration is done by contractors. Often, the contractors post their League work to Artstation! (Does your gf have a page?)\n\nAnd not to be harsh. I'm at least half joking. Okay... maybe 45%. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}\n\nDrawing professionally for a game is as much a craft as an art. We couldn't ship \"Starry Night\" as our next champion, though it's stunning AF, to create the most ridiculous example possible... If you said your gf has created concepts with great readability from in-game camera angles, clear thematic, etc., I think I would've spit out my Kool-aid, and then a bunch of $100 bills to hire her (and I'm just a writer, lol).  There are very specific things we'd be looking for from concept artists in particular, skills that are sometimes as rare as broader artistic talent.\n\nAnyway, if your gf has a page or sample work online lemme know, I'll pass it on!","replies":[{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2019-12-05T19:41:37.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey Interlocutioner this is unrelated but Aphelios' narrative is super cool, was it a lot of working pumping him, Senna and Pantheon back to back to back","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2019-12-06T00:24:16.407+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, three champs in a row is tough to pull off.

Create a relationship between the player and Aphelios/Alune that's as deep as the night is dark, and as soft, as whispered as the moon is light. Aphelios feeling too much and protecting himself with numbness is something very personal to me; sometimes developing a character, you can find a truth in yourself. I needed to to reconcile and enrich everything we've said about the Lunari so far, develop their faith into a philosophy that's more than just \"moon\"... \n\nThere were dozens of goals and it would be hard to list them all, really.\n\nAlune is the primary voice because \"silent monk assassin\" is a cool archetype, and silence reinforces many of Aphelios's themes. (Really glad you like Tania's performance by the way, she was AMAZING to work with.)\n\nAlune spends much of her time in the spirit realm meditating, glimpsing futures and truths that can only be seen there. Alune loves to explore, to see beauty and wonder. In a way, she can explore more now, the temple projecting her thoughts anywhere. But to truly see the world through two eyes, she needs the help of her brother.\n\nAlune and Yuumi meeting is canon (edit: my personal head canon at least, nothing is really canon until it's in a story). Sometimes her meditation is broken by small adventures like that. The temple has a garden, for food.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-12-05T19:32:11.522+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does narrative writing work the same way?
