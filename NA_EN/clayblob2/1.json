He should get some form of refund on his ultimate or at least 2 layers of stars, like Extremely EXTREMELY HOT stars towards aurelions center and his w to go Far\n\n-volibear (i know i know, he just got a buff to his movement speed but i expected more and his ultimate should proc on-hit effects is what i want)\n\n-Shen (That w needs to Block ALL FORMS OF AD before i play him again, not just auto attacks)--&gt; its because xayah feathers are physical and are not in the spirit dimension so how df they still hitting him!??!?!?!\n\n-allistar: He needs his passive to heal from a a flat amount and missing HP to be strong in teamfights and the ability to spam his e and the ability for new leondrys to proc from his e\n\n-Braum: i wish braum had more  he  could do, like actually be like his lore. maybe the ability to break walls. Without good team co-ordination he's weak\n\nMundo: He's One Dimensional; Meaning Him healing himself is literally doing nothing for the team. What good does healing do if it can only help you in a team fight, and how does ignite work on Mundo when his w is literally fire. some champions ignite shouldn't work on\n\nIVERN: Because people complained about him. He got Nerfed and left  in the Dumpster for Being a good support, GJ RITO GJ. If this was\n a porno Ivern would of Rito's cum dumpster (Kids don't have a concept of what cum is so its ok)\n\nKindred: Her passive was better off left untouched, i do like the Scuttle crab Attachment and red and blue buff thing. but that makes her predictable. its better off making her mark Appear a quarter distance away from ALL Characters At Random. so the enemy doesn't have to plan to  invade her the whole game.\n\nMordekaiser: Mordekaiser players and mains all alike have been begging and pitching ideas about this guys rework for a long time, i shouldn't have to explain\n\nSona: what ever happened to her bro? *pubg face* i never see people play her anymore dam\n\nRumble: maybe a tiny buff, so he can stay relevant\n\nSIVIR: Riot Nerfed her into Oblivion, she was the first adc i ever played and liked and loved. i miss those old movement speed days were i used to outruun udyr around the map and run about at 1 HP n teamfights.\n\nVladamere: Swain is the new vladamere and his hairstyle and skin looks weird. whats up with that onion hairstyle. if only vladamere let his hair flow like a rock n role power fantasy\n\nzoe: Oh Yeah riot -raped- MB she's a child. Riot Nerfed her so hard, they might get arrested for the amount of Things they've done to her.","replies":[{"poster":"Clayblob2","date":"2018-03-08T00:48:21.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"XDDDDDDDDDDDDDD. i have dislexia.  i couldn't fit many charecters in the title\n\nBasically i was saying champions that \"Need some love from Riot\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-08T00:25:44.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Half of this makes my head hurt, half just makes zero sense and makes me wonder if this is a troll post..","replies":[]},{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2018-03-08T00:19:27.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are you taking about exactly? Read the title then the Aurelion Sol part and I'm REALLY confused. You're complaining about Riot lowering skill caps then immediate ask to lower AS's skillcap? Huh? Then the volibear part next.
