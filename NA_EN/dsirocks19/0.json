I have tried more than several times and currently it's 3:50am so I did leave it over night but it froze sometime while I was asleep. This is getting really aggravating as I really want to play. Anyone know how to unfreeze it from 75% Applying Patches???","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T00:50:02.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Issues at this stage (and anything after 33%) are caused by your patcher losing its connection to our patching servers.
