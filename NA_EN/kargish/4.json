It's incredibly straightforward. The extent of her skill expression is timing, positioning, and her Q, her only skillshot.\n\nYou put the E on the right player at the right time and you W the right enemy where it'll matter (like not blowing it on a Fizz who's going to leap to your carry anyway instead of hitting the Tahm Kench; slowing immobility over mobility). You use your ult appropriately and you position correctly. If you find this difficult to accomplish on Janna or think that it's a \"challenge\", I have to apologize and say that you're probably going to fall flat on your face with every other champion because no other champion carries the same amount of safety and utility on such a simple and easy kit. Not to mention other champs already have to worry about positioning and timing on top of actually hitting their shit.\n\n#Incoming controversial statement I guess, maybe not so much since it should be pretty obvious by now:\n\nPlaying **Sona** is harder than playing Janna. If you were a Sona player and argued that people didn't appreciate her hidden skill expression, then I would say you might actually have something since Sona's passive requires her to stack it as well as finish her combo with the key she wants to put to use - either increased damage, lowering enemy damage output, or slowing the enemy. You choose the wrong one at the wrong time and you can end up getting somebody killed. _That's_ something to actually worry about. This is on top of Sona having next to no self-peel and being one of the squishiest champions in the game.\n\nFlashing and pressing R once to knock an enemy champion 900 feet away from their partners because you have one of the most unfair ults in the game as far as counter-engage and sustain goes doesn't quite carry the same worry about it when you have to do nothing but press the button and watch the results go off.","replies":[{"poster":"Andrey0345","date":"2018-04-30T11:23:08.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Toxic Control,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=NkP5Ar8l,comment-id=00060005,timestamp=2018-04-30T10:55:57.827+0000)\n>\n> &quot;Hidden&quot; skill expression...?\n> \n> That&#x27;s... not a thing on her.

She's an enchanter support, not some assassin with ton of different mechanics.

Guess I didn't even though I did. Or maybe you just didn't read that part because, I mean, reading just one part of an argument obviously means you get the whole thing, right?\n\nSo to reiterate the entire rest of the post: Janna requires nothing that any other champion doesn't already require, and in fact requires far less. Her R is a literal button press and while it can be \"used in a ton of ways\", not only have all those ways been displayed in the well over 100 games of LCS that Janna makes her appearance in, **it's not mechanically difficult to pull off** - it's actually one of the easiest things to accomplish because, again, press the button, watch the results.\n\nNow this could be considered to require more mastery if Janna didn't, say... have a passive on her W that actually makes her one of the fastest moving champions in the game which allows her to position herself with such absolute ease that it's quite literally one of the main reasons she's picked so often and why she continues to stay relevant, one of the other reasons being that _she isn't fallible_ - she is a reliable constant since she will practically always be played to her full potential just because she's so simple and has all the tools she'll ever require at her full disposal.\n\nThe fact you say she has one of the highest skill caps of all enchanters is absolutely baffling, honestly. Like, what...? You realize she has had the highest winrate _and_ the highest playrate out of all enchanters since forever always, right? So by your logic, if she's the \"highest skill cap enchanter\", then she must be disgustingly overpowered and overtuned right now. Guess we better nerf her to oblivion, we have your approval! Because shit, if Azir had the same winrates Janna has - and he's the highest skillcap mid-laner tied with A.Sol - he'd be deleted from the game and re-added with a new kit. That is what you are basically telling me.","replies":[{"poster":"Andrey0345","date":"2018-05-01T20:19:12.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The fact you say she has one of the highest skill caps of all enchanters is absolutely baffling, honestly.

As someone in comments said, there are a lot of Janna players who just stack ap items and spam E behind their adcs and that's it. Any player can pick her up when autofilled - but Azir requires training. Still doesn't mean she can't be mastered and do actual plays which autofilled janna player wouldn't. And getting good at those plays is her hidden skill expression.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2018-04-30T12:45:01.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I am in no way going to dissect my own playstyle for your sake but i can confidently say that you've never seen an actual good Janna player play.\n\nCan't say i blame you as ( as egocentric as it sounds) i've never met a Janna player that plays like me either. Not a single one. There have been aggressive ones but they all fall flat somewhere and do their own stupid AP builds or make dumb positioning decisions that reek of overarrogance.\n\nI, personally don't build AP. Never. Well except for Shurelya's Reverie i guess but i don't really have a choice anymore as Talisman never gave AP. Regardless, i have 6 active items to manage, all with different effects if you count in Sightstone and Lens. The shield is not very easy to land when you're moving at Mach 6 and trying to keep track of the enemy, including your Tornado being a viable option if someone Dives in.\n\nOk, i don't want to stretch the reply too long but there are things like trading in-lane with basic attacks via animation cancelling and orbwalking properly, things like doing an Insec Flash + Q + R to get someone to fly towards your team or putting your tornado in reverse so the enemies walk around it but won't expect it to go the other way. Or actually, just deceiving them into going the full tornado's path by using deceptive movement while casting. Similarily to Thresh.\n\nI've never had any real counters in the opposing lane EXCEPT for Brand in all these years because of his absurd range and cc implementation.\n\nAnd since you'd assume i'd fall flat or sth, i don't main Janna anymore. I mained her for 3 years straight until the meta twisted her into an afk-carry which sickened me to the core.

Orbwalking and animation canceling isn't exclusive to her, nor are health and mana conservation. None of that is exclusive to Janna. What is exclusive to Janna and other enchanters are their simplicity, with Janna riding the highest horse of \"easiest in the game\".\n\nShe is, without comparison, the safest champion in the game, having the lowest death count of any enchanter support and the lowest death count of any champion with 10%+ playrates - to translate what that means, _even people who don't main Janna die excessively less than other champions on average, since we are to assume that 10% of the playerbase does not actually main Janna_. Her ult is - as I said - completely simple to use as it's a bloody button press on Janna's model - so the flash/ult move isn't actually as impressive as the shoutcasters always made it out to be. It is quite literally: point cursor at position, flash to position, press button. If you fuck up that sequence then you should really review what games you play because League probably isn't for you. Tying Q into the combo isn't especially hard when it's one of the widest skillshots in the game and can be cast immediately on command by double-tapping. Barrel stuff the poor sucker and do the combo - there ya go.\n\nYou'll also notice that I literally pointed out that combo in the last paragraph, so you have quite literally just admitted that the extent of Janna's \"hidden skillcap\" is non-existent since it's not hidden - we've seen it. 8 years and everyone has seen it. There's no new depths to plunder and no new mysteries to find. We've seen basically everything there is to Lee Sin's kit, and his is multitudes more complex than Janna's - you really think Janna's special and has some hidden potential?\n\nShe doesn't. She's the simplest most braindead champion in the game. You can stretch that braindead play to encompass some _general_ amount of League skill, like orb-walking (again, not exclusive to Janna) or poking or conservation of resources or dropping actives like a mother-fucker, but there's nothing hidden about any of that. It's out in the open. Try predicting enemy movements with Xerath, or faking people out with Ekko, or using Vi to initiate before flashing over a wall when the enemy pops all their shit on an empty spot, then Q back into the fight once your team's followed up. Those are some good plays that can fall flat if you haven't a clue what you're doing.\n\nJanna's face-value. You will always get what you see, and all you need to do is know what the kit does.

I only said she has that in her kit? And given how i've hinted at nobody playing at my level, i have only seen 2 Janna players orbwalk and animation cancel at the same time. They both were hyper-aggressive.\n\n> She is, without comparison, the safest champion in the game\n\nOk, what is your point here? I never denied that, i said she has a lot of hidden skill expression in her kit. When did i say she was not easy?

You're discrediting all the variables of the game itself in order to make it look simple. Sure, in principle it's pretty simple. But unless you're playing against Gold players or something, they'll recognize what you're trying to do. Also, it's usually best to make sure it's worth the expense as i haven't gotten a kill simply by successfully pushing someone into an ally, as they can get outmatched/outdamaged and screw it up themselves, even with me present.\n\nThat's like saying playing an FPS game is easy as all it requires is pointing and shooting at an enemy model.\n\n> Tying Q into the combo isn't especially hard when it's one of the widest skillshots in the game and can be cast immediately on command by double-tapping. \n\nFirst, with the recent changes to the tornado speed, it's freakishly hard as it moves very slowly in comparison to how it used to. And i don't see what does width have anything to do with this when it was nearly cut in half to match the visuals 2 seasons ago.\n\nSecondly, i use Normal Cast. It takes quite a bit of coordination so i wouldn't fuck up the literal mechanical input.\n\n> You'll also notice that I literally pointed out that combo in the last paragraph, so you have quite literally just admitted that the extent of Janna's \"hidden skillcap\" is non-existent since it's not hidden - we've seen it.\n\nYet i've rarely seen it across ranks ranging from Silver to Tournament - Challenger. I don't watch Esports so that's entirely irrelevant. It's hidden because it's not obvious for everyone, obviously. Are you this dense just for the sake of an argument?\n\nAnd the rest is you just arrogantly trying to force a self-conflicting idea on me that doesn't hold any merit to it. Not to mention you're separating general skill from champion skill. All champions have personal animation lengths,movement speeds, ability quirks and unique passives that you're completely disregarding as \"general skill\".  You're simply wrong and i know that as i'm a living testament to that. When i said i've **never** met another player that plays Janna like me, what do you think i was trying to say? That the sky is actually purple?\n\nYou're thinking that i was saying her kit is something \"toootally different\" when it's not. I don't know why you pulled that side of the argument out of nowhere when i was simply describing how you can be innovative with it and how almost noone i've met has used her to her fullest potential. Like what's your point? Trying to convince me that i'm playing an easy champion? No shit! Am i playing her the easy way? Obviously, fucking not.\n\nMaybe you just fail to aknowledge that because it'll hurt your pride or something, i don't know. Truth is, i don't care. No Janna player has been truly proficient on her from my point of view, and as long as people opt to play her like she's a tutorial champion or until she gets some kind of a rework, it'll remain that way.

You also admitted that orbwalking nor animation canceling are exclusive to Janna's kit, you also admit that Janna really doesn't take any more effort or skill to play than any other champion that has those utilities in their kit.\n\nI'll still grab this portion:\n\n> Extremely situational and it's highly risk-heavy as they may react faster than you and get out of the way, the speed relative to them may change and you may have to be much closer to secure it, giving them a heads up. You're discrediting all the variables of the game itself in order to make it look simple. **Sure, in principle it's pretty simple.**\n\nIn _practice_ it's also simple. Having a risk/reward system isn't _new_ and it doesn't necessarily take skill to cash in on it. Those two aren't inherently inclusive to each other - you can have a braindead, easy thing be a high-risk move. Flashing over a wall into dragon isn't exactly hard to do, and doing it for a steal puts a risk/reward - does it make it harder to pull of? Not really. Flash is immediate and smite is a set number, so given two junglers hitting smite at the best time at the same level, it's going to be more of a coin flip than anything.\n\nIf you're having trouble following this argument like all the other ones, I'm saying flashing and hitting one button that will always 100% do the same action every time isn't skill expression. It's just timing - you understand timing, you understand when to hit the button. All other factors are automatically worked out for you. That is not something that makes you a better Janna player - that's just better play in general. Understanding timing is largely macro-play versus micro-play. Now rationing out your cooldowns, that can be tied to the champion you play, but again, Janna's not hard to do that with nor are there usually worries tied to it besides giving up your bonus MS when using your W - not that you don't then have 5 other things to protect yourself in the meantime so like it really matters anyway.\n\n> Also, it's usually best to make sure it's worth the expense as i haven't gotten a kill simply by successfully pushing someone into an ally, as they can get outmatched/outdamaged and screw it up themselves, even with me present.\n\nThis also isn't skill expression on your part as you've just completed your part. Janna doesn't outplay - Janna gets outplayed. Since Janna will consistently perform the same exact way given the way her abilities function, it's generally on the enemy player to instead outplay and counter Janna as opposed to Janna having to outsmart the enemy since Janna doesn't really have a ton of tools to \"outsmart\" them with so much as just blatantly stat-check them (not unlike Nasus or Singed). You pressed R and put them in your team. Your job's done besides shielding and Q'ing and other crap. Maybe you die. Whatever. This still isn't skill expression - this is basic game calculation. Your Nautilus is doing the same exact thing trying to figure out if he can lock down the enemy ADC long enough for his team to kill it or if he'll end up getting nuked to shit. Difference being Nauty-dog also has to worry about hitting his goddamn Q on the right person to begin with and how he's even going to get to the ADC all the way back there.\n\nThese are basic calculations. None of this is a \"Janna player\" thing. It's a macro-level - throw a Diamond player that understands basic game mechanics and they'll perform just fine on Janna without really having to worry about much else because _they understand these **game mechanics**_.\n\nAnd the last three paragraphs are you spouting off on some tangent that's so misguided I kind of laughed. That's quite a lot of assumptions you've made. Sure, my argument definitely wasn't about how \"hidden skill expression\" is all but absent on Janna due to the fact that she is as complex as an amoeba's neural functions and that you're so far up your own backside that you don't realize that any ol' schlub can play Janna to her maximum extent due to the fact that yes, her power is so frontloaded into her E/R/W-passive that she hasn't had to worry about making the \"big plays\" for 2 bloody seasons and so the reason you don't see anybody take those risks is because they're 100% unnecessary when Janna is able to just stat check everyone nowadays. No, definitely not the point I was making. I was trying to attack your sense of pride because, I mean, mine's just so fragile I guess. 'S why I started this whole thread about how somebody saying Janna's as braindead as a guppy doesn't offend me because I'm such a testament to how truly great a Janna player can be and oh look at me I'm a paragon of Janna play - oh that wasn't me. I think I got my side mixed up somewhere in the middle here.\n\nWhat was I arguing again? Was it that Janna is a paint-by-numbers champion that really only requires basic game knowledge and awareness of her kit with no hidden mechanics whatsoever? I think that's what it was, and I think I accomplished that pretty swell.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2018-05-01T13:48:12.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> you also admit that Janna really doesn't take any more effort or skill to play than any other champion that has those utilities in their kit.\n\nUm, not for me since i think i've said about 2 or 3 times that i maximize the input required to harness all her hidden skill expression.

Flash is immediate and smite is a set number, so given two junglers hitting smite at the best time at the same level, it's going to be more of a coin flip than anything.\n\n\nFrom here, the entire wall of text onwards is a pointless attempt to convince me otherwise when i know a thousand times better than you what goes on in practice from **experience**. You're not a Janna player, you'll never even understand what i'm talking about here because you don't really care. Stop trying, because you're nowhere near credible. You're essentially repeating yourself here and as i was saying, not going to turn this into an in-depth guide just for your sake.\n\nYour entire argument is completely off the rails apparently. I don't know what you're trying to prove here. I know that Janna players generally take the easy route and go for AP heavy builds. I showed clear disgust towards them as there are a multitude of things i do differently, simultaneously in real time that they never have the balls to but it seems to me that you're trying to downplay that for...what? Winning an argument? You played Tahm Top, do you really want to lecture me about what's easy or not?","replies":[{"poster":"Barcid","date":"2018-05-01T16:53:23.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, sheesh, I hate to be dismissive but...

It&#x27;s incredibly straightforward. The extent of her skill expression is timing, positioning, and her Q, her only skillshot.\n> \n> You put the E on the right player at the right time and you W the right enemy where it&#x27;ll matter (like not blowing it on a Fizz who&#x27;s going to leap to your carry anyway instead of hitting the Tahm Kench; slowing immobility over mobility). You use your ult appropriately and you position correctly. If you find this difficult to accomplish on Janna or think that it&#x27;s a &quot;challenge&quot;, I have to apologize and say that you&#x27;re probably going to fall flat on your face with every other champion because no other champion carries the same amount of safety and utility on such a simple and easy kit. Not to mention other champs already have to worry about positioning and timing on top of actually hitting their shit.\n> \n> #Incoming controversial statement I guess, maybe not so much since it should be pretty obvious by now:\n> \n> Playing **Sona** is harder than playing Janna. If you were a Sona player and argued that people didn&#x27;t appreciate her hidden skill expression, then I would say you might actually have something since Sona&#x27;s passive requires her to stack it as well as finish her combo with the key she wants to put to use - either increased damage, lowering enemy damage output, or slowing the enemy. You choose the wrong one at the wrong time and you can end up getting somebody killed. _That&#x27;s_ something to actually worry about. This is on top of Sona having next to no self-peel and being one of the squishiest champions in the game.\n> \n> Flashing and pressing R once to knock an enemy champion 900 feet away from their partners because you have one of the most unfair ults in the game as far as counter-engage and sustain goes doesn&#x27;t quite carry the same worry about it when you have to do nothing but press the button and watch the results go off.\n\nWhile i generally agree, you are greatly overselling the importance of managing Sonas passive. Generally speaking, it is far and away from the thing that will make or break Sona's success cases. Her stats are,\n\nSona is also far easier to play than janna. Janna is just a stronger champion.\n\nYou talk about just pressing buttons and watching the result, when that is by and large the perfect description of the bulk of sona's gameplay. You just press buttons next to people.\n\nYou also claim she has no self peel when she has her passive slow, ult and E movespeed to work with.\n\nShe also does the most damage of any enchanter of game.\n\n\nWhile i agree with your point to an extent, cant say i do as a whole.","replies":[{"poster":"Barcid","date":"2018-05-01T16:50:17.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sona is generally harder to maximize your potential on with her as a champ as opposed to Janna, since Sona has far more emphasis on her positioning and, while her passive won't usually be the breaking point for her, the point was that that's more of a hidden power that Sona has than anything at all in Janna's kit. Both are by far the easiest champions in the game without comparison, and were this an earlier season than I'd say Sona certainly would be the easiest by far - since Sona's reworking, Sona does have to play to her ability auras a lot more and micro-manage where she needs to be a lot more often than Janna, who can basically slap a tornado and shield somewhere away from her and just kind of focus on being in a place where her ult will do the most disruption possible come teamfights.\n\nIs Sona hard? Fuck no. Statement was really just that Janna's so braindead easy that Sona is difficult by comparison, which is really saying something about Janna.\n\nOn the terms of \"self-peel\", Sona can do wonders to keep herself positioned right, but getting hit by hard CC generally means that she won't be escaping even if her ult's up since stuns are reduceable CC and hers isn't even particularly long by comparison to a lot of champs - 1.5 seconds isn't exactly something that'll get you out of a shitstorm on short notice, while Janna's massive knockback on her ult tied in with her perma-speed boost on her W will usually be more than enough to get her to safety on more than one occasion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xelaker","date":"2018-04-30T00:46:59.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"do you have you eyes closed the whole time? there's metric shit tons of janna players being disgustingly over tuned *in front of*  their adcs too","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2018-04-30T01:01:40.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I stated how Janna players make me cringe with their misplaced timings and positioning by generalizing how they never exploit hidden skill expression.\n\nWhat's your point?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SaltLord451","date":"2018-04-29T18:30:47.467+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":5,"body":"I could main Janna to get out of silver but I have morals.","replies":[{"poster":"Solitair","date":"2018-04-29T19:24:25.087+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SaltLord451,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=NkP5Ar8l,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-04-29T18:30:47.467+0000)\n>\n> I could main Janna to get out of silver but I have morals.\n\njust try it lol","replies":[{"poster":"Amasa Delano","date":"2018-04-30T16:03:24.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"#notevenonce","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SSShutTheDuckUp","date":"2018-04-29T21:56:35.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You would aslo have silver ADCs and that would be the catch","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rainfall","date":"2018-04-29T19:27:53.886+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":4,"body":"Community:Players are calling support a role for noobs do something riot.\nRiot:Don't worry i got this\nRiot://Keeps janna at 53% winrate for 2 years\nPatrick we did it we saved the city.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2018-05-01T21:05:55.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rainfall,realm=EUNE,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=NkP5Ar8l,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-04-29T19:27:53.886+0000)\n>\n> Community:Players are calling support a role for noobs do something riot.\n> Riot:Don&#x27;t worry i got this\n> Riot://Keeps janna at 53% winrate for 2 years\n> Patrick we did it we saved the city.\n\nWhat?
