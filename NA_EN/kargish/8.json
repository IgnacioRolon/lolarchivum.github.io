Doing this will also help out the other victims that don&#039;t have access to these options, and we&#039;ll go back into a state where playing marksman requires positioning and assassins need to play properly in order to pull off a successful job**\r\n\r\nBecause {{item:3309}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3109}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3107}} {{item:2420}} and such didn&#039;t exist back then. The only reason {{item:3147}} is the way it is, is because without it assassins can&#039;t penetrate all the defensives their targets are given. So what happens to targets that don&#039;t have access to these items, minus stopwatch that is? They get obliterated, and if the victim happens to be a mage they&#039;re going to die without a {{item:3157}} to extend their life by 2,5 seconds.\r\n\r\nIn the early seasons, mages had access to {{item:3157}} as their main defensive item, and marksmen could go {{item:3072}} plus an additional defensive item. Marksmen were never allowed to pick a 6th offensive item, because if they did there was nothing stopping them from becoming fodder for enemy assassins. So they had to choose between {{item:3102}}(No AP version) and {{item:3026}}(No AD version).\r\nNothing else was required really, an ADC with skill could outplay assassins at their own game while good assassins could eliminate their priority targets like it&#039;s meant to happen. Supports had the option to build into heavier defences for their marksman, but in doing so they lost team vision or team auras (remember when auras were a thing?) {{item:3222}} {{item:3190}}(Old and weaker version){{item:3110}}.\r\nI support build diversity entirely, but it feels like with every season either the support or the marksman gets an additional option to avoid getting killed. First it was making {{item:3072}} able to overheal you for a shield, which was fine since marksman did infact lack some form of defensive at the time, then they created the support shields, {{item:3812}} became a thing and got buffed, attack speed items got buffed so {{item:3006}} wasn&#039;t necessary anymore and everyone started to build {{item:3047}} and now there&#039;s a rune that allows you to overheal while supports have gotten 3 new shield/heal/damage mitigation items. Don&#039;t even get me started on the {{item:3097}} marksmen build, I&#039;m quite happy that got removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf {{item:3147}} has to be nerfed then marksmen have to sacrifice some of their safety as well, then it&#039;ll most likely also improve the game for mages and melee carries ({{champion:11}}). If you as me then Duskblade shouldn&#039;t even provide free damage, such an items shouldn&#039;t exist on the assassin rooster. Duskblade should rather be a way for an assassin to participate either in the team&#039;s vision game or his own vision game, incase he wants to hold onto {{item:3340}} or make him a clean sweeper with {{item:3364}}. Now the assassin has a new role to perform in the game, and it also helps him perform his assassin work.","replies":[]}
