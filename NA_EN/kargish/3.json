Rengar suffers while Twitch is around.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":184,"down_votes":27,"body":"Honestly I don&#039;t know why this has been a thing for almost a year now, it&#039;s absolutely absurd and is just a massive &quot;screw you&quot; towards us Rengar mains. I shall explain exactly what I am talking about, but I am quite sure you might already have an idea of what I have on my mind.\r\n\r\nSince the assassin update back in 2016 Riot implemented 2 different kinds of stealth. Invisibility and camouflage. Camouflage was given to both Rengar and Twitch, and is basically just pre-assassin rework Evenlynn stealth. The most absurd thing though is that since the reworks Rengar has been almost destroyed through nerfs, and the reason being that he was still too strong when coming from stealth or the fact his early game was too strong.\r\nOn the other hand Twitch has been left almost completely untouched since then, while still being able to perform oneshots on people (or 5 for that matter). The only thing is that Twitch can do it in a much safer and reliable way, oneshotting entire teams without ever putting himself in danger.\r\n\r\nTo compare I&#039;ve gone into practice tool to quickly get a few photos of both&#039;s range on their camouflage mechanic.\r\n\r\nTwitch{{champion:29}} \r\n\r\nDetection range: approx 500 units\r\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/c141fb0d87918231469b324aad4a84fa.jpg\r\n\r\nAttack range with ult: 850 units\r\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/748e316d6f3eb4f3eedff4a9009a7a87.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRengar{{champion:107}} \r\n\r\nDetection range and attack range: 725\r\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/b977af69f73bf1052270eb45990fdf34.png\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo in short Twitch has a far lower detection range and he can attack from this position with the longest auto attack range in the game. Just to make it even more clear, I&#039;ll compare them again in terms of all their strengths.\r\n\r\n{{champion:29}} (Ambush):\r\n\r\n* Has 500 detection range which is shorter than his normal auto attack range\r\n* Activates after 1 second\r\n* Gains 10% movement speed increased to 30% if someone is near him that can&#039;t see him\r\n* Up to 50% attack speed\r\n* Duration is 10 seconds and can be increased to 14 seconds\r\n* 16 seconds cooldown\r\n* Resets cooldown upon killing an enemy champion\r\n* Gives a potential 850 unit gap between Twitch and his opponent\r\n\r\n{{champion:107}} (Thrill of the Hunt):\r\n\r\n* Has 725 detection range and attack range\r\n* Activates after 2 seconds\r\n* Gains 40% movement speed increase at all time\r\n* Duration is 12/16/20 seconds\r\n* 130 seconds cooldown in early ranks\r\n* Gains vision of the nearest enemy within 2000/3000/4000 units and allows Rengar to gain a guaranteed crit if he leaps to them, but also alerts everybody within that radius you&#039;re in camouflage.\r\n* Places him in melee range\r\n\r\n\r\nQuite frankly Twitch has Rengar&#039;s ultimate on a basic ability, with potential 0 cd if he gets a kill. He has a shorter detection range and can attack from further away, so he is far safer than Rengar that even has to go into melee range. He doesn&#039;t alert the enemy at all, and he naturally builds critical strike so Rengar doesn&#039;t even have an advantage on that part, who has to work for it to get it on the right target while Twitch just right clicks and crits 5 people.","replies":[{"poster":"Galacius","date":"2017-08-18T11:17:35.512+0000","up_votes":84,"down_votes":6,"body":"Hey!

You can't farm, you can't ward even with a teamate sense he can kill you both. You can't jungle otherwise you'll die in your own jungle to rengar. You can't do anything.

Rengar and Twitch have similar roles. Twitch might not burst as fast as rengar, sure, but Twitch could always do it from a safer position. Even if Rengar did burst you, he was often actively putting himself in a dangerous position by getting into melee range. Optimally, with a squishy build. (Hence why Tank Rengar was an issue and why Rengar is being moved more towards a diver playstyle)\n\nThe issue is that if you put these two characters side-by-side and told players to pick one, they'd pick Rengar every time. Rengar is the scary monster who bursts you with zero counterplay and then runs into the jungle. Twitch is the squishy ADC who dies if you breath on him. Sure, it's not the case right this moment, but it's generally what people see when they deal with the characters. My point is that both characters are bullshit. Rengar, however, gets dealt with swiftly because he's the melee assassin who instabursts with zero counterplay.\n\nTwitch is the subtle bullshit. The bullshit you weren't aware you stepped in. The bullshit you hate fighting against but don't say anything because you know the forums would laugh at you for complaining about someone with a 49.99% win rate. Even in this case, characters who aren't as bad as Rengar (Zed, Talon, etc.) are still shafted because this assassin-y feeling of instaburst-zero-counterplay-GG exists simply by being a class.\n\nMy core point is that both characters have flaws and need changes, but Twitch gets to scuttle out of the spotlight because \"the poor ranged ADCs who are fodder to the big mean assassins\" is often the prevailing discourse when it comes to assassin vs. ADC.

Because Twitch can not do what Rengar used to be able to, he does not have a superior form of his Ult. Rengar's is meant to get him into killing range, so is Twitch's, but without the additional burst, Rengar's Ult is still the superior one. \n\nIt's because it's much better that it has those restrictions placed on him, not that Twitch's is better because he has no penalties.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"N3mO06","date":"2017-08-18T12:56:24.980+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twitch lacks of counterplay.

Love the photos that perfectly illustrate your point, too. \n\nAs a aside, I think it's important to note here that Riot has already done away with the the roster updates that led to these sorts of situations. I think they do deserve a little credit there, generally, for understanding that those practices led to some pretty questionable design directions.\n\nBut yes, both Rengar and Twitch are in very strange places, and juxtaposing their abilities is a nice way to highlight how weird this got. Both of them need work, and threads like this are a great way to communicate to Riot that we want these champs higher on the priority list.","replies":[{"poster":"Sohleks","date":"2017-08-18T19:09:41.739+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh oh!

They vision ranges and things have a logical process behind them that Twitch's abilities don't adhere to, and he *also* has the advantage of being ranged.
