Are we seriously being rejected a better refund rate, simply because they think we shouldn&#039;t take an extra 10 seconds to figure out the difference between a 2050 quint and a 515 quint?\r\n\r\nLink to comment:\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/o1hsbxt5-the-real-reason-veteran-players-are-unhappy-with-the-rune-rework?comment=001b","replies":[]}
