Only thing that saddens me is that this thing doesn&#039;t play every time you start a new game, and are sometimes replaced with one liners.\r\n\r\nWhy does this not play every time you start a new game as Jhin?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-07-31T20:20:29.213+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To answer your question.  \nVariety.   Our general guideline for all in-game character lines is to deliver variety in: tone, length, timbre, context, and emotion.   If we played the humming at the start of every game you played with Jhin you would either (A) get sick of it or (B) tune out.    \n\nThis is also the goal with longer scripts and odd asides -- we want to give you something to discover for hundreds --even thousands of games.","replies":[{"poster":"GenoXx","date":"2017-08-01T15:05:10.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which was a good choice, I personally love the humming with the choir.

No the humming, but adding in to their VO that makes you really feel like you're that champion. \n\nI have a embarrassing act for believing I'm the champion I'm playing simply because I a lore nerd.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-08-01T20:09:36.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the goal with all releases.     (I also worked on Kled and Rakan recently and they do similar things--though neither hums)  Their VOs are designed to get you inside the character's head.   Both so you \"feel\" like this character-- but hopefully so that feeling leads you towards making the right sort of plays.    Kled's aggression obviously matches his mounted mechanics but also: his paranoia matches his desire to win lane and his fear of jungler ganks; while is insane declarations of leadership --speak to how he and his team must decide to engage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HonestJohnTheCon","date":"2017-08-02T12:09:29.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GenociderX,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=iwa7058u,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2017-08-01T15:05:10.604+0000)\n>\n> Which was a good choice, I personally love the humming with the choir.
