It would also be far easier to do if there are ally minion from Akali's side currently sieging and taking the attention of the turret.\n\n........\n\nAnd really, both true stealth and true sight are already a thing in this game, and we know that true sight ultimately wins the priority over true stealth. And yet Akali now somehow have a even more \"true\" version of stealth than even \"true\" stealth, and it overrides true sight.\n\nThis is the very definitive example of power creeping, and it's nothing but bad.","replies":[{"poster":"IP Masquerena","date":"2018-11-06T14:49:42.857+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The shimmer effeft is updated at fixed intervals, her W under tower is her actual live location, no intervals, so your statement shows misinformation.\n\nAlso, not quite, a tower needs ~0.75 to target and fire, Akali restealth is on 0.65, so unless the Akali player can perfectly time their moves, hence why I said that only players with hundreds of games on her or challenger level players, aka, those who learned the timer the hard way, can dodge tower shots, as it's only a 0.1 interval between \"you get shot\" and \"you don't get shot\".

It's not some big heal, but it definitely mitigate the risks Akali has when diving. It's pretty clear they intentionally designed it so that Akali camping the opponent under the latter's own turret would be a thing given they took the overt measures to make it happen, and that is CLEARLY not a way to try and design a champ given it by itself betrays a few ground rules of Riot's design logic. Ground rules are there for a reason, no one should just circumvent and ignore it whenever it's convenient to them, and no one should just selectively allow some designers to keep practicing that shit for some unspeakable and obscured reason.\n\nIf you haven't noticed, because of how the W (and other elements in Akali's kit) is designed, Akali has all of the initiatives to do everything, including playing dumb and get killed. The opponent is always at the mercy of hoping Akali outplaying herself to even think of the chance of doing meaningful interaction with her, with the sole exception that if they have spammable AoE or skillshots. Basically, unless you hard counters her by default or else you don't get any say; this is no different to being stat-checked by Pantheon, just swapped out the blatant binary interaction with more subtle and sinister form of binary checking. And that's a really bad way to design a champ interaction.","replies":[{"poster":"IP Masquerena","date":"2018-11-06T15:16:36.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Will take your new comment as a win on my side, as you both no longer comment about the fade time nor shade.\n\nIf she dives, you don't need AoE, just ground target abilities.

Oh wait.\n\n.......\n\nAlso, AoE and whatnot would also actually be super useful if not also for the fact Akali gains MS in the shroud, adding to the already present difficulty of shooting at her semi-blind under turrets or completely blind without true sight sources. Most of the time unless you have spammable skillshots and AoE to basically hit her via inevitability when she's in the shroud, or else you're shit out of luck especially as a ranged squishy character who can't just hope at the prospect of maybe stat-checking her in melee range when she leaps out.\n\nAkali is basically made by creating a counterplay for her and immediately deny the said counterplay in the very next thing in the kit; the result is something like Akali who can really only either be hard countered, banned, or you can suck shit as long as the said champ isn't played by a potato; and unlike the old outdated champs who at least were honest about their binary nature, the newer champs often take on the mantle of fake interactivity and counterplay that merely gives the illusion of not being binary. A signature style of the more recent champ designs and heavily abused by hack \"designers\" at Riot, arguably the most by CertainlyT as of yet or at least in the recent relevant memory.","replies":[{"poster":"IP Masquerena","date":"2018-11-06T17:35:11.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Must be pretty fun in your little world.\n\nGo talk to the Orianna we just had in ranked, she had to deal with an Akali, and guess who got stomped. *hint, it wasn't Orianna*\n\nYou keep saying that \"the opponent has to make mistakes for you to counterplay\", but that's bs.

There is a reason why they're anecdotes.\n\nThe silhouette is only visible when there's true sight, otherwise Akali is entirely invisible during W. I'm sure you have more IQ to comprehend how both stealth and obscure works. Given that even when Akali is diving the enemy turret where anyone doing so is expected to do so at their own risk and vulnerability, she is still protected by a semi-invisibility and the inability to be locked-on, I'm sure that's all you need to prove the simple fact that she throttle's the opponent's agency.\n\nThe difference between Trundle's W and Akali's W is that Trundle's W is completely nonexistent and only served as a minor buff (mostly MS) until late game or if Trundle is ahead; Akali's W is different because useful for so many things IMMEDIATELY and remains extremely powerful throughout the entire game. Also, Trundle's W only buffs himself, it doesn't both buff and deny enemy at the same time unlike Akali's W. Lastly, because Trundle is basically immobile and is played as a jungler, W is often REQUIRED to be used at the very start of the fight, at the edge of the engagement zone as a pseudo-dash rather than in the middle of it; Akali does not have this problem because she's both a laner and has many disposal tools to go in and out of fights freely, and so she can usually place the W in the ideal position. They are completely different.\n\nAkali has a 80+% pick/ban in worlds, and spent most of her time being banned. It's kind of funny how you manage to get the stat that she's picked 11 times but conveniently ignore the fact she's banned 51 times (the MOST BANNED champion in the ENTIRE worlds tournament); and in the 11 games she was played in, she won 8 out of the 11 matches. Do you take me for a total idiot who can't even google basic info? A champ being at 80% pick/ban certainly won't be because they are fair to play against; and pros tried every other lane-bullies and hard lock down champs against Akali whenever she's picked, and it would appear the ONLY champ who can actually own Akali is just Urgot. Yes, Urgot, the guy who is made to win lane 100% and is another problem in and of itself, and he's the only person seemingly capable of solo shutting down Akali in her tracks, not Swain, not Lissandra, not even LeBlanc. Does that sound like a champ with a ton of play interactivity to you?\n\nMaybe you should start actually using and focusing on real debate point and instead of spending most of your time belittling the opponent with your nonexistent pride.","replies":[{"poster":"IP Masquerena","date":"2018-11-07T08:00:16.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Want me to be honest?

However, the combination of free mobility, burst damage, and long duration obscurity simply does not work together in a moba. Should have built her around two of the three. \n\nRiot missed the mark on what was problematic about her pre-rework kit. Having targetted burst is fine as long as it also puts the assassin in danger, both rengar and kha work just find around that concept. Her problems stemmed from the defensive aspects of her shroud and her sustain in lane against melee champions and the rework kept both of those elements (and doubled down on the shroud).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fear the Kayn","date":"2018-11-06T16:10:26.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a problem when any assassin has too many escapes.

It might be an extremely short lived hard cc but it can reward a kill. After level 6 when akali engages with ulti (and lands it) unless the enemy is an assassin or a beefy champ, he WILL have to flash away or 95% of the times, he will die.  That 0.5 sec is enough for her to land her e, get out of the ring and gain the empowered aa and she still has her w to regain energy and 2nd ulti to catch up to you.","replies":[]}]}
