Getting one item often forces you to get another specific item to make use of their effects. Because of this you&#039;ll never see &quot;off-meta&quot; builds that actually work, like how building {{item:3031}} forces you to build a critical strike item and trying something like {{item:3153}} on a champion on {{champion:51}} will put you too far behind in damage compared to IE+crit to be relevant.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/XRsugp_4RDA?t=9m26s\r\n\r\nI think Hashinshin made a pretty good argument on one of League of Legends&#039; major problems. Items all synergize with each other, which results in every role having 1 item build in general, not counting the outliners.\r\nI&#039;ve been playing this game since 2010, and although there has always been a meta (besides season 1), adaption was still a thing and you couldn&#039;t always rely on the meta to carry you. The difference is that items back then had no synergy with each other, and though that&#039;s a personal preferance whether you like that or not, I&#039;ll at least explain why I think it was better back then.\r\n\r\nA classic mage back in the day didn&#039;t have unlimited mana, infact nobody had, and some regular abilities costed 130 mana ({{champion:99}} E, {{champion:267}} W etc.). So to cover this weakness you obviously had to build at least 1 mana item. These items could be {{item:3003}} {{item:3174}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3027}} or even {{item:3102}}. I am of course talking about previous versions of these items.\r\nBecause these items didn&#039;t synergy, there was no connection between anything and you could build whatever you felt like suited the situation best.\r\n\r\nThe enemy has late game champions and you need to compete with them? Go {{item:3027}} {{item:3003}} {{item:3089}} and scale slowly.\r\nGetting pushed back in lane and still need mana to linger longer? Go {{item:3102}} {{item:3027}} for some defensive capability and top off your mana.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis applied to every role except ADC. They were the only ones who actually needed some more items, as only {{item:3031}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3035}} existed back then.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nLooking at today&#039;s build paths almost all of them are identical. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a single AD assassin out there that doesn&#039;t go {{item:3147}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3036}} ({{item:3095}}) {{item:3071}}/{{item:3814}}  as their rush in whatever order they prefer {{champion:107}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:238}}.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s pretty clear what items they&#039;re supposed to build. Got high AD damage through abilities? Stack lethality and armor penetration to achieve success, and if you don&#039;t you&#039;ll do too little damage to be relevant.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nBack in season 2 I got obliterated by a pre-rework {{champion:83}} that built {{item:3078}} {{item:3128}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3022}} {{item:4401}} against me as {{champion:8}}. Despite that build being a literal joke in the eyes of meta players, this build was too good for me to handle because it had burst, DPS, slow, movement speed and defensive capability. If he had gone standard build, he would have lost to me back then, but his ability to adapt through items beat me.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nYou&#039;re not going to see stuff like that anymore, you can see it in the recent ADC changes that Riot wants us to build a specific path.\r\n\r\nIf you get {{item:3031}} you might as well get {{item:3094}}/{{item:3046}}/{{item:3087}} as well to make use of its passive, and if you get those items you might as well go full AD to maximize their effects.","replies":[]}
