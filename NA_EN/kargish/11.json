In almost every case, the Tristana is NOT cheesing Blitz's hook intentionally. To have such impeccable timing IS the skill expression, you need to be ramping up the W jump JUST as it hits. Blinks, such as Ezreal's E and Kassadin's R, have a much larger window because it extends through their cast time to when they're placed in their new position. So you see that more often.\n\nTristana mitigating CC intentionally is something you're only going to see at very high ELO by a Trist main.

When dashes and blinks (not limited to Tristana) are activated at the same time as stun/displacement/supression effects are applied, they will not cancel them. During a dash, however, it will interrupt it but not at the point of activation. \n\nOne of the oldest example of that is Ezreal cheesing Blitzcrank grabs. Tristana can do it too, if timed perfectly.\n\nThe problem there is coding and how placement altering effects interact. There isn't any fix for that, if it was doable it would've been done.

Adding a 198% Bonus AD ratio to a kit with next to no trade offs (it added a condition that was fairly easy to achieve) and converting it to physical damage caused her damage to actually scale fairly hard and have burst attached to it. Tristana&#x27;s damage from her kit stopped at level 9 unless you built AP (the ult did go up a bit in damage at level 11/16) with the rest being multiplicative stats with items (AS is useless on its own). All of Tristana&#x27;s damage before the rework was directly related to how good items were since that was the ONLY way she did damage. Adding a ratio to her E still does cause her damage to be fairly correlated with items, but a 198% AD ratio causes her E to do ~170 more damage with just IE+DBlade on a fully stacked one (which yet again isn&#x27;t very hard with IE+Zeal item and about level 10 so 3 points in Q).\n\nTristana did need that buff though. You said yourself, she had no AD scaling and her niche was her late game range. When you compare that to someone like Xayah, who comes with an AS roid and AD scaling... Tristana would be completely out of her depth.\n\nI can get behind hitting Tristana by changing her E stack W resets. Give it a partial reduction like Lux's ultimate, or just reduce her jump cooldown overall. But her damage output relative to other ADCs is more than fine, she is outclassed by almost all of them in that department. Her only saving grace for her damage is the range she can pull it at late game.

She only surpasses Caitlyn's range at level 17-18 and that has ALWAYS been the case.\n\nThe truth is that Tristana gets bullied by every other ADC early. Caitlyn out ranges her, Draven/Varus/Xayah/Kog'Maw/Vayne out damages her, Ashe/Sivir/Ezreal out poke her. She falls behind, she can't freeze waves and she can't farm under turret. That's how she is designed, the AoE on her E that you argue is the best for pushing is actually there to cripple her early.\n\nIt is only at late game, level 15+ onwards, where she reaches her potential.

I have no idea why you're debating that, there isn't any debate to be had. The tone of this thread and the OP's post is a bias in that Tristana is OP, despite literally every statistic proving the opposite. How she is a jack of all trades, has no weaknesses, is ultra safe;\n\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Tristana/ADC\n\nLike every single hyper carry, mediocre 0-20 mins. Nose dives 20-25. Picks back up again 30+ mins.\n\nShe clearly isn't as overwhelming as the OP and yourself paint her because her win rate would be higher than 50%. She clearly doesn't have no weaknesses (as I've outlined for you), and she certainly isn't jack of all trades (define jack of all trades with relevance to Tristana and her place as an ADC, instead of using it as a buzzword. It's just throwing words around at this point).\n\nThis is just ADC hate bandwagoning. WE and Riot know that itemisation is the issue, burst (by crit proxy) and the highest penetration options in the game don't mix well. The individual champions aren't the problem, and certainly not Tristana, whose core kit has remained untouched since 2009.\n\nFunny how when ADCs are the strongest they've ever been, Tristana's 2 min cooldown knockback, scaling range and rocket jumps is now a problem. Not within the past 8-9 years for a champion whose kit is \"toxic\" \"oppressive\" \"overwhelming\" \"ultra safe\" \"jack of all trades.\" You'd think if that were true, they'd be an issue then.

I will try to explain a little better. \n\n1. Tristana is not OP. \n\n2. The design problems that people have with tristana have started becoming apparent once people started to abuse a mechanic that she has which priorly was not used. This being the buffer on her rocket jump. If you combine an essential uninterruptible resetable long range dash (I know it's interuptible but it forces you, as a player, to have two forms of displacement or your team to work together to throw two CC's if she plays perfectly. Which not even pros have been seen to do) with a 1000 range knockback. It's provides way to much safety for her without any real investment. \n\n3. It's not her laning or midgame people have problems with, it's her late game. Which is reached far to early with current adc itemization. She becomes (as one tristana main on the forums put it) the late game self peeling hyper carry. That's what people have a problem with. Once you hit three items and level 14-18 her range is too high for the safety she has. And the design philosophy in this game is balanced in such a way that 'dont let her get there' is not really an option. \n\nTldr. She is too strong late game. She should not have access to en extra reset which was implimented in her last rework, and her rocket jump needs to either be recoded so that cc interuptible the buffer or the range needs to be slightly lessened and have the buffer removed. Nothing major. But she should not have multiple ways to peel for herself once divers and tanks get on top of her.\n\n\nOh ya. Jack of all trades. \n\nShe has a strong laning. It's nearly impossible to shove her in due to her passive on E i think. She rapidly out ranges most other champions in botlane. It used to be level 2 but now it's like level 4-5. She has fairly reliable harrass patterns 'dropping e on a 1 shot minion and aaing when next to an opponent' she doesn't really lose lane to other bot lane champions because she just shoves and then doesn't interact with you. Barring sivir (kinda) and Caitlin. Maybe there are others. \nShe also doesn't actually have a bad midgame. BF plus static shiv and she is equally as useful as most other adc's at that time. Barring midgame centric adc's but she rapidly passes that point due to easy waveclear into 2-1/2-3 item where she hits late game status and becomes extremely strong. She can do everything that other adc's can do at this point. And almost as well. She kills Squishies in like 1.5 seconds if she catches them out. Bomb into 3 autos and ultimate quing the last auto during the cast time. She peels herself. She has mobility that randomly resets without her really trying. She has the longest static range in the game at that point.
