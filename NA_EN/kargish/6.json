Lame but not as bad as the &quot;5man trolling premade&quot; missions.\n\nI fail to see how it's trolling if there's not actually any target/victim. The meta-challenging missions have actually been some of my favourite - it's fun figuring out how to win, again. The first week of runes was likewise enjoyable - it was nice playing a game and deciding \"nope, that was a shit idea\". They require a premade-5 so that everyone on the team has to agree to complete the mission - i.e. removes any possible abuse. \n\nThe only issues with previous implementations of premade missions is\n\n* Lack of public chat room to build teams in.\n* Rewards requiring the completion of all missions to earn enough currency. \n\nBut Riot's already addressed the second point and said they're working on the first. Since the Star Guardian event, there's never really been a need to earn all possible currency. Star Guardian literally had 2 rewards and one of them was junk - so you didn't have to do everything, you could do half. And all others since have have superfluous currency too. If you don't have friends or don't enjoy getting creative - just don't do the mission.
