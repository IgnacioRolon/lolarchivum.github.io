This was more than likely to avoid the need for something to happen if Taiwan placed 1st/2nd in the knockout stage (they don't have a third seed, so what do they get).\n\nWhile several people have said they should earn a third seed and then you just move it into the 2nd pool, ideally this is good, but when you take into account Taiwan's general population compared to Europe, NA, Korea, and China, it becomes pretty obvious why they have 2 seeds and not 3 (not to say that won't change, but they'll probably always have fewer than the other regions).\n\nAnyways, back to your question, it's pretty much tradition based past the fact that knockout stage placement wasn't taken into account. It's probably a good thing too considering it's only a single elimination bracket, so technically speaking, RNG could be better at Bo5s than CLG and FW. If it were a double elimination tournament, then I could see it being used for group seeding, but I don't think using a single elimination bracket is the best way to determine the best 2 regions when it could've simply been luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-09-10T05:40:36.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The seeding only being determined by the group stages couldn't be correct either because Korea got 4th in groups. If they picked Korea for winning the whole thing and China for winning groups then maybe but at that point it is basically \"because we felt like it\"\n\nLuck or no luck it makes more sense to use the overall placement at MSI then to just give China the higher seed just because. Not that it really matters that much in the overall goal of a team trying to win worlds but it does bug me a little that they didn't just use the way that made more sense.\n\nSupposedly Korea and China automatically get their spots unless they are 5th or 6th but I hope that changes for next year because they should have to earn it just like the other regions (not that they won't).","replies":[{"poster":"Azlureon","date":"2016-09-10T19:14:57.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks everyone for replying.\n\nAnd I see what you mean by only using the group stages, so basically they used the first round to decide and who came 1st-4th didn't matter?\n\nAnd Stillname this is exactly what I was thinking, it would be much easier and just plain fair to use the final results of MSI to determine the placement. IF NA had lost bad everyone would be in an uproar about how we shouldn't even have 3 seeds at all.\n\nAnd even if they are predicted to earn it, doesn't mean you shouldn't give other regions the chance, crazier things have happen in the world.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Smart Kitty","date":"2016-09-10T04:13:17.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MSI only determined pool 1 seeds, so the bottom two were unaffected other than EU's #1 getting forced to be in pool 2.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Takito","date":"2016-09-10T03:00:31.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was asking myself the same question to be honest...\n\nDoesn't seems really fair.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azlureon","date":"2016-09-10T02:42:56.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is also another link to the league esportspedia in which it claims that no matter the result NA and EU auto gets a pool 3 seed, and by implication Korea and China can never get one unless they got last place in MSI.
