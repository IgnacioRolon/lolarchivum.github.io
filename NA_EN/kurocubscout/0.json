It's been about 4 days so I decided to take it upon my self and get answers from the community, usually Riot Support answers me within 24hrs or less but this time that's not the case because it's not basic questions like all the other times. Here is what I sent to support asking.\n\nIs This allowed?\n\n\n\n\nKuroCubScout\nWednesday at 22:55\n\nHi riot I was wondering Is Mod Skin Professional allowed it shows on their website saying you allowed it but I'm just asking to make sure. The program changes the skin of enemy and player skins locally, it doesn't show it to anyone within in game only that of the person who is using the program. But I just want to know. here is the link to it \nhttp://leagueskin.net/p/download-mod-skin-lol-pro-2016-chn I will delete if it is not.\n\nIf someone could give me an answer on this preferably a Riot member that would be great. Anyone who already knows about this program please give me your best input.\n\nNot sure who was assigned to my ticket but they never answered which I was kind of shocked about. Also I later edited the ticket on Thursday  June  1, 2017 to add the link in description but it was originally created on Wednesday May 30, 2017 I don't know if that has anything with me not getting an answer but usually when I reedit a ticket I don't get an answer the next day but the day after because it was deemed of being recreated/reposted.\n\nWould appreciate any answers on this. If it is allowed feel free to use this yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"kokideal","date":"2017-06-03T21:24:50.339+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! I've been using the same program since October 2016 and haven't had a problem since February 2017 when I got permabanned for third party programs/scripts. I have only used the skin mod. I have been sending tickets to Riot Support trying to explain things, but they just don't seem to care and closed my ticket. I don't recommend using the program to you bro as it may lead to a permanban for you aswell.","replies":[{"poster":"KuroCubScout","date":"2017-06-03T22:20:38.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"alright thanks for letting me know. I thought it was allowed because it only changes the skins locally and only you can see it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-03T20:28:39.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can take a look at your ticket if you want to toss me your ticket number.  Just to answer your concern, though, we don't support any third party programs.  We aren't directly banning for using a skin mod right now, but that can change anytime.  You nede to be also extremely careful of what you're using, because even if it says it's a skin mod there could still be malicious content hiding within.  Check out our [third party guide ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/225266848)for more info as well.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"KuroCubScout","date":"2017-06-03T21:20:33.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ticket #30496158 is my ticket number.
