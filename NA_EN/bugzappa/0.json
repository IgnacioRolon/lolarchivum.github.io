My account has never received warnings in the past and aside from some shot calling disputes I am never toxic. No foul use of language whatsoever. So it was a shock that after the game my account was perma banned with no warning. I went to check the &quot;email&quot; riot games was supposed to send me but there is no such thing. Im furious and confused why this is the outcome?! Can someone explain what may have happened?\n\n\n\nEDIT:\nRiot has come back and told me this was a protective suspension!

You'll need to contact Riot Support to sort it out, reset password, etc\n* **Cheating/Boosting Ban:** You were detected to have been playing with a modded version of the game with unauthorized and disapproved of third party software (skin mods, auto-scripts, use of macros which perform combination actions with 1 button press, etc), or it was detected someone other than you is playing on your account for the purpose of boosting your rank.\n* **Chargeback Hold Ban:** If a chargeback was issued on any item purchased in the game store, a ban is placed on your account until the money is paid back.

The idea is that your password is consistently changing, think about authenticator codes that games such as Runescape use alongside your passcode to allow you to log-in when you're logging in from a different IP than where you commonly logging in from, however the live encryption is just the changing codes portion removing the passcode. It makes it infinitely harder for someone to hack an account since the codes are consistently changing and with over several billion possibilities for said passcode not many people would even bother trying to figure it out.","replies":[{"poster":"Lux Is Mai Waifu","date":"2017-09-22T06:37:54.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Riot games is worth 1.6 billion dollars and draws a lot of talent to work for them.

Usually for anyone who wants to get access to someone else's account, whether the intent is good or bad, they just need to find a single flaw within the operations of said games log-in protocol.

Furthermore depending on the skill level of those offenders they could altogether disable the systems which notify the account owner that something has been changed with their account.
