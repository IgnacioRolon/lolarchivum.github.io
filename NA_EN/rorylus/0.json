I went through this same type of thing before, and the customer service have always been 0/10. The game is beyond toxic, no one even seems to care. They randomly pick and choose who to punish with a broken system. The whole game needs to be reformed, starting with the devs who are suppose to fix these bugs...but including everyone. In 6 years I can't think of one good thing to say about LoL. At this point, I really just think I will be charging back and finding a new Moba.

Click on the XBox App in your Start Menu, click the gear in the bottom left corner, click the 'Game DVR' tab under the Settings title, and slide the slider to off. This has reportedly helped some people.\n\n2) Right click on the league client in the Riot folder on your computer, select Properties, click the Compatibility tab and then select \"Run this program in Compatibility Mode for Windows 7\".
