The problem is that he's so strong already that those weak ass lovetap nerfs didn't even make a difference, because Riot is too afraid to give him a real nerf.\n\nHe's more like Braum than Jax.  He doesn't have to dodge shit, he's just nearly unkillable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OnanThaMan","date":"2015-01-17T16:16:40.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I would try to reduce the bonus damage cap from his execute on his q to 75/150/225/300/375. Then take away the spellvamp on his w and reduce the lifesteal to 5%/8%/12%/15%/18%. Lastly Reduce the base damage on his ult to 200/350/500, but leave the scaling alone. \n\nOr they could nerf him into the ground like Elise, but that wont happen. Either way i'm tired of seeing him and hearing about him, plus i do believe that he does crowd out some junglers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cenobite Azaziel","date":"2015-01-17T05:06:21.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Starting?\n3 years as top pick jungler. \nIn three years you finish a PHD dude!","replies":[{"poster":"freeformline","date":"2015-01-17T08:16:32.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've got some kind of doctoral program there, most PhDs I know take more like five to seven years!\n\nBut I agree. Lee Sin has been strong for a long time simply because of his built-in utility and mobility.
