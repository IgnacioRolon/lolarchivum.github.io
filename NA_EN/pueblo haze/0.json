It looks awesome, but I have a couple of questions about the game.\r\n\r\nHow many games are avaible to order? Is it likely that the game will be sold out in like 10 minutes? \r\n\r\nAre the shipping cost the same as stated on the merchstore? In my case it would be 10&euro; to switzerland.\r\n\r\nIs it avaible on the merchstore so I can add some more stuff? Could use a new mousepad :D\r\n\r\nDoes shipping to switzerland include the customs?","replies":[{"poster":"Kades","date":"2016-10-05T01:20:36.664+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nWe're doing the first half of our initial order of 30k units; I have no idea if it will sell out or not, but if it does, we will make more.\n\nI believe 10€ is correct for Switzerland, but because Switzerland isn't a part of the EU, you will need to pay duties upon receipt.\n\nAnd yes, you can buy other stuff at the merch store; enjoy your new mousepad?","replies":[]},{"poster":"jgcpalmer","date":"2016-10-04T19:46:11.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There will be 15000 games available on October 13th.  Once those sell out, there are 15000 games that will be immediately available to pre-order and should ship in December.\n\nShipping to Switzerland would indeed be 10 € .  You can find complete list of shipping prices in this discussion: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1645785/lets-chat-about-shipping-costs/page/1\n\nI can't really answer your other questions definitively.  I'm 99.9% sure you can add other stuff to your order, I can't see why not, as it all goes through the merch store.\n\nFrom what I've read, customs is only included in orders from the NA.  However, orders in the EU are shipped from within the EU, so there shouldn't be customs charges for orders in the EU.","replies":[{"poster":"Pueblo Haze","date":"2016-10-04T20:33:03.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Switzerland isnt part of the EU and that's why I wondered. I thought bulky stuff like the game might be more expensive to Shop to Switzerland.\n\nThanks for answering the other questions :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Balliztik2","date":"2016-10-06T03:44:57.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an avid board game collector, I predict that they will sell out within a few hours.  RIOT just broke through another dimension (the board game dimension) and people are taking notice of this upcoming game.  Millions play League of Legends, and out of those millions, a couple thousand will easily purchase Mechs vs. Minions.\n\nAside from the PC gamers, board gamers in the US and other countries, such as Europe, greedily await the release of such an incredibly, well produced, and greatly affordable board game hoping to snatch a copy before a reprint, or before After Market Sales (which will, in due time, cause the price to inflate).  \n\nThe QUALITY of this game is self-evident.  The love of the creators transpires within the rule book and each, individual plastic mold.\n\nNow, if only RIOT would allow other vendors to buy, such as Coolstuffinc, Miniature Market, or even Amazon, the news of this great game would spread like wildfire and their \"street cred\" would make many more buyers jump in on their next board game project.  I'm already wishing for more, but this may be their one and only gem, and it will definitely outlive the PC game.","replies":[{"poster":"Herazalila","date":"2016-10-06T21:02:59.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They said  with distributor they would have sell it 200$.Pretty sure the price is one of the big factor for  hype.","replies":[]}]}]}
