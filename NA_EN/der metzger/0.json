But even when his passive is full, you can't really duel him.\n\nDue to his debuffs and dash/slice/whatever you wanna call it, it's also very hard to kite him and most ADCs can easily die instantly to Tryndamere.\n\nRecently I've seen a full Attack Speed Tryndamere, all of his runes he could get had Attack Speed on them and his first item was Attack Speed and he ended up carrying th game, pushing top lane to our Nexus Turrets because very few people besides our Ziggs could stop him (only our ADC and Mid were ranged.).\n\nI don't think calling Tryndamere overpowered is wrong, he needs to be nerfed even if he is technically not \"overpowered\". He invalidates a huge majority of the game from ever being able to fight him with a Level 1 Infinity Edge built into his kit due to his free critical chance and free attack damage. He has too much sustain and get-out-of-jail-free cards and it needs to be nerfed, even if he isn't played in the LCS or have a 60% win rate, it still changes nothing as his kit is so extremely toxic on top of him being the easiest champion in the game, even easier than Master Yi, he needs to be nerfed.\n\nWhen a champion's kit is this toxic then there is obviously an issue with the champion itself.\n\nPersonally they should max his critical hit at 15% and also make him unable to use his ultimate while under crowd control.","replies":[{"poster":"StealWolverine","date":"2015-05-26T21:46:10.067+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:36}}  {{champion:31}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:102}} \nall can do decent against him if good.","replies":[{"poster":"I Main Swain","date":"2015-05-27T00:11:41.623+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"you forgot to add almost every other champion in the game","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"lDontLiftIcarry","date":"2015-05-26T16:03:52.977+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The laneing phase.\nTrundle: IT NEVER STOPS!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joe Dredd","date":"2015-05-26T15:29:23.548+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh what's that, you won lane?\nGood thing laning phase never ends when vs tryn","replies":[]},{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-05-26T15:08:18.883+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, reason why Tryn is never allowed to be good is because much like Master Yi and Riven, you need your entire team composition to counter him specifically.  If you have a ton of hard CC, Tryn's made irrelevant.  If you don't, he roflstomps you and gets pentakills effortlessly.  At least you can plan a team composition against him and still invalidate him as a champion.
