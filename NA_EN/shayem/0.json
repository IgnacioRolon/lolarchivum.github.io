I went and counted and have played over *120* games since this honor reduction due to a 25 game chat restriction. Since then have had no further violations. I do not recall seeing the system pop up telling me I&#039;ve unlocked honor again, which I believe I read somewhere that this must occur before you actually start gaining honor, and until then it&#039;s just a time period of it being locked. However, I do leave my client up when I&#039;m not around and thought maybe I had missed the pop up, since I feel that by now I should be able to be climbing out of this sewer. \r\n\r\nIs there currently a bug where you can not leave honor lvl 0? \r\n\r\nThanks to anybody with information - I&#039;m just curious about my situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-11-08T22:53:03.027+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, there is no bug.

Are you serious?  You read the logs and yet you don't think that kid was trolling.  He admitted he was purposely bailing out to get me killed and he admitted he was spam pinging.  He purposely walked under their fucking turret as an adc and auto attacked it 3 times feeding a kill.  I may have been toxic to that %%%%, but the fact you think he was \"having a poor game\" is pathetic.  To prove the point I have gotten a smurf account to lvl 23 only trolling.  Lvl 23.  No bans. No chat restrictions.  Nothing.  23 levels of purposeful feeding. ulting people with bard so the enemy could surround them.  spam pinging.  taking smite as a bard support and smiting all of my junglers camps away from him. \n\nNot. One. Ban.   You're bad at your job and your banning system is flawed.  All you have to do to troll is not blatantly say \"I am trolling\" to get away with it.  Don't be toxic in chat and you can ruin the game for 9 people at a time and Riot will take your side when they report you and you report them because \"they were toxic\".  I actually get little congratulations from your system in game saying players were punished.  Literally, what happened to my account I've had since 2010.  Game got super toxic, I talked back to the assholes and got a bunch of chat restrictions and bans for doing so.  It must suck to be the man in charge of the punishment software and know that you literally work all week to do nothing useful huh?  Banning the wrong accounts because toxicity in the chat is considered worse that toxicity in the game.\n\nAnd to answer your question, yes.  Let people rage.  Who cares, its an in-game chat.  Your policy seems to be if somebody is toxic mute them, since that's what I was told in my ticket when your own employee acknowledged that I was being trolled by players and said that I should have just muted them.  You have a system that is a mix between coddling a bunch of pussies who cant take a negative in-game chat and allowing trolls to ruin the game.  I was told I should have \"changed my behavior\" if I didn't want this account banned.  I did so.  I stopped being negative in chat and started ruining games instead.  Because on this account I never purposely fed, trolled my teammates, or anything like that.  But boom, banned.  And on one of my new accounts all I do is troll my teammates and purposely feed and harrass them but avoid the chat and Riot seems to have no problem with it.\n\nMy issue is you ignore the harassment that actually impedes game play in order to coddle a bunch of cry babies who cant take somebody saying they suck in the chat. And yea, I do have bad games.  The difference is when I did I never purposely ruined the game for everybody else on my team because of it.  And thanks to this being one of the most toxic games out there, yes I too am harassed by at least half my team any time I make a mistake like not warding and going in for trades when it comes out bad. \n\nBut enjoy your job bud.  Doing an outstanding job policing the chat logs for any negative messages. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n\n_Edit:  I've actually come up with some really cleaver ways to troll my teammates.  Exploring ways to ruin the game with these terrible new runes currently._","replies":[{"poster":"RunningDownMid","date":"2017-11-16T19:38:51.510+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"i respect u buddy.
