Some of you may even know friends who have gotten banned for a week, 2 weeks or even permanently banned. Some of these players don't realize the harshness of the punishment riot can bring to your account. \r\n\r\nWell, I happen to be that person. I was permanently banned for saying a bunch of stupid things that meant nothing to me at the time. I truly feel bad for the people that had to go through my behavior. I severely regret the hundreds of dollars I spent on the game only for it to go to waste. That's why I'm here to make a statement and tell anyone that exhibits toxic behavior to stop now, it will only get worse.\r\n\r\n I feel like many people that have been permanently banned, didn't know the true punishment to behaving in such a way. I also feel that many perma-banned players have been reformed, myself included and want to continue playing League of Legends with their group of friends. I believe that Riot should unlock all permanently banned accounts starting fresh this new season. This will allow everyone to get a chance to reform and prove themselves on the Summoner's Rift.\r\n\r\nPlease consider unlocking permanently banned accounts this upcoming season. I'm sure the community will come together again.\r\nThanks, {{summoner:13}}  \r\nOldSchool GGez","replies":[{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2016-11-04T04:48:38.842+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":5,"body":"I'd rather their accounts be given to the needy.\n\nYes that's right.
