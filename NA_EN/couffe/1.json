Also my toxic behavior was fine throughout the game other than that one line which is why I got chat restricted? I report people who are toxic to me and nothing happens I have never gotten the thank you for reporting message which proves that they don't care if one person reports them. So without telling people to report nothing gets done, I find the system flawed if that's the way it works. People don't care to report unless they are told to. (Unless they are the person being attacked) So telling someone to report someone shouldn't be considered an attack because even if it's a false report Riot would know that and do nothing about it.

All it takes is a single report to flag a match for review by the IFS.  Your report.  Having the other people on your team or the enemy team really doesn't make that much difference.  So, by calling for reports, all you are doing is breaking the rules and running the risk of getting yourself reported for harassment.   The IFS isn't like the old Tribunal where you see how many people on both teams reported the player.  It's an automated system that picks up the match the moment one report is submitted, and isn't impressed by all those extra pretty colors and ally 1, ally 2, enemy 1, enemy 2, etc. \n\nAnd for your own sake, you might not want to call other players retards anymore.
