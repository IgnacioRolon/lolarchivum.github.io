(NA-Comcast ISP)\r\n\r\nFor the past week I suddenly have not been able to log into the league of the legends client. I've reset and changed my password, repaired the client, reinstalled the client, used Hextech repair tool, opened ports, changed firewall settings, and I still can't connect. I says \"Login Status - Loading...\" and just continues to load until i kill the client. IS anyone else having this issue? I live in Houston, TX... I submitted a support ticket and still haven't heard anything back from riot support.  Would love some assistance with error if anyone has a fix.

If you could, go ahead and run a traceroute using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to the NA servers at 104.160.131.1. Shoot the results my way or go ahead and send them over to our techs in your ticket so that we can take a look.","replies":[]}]}
