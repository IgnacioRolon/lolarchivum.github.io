{"poster":"Shamont","date":"2014-11-27T01:25:30.116+0000","title":"Champion Concept: Gryndheim, the Usurper","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/TkR8xcu.jpg?1\n\n*“The end of the tunnel justifies the means of the digger”*\n\n2 Months ago I had an idea, one of my first concept ideas. And I have been working on it ever since, trying to get it just right before I released it. \n\nKeep in mind, I have had this idea for two months of progress. I wanted to make this champion to fit a unique niche, the attacker from below. I had no idea that Riot was working on Rek’Sai, but that just means that great minds think alike. Gryndhiem’s niche is slightly different; the idea behind him is that he is a usurper, when you least expect it he will rise upon you, from the shadows, and knock you from your throne. He has a slew of abilities that will put his target at a disadvantage before he delivers the final ground shaking blow. \n\nAnd that is what I focused on for the concept being that I think a mole is the perfect manifestation of a usurper. I also focused on the fact that moles have strong arms to dig underground, undermining humans’ idea of property. As a usurper his abilities capitalize on his shady background. Even though he has good intentions at heart, he will use any methods necessary to meet the ends he deems just, even if they are underhanded methods.\n\nThe idea came to me when I was reading post about how there aren’t enough beast or monster type Champions that are not from the void. I was further inspired to start creating the idea of this champion concept, when I read HigheR’s post for Spica (E0oQXx3B-champion-concept-spica-the-flaming-kick), who is an amazing artist and concept creator. I decided that I would try my own hand at drawing my own champion and creating their concept for the first time.\nThis is what I came up with.\n\n**Gryndheim, the Usurper**\n\n**Resource: Oxygen**\nIt’s not easy finding air pockets underground, even for the best miners. The more time Gryndheim spends underground the less oxygen he has. Oxygen has a low timer around 6 sec, if he spends too much time underground he is forced back to the surface, and is rooted while he catches his breath. When Gryndheim does come above ground before the timer depletes there is a limit of time before he can go back down based on how much time he has spent underground: If the timer had 2 second left Gryndheim has to wait 4 seconds, while he refills his Oxygen. Abilities have no cost.\n\n**Passive: Drill Claws**\nGryndheim is an experienced miner who knows where to find the weak points in a target. Every 5th attack Gryndheim gets bonus attack damage, and armor penetration. If Gryndheim AAs the target on the 5th attack, his claws will pierce the targets, gaining 175 range for 5 sec. Below ground Gryndheim moves with increased movement speed with reduced armor and magic resist, above ground he moves with significantly reduced movement speed, with increased armor and magic resist.\n**\nQ: Fault Line**\n(Underground) Gryndheim attacks the fault lines underground causing the earth to rupture up along the fault line creating a tall rock shockline that shoots forward, it stays up for 3 sec. Fault Line acts as a damage dealer and a wall and it's operated like Viktor's laser.\n(Above Ground) On activation if Gryndheim walks over land that he has hollowed with Dig Away! He drags his huge claws behind him as he walks, making the tunnels collapse and creating terrain that slows enemies behind him, and damaging those that he walks by for 2.5 sec. Can be recast to deactivate the ability. He cannot AA while this ability is active.\n\n**W: Muskeg**\n(Underground) Gryndheim churns the ground making a \"quicksand\" where he is located, enemies at the center are rooted, and enemies to the sides are slowed, all are damaged over time. If an enemy unit is on the side, it will be slowly pulled towards the center but not rooted. Gryndheim can move away and Muskeg's location will not change.\n(Above ground) Passive - Gryndheim gains MS when walking through brush. \n                           \n**E: Dig Away!**\n(Essential for other abilities) Toggles being above ground, and underground, when activated Gryndheim gets a 3 sec significant MS buff. Gryndheim has those 3 seconds to damage enemies (if he passes beneath or near them) as he is just below the surface in the Transitioning Phase, between levels. He can be targeted by all abilities during this phase.\n(Underground) Passive - Gryndheim's tunnels during the 3 sec Transitioning Phase leave a hollowed ground trail that is easily identified by scars in the ground. These scars persist for 1 minute. They can only be used for the above ground version of Fault Line. \n\nActivating this ability begins the refill of Oxygen's timer, if he is going up. But the bar won't begin to deplete until the Transition Phase is over, if he is going down. While completely underground Gryndheim not targetable except by abilities that effect the ground. Allies and enemies can clearly see his shadow and dirt mounds being kicked up as he moves. Gryndheim cannot bypass terrain while underground. He ignores unit collision while underground. If Gryndheim is stunned, silenced, or rooted while underground, his Oxygen timer stops for the duration on the stun silence, or root. (5 sec CD)\n\n**R: Dirt Geyser**\n(Underground) Gryndheim tears throught the ground shooting straight toward a target location (within 800 units) and from underground and blasts up, doing a lot of AoE damage in a small area initially (200), knocking up the enemy in the initial AoE. The geyser persists doing light AoE damage over time In a larger area (500), and more damage towards the center (300). If this ability is activated Gryndheim can't go back underground for 1 sec.\n\n**Lore**\nGryndheim was part of civilization of moles that lived deep underground for decades without light. On the edge of the Kumugu jungle is where they made their home. All the little moles had heard the stories of when their civilization used to live closer to the surface, where in the early morning they could watch the beautiful sun rise. But they had migrated deep when the Rune Wars started. The only way for them to preserve their way of life was to remain neutral. But their leader saw a way to make money off the war. He coerced his own kind into digging for weapon metals to sell to both sides. But this plan would not benefit them for long. Noxus leaders started to get suspicious when they saw Demacians using the same metals they had bought from the moles. Gryndheim, the leader’s second in command, knew it was only a matter of time before the Noxians found them out and laid havoc to their city. So he secretly tried to start a revolution to get rid of the tyrannical leader. But no one that attended his underground meetings believed him. They were all as greedy as the leader and their eyes were too blinded by the gold that fell into their laps to pay any attention to the inevitable future that Gryndheim clearly saw. Undeterred Gryndheim knew with grim resolution that, in order to preserve his people’s way of life, he would have to carry out his revolution one way or another. He set out on his own and usurped the despot of the moles in the most unexpected way, from beneath. As he expected the result was not pleasing, even though Gryndheim had resolved not to take the position of leader himself, as a sign of respect. He had even shown them evidence of what would happen if they had continued on their current path, the others still despised and rejected him. Gryndheim was forced to leave the city. But he knew his job didn't end there, he had to keep appearances and make sure that no one ever found out. So he joined the League of Legends so that if he could find out if anyone ever connected the dots, then they would never live to tell.\n\n**Tip for Playing as Gryndheim:**\n1. Gryndheim can be very slippery if you manage his Oxygen bar correctly\n2. Gryndheim has good burst potential and zone control if you plan your moves carefully\n3. Gryndheim is very vulnerable above ground because he is very slow, but if his abilities are placed correctly, he can cover his escape\n4. Fault Line leaves a tall rock wall in a straight line, try maneuvering it so that it covers his escape when you have to come above ground or after his ult\n5. Create as many scars as you can when you use Dig Away! these can later be used to help you escape if you are above ground and in trouble.\n\n**Tips for Playing Against Gryndheim:**\n1. It's hard to hit Gryndheim while he is underground, but he must come up often for air, plan for that time to open an opportunity to deal as much damage as you can before he goes underground again, you have a 6 sec minimum window when he comes above ground\n2. Gryndheim can be hit by attacks that knock up, knock back, stun, root, silence, apply cleaving strikes, cause tremors and other attacks that hit or effect the ground, while he is underground.\n3. If Gryndheim is hit by an attack that forces him above ground his Oxygen bar will deplete on surfacing, but it will only take 85% of the normal time to refill\n4. Gryndheim is completely targetable during both of his 3 second Transition Phases (Down, Up), if he runs out of air, he is immediately forced to the surface.\n5. Even though Gryndheim can be harder to hit while underground, he is also has less armor and resistances.\n\n\nIf you find any of these abilities confusing, Im probably going to make some animations for him so just ask\n(Max wait time=1 week)\n\nIf anyone knows some one who is good with color (digital or whatnot) or want to color this splash them selves, I am open to letting people use this art for that purpose  (i dont do color). Just make sure you post it here when your done, and you give credit to the correct people.\n\nThere are probably some flaws in here, but that’s what you guys are here for. All you commentators are gonna help me make this concept even better.

I screamed like a girl when you mentioned me xD it's awesome to be acknowledged as a fellow!\n\nOnto the champ itself! the resource bar is amazing, I created a champion a while ago that was about digging as well (it's on my DA if you wanna take a look) but I never thought about tying the whole burrow mechanic to a resource bar, so kudos for that! it's an amazing Idea, it'd be cool if you took it a bit further and made it work like Rumble's heat but backwards, the more oxygen you have the stronger your skills hit.\n\nE's tooltip is crazy convoluted xD try to simplify it a bit, I'm not even sure I understood it well and I read it several times xD it's a tad too long and the whole CC resistance is odd, does he gains tenacity while burrowing? or a spell shield? how does that work?\n\nR: Does it have an above ground option? or maybe gryndheim burrows himself immediately and sends the geyser up in the spot?\n\nLast but not least the splash is amazing! you're really good drawing the effects, dem rocks and tornado! his pose is great as well, good handling of perspective in his legs and upper body! Gryndheim himself has some elements that confuses me a bit, like the knives in his waist or his... tongue? nose? xD can't really make out what that is, but the point comes across, he's a mole and looks like a empowered one! all in all great job man, keep it up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-01-12T07:50:10.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me and Shamont worked on this concept together so I'll give you the thanks on his behalf in terms of the concept art\nFor the root on the resource it would only be for 1 sec, I'll tell Shamont to put that in. But this concept was created with the mind that he works best in his element, and thus a good player will manage their oxygen well, and maximize their time undergrounds, the root is punishment for not managing your resource well. It also fits thematically in that he is catching his breath. If the punishment were to be lessened, the least I think Shamont would do is immediate resurface, and a silence.\n\nThe reason he moves faster underground and slower on land, is the same reason a penguin moves fast underwater and slower on ice: he is in his element, he is meant to be underground. The reason we reduce his armor underground, is because there are so many less chances for a lot of champions to hit him while he's there, so it's only fair that we make some counter play for a character who can't be hit by a lot of abilities.\nBut in a thematically you are correct, but we were thinking about balances.\n\nWs above ground was my mistake that's supposed to be HR, my bad, it because he's a part of nature.\n\nFor the W the 3 send transition phase is not a channel per say, it's more of a MS buff and damage dealer. Rek'Sai just goes up and down, this guy tears through the ground when he dives or resurfaces. Those three seconds help him catch up to an enemy and deal damage as he passes, or it would help him get away. Those 3 seconds help increases his chance to do those things, so the 3 sec is more of a soft channel cause you can still do a lot of stuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-12T04:11:09.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, the famous and universally loved \"tunneler\" concept!  Everyone has their on take on what this should and could look like, and no one's is necessarily better or worse than others.  That said, I'll only leave notes on the merits of each ability.\n\nFirst of all, hats off to you for creating your own concept art from scratch.  It looks really good and helps sell who this character is.  Unlike the reference images I use, which only get sort of close to some semblance of my intent, your concept art is EXACTLY what you want to be.  That's awesome.\n\nOxygen seems pretty debilitating to me.  A self-imposed root simply for using the rest of his kit the way he should/needs to?  That's so harsh.  At the most I would suggest temporarily reducing the damage he deals while \"exhausted\" or slowing his movement speed for a few moments.\n\nWhile underground/above ground, it seems like the stats are backwards to me.  Digging through rock and mud should make him slower, but seeing as he's underground he should have added defensive stats, right?\n\nQ seems pretty straight forward and cool.  I like the thematic ties to the fault lines.\n\nW's above ground passive seems really weird and weak- why would a mole move faster in thick brush?  Plus he already has movement speed benefits in other areas.\n\nE is obviously core to his kit so there's not much to say about this one.  A 3 second channel/transition period seems really long, though.  Is there a particular reason why you made that so long?  Think about Rek'sai (as hard as that may be) and how quickly she can transition between her forms.  That kind of player control is paramount for a champion like this.\n\nR is admittedly a predictable choice, but again a rather necessary one for a kit like this (my tunneler concept has it, Rek'sai has it, etc.).  I like the geyser approach and the havoc it would cause when bursting out in the middle of an enemy team for a team fight!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2014-12-27T00:20:33.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm giving a more complete review of this champion since before I simply stated is  was really good.\n\nResource - First champion I've seen with a truly unique resource since the time there was only one rage based champion in league. It has a very unique attribute of stunning the champion should he use it all up without noticing, which can lead to him getting trapped in the middle of the enemy team and cause him to wait for respawn. Rating=5/5 I have no suggestions for this, it is good as it is.\n\nPassive - While there are champions that gain additional damage after so many attacks, there are no champions that trade movement speed for additional armor and resist, (besides mine but her's is a toggle ability with mana usage and healing,) and switches the stats traded when switching between above and below ground, above ground less movement speed and more armor and resist, below ground more movement speed and less armor and resist. Rating=4/5 I believe this is very good for a passive and makes you think before acting in match.\n\nQ - Below ground has a unique ability of creating walls for 3 seconds that damage enemies as they come up and can be directed by the player basicly. Similar to Viktor's laser. Rating 4/5 A ability I would really love to see in the game and think would lead to interresting team battles.\n\nAbove ground he collapses tunnels that he has dug creating a slowing zone and damaging enemies near him as he walks while being unable to auto attack. Rating 3/5 Not a very interesting ability however compliments the rest of his toolkit well.\n\nW - Below ground this is a \"trap\" ability where gryndheim will create a zone in which enemies are stunned at the center but slowed at the edges, similar to Leona's ult, HOWEVER! Unlike Leona's ult enemies at the edge are slowly drawn into the center where I presume they will be stunned when they reach the center. I also presume that the pull is slower then basic movement speed and thus most people will be able to escape. Rating=4/5 Considering that he must be underground to use this, and has a limited time span to use it do to his unique resource, this is a rather good ability that can be used to either stop a fleeign enemy or secure your escape.\n\nAbove ground he gains additional movement speed while in brush. As far as I know only one other champion has this, though I'm not really sure any champion has it. Rating=3/5 Compared to the rest of his kit, this passive seems rather dull, however it is not so dull that it should be removed.\n\nE - Above ground gryndheim goes underground. Yes we all know that Rek'sai does this. However as the submitter clearly stated, he had been working on this champion for 2 months before posting, and thus did not know anything about Rek'sai during that time. However different from Rek'sai, gryndheim gains only a 3 second speed boost before returning to the speed that he has with addition to what his passive gives. Rating=4/5 Rated as such because before Rek'sai's release this was a very unique ability and showed great promise for potential tookits.\n\nBelow ground gryndheim leaves essentially paths that he can activate with his Q to slow enemies that pass over them. Rating 3/5 Fits very nicely into his toolkit but leaves you defenseless while you do it.\n\nR - gryndheim will quickly travel to a target and blast up with a geyser, doing initial AOE damage and knocking up enemies in the initial zone, before dealing additional AOE damage after. Rating=5/5 Rated for the fact that I have NEVER seen an ability like this one and has a very unique machanic to it.\n\nLore - And interesting story but the delivery leaves you wondering if it could be better. Rating=3/5 for a good plot but not so good deliverance.\n\nTips - The tips are given for both people playing grynndheim and those against him, makign them fair and balanced. They point out both strengths and weaknesses well. Rating=5/5 Rated as such because they do their job and that's all that's required of them.\n\nAveraged champion rating=4/5\n\nNow for suggestions to improve upon the concept, (as a concept is just that, a concept. A idea that has begone to shape but is not yet set in stone.)\n\nResource is perfect as it is.\n\nPassive needs to be carefully balanced between loss and gain factors. You don't want him to be super slow above ground, but fast as heck below while also being basicly wet paper due to loss of armor and resist.\n\nQ below ground is perfect how it is. However for above ground I would make it so instead of dragging his claws he could instead stab them into the ground, causing the scars to collapse. He would no longer move while doing it but i think it would look much better then the image of him in my head where he waddles along slashing the ground as he goes.\n\nW Below ground it is just awesome and does not need to be changed. However above ground I'm not sure the increased movement speed while traveling through the brush fits in with his theme. Maybe make it instead so that he moves slower in the brush but gains increased health regen? After all he will be traveling through roots and all, roots of which he could be munching on to regain health. Yeah I know how moles act, I've had a few in my yard before the cats got to them.\n\nE This is fine with the exception that perhaps 3 seconds it too long? Maybe 2.5 seconds would be better?\n\nR I would only lengthen the time that gryndheim cannot return underground. besides that it is perfect.\n\nLore could use improvement on delivery, besides that it has a good story.\n\nTips are fine as they are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shamont","date":"2014-12-15T04:28:47.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The splash or the kit?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninjacat990","date":"2014-12-15T02:06:39.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"looks great man","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiamondMatthew","date":"2014-12-07T22:26:50.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, just posted 2 new Ideas, could you plz check them out? \n\nRiss ~ The Void Shredder\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/wOiZLx6b-riss-the-void-shredder\n\nKrieger ~ The Might of the Rakkor\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/IBViwLKW-champion-idea-krieger-the-might-of-the-rakkor","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shamont","date":"2014-12-06T06:48:14.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also Im gonna being making a skin for Gryndheim so people can add to their team skin collections, because Gryndheim has decided to join the Rune Guard, and join forces with Volibear.\n\nThe skin will be available next week, (or whenever I get around to it)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shamont","date":"2014-12-06T06:46:38.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kno, i kno, i had the champion in the works 2 month before Rek'Sai, came out, i had no idea she was coming out, and I actually had to release Gryndheim early to maintain the little projection of originality that i had before they released her kit. Me and Beat Punchbeef, just think alike, we both had an idea for a tunnler champ and we both wanted it to be realized. But they are still very different. Thier arch types are different. But if you want to focus on the \"tunneler role\" I could give a lot of examples where Riot has taken the same \"role\", but implemented it differently: Fire Mage-Annie, Brand, Shyvana. All use fire yet each unique and different. Gangplank and Miss Fortune are prime example of this: Both very much pirates (pirate hunter watever) but they still have a different feel to them. So i think that it could be viable to have two tunnle champs as long as they are still very different an unique, and while both have a main tunnling ability, the rest of the kit is entirely different. His passive an resource are a testament to that.\n\nI think that his visual design is better and more original than a mole.

So it works like this: underground he can only do the eruptions on version of fault line, and when he is above ground he can only use the ability that makes use of the scars from Dig Away! He cannot use the eruption Q while above ground, and vise versa, with he collapsing tunnels Q. This also means that if there aren't any scars left in the right places from E, then when Q is activated above ground, Gryndheim won't get the slow for the duration of the ability, only the damaging part. The slow only activates if Gryndheim has walked over scared land when he activates Q above ground. W has only a passive in addition to its main active ability, but that passive is only available above ground. I hope that made sense.\n In terms of his E, Dig Away! would bring him above ground if he's underground and It would take him below ground, if he's above ground. In both cases he would leaves the trail for (above ground) Q, gets the MS buff, and the ability to do damage when it's activated.\n\nAnd I would luv to read about ur sound champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scilot","date":"2014-11-29T21:43:09.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reading this now, so far it's a great concept, but my computer's about to restart for updates, I'm gonna give a review once i can get back online.\n\nEDIT: Computer's back and found the thread, reading the rest now.\n\nEDIT-2: Just finished reading and think that this would work really well in the league, but I have a few questions.

(I love Spica)\n\nIt seems like everyone is loving his Resource, glad I could come up with a crowed pleaser. On the topic of your suggestion, its a possibility, but I wanted to keep it as simple as possible (this is supposed to be my simple champ, the rest coming up are kinda...the opposite). Also I can see why you could justify that, but I dont see how having more Oxygen makes him stronger. At peak Oxygen, he just has the same amount as every one else, when he goes below ground he's just losing the normal amount over time, which means he'd have to be super weak when he is at 1 Oxygen (b/c thats the way you have to balace him with the mechanic), even more so at 0, and thats when he's forced to the surface and rooted. And if you think about it, (if I did use your suggestion) when Gryndheim is above ground he'd be too strong because, his oxygen bar would always be at the top if he stays up long enough (it wouldnt fluctuate like Rumble's, whos mechanic on the Resource works totally different from Gryndheims). And I already gave him more armor above ground, thats OP. Plus it takes away from the fact that Gryndheim is meant to be played underground, your mechanic is suggesting that the player wants more Oxygen for more damage, which means that they'd come up for that reason, instead of managing the Oxygen for the sake of staying down as long as possible to use thier abilities when they can. But if you come up with a logical rebuttal, Im open to listening to it.\n\nTalking about E, your right it is a bit complicated, sometimes, I just get carried away, maybe i can move the passive to another ability, to take the weight off of E. But besides the passive I think everything that I wrote under E is important that it is said, and I think all of that is logical, but could probably be written better. And I realized that the CC reduction doesnt make much since on him, it just complicates things, I wanted to give him some more protection since he's wide open to all attacks in his Transitioning Phase, but its better if i take it off, because it gives room for more counter play against him, which balances him more.\n\nOn R, I was using the {{champion:150}} logic on his R by making it so he can only use it if he has managed his resource correctly. This is a major component to being able to play Gryndheim successfully. If you dont manage your Oxygen correctly your screwed, and that includes not being able to use your ult for 6 sec, (if you really screwed up), but 6 sec isnt that long to wait, since R comes with MS. But I think the idea is interesting, if Gryndheim cant go below (because his E's on cooldown (very low by the way) Oxygen bar hasnt refilled yet (or reached a spot where the player is comfortable, as long as it didnt reach Zero while underground, they can re-enter the dirt at any time, even if the bar hasnt refilled)) but they can substitute the skill shot nuke for a  self nuke, if they activate it above ground. Im open to your reasoning as to why you suggest this.\n\nLastly thank you for your compliments, but I still look up to you as an artist! That is a picture of him that i caught after he used Fault Line on an enemy archer tower and used his Ult to get away. He nearly hit me with it! Moles have terrible eyesight. And if your referring to the front view, about the knife, that is a mining tool sticking out of his overalls, and the back view you would be looking at mining armor, from beneath his overalls, to protect his lower back in the tunnels. And thats his nose that your looking at, at the tip of his face, right in front of his scraggly miners beard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shamont","date":"2014-11-27T08:03:51.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/C7lkdVa.png up","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shamont","date":"2014-11-27T07:19:29.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unlike Alistars Trample, Gryndheims Dig Away doesnt effect turrents, because its ability based not AA based\nAnd I really have to thank you for challenging me on his Q and W. Although I think Im gonna stick with his current W, your comment allowed me to evolve his kit a little bit.\nAlso do you think it would be OP if Gryndheim could bypass ability walls? I justify the fact that he cant pass terrain wall because it is mostly rock that continues underground and that might be OP, but the same is not tru for ability walls\n\nAnd I agree with you on the resource Idea, it doesnt need to be oxygen per say, but I dont think rage fits that well, she could use a more thematic passive, though Id bet that Beat Pucnchbeef's team probably played around with the idea, but they decided to let me have SOME originality haha.\nI think anyone can draw if they practice long enough, and it depends on what you draw, I can hardly draw humans as well as I can draw animals.

Im realizing now that there are a lot of things that I did not clarify. His abilities DO not have a cost like you thought. I am thinking about making the timer pretty short, so the player cant just stay under ground all the time, the key to Gryndheim is effectively managing your timer so you can stay underground to do the stuff you need to do, while not getting rooted, but i dont want him to be able to stay there all the time.\n\nPassive:\nI really like that suggestion, it feels right, and it does fit his arch type, thanks for that good idea. As for the global taunt, I should have deleted that. This is when I was playing around with making him have very low visibility when he was underground. So I wanted to balance that with the world wide taunt. But I scapped the idea because I thought that made him OP, and it didnt really match his arch type to me, so I should have deleted the WWT also. (At the time i justified the WWT with the fact that mining isnt quiet, but now it just doesnt work)\n\nQ and W:\nThanks for the compliments. The idea that Q and W dont have above ground applications comes from {{champion:268}} . He cant use two of his abilites either without activating Arise. In both kits one ability is logically essential to activating the other two. With this in mind, I made it so Gryndheim has to be in his element in order to use his abilities because that just made sense to me. Second Arise doesnt actually do damage it just places the soldier to ready them for the other abilities, other wise the only use Arise has is extending Azirs AA range. On other hand Gryndheim's Dig Away! has multiple uses; an engage and disengage, damage dealer, and it sets the stage for other abilities. To me, this makes up for the fact that his other abilites dont have an above ground use. If you think about it how much can a miner really do thematically, sticking to their theme, while above ground? If you have a suggestion for that I am wiling to listen, until then I have posted a temporary addition to his W that i think still fits, but at the moment dont have a solution for his Q.\n In addition both of these abilities can be used in a very defensive manner, so if you think your in a dangerous situation, and your W is on cool down (which would be pretty low) or you're still catching your breath and cannot go underground that just means that you did not handle your Oxygen correctly, and then (im sorry) you have trapped your self (thats just the way i designed him), proper handling of Oxygen is key. If you can go underground, but your in a dangerous situation, both Q and W damage and impede enemy movement, placing Muskeg, in front of a well placed Fault Line, almost ensures a compete get away from most champions.\n\nE:\nI guess Gryndheim's E is a little like {{champion:12}} s Trample, but it only deals damage to enemies within 150 units of him, as he is passing under or near them I guess, and its not DoT, its instant, on contact. Gryndheim does not have 100% tenacity (another case of me not being clear), especially while under ground, (thad be OP) he only gains an little while he is transitioning, this is meant to protect him while he is moving between levels. And I wouldn't say its a massive speed boost either, but a MS buff none the less. Like you said the immunity to non ground type attacks is ok as long as the Oxygen Timer is reasonable. Think of Gryndheim's E like Power Ball, but with out the increasing MS buff. Im thinking the timer could be around 6 sec since Power ball is 7 sec.\nAnd if you look in the Tips for Playing Against Gryndheim, you get a list of all the types of abilities that can get hit him while underground. So stuff like Alistars Pulverize, Veigars Dark Matter, Rammus' Tremors, Cho'Gaths Rapture, Gnar's Crunch and GNAR!, Lissandra's Ring of Frost Glacial Path and Frozen tomb, Malphite's Seismic Shard, Braums Glacial Fissure, Sions Decimating Smash and MORE! :) This shows that even though some abilities cant hit him underground, ALOT still can. Im also thinking about allowing skill shots to hit too, but I dont know.\n\nR:\nOK thanks, I didnt really want to add numbers since that would make it harder to balance, and im not gonna say im good at balancing, but since you asked, and I see how it could help, then I will try my best. Im thinking 100 AoE for the initial knock up, because I dont want it to be too easy to land that part, because its not the part that I want players to look at. The geyser that comes immediately after the knock up is the important part. Im thinking 500 units? (I want it to be a reasonably big AoE for the outer circle) and 200 for the inner circle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpiceIsRight","date":"2014-11-27T04:40:52.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, if he does get hit with a \"tremor\" ability I think it's fair that it depletes his Air and forces return to the surface.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpiceIsRight","date":"2014-11-27T04:34:40.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me know when you add some numbers, and I can look over things again for you if you want :) \n\n**Resource:** \n\nOh man! This is great, I love the forced management of underground time with clear-cut ramifications (i.e. the root). Does this mean his other abilities are no cost like Garen/Katarina? This is fine, but would need balancing with numbers and CD's to compensate. \n\n**Passive:**\n\nNot a bad passive, but I think aside from extra damage/pen, it could use a mechanic that makes it feel like a drill in action. For instance, what if it also gained increased range with a piercing effect (as if the drill finished its \"drilling\" through the target)? Also, could you explain more about the global taunt and how that ties in with the passive?\n\n**Q- Fault Line:**\n\nConcern here is that this ability has no function while above ground if I'm not mistaken? This is very dangerous. Otherwise it seems like a fun and useful skill.\n\n**W- Muskeg:**\n\nSame concern about what this does when above ground. I see this working like the empowered Gravity Field of {{champion:112}} except it's a root instead of a stun and the root only affects those originally at the center (no stack gaining). Thematically I'd say it's still unique enough to make the similarity in mechanics okay.\n\n**E- Dig Away!:**\n\nIs the damage like Trample {{champion:12}}? So champions nearby receive a sort of DoT damage? 100% Tenacity has been a Riot no-no (see Zac/Singed), this is especially bad when coupled with the massive speed boost. I won't quite say that the untargetable nature while underground is OP until we know how long the oxygen gauge can last, but this aspect must be carefully balanced. The other question, which abilities count as tremors? Does this mean only obvious ones like {{champion:31}} Rupture? Or would something like the 3rd strike of {{champion:92}}'s Broken Wings or {{champion:150}}'s Crunch work?\n\n**R- Dirt Geyser:**\n\nI like it as is! :) good work. The only question is what sort of ranges are we looking at (cast range, AoE range)? \n\nOverall, I think this is a very unique champion regardless of Rek'Sai release. I actually wish she included some of your elements (especially the resource idea). BTW, nice artwork. Wish I could draw like that ;) for now I have the FF picture haha.","replies":[]}]}
