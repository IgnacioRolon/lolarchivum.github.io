I mean it could be missing, but usually cases like this can happen if a security setting is preventing game files from being read.  I suggest going over the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure access is being allowed.  If the issue persists, you can also use the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to repair any bad or missing files.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
