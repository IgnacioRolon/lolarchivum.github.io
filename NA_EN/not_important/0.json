Soi restarted and League repaired itself. So far so good. I go back in and see that they obviously surrendered. I then find out i got the leaverbuster ban because my game crashed. I mean getting punished for something i didnt even do is not ok.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-11T21:42:47.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if your leave is not intentional, [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) treats all leaves equally because they still cause a negative experience for others.  Your best bet is to resolve whatever is causing you to leave.  I'd love to help but need more info and specifics on what your crashing issue is, along with any errors.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2016-11-11T21:46:23.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really sucks that the buster can't tell the freaking difference between a crash and a quit. It's a painintheass when you get a BSOD and get punished for something you can't prevent or fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-11T21:49:50.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Players intentionally leaving are likely to get banned.  The lower priority queue is to give you time to troubleshoot whatever is causing you to leave, or prevent that possibility from happening again.  I know it's frustrating to receive a leaverbuster penalty, but it sucks just as much for 9 other players who are down a player.  We have many guides and are always happy to help troubleshoot.  Check out our [Knowledge Base](https://support.riotgames.com), you might find that many issues are indeed fixable or let me know if you're having a specific issue. \n","replies":[{"poster":"Not Important","date":"2016-12-01T19:22:22.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It treats all 'equally'' ,  so shall we treat thieves just like rapists now? You treat the innocent guys like the ones that just straight up left. All that I saw was the game closing and telling me ''LoL crashed''. Also to troubleshoot for errors sounds good, especially 4 more times after i had found the bug or it fixed itself. So I can quadra check for an fixed error. If i want to search for errors I close League of Legends, and take my bloody time.\n\nAlso an example \n''An man trips and drops the chemical on an person and burns their face off'' \n''An man threw an chemical on an person with the intent of burning their face off''\n\nBoth get 20 years in jail.\nJustice has been served. This is the type justice leaverbuster enforces. I understand that my teammates think im a fucking dickhead for disconnecting , I also hate it because i just waited a lot of time that I could have enjoyed. Do you really think I dont feel bad about that? With an ban that occurs i get maybe 2 or 3 games a day, and lost time that i could have been spent otherwise, and to top if all off I get an role that i dont want to play or dont enjoy at all *cough* autofill (99% guaranteed support) *cough*, thats the beauty of leaverbuster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2016-11-11T21:52:43.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what about the issues that turn out to be unfixable?
