I'll play 200 games of {{champion:27}} Jungle and carry the game.. off-meta picks won't put you at a \"riskier\" take on anything go read the TOS again.","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Aphrolift","date":"2019-06-16T17:23:55.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Duelist Sagiri,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=PkVAmmOI,comment-id=000c000000000000000100000000,timestamp=2019-06-16T16:59:38.777+0000)\n>\n> Doesn't work that way buddy.

It's even more true if you end up with someone like nb3 in your game:\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/PQXy7f7m-nightblue-gets-a-player-falsely-banned\n\nI've read through the TOS...have you?

NB3 is banned because of the community outrage so Riot decided to appease the masses.\n\nNubrac is still banned with no explanation given beyond that one bs Reddit post by WookieCookie.\n\nOff-meta is completely play at your own risk.  Nubrac's penalty is a perfect example.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DeleteSuppRole","date":"2019-06-07T16:26:57.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wish we could change the official lane for supports and make them support the mid laner or the top laner instead, making bot lane a 1v1 ADC lane, would make everybody happy, solo laners will have a friend to lose lane with, supports won't be a handicap for ADCs anymore, it's a win win for everybody.","replies":[{"poster":"Shifted Society","date":"2019-06-08T07:12:34.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would rather have a 4 v 4 top jungle mid adc roles and be done with it","replies":[]}]}]}
