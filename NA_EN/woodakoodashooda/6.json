And each of these posts are often replied to by dozens of ACTIVE players who then proceed to up vote those posts. And, again, the boards are but a fraction of a percent of the game's entire player base.\n\nMathematically speaking, there are millions of active players around the world. Riot is pulling in money off in game events as well as championships.\n\nWorld Tournaments entertain hundreds if not thousands of live attendees with many more viewing through live streams.\n\nEntire Youtube accounts with thousands of subscribers are dedicated to bringing League related content.\n\nThousands of dedicated players spend hours discovering tips and tricks for the champions they enjoy playing with in order to share them with others through both written and video guides.\n\nRiot advertises their game, even on television because they can afford it.\n\nThis game is not dying, this game is not failing, this game is not going away any time soon.\n\nJust because it happens to be what a fraction of a percent or even a small percent of players do not enjoy does not mean it is a failure.\n\nThe game changed and some people are simply adverse to change, but change is necessary in order to maintain and sustain. People toss around the word \"stagnate\" in reference to this game. But, if anything, the exact opposite is true. This game is not stagnating. It iis because Riot identifies their current and primary consumer and caters to that target.\n\nIf what's being done to the game does not appeal to you then you're probably below Riot's radar of who gives a crap. Because Riot is a company and a company must put forward its financial interests first. Not what give certain individuals a warm fuzzy. It's not only logical, but it is far more compassionate and understanding than people realize.\n\nBecause by catering to the majority, Riot is indulging as many players as possible. They cannot possibly be expected to please everyone all of the time; so, they try, at the very least, to please the majority.\n\nLecture's over; otherwise, I'd end up repeating myself.","replies":[{"poster":"hoganftw","date":"2018-12-20T21:42:30.181+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm really not thrilled with the direction of the game.\nI think Riot took the whole \"Buffs not nerfs\" thing too far.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-12-20T22:38:30.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/ayLr86y_700b.jpg\n\nAh the good old days.\n\nWe ask to Nerf the Broken and Buff the weak, but we get buff everything instead.","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-12-21T00:33:02.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Anìmê,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=n06Uh9Em,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-12-20T22:38:30.820+0000)\n>\n> https://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/ayLr86y_700b.jpg\n> \n> Ah the good old days.\n> \n> We ask to Nerf the Broken and Buff the weak, but we get buff everything instead.\n\nso i see riot is valve now XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-12-20T23:47:07.951+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"This isn't true at all, we see plenty of nerfs","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-12-20T21:35:28.229+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"It might not be dying, but there are people who don't like the direction it is going and interest in it has waned.","replies":[{"poster":"Even","date":"2018-12-21T00:18:28.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jamaree,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=n06Uh9Em,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-12-20T21:35:28.229+0000)\n>\n> It might not be dying, but there are people who don&#x27;t like the direction it is going and interest in it has waned.\n\nYeah they will always exist regardless of the change.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DoktorKaiser","date":"2018-12-20T22:43:12.604+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's not dying per say, but the number of players has dwindled quite a bit since season 2-5 .

It's been shown that there are less and less players/viewers so yes people can say the game is dying. even when na and eu was getting the farthest and toppling competition there were less viewers.\n\n\n> Mathematically speaking, there are millions of active players around the world.\n\n\nno shit a game that at one point had 7million concurrent players in a day a few years ago still has 2-3 million a day in a game that is so addictive. those people have put in too many hours and money on this game to just leave.\n\n\n> Riot advertises their game, even on television because they can afford it.\n\n\n\nwith the amount of sponsors they have had for years and then franchising with lcs and lec, no shit they got the money. They made 1.6 billion in 2015.\n\n\nJust because a game is making alot of money, doesn't mean its not dying especially when it comes to the top 1-3 most played multiplayer games. This post is literally just \"oh well just because you see everyone everywhere say the same thing of how bad the game and riot is, doesn't mean its true because they still make money!\" the game is definitely dying, but a multi billion dollar company won't just die in the span of 1-2 years.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"1800NICECLIENT","date":"2018-12-20T22:40:18.916+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"To be fair being the most played or popular doesn't automatically mean the game is the best game or without fault.

To put that in classical descriptions, not the new tier system, that would be putting a B3 vs a S1 head to head in the same lane. That has the scary memory of games like dirty bomb, where the player base of active players fell to the point the ranked system ran up to 60 minutes, before they changed it and just put the next ten people that qued in the same game.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-12-20T23:40:15.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The new ranked system changes have caused some issues with matching making.

I really need to go to bed though so I'm not going to write an analysis on that right now.\n\nAnyway, personally I'm not sure how I like the game at the moment. At first I really didn't like the shorter gametimes and higher damage but... it's starting to grow on me. You see, I'm 32 (so I belong in a museum compared to most players). I've got a job, a GF, other hobbies, responsibilities, etc. I don't have as much time to play League as your average high-schooler that only has to worry about his homework. So a more \"arcadey\" League fits my time schedule and what I want from the game right now a lot better than a \"hardcore strategic game\" that you have to sink 100s of hours into. And compared to many other games out there, League still has a massively daunting learning curve. I'm glad I don't have to learn all the basics anymore because if I started out right now I'd be quitting after a couple of matches because \"waaaay more complex than I have time and energy to spare to learn all this stuff\".","replies":[]}]}
