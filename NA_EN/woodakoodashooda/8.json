Galio in his current state was not satisfying or successful enough to merit player attention.\r\n\r\nHow long as it been since his play rate even exceeded 1%? His play rate, in fact, was on par with Yorick prior to HIS rework.\r\n\r\nAnd now that Riot has put in the time and effort to provide him with a new look and kit in order to entice players into actually using him, all the ingrates come out of the woodwork and go on about how great Galio was and how Riot is just messing up again.\r\n\r\nWell, too bad.\r\n\r\nBaby don&#039;t get to have its cake and eat it too; in fact, baby shouldn&#039;t even be getting cake. But you&#039;ll be served your cake, people, and you might just find it delicious.

Not only would it have made his laning phase way better (as with melee autos he was forced to use his high-mana spells to wave clear), but it would've given his kit a pretty unique niche compared to other characters. He'd be a bit like karthus, in that although a bunch of things in his kit are ranged he'd want to get right in the middle of teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"Blossom of Time","date":"2017-03-08T03:27:37.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually fine with Galio receiving ranged auto attacks than melee attacks. Maybe ranged attacks in the form of morgana's autos or gnars'. They could also decrease mana consumption and adjust the ap ratios of his abilities to make him better.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-03-08T03:26:13.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If it looks like an arrogant little brat, and sounds like an arrogant little brat..","replies":[]}]}
