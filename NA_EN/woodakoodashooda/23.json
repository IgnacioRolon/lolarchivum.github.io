The active is powerful, and it's okay being that powerful. But such a powerful utility shouldn't be on such a powerful item, that it becomes core on just about any glass cannon. Particularly for those who already build lethality. As 60 AD and 15 lethality, puts it on par with all other lethality items in terms of offensive stats. Meaning that no one sacrifices any real damage, buying such an item to get that has a powerful defensive utility. \n\nEoN pretty much needs to go the same path that Rylies' did.

It has a lot of damage because of the lethality, it has defensive stats MR. And it has the active shield. I understand the purpose of it, but Sivir's spellshield was nerfed because it lasted a long time, this is like 4 times the duration of it and a shorter effective cooldown and everyone can use it. There's no justification to say that it's a balanced item.\n\nAD champions have better access to MR defensive items period. They are also more useful. AP Champions have literally 1 item that is worth building for MR and 1 item that is worth building for AD and then HP items. ALL of those items save for RoA/GLP on certain champions take up 2 prescious item slots reserved for defensive items.\n\nThe only exception is Seraphs, which frankly is not built on most champions because they take forever to charge it.\n\nAP Defensive items on the whole I would agree are more useful on an individual basis, but when you consider that you can build, Maw, BT, QSS, EoN, LW-Item and Duskblade end up up with 20% CDR, huge shields to get through, a large amount of penetration and magic resistance on something like Jhin/Varus and still deal a lot of damage to tanks with these items and have huge amounts of protection, they have way more items.\n\nIt sounds like your focus was more from the fighter/assassin space.

There's a clear trade off in building something like maw or hex drinker with clear benefits. People do build it and it is still a good item, but its situational. This is what defensive itemization should be, it shouldn't be get a great  effecient item, still deal tons of damage and have protection, especially on AD assassins who already have a lot going for them against mages to begin with, when you consider the reverse. Seekers while effecient if you build it first, you need to be much more careful with how you spend your mana; which makes a lot of lanes more difficult because you tend to get shoved anyway not to mention, Zhonyas as a second item save on a few champions does not do a lot for you unless you're just simply trying not to die.

People do build it and it is still a good item, but its situational.\n\nMaw was no less a cost efficient anti-mage item as edge. There were no downsides to building it as an assassin if you were stacking arpen. You had equivalent armorpen. You had 10 less damage but 10 more MR. You had a magic damage shield instead of a spellshield. It was a little more defense oriented, whereas edge of night is a little more offense oriented - but that's actually what an assassin wants. An assassin benefits more from buying just enough time to get his burst off, and actually benefits more from blocking CC than damage in a lot of cases. \nEdge of night is not a new item in that sense, but just a tweak on an existing assassin item.\n\nThe true source of whining is not the stats on edge, but appears to be the spellshield specifically.\n\nAnd assassins do need an efficient item like that. I've been doing the math recently on assassin vs mages and it becomes clear how much mages have an advantage over assassins when they build zhonyas and some HP/AP items, without sacrificing meaningful amounts of AP so they can still burst down squishy targets like assassins. Without the ability for assassins to gain a bit of MR without sacrificing their burst potential, they would be too easily countered by mages (which is their only real target after the ADC) to be viable. \nAssassins have no hybrid HP/AD/Arpen items like mages do. And the few HP/AD items in the game are not viable on assassins because they have specifically been nerfed to only work on bruiser builds. They give up too much AD for the HP. This is not the case with HP/AP items. Cleaver is a late game buy to help against tanks, but it's very inefficient for an assassin because their burst pattern means they gain little from it directly because all their damage is offloaded before the stacks are applied. They only help their team finish up, but it's being nerfed next patch in the same way frozen mallet was. \n\n>Does an assassin have to play ANY different when getting edge of night first? No.\nYou give up damage and roam/gank potential going edge versus the other two lethality items.\nIt is a more defensive pick if mages are giving you trouble.\nIf you need an early dominiks to deal with tanks, edge of night might be one of the lethality item you put on hold for it. \n\nSo yes, you do give up something relative to other lethality/arpen items to get edge. But as I already pointed out, items and classes were designed in such a way that you aren't suppose to need to give up damage/arpen as an assassin in order to gain some magic defense.\n\n> ALL of those items save for RoA/GLP on certain champions take up 2 prescious item slots reserved for defensive items.\n\nI've done the math in my thread on this subject, and you you lose almost no damage as Ahri against a squishy target if you go Sorcshoes/Rod of Ages/Zhonyas/Liandries/Rylais/Rabadons - Yet you become so highly survivable that no assassin can burst you down, and your return fire can kill them in a counterstrike. \n\nThat is a power that assassins don't have the ability to itemize for. \nIf they do go AD/HP items, they lose the arpen they need to burst down squishies. Mages don't have to choose between mpen/AP and HP. \n\nThat's why having some easy magic resist in assassin items makes sense, because they have no other options to survive mage burst.\n \n> AP Defensive items on the whole I would agree are more useful on an individual basis, but when you consider that you can build, Maw, BT, QSS, EoN, LW-Item and Duskblade end up up with 20% CDR, huge shields to get through, a large amount of penetration and magic resistance on something like Jhin/Varus and still deal a lot of damage to tanks with these items and have huge amounts of protection, they have way more items.\n\nA lethality stacking ADC does *not* deal huge damage to a properly itemized tank.\n\nI proved this on Swain against a lethality stacking Varus, Lucian, and Garen - I went Sorcshoes, Zhonyas, all four HP/AP items, and finished off with a frozen heart for a total of 30% CDR and 30 MPEN with tons of mana and armor. None of them could kill me. I'd dive into their whole team and make them flee because they realized I wasn't going down, while killing them in the process of chasing them down. \n\n\n> It sounds like your focus was more from the fighter/assassin space. \n\nI actually prefer to play both mages and assassins. \nI can be good on balanced fighters and tanky junglers, but I just don't find them as fun. \n\n\n>Which to give you credit I think for fighters these are mostly ok.  Assassins, I still think Edge of night needs to have things removed from it like it&#x27;s lethality.\n\nAs I already explained the necessity of EON for assassins, I have to point out that fighters actually are the ones who have the option of buying HP/AD items and benefiting from it.\n\nAn example is a game recently where a wukong went full armor/HP with only one damage item - a healing deaths dance. \nHe was able to wreck out entire team because we had a stupid lethality stacking Jhin that was useless against him, while I was obviously a lethality stacking Talon so I also couldn't kill him 1vs1. \nIt didn't help that he got fed off top and we were down items, but still, the point is he knew how to itemize to counter a team that had no attackspeed/crit damage dealers. \nBuilding that way on Talon would be pointless. Which is why you either go all arpen or you go home. You just try to shift to the targets that don't have defense and let your team deal with the tanky ones. \n\n> Seekers while effecient if you build it first, you need to be much more careful with how you spend your mana; \nThe armor of Seekers negates 2 lethality items for the price of one. Losing out on mana early is a small price to pay if you are really in danger of getting snowballed on.\n\nI personally go RoA first to get that stack going ASAP - and that gives me a balanced mix of everything I want to get rolling. \n\nThen a seekers is a good follow up, giving you armor and AP. Then you don't have to finish the zhonyas, but can move on to something else that is more pressing, depending on what you need.","replies":[{"poster":"SOLOQSUPERHERO","date":"2017-02-22T18:35:04.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I am awful at math, but you didn't really show your math here I can't really comment on how accurate your math is, but I think you're missing a key point with a RoA rush and a Maw.\n\nIt seems like you're focusing on the stats it gives and not some of it's other effects and the value those have..\n\nA fully stacked RoA is a great item, a non-fully stacked RoA is not. It also has no cdr when you compare it to morellos. You get more damage upfront right away without having to invest in other items than you do when rushing RoA. (Mages do need CDR. Zhonyas only gives 10%, where is the other 10% coming from? Perhaps abyssal if there's an ap champion on their team, protobelt you could argue maybe, but honestly it's not good if you're not making use of the dash. So now you might be SoL. You could go for a morellos afterwards also, but you're devoting a lot of stats to your mana pool now, which isn't necessarily the most useful thing.\n\nTHE ABOVE ALL SAID ABOUT ROA. It gives you a trade off. It is a good item and I like it very much, but it is a trade off that you can make, but it doesn't always make sense to do. It's pieces are hard to buy - especially if you aren't doing well in lane, it doesn't add a lot of value to you for awhile. \n\nMaw, gives you value right away. You're not going to build warhammer first, you're going to go hex drinker and then sit on it. Hexdrinker is a very powerful item early game, and against a lot of mages can actually really ruin your chances of being able to kill an assassin; most of whom are already hard to hit, that when you do hit you've got that shield which early game, the hexdrinker a lone will likely prevent their death.\n\nEoN while may not have as much damage as a duskblade, it does have a lot of defense associated with it and it's build path is much smoother with less of a trade off. So you're losing what is it, 10 lethality off duskblade for EoN to be able to completely absorb the enemy champions skill or prevent them from using one for 10 seconds. It's a pretty fair deal. \n\nLastly, the item is frankly not just for assassins and fighters, ADCs are building it too. Which makes a huge difference. It's not balanced properly to be that prolific. So necessary or not, it's power is quite high and it's build path is smooth and with little or no adjustment.\n\nHeck, you don't even need to decide if you're going to build it first. Grab a serrated dirk on your first back and decide later. If a mage is going to go RoA instead of seekers or morellos, they're buying completely different items and have to make that decision early on.\n\nIf you want to do math on scaling a lone at the end result, it may come out to it's fine, but there is little reason not to buy EoN right now and it's an extremely powerful item. \n\nto be clear I do not think that mage items are in a bad place, save for maybe there's a little too much of a decision to make over which defensive item you're going to get, I just do not think that there's a trade off to make with regard to edge of night. Maw, I think has one. You deal less damage with it, but you get a huge impact very quickly in terms of your survivability and it can absolutely change the lane in your favor.\n\nAnd interms of AD/MR items, there are quit a few very different and very useful items that exist.","replies":[{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2017-02-23T22:44:06.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MortonSaltBoy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7JlsX7tQ,comment-id=00050000000000000001000000000000000100000000000000000003,timestamp=2017-02-23T17:00:10.255+0000)\n>\n>  You can look at numbers all you want in posts, but you can&#x27;t compare apples (AD Itemization) and oranges (AP itemization) in terms of practicality, build path and choices. It doesn&#x27;t work.\n\nI am not the one who started comparing itemization.\nYou're the one who started claiming that it's unfair to put both AD/lethality and magic defense on a single item. \nAnd in just about every lethality thread you have ignorant people whining about how unfair it is that assassins have offensive options with magic defense on it.\n\nI addressed that by pointing out how itemization really works in this game - Mages are the ones who truly have the defensive and mpen itemization advantage against assassins. \n\nSo much so, that without the previous arpen maw or the new lethality edge of night assassins would get dumped on by everything in the game (as long as they itemized properly) but the ADC - because ADC's are the only class in the game that have no real offensive/defensive item options. Lifesteal is the only thing they have going for them, while assassins only have some MR. Mage AP items get oodles of health, utility, with both armor and MR options. Bruiser options obviously provide ample defense with offense, but they aren't viable items for assassins and ADCs to build, otherwise they cease to be able to assassinate or carry with AD (they just become a weak bruiser). \n\nAssassins have literally no other offensive/defensive options that are viable if they don't have one with arpen/AD on it, because they have no choice but to build arpen to function; whereas mages are full of viable offensive/defensive options - Allowing mages to easily deal true damage against an assassin while gaining a net defensive advantage against even a full lethality stacking assassin.\nAbout the only item that is even semi-viable on an assassin is Maw, but you cannot afford to prioritize it before your other arpen items if you want to remain relevant as an assassin. \n\n\n\n\n> Riot is nerfing the item. Not necessarily my HUMBLE suggestion but the point is the item in its current state is too strong and needs adjustments. The active is extremely powerful, and it&#x27;s meant to be so; it doesn&#x27;t mean it was well executed.\n\n\nI can agree that the cooldown could use some adjustments. I have no problem with there being bigger windows of downtime. And that's what they are talking about doing.\n\nBut anyone who suggests we need more than that does not understand assassin vs mage itemization or proper balance. It is utterly unecessary to nerf it's damage or lethality, especially since it has less MR than Maw did before it. You got 10 less MR for 10 more damage. \nBoth have a passive geared towards giving you burst survivability against AP users.\n\n>There's clearly an issue with the item and clearly an issue with Lethality builders as a whole which Riot is attempting to address.\n\nThat part is the biggest lie being bandied about on this forum. Mathematically it can be proven completely false. \nLethality builds are no more powerful than flat arpen builds were before them. An extra 10 arpen at level 18 only accomplished the goal of helping arpen to not fall off as hard late game as it use to, but that by itself is not what is causing people so much grief.   \n\nIn fact, when you talk to these lethality whiners, the only thing they are really complaining about is EoN specifically. And as far as EoN goes, the only thing they are really complaining about is the spellshield.\n\nYou could stack the old arpen with cleaver and dominiks too. People just weren't doing it as much. \nNow with the nerfs to the later two, lethality is completely fine. \n\nThe \"problem\" of ADC's going lethality is also vastly overstated, and not really a problem at all. Only 3 out of the top 15 most played ADCs are going lethality, and the top winrates show that there's an equal mix of attack speed and lethality users. \n\nThere's also, conceptually and balance wise, nothing at all wrong with an ADC choosing to become a burst AD caster mage - because they cease to really truly be an ADC at that point. You can't carry with your attack damage if you can't kill tanks. A full lethality build cannot kill a bruiser/tank before being taken down by them. You need attack speed to deal with tanks or your team will get completely bulled over by bruisers/tanks in every teamfight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2017-02-23T16:00:11.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MortonSaltBoy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7JlsX7tQ,comment-id=00050000000000000001000000000000000100000000000000000001,timestamp=2017-02-23T14:42:06.365+0000)\n>\n> I think you&#x27;re really missing the point, which is EoN has far too much power on it to be as effective of a buy as it is. \n\nNo, you've missed the point I made: Which is that the old Maw was just as powerful as EoN.

They are talking about doing as something as minor as increasing the cooldown on the active. \nThat would be a reasonable change, because the old Maw did have a long cooldown on it's active.\n\nWhat would not be a warranted change is reducing the stats on EoN in terms of damage or magic resist, because at that point you are making the item worse than the old Maw.\n\nReplacing Maw with EoN was suppose to be a buff to assassin viability, not a nerf.\n\n\n> There&#x27;s not a meaningful trade off to purchasing it, \n\nYou failed to understand anything I said earlier: Maw was in the same boat. There was no \"trade off\" at all for an assassin purchasing it. They needed it for the flat arpen and damage regardless, so it's build order depended on how bad the magic threat was. \n\nThe old ghostblade and duskblade were still better arpen items to build first if you wanted more damage, and you weren't worried about oppressive magic damage.\n\n>the numbers aren&#x27;t the same because you have to factor in fundamental differences that I don&#x27;t believe you are such as an auto attack from an AD champion does a lot of damage vs. an AP.\n\nLargely irrelevant as far as AD caster mages go. You don't seem to understand their playstyle or limitations.\nA melee assassin doesn't want to stick around long enough to auto because they will likely die without accomplishing much, because only a small percentage of their total damage output comes from auto attacks and they have no attack speed boosts and little or no added defense to stay in close combat for extended periods of time without dying. \n\nA ranged AD caster mage (an ADC going full lethality), is equally gimped in their ability to deal auto attack damage because they have no attack speed or crit. That's why they are completely useless against bruisers or tanky mages. Like ranged mages, they are all about poke and bursting down any squishy that gets too close. \n\n\n> And how much out of the way high health items can force a mage from an optimal build path.\n\nI provided the math already, go look at it. \nThe answer: Barely any.\n\nIt's absolutely crippling to a lethality assassin because you can easily survive their burst but they can't survive yours. \n\nOn top of that:\nOther tools that come with those items like slows, sustain, and dash help you only to battle on your terms, and stasis is the get out of jail free card as long as you have a teammate nearby who can get them off you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOLOQSUPERHERO","date":"2017-02-23T14:42:06.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're really missing the point, which is EoN has far too much power on it to be as effective of a buy as it is.

If you wait until your fifth item for Maw, then you've already gone most of the game without it and now you're just trying to survive longer to get your burst in.\nIf they build armor and/or health you will have to itemize a dominiks before maw, if you want to keep killing stuff.\n\nSo Maw is almost never built on pure assassins for a reason - You need arpen to even function. It's not optional. You either are an assassin or you aren't. You really don't have the option of going bruiser because your kit doesn't compliment that playstyle. \n\n\n\n> A fully stacked RoA is a great item, a non-fully stacked RoA is not. \n\nIt's still good, you have a nice chunk or health and AP. Just as good as a protobelt. You are underestimating the value of health. In 10 minutes ROA becomes equal to a top tier AP and health defense item.\n\n>It also has no cdr when you compare it to morellos. \n\nFew problems with that statement:\n\n1. In the example I gave in my thread (the one I linked), you don't need to take all the HP/AP items to be survivable. You can still get a morellos if you want. And if you're doing well enough that you don't need as much defense, you can swap out a rylais for a rabadons or ludens on top of a morellos. It all depends on how well you're doing. Really good players can go full glass cannon and just evade, outposition, or outplay the assassin. Weaker players, or players with weaker teammates, need more defense to stay alive. \n\n2. You have to make a tradeoff somewhere if you want maximum defense. You can't be the equivalent of a bruiser burst mage and not have to give up something, even if it's CDR. You can still easily get 20 CDR, or 30 CDR if you want to take lucidity boots. So you're not in that difficult a position. It comes down to what is more a priority for you, damage, defense, or CDR. The point is you *can* itemize for all three quite easily on a mage, it's just a matter of how much you want to emphasize one over the other based on your champion and your current performance level (if you are snowballing, just go strait damage. If you aren't, and anticipate trouble later, go hybrid defense/AP).\n\n3. Not everyone needs early CDR. Some players are just more skilled about conserving their spells to use at the right moments, and not missing. Some champions are ok without it.\n \n> Maw, gives you value right away. You&#x27;re not going to build warhammer first, you&#x27;re going to go hex drinker and then sit on it. Hexdrinker is a very powerful item early game, and against a lot of mages can actually really ruin your chances of being able to kill an assassin; most of whom are already hard to hit, that when you do hit you&#x27;ve got that shield which early game, the hexdrinker a lone will likely prevent their death.\n\nI've never found hex to be worth giving up lethality for when playing a pure assassin, because you are made or broke by your ability to burst targets down. You don't *want* to stick around to auto attack them thanks to Maw. You don't do much damage that way, and all your abilities are unlikely to come back off cooldown before the fight is over. \n\n\n> EoN while may not have as much damage as a duskblade, it does have a lot of defense associated with it and it&#x27;s build path is much smoother with less of a trade off.\n\nYou missed a critical point: Edge is no different than Maw was before it. Maw use to have equivalent damage, armor pen, and magic resist.\nNobody whined about it.\n\nThe reason nobody whined about it is because the magic resist is not what they really care about - The active spellshield is what they are really raging against.\n\n\n> So you&#x27;re losing what is it, 10 lethality off duskblade for EoN to be able to completely absorb the enemy champions skill or prevent them from using one for 10 seconds. It&#x27;s a pretty fair deal. \n\nNo, you are forgetting the passive on duskblade to do extra burst damage. And it's passive which disables wards. Duskblade is the better roaming assassin pick if you aren't getting dumped on by magic users in lane.\n\nGhostblade is also currently picked first on almost every champion for a reason: you get 5 more lethality - and movespeed is generally more useful for offense and defense than the edge spellshield is. Unless, again, you happen to be getting dumped on by a magic user in lane.\n\nI'll take either of those two before edge if I can. I don't know if, after the ghostblade nerfs, I will buy it first. It might become either a second or third buy depending on what the enemy's magic threat is.\n\n> Lastly, the item is frankly not just for assassins and fighters, ADCs are building it too. Which makes a huge difference. It&#x27;s not balanced properly to be that prolific. So necessary or not, it&#x27;s power is quite high and it&#x27;s build path is smooth and with little or no adjustment.\n\nNo, it actually doesn't matter as far as itemization goes - Because an ADC doesn't have the capability to build HP or armor defense either. They are in the same boat as an assassin. The mages they are up against have more ways of mitigating the damage a lethality ADC dishes out than the ADC has of mitigating incoming damage from the mage. \n\nIn fact, a lethality stacking ADC is basically little more than an AD ability caster mage. That's why they suck against bruisers and tanks, or even heavily defense itemized mages. \n\nEdge is about the only item they've got to do it with. If they were to build schim or maw they would be severely gimping thier ability to function as an ADC, because although an assassin might get away with not building a dominiks and just going for the squishies - you as the ADC had better be building a dominiks because your job is to hit everyone in a teamfight. \n\n> to be clear I do not think that mage items are in a bad place, save for maybe there&#x27;s a little too much of a decision to make over which defensive item you&#x27;re going to get, I just do not think that there&#x27;s a trade off to make with regard to edge of night. Maw, I think has one. You deal less damage with it, but you get a huge impact very quickly in terms of your survivability and it can absolutely change the lane in your favor.\n\nThe old maw didn't have any downside to it compared with edge of night. They are basically the same in terms of power level, just different in how they approach it.\n\nI suspect the only reason they didn't remove Maw outright to replace it with Edge, is because they want bruiserish AD's who are more defense oriented (and aren't building lethality) to have an option more suited to them. No ADC or Assassin really benefits from building Maw without the arpen. You're better off building more lethality so you can actually kill the mage in question. \n\n> And interms of AD/MR items, there are quit a few very different and very useful items that exist.\n\nThere are three, and only one of which you'll ever see assassins or ADCs building. Maw isn't worthwhile to prioritize when you have edge of night and Maw gives no arpen.\nYou'd also have to be even more stupid to build a schimitar on an assassin/ADC unless you're dealing with a 100% magic damage team. \n\nSkipping a lethality item to build hex is possible, but almost nobody does it because it doesn't pay off to skip lethality. You're better off getting edge and then trying to outplay your opponent. \n \nIf anything you should be happy that you're dealing with edge of night instead of Maw as the old arpen item - because Maw is a much stronger defensive item in a dive, but on a longer cooldown. Maw also can't be baited out with a weak spell like Edge, or evaded until it's cooldown is up.  Because you have to unload your burst to even activate Maw, and the assassin is probably already in your face if you're unloading your burst on them. \n\n\n\n","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ktorywygrywa","date":"2017-02-16T19:18:23.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"maybe add a slow after it pops like blitz ability","replies":[{"poster":"SOLOQSUPERHERO","date":"2017-02-16T19:38:03.718+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"That would make it really bad I think.","replies":[{"poster":"Mizuki Zahra","date":"2017-02-16T19:48:59.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya  a slow isn't the best idea but they should rework it a little. have you played with eon since i don't see any recent games @ktorywygrywa","replies":[{"poster":"ktorywygrywa","date":"2017-02-16T19:51:21.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"listen here ass face ur bronze shit so ur opinion doesn't matter 200 + games 3 years and still in the shithole lol {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"TwinkiePro","date":"2017-02-16T22:12:52.351+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was uncalled for.
