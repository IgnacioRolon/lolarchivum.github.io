An ultimate Riot previously tested with Fiora and decided, correctly at the time, it was toxic and unfair.\r\n\r\nHis ultimate makes ganking him impossible. He's solo lane and is guaranteed to be ahead of the jungle in level because of all the nerfs dealt to the jungle over the years. And so when that jungle shows up to make an attempt against Mordekaiser, Morde basically has his pick of the litter on which enemy to take out first. He ensurees that his solo lane remains just that, a solo lane and it is pure toxic bullshit.\r\n\r\nBoth being ulted by him and watching an ally being ulted by him is painful to watch because there is no helping that ally. There is no helping top lane against Mordekaiser.\r\n\r\nNo lane should have this kind of immunity against ganks.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-06-14T01:25:02.552+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats your point?

Ganking a fed juggernaut (or even unfed if you're a weak duelist) isn't always the answer.  Juggernauts are slow at maneuvering, so you can better control the map with mobility and global utility without necessarily facing the juggernaut threat head-on.  If your ally is repeatedly playing into the juggernaut's strengths then that's rough but you can't always help directly.  You can group up with the others to take objectives around the map or rotate as a team to shutdown the fed juggernaut.

That is exactly true. And im glad Morde functions like this, because now toplaners have an actual counter to her bitch ass.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2019-06-14T01:35:45.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Pretty much this.
