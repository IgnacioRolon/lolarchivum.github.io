Use Platinum 3 and higher across all servers so the sample size is large enough. \n\nThey have made win rate adjustments enough to know that 5ms is usually between 1.5 and 2.5% win rate change or -15% ult CD can change a champion's win rate 1-2%.

Not only does League have a very large roster of champions, the game itself runs on a design philosophy that aims not to make any champion counter another too hard (or at least claims not to). Therefore, the only cases where a champion's fluctuation in play rate and power would be enough to majorly affect that of another, would be in an environment where the latter champion would have a disproportionately high frequency of play. This is quite possibly an issue in competitive play, where only a fraction of the total roster is typically used, and where some picks are far more popular than others, but I feel it is unlikely to be anywhere near as much of a feature in standard play, bar perhaps some exceptions, namely in bot lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RoberttheRobber","date":"2018-05-27T00:11:53.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If Riot nerfs most of the champions that counter a certain champion, then that champion will have a better chance of winning there lane, thus a better chance of winning the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyquiem","date":"2018-05-27T02:32:24.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Win rate never mattered.
