Ahri's is as well and people call her a assassin when her assassinations are no where near as strong as they once where.\n\nAlso my debatable was more towards the him destroying tanks, When I have to jungle I enjoy taking Rammus into him, build thornmail and a Titanic Hydra (Laugh all you want) and I've yet to lose a 1v1 to a Yas with that combo.
