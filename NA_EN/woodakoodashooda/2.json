I wonder if it is legit):\n\n\n_When you get matchmade, it's based on your MMR and the system will match you with others of a similar number so both teams can have a 50-+1% chance of victory. While this does not occur as often as we would all like, the difference in skill level is as minimal as possible, as this system will always aim towards matching two teams with a very small skill gap difference._\n\n_Even in the case above, the system will try to be as fair as possible an match you with others of a similar determined skill._\n\n_You can also read more about that here(\\*\\) and also this article(\\**\\) provides a lot of really good details. As mentioned in the second article linked, the system will not give you weaker teammates and stronger enemies._\n\n ( \\*\\): https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide\n(\\**\\): https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/2018/02/dev-matchmaking-real-talk/","replies":[{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2019-05-30T12:34:41.035+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because everyone knows Riot is known for their honesty.\n#sarcasm","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-30T07:03:12.185+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"That can happen with coin flips, too.","replies":[{"poster":"Jonesybones","date":"2019-05-30T07:15:44.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Except coin flips don't happen until d1-d2","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nadeok√≠","date":"2019-06-01T04:11:43.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you win 50% of your games the  you are basically a non factor in all of your games.\nTry to play in a way that influences your games outcome more.
