It grants mobility to immobile ranged champions that already poke down melee champions in lane. And it has an extremely low CD. It literally grants an extra ability with massive passive stats to any mage who buys it. And, of course, they WILL buy it. It&#039;s become a must have item for most mages anymore, warping the game as a result.","replies":[{"poster":"TheCaligrapher","date":"2016-10-16T02:32:05.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.Its only used for aggressive mages {{champion:1}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:68}} who need a gap closer.\n2.There are very few match ups with a mage into a fighter (Yes I know kennen pisses you of playing Darius or something)\n3.Stats are low than others as well as scaling\n4.It's only a  200ish unit dash that can't go over terrain","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-10-15T21:42:23.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"stop complaining about it and start using it.\n\nIts not good on everyone.
