He seems to have the shaco affect going on for me. Godly on the enemy team, useless on mine. :/ in some ways, he's honestly a worse blitz. I dont mean like they have a similar kit. I mean they end up kind of falling into the same hole of unless you get ahead and are really good, they will be useless because they're only really good at one thing and have limited tools to actually apply utility and peel for their carries. The main difference is that at least if the blitz is garbage and cant land hooks(except on the fed bruiser) he can be at least tanky. Not pyke. \n\nI also wish that, for the love of god, they'd take some of his safety away. Like, whatever, it's perfectly reasonable for him, as a support, to be able to 1v1 me as the ADC at every stage of the game(its not like ADC is capable of beating anyone or anything at any point of the game anyway so what's one more person) but at least make it so that when he does finally fuck it up by missing his engage, missing his ult, or what have you, he is appropriately punishable by me and my team. Late game he can literally screw every part of his flank up as an assassin and then just get to quickly slip away invisible, only to come back five seconds later at full health to try it again. He is the absolute least punishing assassin in the game, which is *bad* since he's also the assassin with the most CC and a resetting execute ult. Take some of his passive healing away late game, ffs. I'm not asking for nerfs on his damage; just on the late game healing. It's fine and acceptable in lane; he's a squishy melee support with limited means of sustain beyond his passive and potions. But after laning phase, he should *not* be getting away after a flubbed engage scott free to heal back up to full and try again. He is an Assassin.

Which sort of negates the \"he's making you look bad\" angle, doesn't it? Everyone knows that Pyke is a ks machine, so it shouldn't surprise anyone when that happens. As long as you are contributing to the kills and you win, that *should* be the overall goal in a team game anyway, right?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think you're right. Part of the marksmen fantasy is to be that clean-up crew that survives the initial engage and proceeds to clean up on the remaining enemies. Assassins, generally, kind of negate some of that fantasy, and putting one into the support role is sure to affect that aspect of the game. But, again, it's more about the assassin/marksman relationship than it is about Pyke, specifically. Anyone can ks, and people that do more damage are, of course, more likely to do so. Yi and Katarina are just as bad, I imagine, as they are also champs with high damage and resets on kill.\n\nNow, I'd be *more* concerned about what he's doing to the grading system with regards to kills/assists. If you have a Pyke on your team, it may be much more difficult to secure an S or S+.
