Its better at describing whats going on imo) together by providing tools and systems to engage. Again to draw on examples from the boardgame / tabletop arena, raging in those games is drastically reduced because of checks from social pressure. If we could somehow translate that shared responsibility & \"social contract\" to the League community where it is our collective responsibility to call out toxic behavior and not engage, that IMO is a great solution. And to call it out, yes the game would need to support systems to allow community engagement. Thats where things like Honor and using honor ranking in Clash tournaments comes in. I love their inclusion of an honor floor in that feature and hope to see more of that in the future. \n\nAgain to remind, these are all wild guesses :). I in no way have any clue whats happening next. Just my own thoughts. However my thoughts are heavily influenced by my convo time with Zanytomato who gave a GDC talk about this exact thing (link below). Its just the slide deck, and hopefully the youtube video will be up later, but that talk did a great job breaking down disruptive behavior in online games and some design frameworks on how to tackle it. I'd encourage people to read it.\n\nhttps://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025488/Honorable-Intentions-Player-Behavior-Today","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Amasa Delano","date":"2018-06-14T05:43:20.223+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":5,"body":"A strong mentality is one of the most important things you can have.

That may be overly optimistic or sheltered of me I will admit, but I never expect a system to singularly create behavior or societal change. Rather its a combination of my small individual efforts combined with systemic change that creates sustainable positive growth. Its my responsibility as a person to do what ever small or little act I can to fix the root problem, in this case by showing kindness and empathy towards the people I'm playing with & against.\n\nTo bring it to a really personal place, when I was younger one could have argued it was the \"school system\" that caused me to battle depression & suicidal thoughts. However, it was a small group of people (couple teachers and a new friend) who took the responsibility upon themselves to combat the root causes of that depression (in my case loneliness and lack of self worth). It was them, not the system, that helped me stabilize.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying the system can't be changed to make this work easier. That absolutely needs to and is being done (honor, reporting tool, matchmaking, etc). However, recusing yourself from the responsibility of combating the negative symptoms of life that manifest in toxicity by blaming the \"system\" is a bs move to me. \n\nSorry for being so inflamed by this (and taking it to a very personal story), but I feel very strongly about topics like these.

I play to express and build community, and winning is a marker of that but only a marker. Its kinda like how money is a sign of success, but not success itself. So yea creating an environment where players enjoy themselves and have fun is kinda the point. \n\nA great example is Fortnite and PUBG. Both games you enter fully realizing that you have (in an even field) a 1% chance to win, so the goal is to have fun and enjoy the ride with the rewards coming in other formats. I personally love that intent, cause it means that the game isn't zero sum. You don't derive joy purely from the misfortune of others :).","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-06-21T18:51:45.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too bad the game promotes toxicness and unfairity.","replies":[{"poster":"Bazerka","date":"2018-07-12T17:30:56.769+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XXXMurderPenguin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MkNAelF2,comment-id=000100030000000300000002,timestamp=2018-06-21T18:51:45.257+0000)\n>\n> Too bad the game promotes toxicness and unfairity.\n\nWould love to hear in detail what specific systems or parts of the game you think promote these things.

However, I'd encourage you to ask yourself the question \"where do you draw the line to prevent banning bad players?\". \"Feeder\" is a pretty broad term that definitely encompasses players who do intentionally try to ruin the game for others, but I'd hazard a guess is more widely used to insult players who are just outclassed or not as good at the game (I've definitely been called a feeder before, but in those games I've just been outclasses. Never tried to feed on purpose). I 100% disagree with a move that pushes to permanently ban underperforming players just to satisfy the temporary anger of higher performing players in a game. \n\nI bring up this example because, from a data standpoint, \"true feeders\" and \"underperforming players\" are indistinguishable from each other (as far as I know) using current data. CS, kills, deaths, map movements, reports (which are faulty and subject to bias & frustration), even historical win / loss would look similar for both parties. So rather than taking extreme punitive action to ensure the small % of \"true feeders\" are banned by carpet bombing all of these cases, we choose to take a \"long horizon\" approach where time can work its magic and allow report patterns to arise. The downside is that swift and righteous judgement on \"true feeders\" isn't as much of a possibility because the system trends toward forgiving rather than unyielding.
