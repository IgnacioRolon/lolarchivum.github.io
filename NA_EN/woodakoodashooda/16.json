And I have to say that none of them are quite as unnecessarily complicated, dangerously stress-inducing, impractically imbalanced, tedious and repetitive, or overwhelmingly toxic as League.\r\n\r\nThe money I intended to use for skins this holiday season went towards the purchase of other games that I am now enjoying more than I&#039;ve enjoyed league in the past several weeks. Weeks that, in my opinion, were nothing more than the precursor to yet another season of ceaseless aggravation in pursuit of one good time out of 5-10 hours of game play, and at the expense of the enjoyment of other people.\r\n\r\nGoodbye, League.\r\n\r\nP.S. With my head cleared of nostalgic bullshit, I can look back on the history of this game and admit that it was NEVER fun. It was honestly something I started playing at a younger age because I couldn&#039;t afford anything better. I kept on playing even after having the funds for other games because league was something to which I had grown accustomed and I just couldn&#039;t put it behind me for the longest time. But just like I discovered my breaking point with Runescape prior to discovering league, I&#039;ve found that very point with this game.\r\n\r\nAnd just as I never once returned to Runescape after reaching that point, I know for certain I won&#039;t be returning to League. And it has nothing to do with the current state of the game. As previously stated, this game has always been terrible.","replies":[{"poster":"420Dog","date":"2018-12-23T15:31:12.977+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bye i guess? i don't see why kdis post \"goodbyes\" to the boards. no one else cares.
