I think a huge issue with it is how easy it is to obtain for what it provides. It's a first buy for most assassins being only 2900g. it may be more balanced if it was pushed further into the game, as second or possibly even third item. raising its price a little would help with it, don't even care if they buff its damage a bit to compensate.\n\n{{item:3078}} 3733g\n{{item:3074}} 3500g\n{{item:3748}} 3500g\n{{item:3053}} 3200g\n{{item:3156}} 3250g\n\nJust a few examples of other loaded items and their pricing. People don't complain nearly as much about them because they aren't a first buy in lane. I'd propose it be raised to at least 3200, 400g increase would make other lethality items more favorable early for damage, with {{item:3142}} being 2900 and {{item:3814}} being 3000","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-11-13T03:18:30.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if it's funny or sad that I didn't know which item it would be until I clicked through.
