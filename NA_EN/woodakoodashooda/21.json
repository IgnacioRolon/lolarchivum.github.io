If they do the same change they did for {{champion:1}} to them, they would definitely be weaker on Bot while probably having succes Mid (depends how extreme the change is).\n\nAnd I don't know what you mean about Ardent Meta, that was a thing only because the item was busted, not the champions. If Mages were removed from Bot, it would only lead to a increase in Pick Rate for all Utility-based classes (Enchanters, Catchers and Vanguards).\n\nAnd really, only {{champion:63}} {{champion:143}} seem major problems, followed by {{champion:1}} and sometimes this duo {{champion:101}} {{champion:161}} (which is considered troll by many people, but that is a subjective matter).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2019-06-04T20:49:24.348+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arcade Lulu,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PKvpl4Le,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-06-04T20:48:33.229+0000)\n>\n> Because supports aren't supposed to build AD\n> Supports are supposed to mostly  build support items etc\n\nAP items may give some good stats for some supports\nBut AD items just don't really have that","replies":[{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2019-06-05T11:55:00.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree. \n{{item:3071}} 20 percent more spell casting, and the armor reduction benefits everyone on your team, even your AP champs that right click the enemies affected. \n{{item:3161}} 20 percent more spell casting. \n{{item:3078}} 20 percent more spell casting. \n{{item:3153}} slowing for 3 seconds on a 60 second cooldown. \n{{item:3508}} 20 percent more spell casting, plus mana restoration. \n{{item:3095}} slowing for 1.5 seconds, cooldown scaling with attacking and moving. \n{{item:3004}} more mana allowing for longer times away from base for grueling engagements/journeys. \n\nNone of these items give AD/AP:\n{{item:3190}} shields for potentially the entire allied team scaling with user's maximum HP.\n{{item:3109}} 10 percent more spell casting, user-damage-agnostic lifestealing effect as well as damage mitigation for the designated parnter(partner switch is on 90 second cooldown).\n{{item:3025}} 20 percent more spell casting, more mana allowing for longer times away from base for grueling engagements/journeys, and a slowing zone with 0.5 second longer duration than cooldown.\n{{item:3110}} 20 percent more spell casting, more mana allowing for longer times away from base for grueling engagements/journeys, and also the aura which should be buffed.\n{{item:3001}} 10 percent more spell casting, more mana allowing for longer times away from base for grueling engagements/journeys, and also more magic damage for entire team against enemy champions near the user.\n{{item:3222}} 10 percent more spell casting, more mana allowing for longer times away from base for grueling engagements/journeys, and also more shielding power and a way to purge disables on one allied champion and granting movement speed bonus for 2 seconds on a 120 second cooldown.\n{{item:3305}} 10 percent more spell casting, more mana allowing for longer times away from base for grueling engagements/journeys, and more vision for the team.\n{{item:3050}} 10 percent more spell casting, more mana allowing for longer times away from base for grueling engagements/journeys, and an effect with adjustable cooldown granting increased power to your designated partner's basic attacks both slowing for 2/3 seconds and adding on 30 percent extra damage(although magic instead of physical) for but a moment.\n{{item:3107}} 10 percent more spell casting, more mana allowing for longer times away from base for grueling engagements/journeys, and also more shielding power and a 2.5 second delayed-area-denial effect on a 120 second cooldown.\n\nHowever, I will comment that many of these items are granting more mana which is irrelevant to many champions {{champion:64}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:238}} which discourages players from picking some otherwise viable champions for supporting their team since so many of the support items they could buy aren't a great investment for them.

If these are the kind of champions you mean, then I totally agree actually. Mikael's in particular I wish were more useful for Lee Sin, and it would be solid on Riven and Renekton because it would increase their own shielding/healing power if it just gave some other useful stuff. I sometimes see supports buying cost-inefficient items and Zed buying a version of Mikael's like I'm describing would be passable on him, although not recommended, because other manaless champs would be buying it, and he could take the Ravenous Hunter rune, maybe even also Fleet Footwork and Overheal and that kind of thing to justify it.","replies":[{"poster":"ROYALR3IGN","date":"2019-06-05T20:04:20.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those AD items are really expensive and don't have as much utility compared to the traditional support items. \nOne of the few reasons Pyke can get away with going AD is because he's encouraged to take kills which helps him make up the difference in gold gen with his Gold sharing mechanic.

The most commonly played champions bottom are squishy ranged AD scaling carries who generally turn into dangerous threats when fed. Knowing this, there are two different styles used to go with them: \n\n1. Champions who can 'protect' the carry and \n2. Aggressive champions who can help snowball the carry\n\nMost real supports are given high base damages and numbers on their abilities to compensate for the lack of gold income which they will have. This is paired usually with low scalings to prevent them from being abused in other lanes. In the case of most AD champions, they're designed the complete opposite with low base damages but moderate to very high scalings.\n\nAs for why Riot doesn't make AD scaling supports, AD is cheaper and more effective than both Tank items and Ability Power items currently. This is also not to mention that all auto attacks use Attack Damage. Even if Riot makes a \"balanced\" AD support champion that champion will always be better in a solo lane. \n\nWhen you think about what I said above, basically the champion would need really high base damages (think about Pyke's ultimate) in order to be successful as a Support. Players are always going to take advantage of this in a solo lane since other champions are not designed with the same high base damages. If Riot makes the champion have both low scaling and low base damages, they will be useless and never picked, so there wouldn't be any point in making the champion in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2019-06-05T14:35:49.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very articulate post. 10/10 well said.

At the end of the effect, gain move speed based on how much damage you've mitigated 10% per 300 damage mitigated or something. \n\nThere, we have a crusader or champion or whatever you'd prefer to call it. A kit made in 10 seconds that could, with lots of tweaks, be that of a support champs. Scale all of his damage off AD and scale his utility off a combination of AD and HP _or_ armour. Cool. He would still build full tank, regardless of having AD scalings, maybe a Steraks or Cleaver for the HP shield and additional armour shred. \n\nThe problem with AD supports is that they can go 2 ways only - the Pyke route of being an assassin, in which case they needed to be heavily gated by CD's or mana costs etc etc or else they become too unbalanced against traditional bot lanes. The other route is Leona/Braum/Taric types who have a great kit of engaging and staying in the fight but don't care about damage, they just want to survive. They all have kits that synergize with their autos and spells that empower said autos but none of them build AD items, except trashcans building IBG and Titanic. \n\nAny AD supp would be an assassin or a champ who, while they might scale off AD, don't care because their kit is designed to support others and a Duskblade just doesn't fit that bill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Metal Janna","date":"2019-06-05T16:57:57.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hear Irelia support used to be a thing.

If you have good numbers on abilities and base stats (particularly auto damage) and can consistently make use of them, they'll be overbearing from ahead. So you have to hit something. If you hit numbers, they can feel unsatisfying to play. So that leaves reliability. Skillshots work well for CC, but that's just Nautilus or Leona then. Who are probably magic damage so that they can't build things like Black Cleaver.\n As for autos, reliability pretty much depends on range, gapclosing, and tank stats. Putting aside range for the moment, the ability to close is pretty standard at this point. That leaves tank stats. Which brings us back to hitting numbers, which will probably get balanced around a tradeoff between damage scaling and tankiness.

You would rather your ally die, giving up gold and potentially objectives instead of buy an item that can win you the game?
