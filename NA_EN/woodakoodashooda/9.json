Beforehand, all I did was pubstomp, though I was good at the game, I had never played with a full team of skilled players against a full team of skilled players. It was always one sided before TDA or the throneit mod. Chasing someone uphill is equivalent of chasing someone into a huge bush, that could very likely have another member of their team or multiple members of their team inside the fog of war right up that hill, which won't be known until it's too late. Before, chasing people uphill was no big deal, teams were never coordinated in pubstomps. Same reason people like to have blue trinket to ward bushes before they get too close where a yellow trinket wouldn't do. Just getting close enough for the yellow trinket would spell your demise. Of course there are plenty of examples, I'm just saying, I'm not an idiot just because I don't play much LoL, and skill does in fact translate across mobas. Maybe not the other way around as much, because there's a lot more you have to be aware of in DotA, but skill in DotA definitely translates into LoL.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jarring","date":"2019-06-19T23:37:33.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh this guy is bronze/iron? no wonder. No bro, that's not what it takes to climb ranked. \nAll it takes to get to at least gold is just being relatively decent at the game. Learn the optimal builds, learn your champion, learn the game in general. Don't do stupid noob shit mistakes that I learned over a decade ago. Dodge skill shots, I guarantee you that even in gold they will throw their skill shots in a straight line directly towards your noob asses, and they are easy as shit to dodge if you have half of a brain. Learn how to position yourself to gain opportunities to most effectively land and dodge skillshots(even though you don't even need a skill like this in shit bronze). This is where having all those crazy dashes overloaded champions like Akali and Irelia have come into play, and why it's so easy for skilled players to climb the ladder with them. Learn wave management, get better at CS, ward, and start to pay attention to the minimap as often as possible so that what wards you or your team places actually make a difference, and pay attention to pings so that you can respond to them and act accordingly. this might get you to climb to plat or even diamond. Putting all of this together among other things like team composition, matchups, counters, memorization of all champion cooldowns, etc. will catapult you into master and beyond. It's not that hard, there's not a lot to learn, just playing the game a LOT every day should naturally reward players with all of these skills.
