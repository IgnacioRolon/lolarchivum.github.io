I&#039;d have my friends beat each other up in front of me for my pleasure but since I don&#039;t have any....I guess I&#039;ll hold a tourney. xD I&#039;ma be playing in it to so my fiance is gonna help me manage the games while I&#039;m playing.  But I&#039;ll probably be beat first round so no worries!\n\n**Date: Friday September 30th-Saturday Oct 1st **(Sorry that its so last minute, didn&#039;t really know I&#039;d be doing it either but yeah...)\n\n**Time: 10pm EST/9pm Central/7pm PST-?Hopefully no later than 12am EST** (90% sure I got the times right but if not please correct me)\n\n**Where: The Howling Abyss(Blind Pick, 3 bans)**\n\n**Registration: TODAY Thursday September 29th-Friday September 30th 5pmEST** _**CLOSED-ONLY SUBS!!-**_\n\n_**Rules/Guidelines:**_\n\nAgain, haven&#039;t held a 1v1 so I guess I&#039;ll just go off your guys suggestions/research it for the next couple hours but here are some basic thing. \n\n* Post in this thread with **your IGN and stating that you would like to register for the tourney.** That lets me know who&#039;s wanting to play and who is just commenting/giving suggestions.\n* **Maximum of 30 people can register.** 20 people(including myself) will be in the actual 1v1 tournament while the **last 10 to register will be used as replacements for no shows.**\n* If you do not arrive on time for your match you will be given **15minutes of leeway**. After the fifteen minutes **you forfeit your position in the tourney, no matter where you were** and someone will take your place. I don&#039;t play games when it comes to being on time for tourneys. If you register for it you should take it seriously and make sure your there on time. Shit happens in life and I understand...but the show must go on!\n* **Playful trash talk is fine, attacking(chat, not in game xD)/harassing your opponent isn&#039;t.**  Don&#039;t be the dickwad that someone complains to me about because you kept saying &quot;suck more noob&quot; after they missed 2 spells.  I don&#039;t want to have to kick anyone out of the tourney because they can&#039;t be mature about it. x.x\n* **This will be a Best of 3!** Bans will be **per game** so every game you'll be banning allowing for counterplay and mad strats xD\n* I will be allowing **3 bans per person.**  The bans will be done **in chat PRIOR to the game starting** so both players can do blind pick. \n* ** Win Conditions will be first blood, first turret, or first to 100 cs.** Whatever occurs first. **The winner must screenshot in game with the stats screen(tab) showing so we can confirm that the victory condition was met.** After you finish your best of 3, upload them onto an image sharing site like Imgur and **send me the links through league or discord.**\n* I&#039;m trying to figure out what the program/site that records peoples games so i can have people record the games just in case any discrepancies happen we can review the game.\n* **Most Important thing is try to enjoy yourself and have fun!**\n\n_**Prizes**_\n\n**1st Place: $100 RP\n2nd Place: $50 RP\n3rd Place: $25 RP**\n\nEveryone else:_ Fun experience and knowing you may have cheered someone up_ :D\n\nAlright I&#039;m sure I forgot some stuff but I&#039;ll add it whenever.  Hope to see some people tomorrow c;\n\n_**IMPORTANT UPDATE!!**_\n\nAll participants please be on at 10pmEST for a brief meeting. It would be helpful if the participants would spectate the matches so they can make sure everything is fair for me, but I am expecting everyone to play fair. You don't have to spectate if you don't want though.  \nPlease make sure to add me on League: Miss Wake n Bake \nDiscord is https://discord.gg/Zgxt6 if you want to chill before/during/after but is** NOT** required.\n\nI decided to do 5 matches at a times so here are the groups.\n\n**Group A 10:10pmEST**\n\nA bag of bees _vs_ Kite Azure **WINNER: Kite Azure**\nMG Guardian _vs_ Lord Dusteon **WINNER: MG Guardian**\nNote _vs _ 2nd Chance **WINNER: Note**\nSnF Casualties _vs_ Sohleks **WINNER: SnF Casualties**\nTundra Fizz _vs_ Hero of Ideals **WINNER: Hero of Ideals**\n\n**Group B 11:10pmEST**\n\nMiss Wake n Bake _vs_ Vei **WINNER: Miss Wake n Bake**\nChwy _vs_ Follow the Damn **WINNER: Follow the Damn**\nShynergy _vs_ MG Echo **WINNER: MG Echo**\nAkali is SO Hot _vs_ GlobDaBlob **WINNER: Akali is SO Hot**\nxThaeosx _vs_ Jaymc1130 **WINNER:  jaymc1130**\n\n**Saturday October 1 **\n\n_**Semi Finals 10pmEST**_\n\nNote _vs_  Miss Wake n Bake **WINNER: Note**\nAkali is SO Hot _vs_ Kite Azure **WINNER: KiteAzure**\nMG Guardian _vs_ Follow the Damn **WINNER:Follow the Damn**\nHero of Ideals _vs_ Jaymc1130 **WINNER: Hero of Ideals**\n\n_**Finals 10:50pmEST**_\n\n**1st: Kite Azure\n2nd: FOLLOW THE DAMN\n3rd: Note**\n\nCongratz to the winners, I sent you the gifts cept Note and that's because it won't let me yet ;c  Thanks everyone who participated it was much fun and yall def cheered me up :D \n\n\n","replies":[]}
