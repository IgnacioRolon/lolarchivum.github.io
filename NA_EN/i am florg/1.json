I start Flamespitter and spam it to over 50% heat until buff spawns (Doesn't matter whether it's Krugs or Gromp, I start the side I can get a leash from bot with), then I put a point into W to help mitigate the damage I take from the other camps and then E. \n\nThe key is to get Chilling Smite and then focus on ganking, only farming your jungle when there's no opportunities for ganks. Don't finish your jungle item until you've finished some other AP item (I tend to prefer getting Rylais first for more CC), while it has good stats, the CDR isn't that important for you due to your passive and I think it's better to get items that can help with your ganks or getting through the jungle better.\n\nI also tend to get mobi's early and switch them out for Sorc Shoes once lanning phase ends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NorthernDruid","date":"2015-02-19T02:10:46.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":O Yasuo jungle works!?\n\nWhen is he on rotation next!?! I want this now!\n\nmy favourite is gonna have to be Akali, whom I love in the jungle because dipping in with Trailblazer and smite is basically all you need for sustain, as well as the nifty ganks post-6, and just the feel of sneaking into a lane with my shroud. \n\nI can't quite figure out a good first clear though. I'm running 14/2/14 masteries, with spellvamp quintessences (so I get to start with a bit more than 15% spellvamp and three buiscuits) but while I love the utility mastery setup, I'm not convinced I've found a truly good route yet.\n\nIs starting gromp safe enough as Akali? I usually start krugs, but I wanna try gromp->Wolves->Red to see if that gives me better sucess.","replies":[{"poster":"I Am Florg","date":"2015-02-19T03:20:53.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo jungle does work, but you need to get trailblazer ASAP. I've fiddled with devourer but I think it's best to just go straight for static shiv after your smite upgrade.  His ganks aren't the best but he is a late game monster and a good duelist.\n\nI also use lifesteal runes but I'm not sure if they are needed.
