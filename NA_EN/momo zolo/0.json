I didn&#039;t select it because I do not own it having not been part of LoL when it was given to the beta players. I have been playing games in the new select and it has yet to happen again with any champion I have used so I am guessing it is rare. I linked the link the the replay and if you cannot click it, type this into the command prompt it and it should open it (No clue if you are allowed to open this in case a**hat people link a virus instead of if you cannot do it, look up Zolomenthus in replay.gg and it should be the Rammus game on 1/16/16). I hope this helps you find the bug and have a nice day :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-20T00:31:14.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Zolomenthus -\n\nThanks for the report!
