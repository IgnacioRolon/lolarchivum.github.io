You can max range ulti (walk away from it after cast) and clear waves of baron enhanced super minions in seconds, without ever being in enemy range. Ziggs and Xerath max range skills can still hit of course, but most of which you can avoid, two of these skills are ultimates, and they can't follow up with anything cause they are too far away.

That's ignoring the early penalty of -40 to both armor and magic resist. Further more, summoner spells like ignite and channeling spells like fiddle's life drain remain active and viable when Anivia becomes an egg. (unlike zac and atrox) The cool down is massive as well. If her passive is on cool down for 4 long minutes minutes, does she still qualify as tanky in the interim? \n\nI am glad you could bear the thought of improving her ult. I welcome any change that would make it more reliable.","replies":[{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2015-06-17T09:04:17.520+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mention her ratio's but her base damage is also pretty damn good. Think about it this way because of her passive all defensive items are twice as effective on her. HP counts twice and resists count for twice as much. Meaning that if you compare Anivia to any other mid laner with 1 defensive item; Anivia gets twice the effectiveness on it. When you have the -40 resists it is irrelevant unless you are laning against someone that could kill you with auto attacks well in egg form, like zed. Most of the champions in mid lane you play against can't burst you down twice that early unless they have help. Rebirth is single handedly one of the best passives in the game. Well it is up it makes you hard to kill and a risky target because they have to go through two health bars. Meaning it is unattractive for an enemy to focus you and it is unattractive for an enemy to leave you alone. Hence why a four minute cool down on it is appropriate. As far as things like channels going through and ignite etc; Riot should clean that up for consistency sake but it isn't very damaging to her because most champions that have channels can't get to her and the rest aren't played much. Ignite also tends to not be the thing that kills you in egg form.\n\nHer mana costs are high but each individual skill (except e I suppose which requires another spell to be powerful) is very powerful and can change games. If Riot wanted to see her in competitive play they would probably have to lower mana cost on her ult. However if she were to receive such buffs she would probably have to lose out on damage which I don't like.\n\nHer slow speed on q could probably be sped up but that might push the skill to the over powered side because of its high range and quite large stun radius. Her base movement speed could be increased with little to no harm but this would not make her anymore competitive and is just adding fluff that might have to be removed somewhere else at a later time.\n\nAnivia is unique in the sense that she isn't played much but the majority of people who play her have a very good win ratio and a lot of games on her meaning most of the people that are playing her are mains. I would hate to see her change other then like a couple QoL changes. I feel that a lot of other Anivia players are in a similar boat.\n\nI am not entirely sure what her difficulty rating of 10 has to do with anything. She is a hard champ yes but so what? Gives you more pleasure when you master her.\n\nAdding movement speed and lowering mana costs would make her significantly stronger. With her strong bases and strong ratio's it is hard for me to justify any sort of buff as that significantly increases her damage out put and would probably have to be toned down in the future.\n\nThe moral of the story is that Anivia isn't in a bad spot, she is good in every meta so far. Really the only thing she needs is some clean up on bugs and things as well as a few minor QoL consistency changes. Anything more is likely to put her in the \"my numbers are stupid so therefor I am picked\" camp.","replies":[{"poster":"C1ever Girl","date":"2015-06-17T09:19:29.262+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Anivia is unique in the sense that she isn't played much but the majority of people who play her have a very good win ratio and a lot of games on her meaning most of the people that are playing her are mains.

Personally I find she doesn't yet have a lane opponent she \"can't beat\" in essence, she can safely stay at turret, making dives virtually impossible thanks to passive, stun and wall. Then once you do hit 6, you can waveclear so hard with a short R and a long Q. I can push a lane under turret, and attack the enemy who is under the turret from a safe distance, denying them farm SO much. As long as you watch out for enemy jungler. I often run Boots of swiftness on her because he speed is SO horrible, even with ionion boots and alacrity, I often move slower than most other champs around me.\n\nMost of my failures have come from bad decision making (greed) and dodgy mechanics (I need a new mouse, I often cast spells in the wrong direction or off target :/ ) but the biggest cost of playing Anivia is her need for a team play. On her own, she can wreck almost anyone late game 1v1, as long as you have good timing and accuracy. But in a team fight, it's hard to focus one person, as soon as you weaken them into death range, they back off and a full hp champ comes on you. If you don't have a decent peel (like thresh or maokai) or if your team chases blindly leaving your ulti and passive debuffs, chasing with her is a nightmare. By the time you catch up, half your team is dead. Anivia is primarily defensive, and is very bad at chasing. You need a good peel to defend against a whole team, baron and super minions (and they still won't take your turret), but you need an assassin or global ulti to take them out then they retreat. If your tanks are chasing (nasus or malph, etc), they can get kited and killed before you catch up (if not running swiftness). I often have to flash just to be in the game :/\n\nI say all this because I see her as VERY strong, and very applicable in multiple scenarios. If she got buffs she would dominate. I think slightly higher ms and shorter passive at higher levels sounds great. But you can actually control her mana quite well, and if it was reduced, it's make using her SO MUCH EASIER. If i didn't run 2 mana regen items, then I'd have something like 950-1000 AP or something defensive (like GA which can be a bitch on Anivia lol) and with 2 100% ratio skills, that's over 2K damage with two hits. Not including ulti, and not taking into account the low CD on E which means another 1K damage before the enemy can get around your crystalze or recover from your stun. I tried running only 1 mana item, but I was struggling late game to keep going. I could optimise in a number of ways, but I'm experimenting right now (my match history shows how bad some of my experiments have gone) but it'd only take a small reduction in mana costs to allow me to significantly alter my build and build paths, so yeah, ms sounds good (low just not THAT low) and scaling passive.\n\n\nEdit! No, there is one thing she needs desperately above anything else. Fix that dam Auto attack. I swear, sometimes it does \"less\" damage than what her base stats suggest, on top of the slow cast time and slow travel time. I understand if they want to make her farming harder, but VERY low on hit damage, with Very slow travel speed and VERY slow cast, makes it too ridiculous. Change one of these things, you don't need 3 gates on JUST aa's, they are always gonna be weak, so you can at least make them land reliably. She will never compete against Ori or Lux, but at least let her last hit a caster minion, cause even those are often too much. \nor give her AA's a bonus like her E, so they do more on hit damage if you've frosted the target, it'll still cost a lot of mana early, but at least you stand a chance at a pre-six wave clear, a strong opponent can have more than double your farm in less than 8 minutes, because of her other weaknesses, don't make the little farm that she can get so hard to hit too :( ","replies":[{"poster":"C1ever Girl","date":"2015-06-17T09:42:57.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for this thoughtful response.

I'm not skilled enough to do it, but if you use Crystalize just (and I mean JUST) after an enemy activates a dash, you cancel the dash, even flash though that's often by sheer chance. It can also cancel channels, and displace targets (into turret - enemy, away from turret - stunned ally) though the latter is risky as you may seal their fate if placed even slightly off. You can displace targets INTO your stun, I have launched many predictable Q's so the enemy knows where to walk to aviod it, just to bounce back into it. \n\nBut yeah, other than that, this teamfight queen needs others to follow up to have the \"wombo\" combo. Her combo will usually kill 1 target, while the others are forced to run away with fast diminishing health. Those foolish enough to come at you are slowed by R and killed by the next E. But those that run tend to escape :/ If combined with another champ with a BIG LC$ play, anything from an Orianna to a Yasuo, and that's a very swift ACE","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wezz","date":"2015-06-17T11:18:16.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"THE ONLY\n\nI REPEAT\n\nTHE ONLY THING THAT ANIVIA COULD EVER GET BUFFS IN WITHOUT BECOMING GODMODE IS \n\nQOL BUFFS TO HER W, EITHER MAKING IT ABLE TO BE PLACED DYNAMICALLY LIKE VIKTOR'S E OR RUMBLE'S ULTIMATE\n\nOR MAKING IT DISSAPPEAR ON RECAST\n\nLEAVE MY BIRD ALONE\n\n> [{quoted}](name=M Schumacher,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lz1ZwFuo,comment-id=0013,timestamp=2015-06-17T10:36:04.918+0000)\n>\n> \"muh q is hard to use\"\n> \n> \"muh auto animation makes it hard to cs\"\n> \n> \"muh skillshots\"\n> \n> \"w is hard to use\"\n> \n> \"r is hard to use\"\n> \n> \"wow im so lucky I get fed every game\"\n> \n> \"muh resists in free GA passive\"\n> \n> \"muh double health bars\"\n> \n> \"muh mana costs\"\n> \n> Seriously, Anivia mains are the most delusional freelo abusing lot around.

Not all toggles are passive abilities. Swain has a range amumu and others. The main difference is that it has a cast range. However some champions have channels that don't have cast range (kat). All channels are very specifically similar. You can not channel and do anything else period. Toggles you can do whatever the fuck you want and still have the toggle run. Riot should also probably remove proccing sheen on activating anivia's ult but it is not a channel. You literally can't argue that it is a channel because it doesn't behave like a channel. You can't argue that it is a regular ability because it doesn't behave like a regular ability. It is most like a toggle. their are a few inconsistencies yes but that does not change the fact that it is most like a toggle and therefor should be compared to toggle abilities.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Llanite","date":"2015-06-17T03:15:16.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"She has 2 slow, 1 stun and a wall.
