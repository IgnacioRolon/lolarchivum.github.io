Once a fix was pushed to live, MSI orbs were re-enabled. \n\n* **Client video has unavailable video (5/4, ~3 hours)** An article pushed live in the client linked to a Youtube video with private permissions. Needless to say, no one could watch it until the video was set to public (and the rest of this sentence was copy/pasted back). \n\n**Game Stuff: **\n\n* **One rack of game servers experiencing lag (5/2, ~1 day)** Player reports filter in detailing laggy games. Investigation doesnâ€™t find ISP or other issues that could cause it. Suspected server rack is disabled and pushed into diagnostic mode. After finding no issues, a reboot and test games show no lag, so the rack is pushed back into the pool for live games. Classic case of turning it on and off again, we suppose.\n\n* **One game server failing to respond (5/7, ~13 minutes)** A game server fails to respond to a kill command for maintenance. Engineers directly connect to the problematic server and force end all processes before resuming the maintenance list. \n\n**Player Support Issues:**\n\nA gentle PSA!
