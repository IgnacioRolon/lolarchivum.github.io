I heard voice chat is going to be premise only.  And this is probably to stop VC flame but honestly in most games with VC there little flame in the VC. And that because ppl are less likely to flame when you humanize something. It&rsquo;d be better for the community imo, sure you&rsquo;d have your t1&rsquo;s who&rsquo;d flame but they&rsquo;re going to do that no matter what. In the times where I join a randoms discord I&rsquo;ve never been flames at once even if I&rsquo;m feeding my ass off. This VC could have been great for solo q though, sure we have pings and our key board but you can&rsquo;t convay anything more clear like talking, not to mention you don&rsquo;t have to wait to do something just to type. Overall VC would have been great for solo q and improved the experience by making it more planned and competitive lvl of play. Instead of the team fights and hoping your team are going for the right ppl and calls and such. Please riot take another look at putting it in game at least for ranked. I don&rsquo;t need it for norms and tbh wouldn&rsquo;t have used it there but for ranked it can be a bigger change than most ppl think! Think on it riot.","replies":[{"poster":"afmghost","date":"2018-03-09T04:09:52.888+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Voice chat to me seems like something they should never include, for one simple reason: The community is toxic.\nIf you want to yell, fine.

It's much easier to ignore text than it is to ignore some kid yelling.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-09T00:56:47.707+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"People who want voice can get it via discord, just like they do now.\n\nHaving voice be anything but opt-in would make ranked an even bigger shithole of screaming brat scum than it already is.\n\nNobody wants audio proof that the guy having a meltdown is really a third of their age.","replies":[{"poster":"bumpierbag","date":"2018-03-09T01:04:00.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If ppl rage then mute them, but most ppl are less likely to flame when you humanize the players on the team, and to the discord thing; there are many times where I’d like to work with the team but just don’t want to join the discord it’s a huge difference. A built in VC would be easier to access and quicker. More ppl would be willing to VC if it was in game including myself. Maybe it’s just a mentality thing but there’s be more ppl willing to use comma built in. And to address the age thing, most ppl I see play the game or who I join in their DC are 16+ and when I see a lot of ppl comment about the age gap that means there’s not a huge difference in the ratio of age as you think. Unless you’re like 30 then gl cus everyone is gonna be younger than you.but for the most part I’d say the avg is 16+ (I’m 19) esp if you play at the right times, and like I said, right gamemode, most kids don’t do ranked(at least in my exp.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2018-03-09T00:49:51.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League of legends should not have voice. Its fucking cancer.\n\nIve played plenty of games pretty seriously with voice chat (R6 siege and CS GO are the big ones) and their playerbase is more mature. So it fits the game. But league of legends has a much less mature playerbase that wouldnt handle voice chat well.\n\nAlso the dip shits who use Open mic make me want to kms. In discord. use open mic thats fine. In game. Press to talk. \n\nAnd its gonna be really annoying because im instantly moving that IGV slider to 0.
