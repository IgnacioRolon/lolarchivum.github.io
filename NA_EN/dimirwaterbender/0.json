This is not usually a huge deal, but over the last few days I have had dodge timers as long as 2 hours.  What can I do? I have already tried reinstalling league.","replies":[{"poster":"L0RD AN0N","date":"2016-08-22T04:52:11.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should post a little context for the moderators so they can help you, for example : Computer iOS (Mac, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10). If this issue started happening after a certain update of league, or if you swapped internets or some change that could be related. Even starting to use a program in the background like Skype can cause your computer to crash larger programs that are using the most memory at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"DimirWaterbender","date":"2016-08-22T05:25:03.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the issue may be that my RAM is filling up.  I have 8GB and sometimes its near 7.5+, so that could be the issue.  I have disabled a bunch of startup programs to see if that helps.  I am currently waiting out a 2 hour penalty so I will have to test it tomorrow.","replies":[{"poster":"L0RD AN0N","date":"2016-08-22T05:38:08.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that is the issue then you could just close programs while running league, for example if you're not using skype, shut it off. Around 6/8 skype clients use giant amounts of ram for various reasons, it's odd. For example my sister and I got the same exact computer, prebuilt. I ran skype at 13% of ram and she ran it of 60ish%. Anyways If you open your Task Manager, (crtl+Atl+del, click task manager) The processes have percentages of memory and CPU shown for each program. If you click the word it will sort them by lowest usage to highest or the other way. Try closing out the highest using ones, just make sure to not shut down windows programs that are necessary.    \n\nP.S. Another common memory hog is Google Chrome ( IE, FF, or Safari too) if you keep tabs open, the clients don't dump their memory until you close out of all windows. So try closing out of all the windows, waiting about 20 seconds (It has background programs so you're waiting for them) and then you can open your tabs again. Repeat the steps any time Chrome's memory gets too high.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DimirWaterbender","date":"2016-08-22T05:09:47.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am on windows 10 and have been since its release.  I have always used skype and I have not installed any new programs recently.  I have been having this issue for roughly 2-3 months.

Other than that, if you're still having issues, can you let me know what error messages or specific behavior you see when your client crashes, and where it crashes? Thanks!","replies":[]}]}
