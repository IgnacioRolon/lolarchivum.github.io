Literally unable to play a single game. When it first happened a while ago, I thought maybe it was a bad patch. I went back to playing other games and when I came back the newest patch was out. Updated, same issue. Get to champ select fine but as soon as it tries to transition to a game, it bugsplats me back to the main screen.\r\n\r\nI've submitted a good 20 bugsplat reports over the last 2 months. I've followed all recommendations. I've tried repairing, reverted to previous patch and updated, ensured all windows updates and driver updates are current, even went so far to do a complete uninstall and clean re-install. Nothing. \r\n\r\nStill same issue. Get in fine, get to character select, BAM bugsplat. Anyone got any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"DragnDave","date":"2016-10-08T18:13:51.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've managed to get it to run finally. I just have to play it in windowed mode. If that starts any issues I'll definitely contact but for now I consider windowed mode a victory lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-28T22:52:09.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugsplats are usually caused by hardware or system driver problems, so it's very likely this is what's happening with yours as well. I recommend working through the steps in our [Bugsplat & Crash guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) as a first step in resolving this.\n\nLet me know if this issue persists through those changes.","replies":[{"poster":"DragnDave","date":"2016-09-29T19:49:30.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Worked through that guide over the last 2 weeks with no changes. I've at this point given up on trying anything anymore. Windows is fully updated, all drivers are fully updated. I've run the repair tool and found nothing wrong. I did a clean uninstall and reinstall. The problem stays and hasn't been resolved.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-02T16:47:26.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like we need to investigate further after hopping into some system logs from your PC. If you reach out to our tech team in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), we'll be able to look into this further with you. \n\nI recommend attaching a set of logs using the Hextech Repair Tool you grabbed, it should create an LoL Logs.zip file on the desktop. Let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
