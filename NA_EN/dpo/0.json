The biggest one is swapping over to the other client. Since you're using the Legacy Client currently, I recommend upgrading to the Beta Client to see if it resolves the issue. Don't worry, you'll still be able to access the Legacy Client after upgrading.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/GbgFI\n\nIf you run into further issues after testing that workaround, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Dpo","date":"2017-02-13T07:22:38.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I already was upgraded, i just really dont like the new client at all.
