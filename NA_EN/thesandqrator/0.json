Yet, in most circumstances *it is incredibly telegraphed and to be **expected**, from the pick **alone***, in a vacuum, without items. Never mind **with** items. In most instances, huge amounts of sustain is built into a champion&#039;s kit, and a lot of the time, *champions with heavy sustain **are picked, in part, for their innate, heavy sustain***.\r\n\r\nYou&#039;re not too surprised when **Vladimir** heals for a heck of a lot because he wasn&#039;t burst down before he got off his **Crimson Rush**-empowered **Transfusion**, or his **Hemoplague** expired.\r\nYou&#039;re not too surprised when **Dr. Mundo** careens away on low HP with **Sadism** active, only to come back a few seconds later well above half health.\r\nYou&#039;re a little surprised that **Draven** is healing so goddamned much, but then you realise he&#039;s 21/3 and is skewing your data.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nA point I see rarely raised when **Grievous Wounds** is discussed, is: *it&#039;s unpleasant* when you pick someone who is meant to have survivability *mainly through sustain*, only for that to fold in on itself once you were afflicted with **Grievous Wounds**. Yes, it&#039;s very, very possible to feel absolutely helpless when you just *can&#039;t* seem to make any damage stick, which in the past was solved by a team *making a concentrated effort* to ***fully*** burst down someone with massive sustain. You can&#039;t afford to let all that damage go to waste.\r\n\r\nThis led to an expression of skill, ***from the player playing the sustain champion.*** They had to be able to soak up *enough* damage that they could safely heal off without dying, and be able to get out, to heal up, and come back in for round two. Or three. Teamfights used to actually last a measurable length of time.\r\n\r\nThat can&#039;t happen anywhere near as much as it used to, now. (And not entirely just because of high damage.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBefore, **Grievous Wounds** really only was obtainable from two viable choices, of three:\r\n\r\n{{item:3165}} **Morellonomicon**: *Gated, to be a reward, almost, for **managing** to overcome sustain **enough** to finish the job comparatively easily.*\r\n{{summoner:14}} **Ignite**: *Instant, but gated by a (comparatively) long, **long** downtime.*\r\n{{item:3123}} **Executioner&#039;s Calling**: *Easily applied, just an auto-attack. But, let&#039;s be real. Nobody really remembered, or bothered, to buy this. So much so, it was gone for **almost a full year**.*\r\n\r\nThat changed. With the introduction of a new item (and the re-introduction of one removed).\r\n\r\n{{item:3123}} The re-introduction of the **Executioner&#039;s Calling**.\r\n{{item:3033}} The creation of the **Mortal Reminder**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere was also a subtle change. But a *very, **very** noteworthy one*. **Grievous Wounds** now is applied on **physical damage** from these items. *Not* from an auto-attack hitting. The **Grievous Wounds** received from someone wielding the **Executioner&#039;s Calling** duration was also *doubled* from 1.5 seconds to 3 seconds. The **Mortal Reminder** inflicted it for *five*.\r\n\r\n*Yes*, the healing was reduced by less, and initially *only affected self-healing*, but that changed to affect *all healing*.\r\n\r\nThanks, Obana(na). {{champion:16}} \r\n\r\nIt was now very, *very* easy, to have *a one-hundred percent uptime* on **Grievous Wounds**. Not at the cost of a summoner spell, or investing enough resources to put them on a worrying amount of HP. You just needed to be hit, *once*, by the right person. This is very easily achieved, especially when you consider who the item is mainly targeting. **Marksmen.** Ranged auto-attackers.\r\n\r\n[You can probably understand my confusion when this happened.](https://gyazo.com/23642db427da7790c3359930b430f11b)\r\n[Four of them. Four **Mortal Reminder**s. And a **Morellonomicon**. On the enemy team. In one game.](https://68.media.tumblr.com/2d0ab6fdd60412c9cd4c5e2e527c782e/tumblr_omihjlDV3z1vmg9x3o2_1280.png)\r\n\r\nDespite having become pretty ridiculous, the enemy team didn&#039;t have to invest much time or effort into quite heavily crippling my efficacy. (This is in part due to them ignoring 162 points of armour, approximately 3.2k gold. I, admittedly, should have invested more in raw HP. But that is not the point I wish to discuss.)\r\n\r\nIf our Aatrox, or I, fought with any of them, even the support, our ability to sustain would have been crippled, and it would have been far more risky to fight *anyone* in case a second person, or more, showed up. Almost *any* damage from four of their members would have inflicted, or refreshed, the five-second debuff. Two of our team were almost always on the back foot because of it.\r\n\r\nWhile it was only a single match, it made me realise just how potent the **Mortal Reminder**&#039;s passive was.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n800g for a pretty guaranteed, constant, 40% healing reduction is a steal. For the low, low price of harassing every couple of seconds. This window gets *two-thirds longer* after you build it into an item that&#039;s pretty decent in its own right. It&#039;s not unreasonable to hit someone once every five seconds in a fight.\r\n\r\nA problem that Riot have stated before, is that they ***hate*** binary gameplay.\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve seen {{champion:1}} quite {{champion:13}} a few {{champion:16}} champions {{champion:24}} who have {{champion:131}} been {{champion:80}} lambasted for their all-or-nothing gameplay before.\r\n\r\nAnd that&#039;s what&#039;s wrong with **Grievous Wounds**. You&#039;re screwed by it, or you&#039;re not. There used to be a ramp-up time (getting them to 35% HP for **Morellonomicon** to kick in), or a window where it wasn&#039;t available to them (**Ignite** was on cooldown).\r\n\r\nOne of a few things can be done with **Grievous Wounds** (aimed mostly, but not entirely, towards the **Executioner&#039;s Calling**/**Mortal Reminder**):\r\n\r\n* Reduce the up-time on **Grievous Wounds** from the **Executioner&#039;s Calling**/**Mortal Reminder**.\r\n* Make **Grievous Wounds** only apply as an on-hit effect from the **Executioner&#039;s Calling**/**Mortal Reminder**.\r\n* Reduce the efficiency of the flat healing reduction.\r\n\r\nOr, preferably:\r\n\r\n* Change the mechanic to apply stacking levels of healing reduction, instead of a flat percentage. (It&#039;s **Grievous *Wounds***, after all. Not **Grievous *Wound***.)\r\n\r\nAfter thinking on it for a little time, [I have put together a little spreadsheet with some example numbers and paradigms](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B1tGTz8gFUghUhlvTZIQGZx5DX2grkbVyxkZl-npf38/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\nI believe that the final method would be arguably more fair towards the *sustain champion*, while not eclipsing its usability for the player who purchased it.\r\n(Let&#039;s face it. You forgot that **Varus** applies it using **Hail of Arrows**, and that **Katarina**&#039;s **Death Lotus** also applies it.)\r\nBecause of its ramp-up time, it would eventually reach almost the same, if not better, reduction in healing. This would reward consistent aggression from the players wielding it, yet at the same time rewarding the sustain champions with renewed healing abilities if they are able to play around it enough to allow it to expire. (Think of it as another minigame. We don&#039;t have enough of those yet.)\r\n---\r\nWith Riot taking a look at defensive ability, along with the upcoming Tank Class update, I hope that they realise that there&#039;s more to &quot;*tankiness*&quot; than raw resistances, or mitigation. Oftentimes, sustain is immediately more visible *and appreciable* than resistances.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s hard to see just how much a champion&#039;s resistances affect your incoming damage from moment to moment.\r\nBut it&#039;s very easy to see that they&#039;re going to be a bit more difficult to take down than you may have thought, if their health bar keeps ticking up.\r\n\r\nI really don&#039;t want them to leave that by the wayside.","replies":[{"poster":"togapika","date":"2017-03-11T15:55:12.751+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":1,"body":"I expect {{champion:36}} and {{champion:8}}  to heal, I don't expect {{champion:157}}  to be able to have 1 lifesteal item and heal more then 2-3 people can damage him","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2017-03-11T19:21:22.887+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lifesteal needs rework","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBot666","date":"2017-03-12T00:47:33.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I say it should work more like the name sounds.

All 5 members having grievous wounds was really an appropriate response. \n\nThat was more a failure of team comp than grievous wounds being OP or sustain being not as useful. A big value of sustain is that it forces investment in grievous wounds. You're forcing multiple members of the enemy team to invest in an item to deal with 1 member of your team. It's like how a Malz forces multiple QSS purchases to deal with his ult - it's most effective when the enemy team has a lot of champions that don't want QSS but now need it. That completely goes away when they all want it for other reasons too. \n\nAs for healthiness? It's still there really. You would have been fine as Nasus against any of them 1v1 (or possibly 1v2). It wasn't grievous wounds that stopped you, it simply prevented you from having 1v5 potential. Which you shouldn't have. They can play properly around you and kite you and kill you, and the grievous wounds just means they have to not make a positioning mistake for 10 seconds to kill you and not get killed rather than being flawless for 20 seconds (where a mistake would then lead to you getting even more kills and healing faster and faster relative to the damage being thrown at you). \n\nTo me, this argument is really no different from an all AD team whining that the enemy team has 3 tanks that all stacked huge amounts of armor, and their ADC and APC even bought {{item:3143}} . It's a fault of team comp - armor isn't miraculously OP just because you happen to have an all AD team.","replies":[{"poster":"Alesya369","date":"2017-03-11T15:56:37.059+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> All 5 members having grievous wounds was really an appropriate response. \n\n\nI have seen all 5 members get Mortal Reminders/Morellonomicons (well they would get morellos anyway cuz this broken item just gives too much for its cost to not get it even against 0 sustain team...) against a single enemy sustain champion. That should not work right? They should be punished for obviously investing too much into the same power that does not even stack with itself. Well... they were not because Mortal reminder gives you plenty of AD and armor pen so they loss from stacking the same passive was negligible. \n\n\n> . You're forcing multiple members of the enemy team to invest in an item to deal with 1 member of your team. \n\n\nIt is absolutely false, in fact it is the opposite. ONE ADC with exectuioner's calling/MR is able to deal with whole team made of sustain heavy champions. Execalls passive has no cooldown, no restriction and it allows one person to reliably apply and keep it on multiple enemies through the use of multitarget abilities or even Runnan's Hurricane. Have you seen Twitch with that item? His ult makes his autos pierce enemies while increasing his AA range, if he also has Runnan's hurricane whole your team will be most likely marked with Grievous Wounds as long as he has ult up + 3 seconds. That took only **one** person with **one 800 gold item**.\n\n\nLooking how teams already stack GW items it would make sense \n\n\n> It's like how a Malz forces multiple QSS purchases to deal with his ult\n\n\nMalz's ult has also ton of other counterplay, allies can CC him or you can just avoid him as he has no mobility and R range is merely 700. At worst he will force all your carries to get QSS, that is not an entire team. On top of that QSS counter only **one CC, once every 90 seconds**. QSS will also be useful against other sources of CC. In case of Grievous Wounds from items literally the only existing counterplay is \"run away and wait for GW to wear off\", that is the only case (besides killing the GW item holder #Korean Advice) when GW will stop affecting your teammates.\n\n\nI do not think Nasus is a good example of someone being too weak because of GW. Soraka is hit the worst and after her it would be Aatrox, Swain and other drain tanks. Nasus does not rely so much on his passive lifesteal during actual combat, it is mostly there to sustain him in lane.\n\n\n> To me, this argument is really no different from an all AD team whining that the enemy team has 3 tanks that all stacked huge amounts of armor\n\n\nThere is armor penetration, there is no \"GW reduction\" stat. Full AD team has much higher chance of winning than full sustain team, they have LW/LDR and cleavers, sustainers have **nothing**. And stacking armor costs lots of money, GW is a single time investment of 800 or 0 if you have morellonomicon.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2017-03-11T23:35:51.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sustain champs actually have Spirit Visage, but I completely agree.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperPewPew","date":"2017-03-12T05:03:41.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And Spirit Visage on that case would only increase Nasus's Lifesteal multiplicatively. - It doesn't increase the actual healing done by the attack by 25% - Which would increase his lifesteal to 37.5% (Ignoring if there is life steal present from runes).

You're going to need to send 1 or 2 people to deal with him (if you send more his team will get too much in return). You need to be able to be flexible with who you send. So having a large number of people with GW is good for that purpose. \n\nYou're correct that one person can buy GW and deal with a whole team - I understand that we're hitting different points here. What I'm trying to say is that if the ADC builds Executioners and is the only source of wounds, then fights are pretty linear (you get your assassin to dive him and blow him up before you die and you win the fight - if he can apply GW on you you lose the fight). It makes the person providing GW a target. Maybe not as much for a Nasus, but a Swain or Vlad will likely ask for their team to keep the GW off of them. Given that \"ideal targets\" (enemy carries) are the ones most likely to build GW anyways, it's really not even encouraging suboptimal gameplay either. Dive the ADC regardless of what he has, but definitely dive the ADC with GW when you have sustain on your team. \n\nA 5 man grievous wounds team should be sacrificing tankiness. The enemy Sion building it was just silliness (I'd guess he bought it towards the end after a won teamfight or something because he realized everyone had it). In general the team's front line wouldn't purchase it. Having a team without any true front line function is just part of how this game has evolved (i.e. that players prefer carry champions so much, Riot has made it viable to not have a front line / have a damage oriented front line).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Salron","date":"2017-03-11T15:18:45.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You heard it first here folks\nHaving large amounts of healing on your team is a \"failure of team comp\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tattersall","date":"2017-03-11T14:59:04.102+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://media.moddb.com/images/mods/1/19/18365/Grievoussoru.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Clementine","date":"2017-03-11T19:16:00.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Morello's gives too many stats for too low of a price imo","replies":[{"poster":"INoble KnightI","date":"2017-03-11T22:24:04.253+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's also the only decent item for mages cause it was redesigned to be that way.","replies":[{"poster":"Alesya369","date":"2017-03-12T14:55:52.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No mage needs a Grievous Wounds passive **every single game** though...","replies":[{"poster":"INoble KnightI","date":"2017-03-12T16:00:59.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I didn't mean to imply that was needed.

Painting a big target on my head as I take a look at DotA 2, no lifesteal granted by items can stack with other lifesteal.\nThere is one single exception: an aura that provides lifesteal (and less of it if they're ranged).\n\nOn the other hand, people with innate lifesteal in their kit, aren't limited by it, their passive lifesteal *fully* stacks with one that they purchase. But even they can only benefit from the lifesteal of one item in there pocket.\n\nIn League, there are 10 items that provide lifesteal/sustain of a sort. (14 if you count the jungle items.)\nAnd the sustain each provides stacks with the other. Aside from a couple unique passives (Death's Dance, Gunblade, Bloodthirster).\nI'm sure we can all remember several examples of *nearly, but not quite* killing their ADC/Flora/Tryndamere but you just couldn't because they had Blade of the Ruined King/Ravenous Hydra and/or Bloodthirster.\n(This is also in part, due to critical strikes multiplying the damage they have done, and as a result, the healing they receive.\n\nIt can also lead to silly things like an effectively-130%-lifesteal build for Nasus that I did one time.

The fact healing ever allowed a champion to do so regardless of player skill only proves that measures needed taken against healing.\n\nWish removing Grievous Wounds was a mechanic that was, admittedly, a bit of a mistake. They had removed Summoner Heal's ability to remove Grievous Wounds, well, well before that was even introduced.\n\nAnd while Grievous Wounds does reduce less than it used to, it's still incredibly binary. You're either healing at 60% or 100%, there's no in-between. That is the issue that I have with it. That it's all-or-maybe-about-half. I'm not arguing that combat healing isn't strong, I'm arguing that the gating mechanism for it is, in part, flawed, which has led to healing being seen as a nigh-toxic mechanic.\n\nAn investment in Grievous Wounds could only be an investment that could be better spent elsewhere if you were a Marksman (or otherwise physical-damage-based champion) purchasing  the Mortal Reminder instead of  Lord Dominik's Regards. And even then, you would only buy it in a situation where the healing reduction would benefit your team more than your potential increased damage output.\n\nThe  Morellonomicon is an incredibly efficient and effective item even without accounting for Grievous Wounds. There was a period of time where it was remarkably effective to purchase two of them. I believe that this was before the cooldown reduction was tagged as Unique. People buy it even when the Grievous Wounds aren't needed in the slightest.\nHeck, going by the cost analysis on the wiki page, and taken with a grain of salt, of course, it's still gold efficient to buy two, even if you don't get the full amount of the cooldown reduction.\n\nAnd I disagree about your last point, \"No single champion in the game should survive more than 5 seconds against a group attack\". If executed absolutely perfectly by everyone, with the right amount of crowd control, yes. But we're human. We're not perfect.\n\nThere are several champions who are, as part of their normal gameplay, able to survive in excess of that:\n\n{{champion:12}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:154}}\n\nSeveral more used to be able to if they built tanky enough. Special mention to old hats:\n\n{{champion:245}}  His tank build, which I believe most of us can agree, was disgusting.\n{{champion:121}}  50% damage reduction for evolving his ult, thankfully that was quickly reverted.\n\nNotice that several, but not all of them, could be classed as having high sustain. Yet they all can get pretty damn tanky, and be a chore to take down, even later on in the game. And that's in the current state of the game, never mind the World of Tanks™ from a couple years ago.\n\nDo measures need to be taken against tankiness as well, since it allows champions to survive for long lengths of time without necessarily correlating with player skill?\nOr is it just healing that needs to be ground down, because they're visibly undoing the efforts you've put in to reversing the damage dealt after you have dealt it, instead of resisting it in the first place, reducing the damage you do to them?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"notawinner","date":"2017-03-11T12:56:59.024+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well thought out, fair points made all around.
