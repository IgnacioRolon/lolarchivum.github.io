When I tried to search him though he never showed up in my champ roster and I couldn't find him, and im sure that I unlocked him. Not sure if a bug or not but help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-28T01:59:18.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see where you did get that Hecarim champ shard early on in Nov, but you didn't actually unlock him.
