So the game i played in i didn't play well, kinda fed, kinda got camped, just a bad game everyone gets one. (I wish i didn't copy over my chat log so i had it) but from what i remember looking at, it wasn't even that toxic. I think i only cursed 2 times that i remember from the log maybe more? I said \"She is my bitch\" in reference to an opposing player saying the new syndra skin is his Waifu, the next was a response to another opposing player saying \"Are any of you going to see the new movie IT\" and my response was \"nah fuck clowns.\" Now there was some bickering between me and their mid laner, who kept calling me bad and what not, but (from what i remember of the chat logs) i never said anything truthfully toxic besides something along the lines, \"you aren't much better than me\" and \"You are in gold 2 and i'm 2 divisions above you\" or something like that. \r\n\r\nNow i've been toxic before and i wouldn't be so upset if this was one of those games where my teammate fed and i was in promos or something like that, however i feel as this game that the punishment was based off of wasn't punishment worthy. For example, the zed added me prior to the game to continue flaming me and telling me i was shit and to grow up and all that stuff, i would paste it but he blocked me and i can't look at the past chats. Another example is in one of my games last night a player was telling another play to kill himself, pretty sure that person got 3 reports and unless you don't get \"a player you reported as been punished\" notifications anymore that person didn't get punished for flaming and telling someone to kill themselves.\r\n\r\nCan anyone clarify this for me?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-08T01:13:19.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't speak for everyone, but it doesn't really look like anything that was said in that game was too terrible tbh. With that being said, I was only looking at your comments, and if the other players took offense to what was said, they might have reported you for it. I can't directly lift these types of punishments, but if you'd like to open this discussion further you're welcome to reach out to our player behavior team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"Dêâth","date":"2017-09-08T02:26:22.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for responding. That's what I was thinking. I think I submitted one, I'm just frustrated 1.

I'd recommend reposting there.\n\nSecond, nobody can help you unless you post your chat logs for us to help identify where you crossed the line.","replies":[{"poster":"Dêâth","date":"2017-09-08T00:01:38.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there anywhere i can re-find them?","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-08T00:02:17.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should get them every time you log into the client if nothing's changed on that.","replies":[{"poster":"Dêâth","date":"2017-09-08T04:08:32.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay here is my chat log, it does pop back up.\n> Game 1\n> Dêâth: she my bitch\n> Dêâth: toxic\n> Dêâth: reported\n> Dêâth: i coulda played that better mb\n> Dêâth: starting to tilt /:\n> Dêâth: i mean you are actually trolling so\n> Dêâth: i mean no you won't if we vote no lol\n> Dêâth: report leo afk please\n> Dêâth: good or not she afkd\n> Dêâth: i mean okay\n> Dêâth: key binding op\n> Dêâth: i mean maybe if it wasn't a 4v5 all game /:\n> Dêâth: ask me how much i care about your opinion?\n> Dêâth: i mean kayn was mid more than zed was lol\n> Dêâth: so\n> Dêâth: yup\n> Dêâth: you mean after kayn came mid 5 times?\n> Dêâth: oh you mean the leo that afkd?\n> Dêâth: not crying lol, its a game fam, just find it funny how serious you freak out that i don't agree lmao\n> Dêâth: will do fam\n> Dêâth: enjoy gold still :)\n> Dêâth: nah fuck clowns\n> Dêâth: yet i'm two ranks above you :thinking:\n> Dêâth: zed i don't get why you think you are so cool lol\n> Dêâth: you shit on a shit player\n> Dêâth: gratz dude\n> Dêâth: i lost lane lol\n> Dêâth: you are going to report me for losing lane?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
