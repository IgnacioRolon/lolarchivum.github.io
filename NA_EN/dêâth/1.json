One of the things is a row of keys, so say 1-9 will show how much hp you have with the lights. I wanted to know if this was allowed or not. It says this when setting it up.\r\n\"This should not trigger any anti-cheat, as this uses natively supported LightFX support, but it is still used at your own risk\"\r\nI just wanted to double check to make sure i was okay to use this.\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-12T05:29:09.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As with any program not written by Riot Games, using anything that could *potentially* give you a competitive advantage is **use at your own risk territory**.

Its just a perma ban? I want to use this program cause it has cool features in general. Like you can make it show your CPU and Ram usage on the keyboard. But i just don't want to be banned from league.","replies":[]}]}]}
