Which means not buying the bundle that she comes in is there any other way i could possibly get the chance to get her without buying the bundle because i really love kayle since i mostly mained her back in S4 and S1 but now im starting to get into her again an i need a new Kayle skin to spice things up. Judgement is kinda getting boring to look at and i would love to have Riot Kayle but sadly i would have to buy the bundle which i&#039;ve already said isnt really worth it for 1 skin that i want.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-05T20:41:38.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hiya Jibber4U2! \n\nSince Riot Kayle is a legacy skin, she'll make periodic returns to the store. In addition, legacy skins are available through Mystery Gifts, if you're feelin' lucky. \n\nAlso, as mentioned in the [guide to legacy and limited skins](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944-Guide-to-Legacy-and-Limited-Skins) - \n\n*Riot skins are based around the \"Riot\" theme and are obtained by either meeting a Rioter or attending an official Riot event. They are also temporarily available in the store during events in the year of their release.*\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devack The Holy","date":"2015-07-05T04:48:34.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When this year's Riot Skin comes out, they'll rerelease Riot Kayle for a limited time.
