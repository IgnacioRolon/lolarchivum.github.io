Now I&#039;ve been playing since before Twitch&#039;s VU and even went to the Twitch VU panel at PAX East and I remember the huge outcry towards the change to Twitch&#039;s ultimate name to &quot;Rat-ta-tat-tat&quot; (and to a lesser extent, &quot;Expunge&quot; to &quot;Contaminate&quot;).  \r\n\r\nYears later, it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth to see Rat-ta-tat-tat as the official name. To be honest, it was the only downside to what plenty of people consider one of the better VU&#039;s Riot has done. (Aside from us losing of OG Twitch&#039;s taunt and joke) Spray and Pray conveys the idea of Twitch&#039;s ult (blindly firing into a crowd with autos that can miss) way better than Rat-ta-tat-tat (The sound affect of a clunky machine gun firing, in which only one of Twitch&#039;s skins actually has a machine gun.) can ever be.\r\n\r\n\r\n And god if Twitch is picked in pro play and I have to hear another announcer butcher Rat-ta-tat-tat on stream I&#039;m just gonna stop watching pro matches.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-10-13T06:13:05.914+0000","up_votes":92,"down_votes":2,"body":"We have indeed been talking over the last few days about whether we should change the name of Twitch's ult back to 'Spray and Pray' as part of the Pre-Season changes to Twitch. For that discussion we've wanted to gather as much context as we could about how people feel about the two names. Surveying Twitch players after they've finished a game is part of that, as are other things like looking at forum sentiment (both when the change was made and now), talking to some Twitch mains direct etc. \n\nAs well as looking at how the change has been perceived we also wanted to consider why the name was changed in the first place. Talking with the team who worked on Twitch a couple of years back they had a few goals they were looking to accomplish. Those involved concerns about 'Spray and Pray' having some misleading gameplay implications, some thematic connotations (Twitch used to have a somewhat more militaristic vibe that the update moved away from) and a few other smaller points. \n\nIn terms of the survey results they're been closer to neutral than some of us had predicted going in. From what we've seen overall however players who care a lot about the ult's name tend to prefer 'Spray and Pray' noticeably more often though. 'Spray and Pray' is also still really frequently used as a name, sometimes even by players who never played old Twitch. Thematically, while it does have a bit of oddness as a name (wild machine gun firing isn't a perfect fit for how the skill functions) it does still evoke the whole 'rapidly shooting many targets all at once' of Twitch ult pretty well. \n\nOur overall conclusion is that we should change Twitch's ult back to the name 'Spray and Pray'. We do feel there are some valid concerns about it, but overall think it's a better fit with what people want and expect from Twitch than Rat-ta-ta-tat. Apologies to those who prefer the current name, can definitely understand why even if we don't feel that overall it's the right choice. One thing we are looking into (no promises of success yet, but we're trying) is whether or not we can keep the name 'Rat-ta-tat-tat' purely for Gangster Twitch, given the connection with the Tommy Gun Twitch uses on that skin. That's not something we'd normally want to do, since there's a clarity hit to different ability names on different skins. Given the details of this particular case though we figure it's potentially a good place to make an exception though, try and meet the desires of both groups to at least some degree.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnicore","date":"2016-10-13T06:56:36.902+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":206,"body":"Did that really need 4 full paragraphs?","replies":[{"poster":"Yordle Xayah","date":"2016-10-13T07:01:14.581+0000","up_votes":124,"down_votes":1,"body":"- Rioter answers with \"Yes\" or \"no\"\n- Forums go like \"OMG GIVE CONTEXT F U\"\n___\n- Rioter gives good long answer\n- Forums go like \"OMG TL;DR F U\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-10-13T07:21:59.308+0000","up_votes":125,"down_votes":2,"body":"Need?

Most of us, myself included, still call it expunge. In fact, while writing this I had to go back and correct an instance where I used the wrong name. Not only does the name roll off the tongue far better than contaminate does, but as many others have mentioned the name \"contaminate\" implies applying some new Damage over time effect, not the massive burst of damage that the ability actually is. whereas Expunge implies a sudden exodus of some kind. Which, while still inaccurate to the ability's current function, far more closely matches what actually happens than the current name.\n\nAdditionally, an argument can be made that, although Twitch is not expunging his poison, he _is_ expunging his enemy's life. Not exactly a strong argument, but at the very least an amusing one.","replies":[{"poster":"Anth895","date":"2016-10-13T13:11:43.537+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I call it contaminate.

He looks like he is ripping the poison out of you. He is just not that \"good\" at it so he always leaves more than enough behind.\n\nPlus Contaminate doesn't make sense since you are already poisoned and aren't becoming more poisoned.\n\nAlso while we are at it we should change Venom Cask to Gift Bad, which while hilariously fits the idea of Twitch giving you bad gifts, also means Poison Bath in German.

Rat-ta-tat-tat doesn't invoke any emotions and has no inherent meaning. We've all seen some action movies so we know the meaning and emotions associated with the former. It also makes sense given the way his ult. works. \n\nI don't know why it was changed initially but if it was due to the religious connotation of pray, I think that's overblown. I'm not religious but just like people say \"oh my god,\" they can use the term pray in secular contexts (\"I pray that X doesn't happen!\" etc.).\n\nOn a separate note, I think seeing basically no Twitch at Worlds shows that his 6.19 nerf was unnecessary.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stranger Ways","date":"2016-10-13T18:03:19.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=xoI730fL,comment-id=0014,timestamp=2016-10-13T06:13:05.914+0000)\n>\n> We have indeed been talking over the last few days about whether we should change the name of Twitch&#x27;s ult back to &#x27;Spray and Pray&#x27; as part of the Pre-Season changes to Twitch.
