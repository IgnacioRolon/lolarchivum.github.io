I personally feel as if there are very few situations in which you wouldn't rush it. Any ideas on when one would go for something else?","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-05-19T17:27:49.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Garen main here, Rushing {{item:3068}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3142}} over cleaver right now.

You either build tank first because you aren't winning lane that much or you go for the more expensive cleaver to further push the advantage you have from getting kills in lane. You don't build damage when you are losing lane.\n\nGaren \"can\" make use of the phage but the passive for it is near useless for him, 20 AD and 200 HP vs 10 ArmorP +25AD 10% CDR   This shouldn't be hard to choose.\n\nOr getting a {{item:3068}} allows you to win a lot of sustained fights given his high damage output without damage items, not to mention the more health it gives, healthy boost of armor, and the cheaper cost.\n\nAnd again, in case you missed it, I never said not to get a cleaver just get it as a second item, by the time you pick up the cleaver mid game is in full swing and you are going to make great use of it now that champions actually have some tank items.\n\nBy all means don't do as I do but telling me I don't main Garen because I don't rush 1 damn item right away is just fucking arrogant.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tin Tarantino","date":"2015-05-19T15:12:43.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Probably shouldn't be telling new players to rush black cleaver either, would be a lot better if they could put something in there about building situationally, or at least core builds for a champion.","replies":[]}]}
