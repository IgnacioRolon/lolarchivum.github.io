We've already got two pinned threads detailing rules and general guidelines for Player Behavior, as well as the Boards Universal Rules in boldface and with a scroll icon on the left, just a little ways under the \"Create a Discussion\" button, so if people aren't bothering to read all of that, I'm doubtful that a third reminder that players aren't allowed to name &amp; shame would really do anything.\n\nIf they're not willing to bother to read the rules in the first place, making more threads to explain the rules probably wouldn't get very far.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-16T19:20:19.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only purpose of sticky threads is for veterans to point them out after the fact and say \"look, you broke the rules.\" [No one reads](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/26/designing-for-people-who-have-better-things-to-do-with-their-lives/).
