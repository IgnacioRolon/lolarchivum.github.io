But after a lot of games I recognized this pattern of how the Champion Grade System works. If you are support and have a support item in your inventory, the system counts more from your assists and punish you less from your deaths. But if you are a top laner and picked a full tank, the chance of you getting the S+ rank will be **very very low**, as your job is to** sacrifice yourself for your team in the time of need**. Even if you were legendary at times (most likely early games), one death in late game will ruin your score and eventually get you a A+ rank instate of S (happened to me a few times). It is much more efficient as a top laner to go split pushing 247 once you have like a 10/0 score and back off whenever there is a chance of you getting ambushed even if you have chance to hind enemy team from winning team fights or taking objectives. By not taking part of team fights, people can avoid a lot of sacrifices for the team and get a lot more CS which is also a big indicator for your Champion Grade. For all those lane bullies who fall off later, this seems to be quite unfair.\r\n\r\nI personally** suggest Riot** to** increase the value of assists in the Champion Grade System**. Of course there will be people abusing WW&#039;s W or J4&#039; E to get assists without even taking part of team fights, but it will still encourage more team plays where the Tank uses his life to trade for more kills for the team or objectives.","replies":[{"poster":"lilpokfluf","date":"2016-07-29T14:31:24.688+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":6,"body":"Man if you're going legendary just be happy that you're gonna win .

So many games where ive had fantastic stats across the board yet only end up with an A+ because my cs was a little lower than it apparently should be because I was busy farming champions instead of lane minions.\n\nThe system promotes greedy and selfish play instead of teamwork (like hoarding all the cs you can get instead of letting your adc who is behind have it) like you said, which is pretty sad for Riot to promote.\n\nThe whole system just needs to be changed around because as it is now its just not an enjoyable or healthy part of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aushigh16","date":"2016-07-30T07:09:45.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its still a newer system... it might require individual champion tweaking.
