Because all in-house audio will be in Korean, we'll be offering new English and Chinese translation devices. Here's a few details:\r\n\r\n- You can purchase them at the ticket box or merchandise store on October 19th when the doors open\r\n- They'll cost you 10,000 KRW (about 9.40 USD), both credit card and KRW cash accepted\r\n- Earbuds included\r\n- Three audio channels : Korean (OGN broadcast), English (NA/EU broadcast), and Chinese (LPL broadcast)\r\n- Instruction manual included so you know which button to click\r\n\r\nWe tested these out pretty rigorously and sold them at the semifinals last week to great reviews. I got one, and both the volume and sound quality is super solid (even for someone with terrible hearing like me). So if you'd like to watch the big screens but hear the language of your choice, feel free to pick one up for purchase.\r\n\r\nI'll check back in this thread in a bit to see if there are any questions I can answer about this. See you Sunday!!","replies":[{"poster":"Animesandwich2","date":"2014-10-19T05:11:57.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How will they be listening to it with a bajillion screaming people?","replies":[]},{"poster":"KevinDelMarr","date":"2014-10-17T07:16:57.189+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I won't be there, but will the translators have any Riot or Season 4 Worlds markings on them?
