Felt it was an interesting topic, so I thought I'd share!\r\n\r\nA few years ago when I moved over from Riot QA to Riot Esports, I had to have a confused conversations with my parents about why in the world someone would want to watch another gamer play a video game. When the Season 2 World Championship rolled around in LA, I invited them down to come watch even though they didn't know too much about the game. Whelp, I underestimated them, because not only did they learn as much as they could about League, they showed up in League shirts with TPA signs. After the awesome show, my mother went home and installed LoL immediately. A year (and many many questions about Ashe build paths) later she showed up to support SKT at the Season 3 World Championships, and hasn't stopped loving it since.\r\n\r\nPlaying with my mother is a pretty awesome experience, not only because it made me realize just how many things I took for granted in League (I was shocked when she asked me what \"First Blood\" was; to me I'd heard that term as a kid playing Unreal Tournament!), or because I get to laugh at her yells of victory when she nails an Ashe Ult. The most rewarding part of the experience is that we can now see eye-to-eye on OUR passion for video games (since then she's gotten pretty emotionally invested in the Mass Effect series). I really hope that when I end up having kids, I can game with them and get the same fun I have when I hit champ select with my Mom.\r\n\r\nSo how about you all? I’d love to hear stories from anyone who plays with their parents. :)","replies":[{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-02-26T23:40:13.685+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"My mom can't right click... let alone play video games, but more power to you!","replies":[{"poster":"Jggy","date":"2015-03-01T22:06:13.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, that's my mom as well :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"LaFugazi","date":"2015-02-27T16:28:23.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bummer","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Lexer","date":"2015-02-26T23:58:52.418+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.

She's come to understand that if I'm playing League, I can't really leave it because she knows that if I leave I'm in danger of being suspended and I might be ruining the game for 4 other people. She doesn't know much about the game other than that and the old lore. She plays her own games though. She's a big Lord of the Rings fan so she fell in love with LOTRO. She's also found some mobile game called Ingress that she has become super addicted to. She's less interested in gameplay and more interested in story when it comes to most games. I used to read her the lore from each champion and she was fascinated by the stories that each champ had. She fell in love with Leagues old lore and was truly devastated when it was retconned.  That's probably one of my biggest reasons for being mad at the narrative team, making my mom upset.

It's not like they honed their bodies to be able to do anything other players aren't capable of. If I got five guys who knew which 30/ 120 champions are the most broken right now, because of the fact we only get 3 bans chances are we'd all get someone we can play and be able to do all the same things they do in pro play.  \nIt's just a video game. Normal players with a team could do all the same things they do in the LCS with just some practice and a little memorization. (not going to go on a rant in this thread about how I think Solo Que is a joke and all ranking should be team-based)\n\nInB4 \"But baseball is just a game.\" \nYes, it is. But while every single thing done in the LCS is completely possible by normal players because it's all just zeros and ones in a video game, I could train for years and not throw the ball like Lincicum or hit the ball like Bonds. While there is good in praising those who can do a lot with their brains, there's no good that comes from attempting to group someone who sits at a computer all day with someone who's at the peak of physical health. The obesity problem is getting bigger and bigger all around the world and promoting video games as sports doesn't help it.\n\nAnd even with all this attention going towards video games, you people at Riot still don't listen to community feedback.

What is wrong with being entertained by very good players doing something you also like to do? Every sport is different and requires different physical and mental prowess. It's not like sumo wrestling requires peak physical conditions. Neither do numerous positions in american football. You don't need a six-pack to play golf. E-Sports requires different skills, but not anyone can be the best of the best. It requires the same dedication, practice, and natural talent than any other sport. Some people find LOL matches more entertaining than baseball games (I do as well). \n\nIf you honestly think you could just grab 4 people, make a team, and go win the LCS then you are very very delusional.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dsmizzy","date":"2015-02-28T10:32:54.003+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My mother plays Xbox games, only games I ever see her play are fighters and beat em ups.\nWhen you get up at 1230 at night and see her playing lollipop chainsaw...you question your self and realize where you got all your rage from.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ll Akagami ll","date":"2015-02-28T00:39:43.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please bake her cookies, cake, bread whatever you have to all with TSM on top of them :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cubism","date":"2015-02-27T18:33:20.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:38}}  tried to play league with his mother once.
