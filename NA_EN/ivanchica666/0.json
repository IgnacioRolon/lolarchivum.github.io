Literally this restriction will kill bad atmosphere forever and bring back some positive vibes into community because even if someone wants to flame he is not able to.All you can do is choose what Riot allowed you to send to another player.Think about it guys.We dont need free will in the chat box.We only need words connected to League of Legends(lanes,roles,objectives,player or champion names,attack or defend commands,split push etc).\r\nI dont see the point in giving someone power to write me something bad about me or my family in a video game !! \r\nYou will never cure entire planet by punishing a 10 year old kid with 10,20 min ban or permaban,he/she will just make another acc be nice 1-20 lvl after it here we go again.\r\n\r\nSolution was allways better than problem and i hope you will think about this Riot...Love from Croatia &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-09-25T08:15:28.610+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can always disable both all and ally chats in option and use pings only if you don't like to see people's chat.

This is a game after all. Tons of players appreciate the ability to chat in a multiplayer online game. It may not be a necessity, but it adds a lot to a game. To you, it adds toxicity, but not to everyone. You actually do have the ability to disable chat, so you should just do that. Then you can have your chatless game, while others can have their chat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MLG Quincey","date":"2019-09-26T17:28:20.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swearing is a no no and saying any profanity is a one way ticket to hell.","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2019-09-26T05:34:22.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is chat ONE of the main forms toxicity is distributed?\nYes.\nWill removing it solve any problems?\nNO.\n\nFirst of all, in a given situation, I’d much rather someone call me racial slang in chat then come and steal my CS.\n\nChat encourages people to communicate, bad or good. Chat toxicity is not good, but in game toxicity is worse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-09-25T18:53:16.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you think menu chat will stop people from being toxic you're wrong, as people can still use menu chat to be toxic or just switch to non-chat forms of harassing others if/when they can't use chat to do so. Chat is not the issue, it's the people who feel the need to harass others for one reason or another that's the issue. That aside there's unfortunately no 100% fool-proof way to remove toxicity from a community this size, especially if there's no cost to enter it in the first place.","replies":[]}]}
