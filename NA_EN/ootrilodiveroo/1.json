farmer with the name Fidd.As a person he was 69 age old,he was very kind to him neighbors and especially he love children,because by him points of view the young generation is the future of Demacia.One day,which has become a dreadful news for Demacia,all farmers lose their fields of wheat,they all was destroyed and consumed by a mysterious monster.But this was only the beginning of problems,Demacia was in that situation were everyone suffered by hunger,at this point,Fidd didn't have any ways and decided to find the monster who consume all their fields of wheat,because everyone feared him.By legends,the monster who did it was a evil spirit what comes far away from Demacia,from that place were nobody come back,and now this spirit lives in one dark forest near the village were Fidd lives.After finding some informations about the spirit,he take his scythe and went into the dark forest.Inside,the forest was really dark,the trees was so high what it was impossible to see the blue sky,but Fidd continued to go ahead in search of the spirit.On Fidd's way,he find a abandoned house,the house was really old and dilapidated at the view,but something attracted the attention of Fidd,it was a small glowing turquoise ball what beckoned Fidd to come in.Fidd was not inclined to follow the glowing ball,but then he suddenly heard a howl of a unknown animal,and then Fidd did not have a any way,and he decided to came in the house.Has  passed 5 minutes,the animal leave,Fidd sighed with relief,and then he started to explore the house,by sight the house looks like a hunter's house,because of different animals heads on the walls,Fidd came to the bedroom,he saw a small altar were someone did a ritual,on the center of altar was a homemade scarecrow of wheat,the scarecrow looking as a monster with long legs and arm,the mouth was littered with sharp broken knifes what looks like a teeth,he has two big eyes who gave the impression would this scarecrow watch everything.After contemplation of the terrifying \"masterpiece\",Fidd leave the bedroom.After that,Fidd noticed a strange trapdoor with a painted red **X**  on them,Fidd opened the trapdoor,and saw a basement with another scarecrow what he find in the bedroom,but this one looked like more....**alive**?\nIn that moment when he saw this scarecrow,Fidd was scared,he was panicked and when he started to go backwards,something was on him way,in this moment the Fidd's heart started to tremble with fear,and when he turned his head to what was behind him,he was so scared what he even screamed...it was the undead,the owner of this house,\"**The dead Hunter**\".The dead Hunter with a strong grip grabbed the Fidd's throat and framed his back to the nearest wall,then he spoke:\"**I HaVe fUlFiLleD mY pUnIsHmEnT,nOw,iT's yOuR tUrN**\",after these words The dead Hunter loosened his grip,and then he fall to the floor and started to decay,with the grip what he catch Fidd,he left an imprint of a strange rune on Fidd's throat.But that was not the end,these two scarecrows what Fidd saw came to the living room were is Fidd,and started to looking at him...Fidd was scare,and wanted run away,but for fear he could not do anything...The both scarecrows opened their mouths,from their mouth came two small glowing turquoise balls,then Fidd get it,it not just a glowing turquoise balls,it was the soul fragments of The dead Hunter.After that,both soul fragments came closer to Fidd,they save his fear,he was scared before everything he saw,but when they saw the rune of his throat,the sentence was decided,the soul fragments instantly went into the Fidd's mouth,Fidd tried to do something,but was too late,the soul fragments started to transform his body,flesh became as wheat,bones became as sticks,skin became as rags,the Fidd's life flew in his eyes,he felt pain,but he could not scream in pain,his body was exhausted and was ready to fall in the floor,but he couldn't do it,then all ends.............dark...darker.....more darker......darkness filled him soul,now he was not a human,he is a monster,monster who thinking what he could forget the past....but no.......\n\nFidd open him eyes,he was exhausted and hungry....hungry for human soul...When he got up,he sniffed,he smelled a village near the dark forest,there was many souls to harvesting,what a wonderful feast,after these thoughts,Fidd cannot stop him emotional splash and screamed as a mad man,all the dark forest heard him scream,even the village heard it...then the house were was Fidd started to glow in turquoise light,but fast it removed on light green...\n\n\nThe human who was Fidd is gone,there is now Fiddlesticks,the new terror of the village in Demacia what was near to the dark forest.\n\n\n\"**_*AaaaaHaHaHAhaHaaaA!!!!*_**\n-Fiddlesticks,the cursed

I play him a lot and don't want a full rework. his story could use a rework you are definitely right about that. right now the story is just about a creep no one can handle inside a box that no one knows why it exists or at least that is what I remember about it. \n\nI play fid a lot up to 1.7 million mastery points. the only big flaws I have found with the champ are a slight lack of hp and a need to build move speed items or never keep up with all of the champions who have dashes in the kit. his q timer has a big delay in animation time that allows other champions to cast and interact before his cc hits and he doesn't have the same safety net other champs with similar cc effects have such in the case of morgana or janna where the cc takes time but you can barrier up to stop something bad from happening. so in short I think only this fear animation time needs any real work and the backstory. but on a side not I am not a big fan of the passive they gave him but it isn't entirely dead in the water. so if I were riot I would be very choosy over what would happen to this champion. most times even with the full reworks done to champions they keep a lot of the same feel on the abilities. like with warwick, and galio, even tho the changes were more drastic it kept a lot of the same feel. not always true. urgot got some big changes in feel. and what you impose is a big change in how the champion would be played.","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-03-15T16:49:39.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hate to break it to you, but I'm pretty sure that's old lore.
