Once, after another battle, Olaf came to the knowledge that a mysterious warrior with a big blade would stand in his way and kill him.Olaf at first did not attach importance to this, until this vision did not appear to him every night, but in the end, realizing that he was already glorifying the whole Freeljord and perhaps even outside the frozen land.He took his will into a fist and began preparing for this day when the glorification of the warrior will remain for centuries in the memories and legends of loved ones and other people of Freljord.\n\n\n\n\n[In general, according to my idea, Olaf should have a whip and a hammer, but I did not find a suitable art, so I&#039;ll have to imagine how he will look with him]\n\n\n\n[PASSIVE]Master of War Weapons;Olaf has three weapons with him, it&#039;s a hammer, a sword and an ax. Each of these weapons has its own skills and effects.Also, Olaf can change his weapon every 15 seconds by mouse roller.\n\n\n\n[Q]throwing an ax/Hammer blow/blade cut\n\n[throwing an ax];Olaf throws his ax to inflict physical damage, but it is leaning against him. Olaf can raise the ax and cooldown reduction will be reduced.\n\n[Hammer blow];Olaf hammers on the ground causing physical damage and slowing down the enemies in the vicinity.\n\n[blade cut];Olaf makes a swing with a blade in the form of a semicircle causing physical damage and healing himself by 11% of the inadequate health reserve.\n\n[W]legend lunge;Olaf makes an attack towards the enemy while inflicting physical damage.\n[with hammer];If there is a hammer in his hands, Olaf will hit them at the enemy and throw him up.\n[with Blade]Olaf pushes the enemy with a sword, inflicting a true damage.\n\n\n[E]thunderclap;Olaf strikes with two lightning strikes, striking the enemy with two weapons, inflicting physical damage.\n\n\n[R]Berserker rage;Olaf runs into the rage of a berserker, increasing his movement speed, attacking for 7 seconds, becoming non-violent to control,tossing and slowing down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, that&#039;s all, I hope you liked my idea.\n\n\n\n[for people who do not like the absolute skill]\nI did not decide to change it because it would become too strong with Q skills,But you certainly can offer your ideas about the change of absolute skill  in comments.","replies":[{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2018-08-15T23:34:49.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually really like this.
