Download the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to help auto-configure your firewall settings to be sure.  If the issue persists, go over the steps in the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to verify that league is being added as an exception.

All I've been told is to give League permission (which I have from the beginning), use the hextech tool (which was the first thing I did), and reinstall league (which I've done about 5 times now). This company is a joke.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-21T16:16:26.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's no magic wand, friend.  I get your frustration, but steps provided aren't just pulled out of our ass.  They offer resolutions to common cases of the symptoms that are reported.  In cases that they don't, it still helps a ton by ruling out possibilities.  So the permissions didn't work for you, that sucks, and we want to keep helping.  Hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and attach the logs to your ticket to give us more context.  Your specific issue could be different, so we'll want to investigate further and help get you back in-game.  Work with us!","replies":[{"poster":"LuckyDreamer","date":"2017-04-23T03:53:38.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's actually because the responses are so delayed. Including the ticket I sent yesterday and still have not gotten a response. You guys are a joke and cant help a simple patch error. This shouldn't even happen from a complete reinstall of a program. Having a patch and a forced \"new\" client shoved down into computers doesn't alert someone down the line that \"Hey? Maybe this should be done separately to cause less issues?\" Morons.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
