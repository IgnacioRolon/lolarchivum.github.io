That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it. If this misbehavior happened in chat (including emotes or ping) and they don't respond positively to a _single, courteous, constructive request to focus on the game_, your best option is to mute that player. Submit a report after the match. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by asking them to keep it down and then notifying library staff and moving to another area.\n\n_Do not respond with misbehavior of your own!_ If you do that, your teammates may report _you_, and those reports would be valid. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it. I'm sure you're familiar with the \"s/he started it\" trope, where two children get into an argument or fight and then try to claim innocence of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didn't instigate it. As any parent, teacher, or other supervisor of children will tell you, that excuse doesn't fly. When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem. Making faces at him or shouting at him has never been a good way to get him to stop, and it makes you just as guilty of that as he.\n\nRiot doesn't care who started it. Someone else's misbehavior does not justify your own.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> * Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n> * Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nIf you misbehave but a teammate or opponent does or says something even worse, you should definitely report them after the match, just as someone reported you for your own misbehavior. Yes, that's certainly possible. Reports are not a limited resource. Any time someone believes that another player violated LoL's behavioral standards, they can report that player. Punishments are similarly not limited: if more than one player in a game merits a punishment, they can both get a punishment. This can happen even if the players in question were antagonizing each other. The IFS doesn't need to weigh the severity of all reported players' actions and then \"award\" the \"winner\" with a punishment; it's not a contest.\n\nThink of it like dealing with a noisy person in a library: ask them to keep it down, and then notify library staff and move to another area if that doesn't work. If you get into a shouting match with them, you're just as likely to be removed, even if you weren't shouting _quite_ as loudly as they were. The goal is a quiet library.\n\nYou weren't punished for misbehaving in one game. You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the matches that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several matches. You might see three matches, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> **PUNISHMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW A BASIC ESCALATION PATH:**\n> \n> * First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n> * Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n> \n> However, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.\n\nDid you find something in Riot's store [allowing you to break the ToS](https://i.imgur.com/AvDSnZF.png)? No, because such a service is not offered. Regardless of how much money you spend, you are required to follow the same rules as everyone else. If the IFS determines that you've been validly reported in violation of those rules, you'll be punished according to those rules. If you wanted to avoid a punishment, you should've followed the rules.\n\nRiot once thought that you wouldn't get anymore reports, back when they gave you your first punishment. After many reports and multiple punishments, you're still breaking the rules. So when you now say you'll behave from this point onward... they just plain don't believe you anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lyte Reformed Me","date":"2019-12-21T02:52:20.174+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just had your second account in my game and you told our Ekko Jg to kill himself **because you tower dived at lvl 3 and died** and talked more shit than playing the game.

In the Blitzchung ban case, one reason it was rescinded was because of letters from elected officials (from both of the two extremes, in fact) to Blizzard. These letters were **not** \"yo, if you don't rescind this I will use my official capacity to fuck you UPPPPPP\". The letters were basically just concerned citizens - they simply got more attention because they came from an elected official.\n\nThe main concern of the congresspeople who sent the letter was that the punishment may have a \"chilling effect\" on the ability of other players to support human rights. If people are scared they will get instantly banned for any small statement about anything, then that would certainly be a chilling effect, and that's something I wholly agree with. However, people looked past the most glaring and obvious difference between Blitzchung and your average gamer - Blitzchung utilized an interview **about a match** to make a political statement. In fact, there is a rule in both chambers of the US Congress against such displays - and such a display would result in punishment to the member (up to and including censure). There are also such rules in almost any \"broadcast\" situation. If you are a presenter on a broadcast, you are expected to do what you were \"hired\" or asked to do - unless and only if you were explicitly permitted time to utilize for your own topic.\n\nThe main subject of the interview was the match that just happened - and less so other things related to the game but not the match that just took place. The casters and Blitzchung chose to utilize their official broadcast to make a political statement that they were not only unauthorized to do, but that they were explicitly not permitted to do in that their broadcast was not about politics.\n\nSo should it have a chilling effect on anything? No, because **in game chat or policy was never involved in that case**. Blitzchung case is more like if a CNN anchor who presents a \"60 second news\" followed by moderating a discussion between panelists on that news..... if that anchor decided to, instead of presenting the news of the day, read a smut article live on air. Obviously such behavior is inappropriate. I'm all for protesting - but protesting in ways that do not cause an impact to those who do not wish to be impacted by it. People who tune in expecting an interview about a match should not be treated to a protest and a political statement from someone unauthorized to so make.\n\nSo... not only were the congresspeople not acting in their official capacities (even if they used official letterhead, they were not making any statements on behalf of their position/Congress), but they ignore the fact that their own chambers of Congress have similar rules and punishments should one of them choose to do a similar thing.

If no one quit the game ever because of toxicity and league didnt have a \"toxic reputation\", then the rules wouldnt exist. Theyre not shoving morality down your throat. Theyre shoving rules that deter others from ruining your experience, and thats not based in morality. Its based in what players find to be experience-ruining. Thats why the rules are built off of what people tended to vote to punish in the tribunal. Theyre not teaching you how to be an upstanding citizen in everyday life. They're telling you what you can or cannot say in the vacuum of a league of legends match. Thats why streamers dont get banned for saying shit in their stream.... because Riot isnt the morality police.
