With the 660 I used to get well into the 300's and almost 400's on occasion with FPS, but now with the 1070 I'm only maxing out at around 177. Settings are the same, everything on very high, and vertical sync is off. I've read the \"fps help\" thread and disabled the game bar for windows 10 and I even added the LoL client to my NVIDIA Control Panel and put power management on maximum. Any help?","replies":[{"poster":"Undeaddragon35","date":"2017-08-18T00:42:40.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The gpu is running at the max that it can, you can try doing any updates and check nvidia website about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-17T22:10:45.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure you've probably already done this, but I'm mentioning it due to the fact that you hadn't said whether or not you checked for this in your post. Let's be sure that you've updated and installed the correct drivers for that 1070 to make sure that your pc is able to use it to the fullest extent. Let me know whether or not that seems to be the problem!","replies":[]}]}
