How inspiring it would be for Lux to have Leona, a strong woman of iron conviction with a heart of sun-warmth gold, to look up to as the leader of the more experienced team?

Probably.\n\nIn the overall champion popularity between these 2 Ahri is a lot more popular than Leona, she has the most skin sales out of any other female league champion, most of the female league cosplayers are using her as base and she is displayed everywhere on the media especially in Asian countries where the majority of skin sales come from. Not saying that Leona should not get a star guardian skin but picking Ahri first was the correct marketing choice since skin decisions are based primary on profits. That's why they always give priority to champions like Ezreal and Ahri, because they are popular and bring the most profits.","replies":[{"poster":"2ManyJons","date":"2017-08-16T15:36:33.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, Riot panders to Ahri now like they did when Katarina was the hot one.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Moonfall Saber","date":"2017-08-11T15:45:24.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And on the other side we gave the star destroyers with Diana as their leader","replies":[{"poster":"2ManyJons","date":"2017-08-11T16:03:07.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"See, the story writes its self haha.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fairyfleur","date":"2017-08-13T01:44:20.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not everyone is upset she received the skin.
