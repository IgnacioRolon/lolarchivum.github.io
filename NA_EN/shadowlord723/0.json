Now it's been happening for a while on some of my Snowdown ARURF games and I can't rejoin the game. \r\n\r\nI am wondering if anyone else is experiencing this issue. If not, then it might be a problem with my computer. I'm just looking for a way to fix this. Thanks guys.\r\n\r\nPS: For those of you who had me in their ARURF game and I didn't reconnect, I APOLOGIZE! {{sticker:sg-soraka}} It's never happened before and I hope it doesn't happen again.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-22T19:36:30.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might have some bad game files that's failing to render, and would result in a bugsplat.

It never puts me in the game, then when I try to press the reconnect button nothing happens.\n\nUPDATE: Tried to close and open client again, still doesn't work. See if it was a one time thing it isn't tried to play another game same thing happened. I already got Leaver Buster WARNING rip. I am just level 11 HELP ME.
