So I decided to give this replay feature a try and overall I liked it.\r\n\r\nHowever, my main issue with it is that I couldn't seem to move my chat box. It appears that the chat box is behind part of my HUD so I couldn't fully read what it says due to the HUD blocking it. I wanted to move the box onto a different position, yet I couldn't find a way to do so. I even tried looking online but I didn't get what I was looking for.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone here know how to move the chat box in the replay feature or is it permanently positioned as is?

I am sorry that I did not specify it, but the problem with my chat box is only in the replay system. While in game, I can move my chat box freely, but when watching some replays of my previous games, the replay system HUD is blocking the chat box. I tried the enter technique as well as trying to look through some of the options within the system, but I just can't seem to move my chat box around.\n\nIs it possible that there is an option/command which I overlooked or is the chat box permanently placed in that certain position in all my replays?\n\nBelow is the link to a photo of what my chat box looks like in the replay system (sorry it isn't a screenshot as I currently have problems with my computer when it comes to that).\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/CzFQH\n\nAgain, thanks for your effort to help me!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-21T22:18:03.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should be able to hit **ENTER** to call up the chat box frame (the blue bar) even in replays, since I was able to do so on my PC. From your screenshot, it seems the blue bar should be visible in replays after hitting the enter key.
