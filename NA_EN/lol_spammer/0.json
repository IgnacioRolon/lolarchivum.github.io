If you don't believe me just try logging into the PBE. It takes at least an hour if you are lucky, something that is rarely seen unless a new champion is released. This is all because of URF and I fear that if we only keep it for 3 days there is going to be a huge out roar from the community saying to bring back URF. So just know this, when you get death threats from the community telling you to keep it for 4 more days, I get to say I told you so.","replies":[{"poster":"MyBladeBrokeXD","date":"2016-04-13T01:48:21.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes urf for around a week pls","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dryad Soraka","date":"2016-04-11T21:40:56.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right?!
