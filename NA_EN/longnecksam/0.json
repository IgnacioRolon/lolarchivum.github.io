Let me tell you that improving yourself, focusing on your own play and learning from people you find exceptional players instead of whining about them beating you due to \"OP champ\" or \"luck\" or \"bad teams\" is the best thing you can do to climb. Keeping an open mind will take you very far, accepting your mistakes will take you even further. I used to think I was good in Bronze but it was just my team holding me back.

Awesome.\n\nMeh, the whole respecting higher elos is pretty bs. \n\nSure, a diamond is a better at the game then you, but its just a game, they don't have to be arrogant, a lot of people actually do have a really bad superiority complex when it comes to this game. They believe simply because of a bit of skill in the game (probably brought on more by experience rather than natural talent) makes them smarter, makes them better. It's ridiculously immature.\n\nYou should respect someone who gives you respect. What impresses me is when someone is ridiculously good at the game, but still laughs at their own mistakes, admits others good calls over their own. And takes the failure of others not as a chance to brag or ridicule,  but as a chance to teach them. That's truly impressive. That's what diamond and above should mean, otherwise all you are is a rager who spent the last few years on a keyboard and learnt some muscle memory.","replies":[{"poster":"Mimy","date":"2015-12-30T18:14:17.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What yoi said in you first sentance is somewhat what I mean. \n\nSorta the golden rule. \n\n\"Treat others how you want to be treated.\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xenos11111","date":"2015-12-30T11:13:45.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Onastacia,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=bAgc0cZF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-12-29T19:41:07.245+0000)\n>\n> Even though I am bronze I like to do this to people who get lucky in placements and place silver 3 or 4... \n> \n> So obviously they think they're better than any bronze and rub it in your face.
