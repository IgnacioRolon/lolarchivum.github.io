These cut the price of 975 RP champs to like 500 RP.  Also, buy skins that are on sale but are also cool.

Same goes for runepage sales.  I use RP to buy champs so I can save my IP for runes.  I'm an adult and a dad and don't have as much time to play as some people so I can't grind out IP.\n\nWait for sales, buy RP when you get a bonus (if you can stand to wait!) and your RP will last much longer.  Oh, and check out the champion bundles (the ones always available, not the seasonal sales).  They are a tremendous value for your RP if you want to play several of the champs in the bundle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2015-02-22T16:09:54.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best use is to buy gifts for friends.\n\nBoosts are mostly useless and you want as much experience playing as you can get before hitting 30.\n\nFigure out which champions you want to main then but skins for them. I wouldn't suggest buying skins until you have played the champion at least 10 times. You never want to buy a skin only to midi d that you hate the champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poptart Evelynn","date":"2015-02-22T15:25:46.237+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rune pages go on sale a lot. Wait for those sales and buy a couple pages.\n\nIn the mean time I would keep testing out free rotation champs and when you find some you like go ahead and buy them. Save IP for runes. If you have a weekend you plan to play a bunch I would also get an ip booster to catch up in runes.\n\nIt's rough for someone to catch up in terms of owning all the champions but I would say it's best to focus saving IP for tier 3 runes and to only use rp on champs you absolutely love. 5k rp = about 5-9 champions you would love to play. So keep testing them on free rotations.\n\n(Btw when making a post don't use side arrows or it will mark the line of text as a comment.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2015-02-23T10:12:39.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dont buy boosts its waste of money.\n\nAlso I would recomend to purchase RP when you want something.
