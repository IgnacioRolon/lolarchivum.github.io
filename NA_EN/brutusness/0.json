Afterwards, the following exchange happens:\n\n>High Councilor Kolminye nodded approvingly. “Thank you, and yes – the knowledge exchanged in the bond is private between champion and summoner. You have nothing to fear.”\n>\n>“Nor do you.” Swain bowed again, keeping his eyes locked on the High Councilor.\n>\n>A tense pause was broken by the High Councilor. “Why do you want to join the League,**_ Jericho Swain_**?” \n\nSwain then answers \"To become Emperor of Noxus\" before adding \"I want to kill Jarvan IV.\"\n\nSide note:  Kinda bums me out that you, a person partially responsible for the creation and maintenance of League's lore, isn't aware of that.
