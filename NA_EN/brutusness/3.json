But what exactly is the character role that they could best be filling? Malicious Metal, well known Morde fanatic, has gone in depth on his views of the idea fantasy that Morde should be fulfilling. But beyond just that, how could each champion be worked on in this regard? For example\r\n\r\n{{champion:31}} Should fill the role of a creature who spits on the idea of &quot;humanity&quot;. Make the player feel like a monster, and a deliberate one. Heartless, merciless. All consuming, but not in a TK way, where it&#039;s a two way street. Cho wants to consume everything and a deal has nothing to do with it.\r\n\r\n{{champion:106}} Should give the player the feeling of a prideful, even arrogant, but not chaotic, beast warrior. This isn&#039;t just an animal, but a demi god, and it should feel good. He should be imposing to look at and feel like.\r\n\r\nSo, what kinds of fantasies would you like these champions to bring in a VGU?

It's the incongruous contrast between those elements that really helps to distinguish him from the other Voidborn.  The other guys are all pretty straight forward when you get right down to it.\n\nOn things he shouldn't have, I don't think some of his aggressive voice lines fit very well with the tone his lore sets.  His idle animations are great, though.  Chasing his tail, dozing off, dancing around in a little circle.  All things you expect from a childlike critter that's just happy to exist and happy other things exist so he can eat them.\n\nThe aspect that would bug me the most if it went away?  Probably his childish intelligence.  If Kog were changed to some slathering monster like Rek, but equipped with a void cannon or what have you, I would be pretty put off by that.  There aren't that many child champions in the game, and losing one of the weirdest ones would leave me pretty disappointed.\n\nFor something added, I would LOVE to see Kog in make some positive lore interactions with Runeterran folks.  Cases where his curiosity overpowers his rumbly belly.  Bonus points if he tries to be 'helpful' and ends up being anything but due to his lack of comprehension.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2018-02-24T02:01:14.815+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would personally add gross, like in that drooling pug sort of way. \"Cute, but don't touch me...yucky...\"\n\nBut I agree with Rebonack's assessment.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2018-02-24T02:06:56.547+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Now I want a Kog'Maw VGU where he's constantly drooling Void acid.\n\nRito plz!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2018-02-24T02:47:13.112+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't think you should drastically change his look.\n\nin fact I thought it was pretty surprising he was up for a vgu. gameplay I get, but visuals I don't.

Because Cho does it, but also Rek'sai so its ok since the theme isn't owned by one void champ. One thing that you could do to separate them is have it so Kog has to kill units before he eat them.

For all of them, I think keeping the essence of the character is number one, even if Riot decides to change a great deal. \n\n{{champion:36}} I want to see him be a real doctor again. One of the both funny and scary things about Dr. Mundo was that he must have been pretty smart at some point, so is he still? Is he playing dumb? Anyways, he actually has a really great visual and \"mad hulked out doctor\" theme going, I think it could be enhanced. He has some great quotes too, I'd love to see more. \n\n{{champion:42}} Another one that I think his core theme is actually pretty solid: daring pilot, a little old. Spruce up his appearance to be more fluffy, give him a bit more of a backstory explaining whatever airforce and why Bandle needs it, and for Void's sake give this man some more lines! Love his laugh, I think his voice is one of my favorite parts about him, hate that he only says like 2 things.\n\n{{champion:31}} I'm sure a lot will need to be explained to put his lore in-line with the upcoming new Void stuff. He's League's premier monster, and I'd like him to remain that way. I also want him to still have his monstrous voice and have some more intelligent lines: I don't think he should be a big dumb monster, at the very least he's able to communicate and understand others and isn't just a mindless beast. I really look forward to seeing what Riot does with his design: I really like it, but his in-game model is ancient and could definitely look way more awesome.\n\n{{champion:9}}  This champ has been mired in mystery, and while Riot doesn't HAVE to reveal everything, SOME details of his origins would be appreciated. I think he would work as a demon in-line with Eve and Tahm. Crow Storm stays. He a scare crow!\n\n{{champion:10}}  Kayle's theme is definitely \"righteous angel who brings justice\". But I would love to see some gray area when it comes to opposing Morg: don't just do \"good vs evil\". Do \"good of the group\" vs \"good of the individual\" or something like that. Don't make Morg the bad guy exclusively. \n\n{{champion:85}} Yordles I feel are all suffering and badly need a lore update, so hopefully Kennen will benefit from that either when he is updated, or before. I think he should keep his hyperactivity, his lighting ninja aesthetic/powers and his connection with the Kinkou. This is optional, but I'd love to see more relationships with the other members of the Kinkou, Akali and Shen. \n\n{{champion:96}} I love that Kog'Maw is both repulsive and kind of cute, I think Kog mainly needs gameplay and visuals, though his background definitely needs some love. I want to hear some foreshadowing about his Daddy too!\n\n{{champion:56}} Freddy Kruger here is, first and foremost, an entity that invades and probably kills people in their dreams. I'd love more lines about this, maybe some interactions on what kind of nightmares certain other Champs have. His general visual design is cool, I think he should look mostly like a ghost-like entity. \n\n{{champion:82}} Players more knowledgeable and passionate than I have provided some great details for good ole Morde. His core theme is really strong, and I really enjoyed his current back story of unstoppable lich that could only be felled by his closest advisers. He MUST be an awesome suit of armor, I am anxious to see an updated visual of him\n\n{{champion:20}} I did a whole thread on Nunu a little while back, I think his theme's focus should be a boy and his best friend Willump the Yeti. I want a lot more emphasis on their cooperation and how they are better than the sum of their parts.\n\n{{champion:80}} Whoever wrote that wonderful bio for this guy, bravo, but I hate that the character we follow throughout--Atreus--has basically nothing to do with Pantheon. I want to feel more connection to him. While I understand he can't look exactly like a Spartan like he does now, I think Sparta is key to his visuals, so elements of it would go a long way towards making him feel like Pantheon.\n\n{{champion:33}} One of League's biggest blank slates, I think almost anything is fair game to change for Rammus. As long as he's \"derpy armored armadillo of few words\" I think it can work.\n\n{{champion:72}} I don't LOVE Skarner's newer lore, but I chalk this up to personal preference rather than the lore having any true problems. I think his design is already great, he just needs some polish. I want the lines \"the Crystal Scar is Weeping\" and \"I miss my kind...\" to remain, great lines. \n\n{{champion:35}} I hate Shaco, I'm not even gonna trust myself to comment unbiasedly on this. \n\n{{champion:77}} Its a shame that Spirit Guard Udyr wasn't just Udyr's VGU because I like a lot about this. Maybe he needs to be more \"rustic\" than his ult skin, more \"Freljord\" if you will, but visually its a great direction. \n\n{{champion:106}} While I miss Volibear's old role as a Shaman of his people, I think some elements from his old lore could actually benefit his new status as demigod. Let him have a vision on top of the stormy mountain, let him see war as a necessary tool to protect his people. And please don't make the Ursine completely mindless: they can be war-faring, fine, but make them spiritual. We already have Sejuani and the Winter's Claw for true war tribe, the Ursine can be more religious or something. Set them apart. \n\nTook longer than I wanted, but hopefully I sort of summarized the primary themes of each Champion. Obviously its mostly in my opinion, but I'd like to think this is, generally speaking, what is appealing about each Champion's fantasy.

I know that the 'space parasite' meme is real, and a lot of folks on the Boards here would rather none of that was ever introduced.  I've read enough threads to know.  Personally, I don't have a horse in this race, but I'm trying to be sympathetic to the folks who like it, AND the folks who don't.  (I.e. plz don't shoot the messenger - ha ha - historical war reference!)\n\nAnd therein lies the rub.  There are folks who like the idea that the Targonian Aspects merge with their new hosts, becoming more powerful than ever before (and losing/gaining a sense of identity with it, depending on the Aspect).  There are folks who hate it with the fury of a thousand suns and would prefer almost anything else.  There are lots of people in between.\n\nSimilarly in this thread I've seen folks who have their hate on for Mundo having never been a real, book-learned, intelligent Doctor - and others who are happy with the new orphan Mundo who just plays a Doctor on TV so to speak.\n\nWhat do we do in either of these situations about the fact that _any action will anger players_?  If we change to the old ways, we anger the players who engaged with the new lore (as well as even further destroying any confidence folks have in new lore going forward).  If we keep going with the new ways, then folks like Warlord Dienekes lose even more faith in Riot being able to, in Warlord's opinion(?) own up to mistakes and be prepared to fix them.\n\nSo I ask - the high level question is - is there a winning move here?  You can't please everyone, all the time, but it'd be nice to please a lot of them!\n\nIf, for example, (and I am making this up on the spot) Atreus started to reassert his identity over the Pantheon identity - creating an inner conflict such as was implied by Aurelion Sol, and in the course of his battles for righteousness his previously star-sparkled cloak became torn and bloody and looked as desperate as the battles he fought in - would that start to take nu-Panth an interesting direction for the old guard?\n\nI AM NOT SUGGESTING THAT THAT IS THE PLAN.  NOR IS IT NOT THE PLAN - I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THE PLAN IS.  But we're in a tricky situation and I want to know if there's a way to get back to the thematic pillars that folks miss, without losing the new thematics that have excited other players.\n\nI know the folks who have already commented here wouldn't but for any newcomers to the thread, please don't throw shade at the 'other' kind of player if you have strong opinions on this topic.  nu-Pantheon has his fans, and old-Pantheon has his fans.  The past is past, the omelette is made - but I am interested in how you, the players, want to see difficult problems like this dealt with.\n\nLastly, asking about thematic pillars is one way to be a little more abstract about these things.  It's one thing to discuss whether a character should be an orphan or not - it's another to discuss whether they should be Tragic, Unaffected, or Cheerful.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Von Bangin","date":"2018-02-24T21:36:01.935+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the whole \"erasing someone's individuality\" is never going to be particularly popular for people. Can you name one mainstream \"hive mind\" character that's popular on their own rather than a foil for another character? Someone who isn't themselves anymore, in a literal sense, just isn't a popular thematic. No one wants to lose who they are, it's the only thing we ever really own; ourselves.  I don't think the theme really resonates with players. Might this might be more so with Western audiences? I haven't seen much data from other cultures but I know that there's a large focus on liberal values here in the West. \n\nCombined with an already unpopular theme, it's been spread to 3 or 4 characters. Yeesh, that's a lot of the same thing going on.  On top of all that it was done in a way that was a complete departure from already popular characters.  Was that the right choice? Is the bed really made?  There's been no media made that solidifies the targonian character's status as a host/avatar for a new consciousness outside of written profiles.   It already  seems like Riot is  pulling back on the idea, desperately trying to convince players that they aren't space parasites (they totally are) and even wrote Zoe in a way that she wasn't possessed and erased inside her own body... or a creepy amalgamation of consciousnesses. Whatever. \n\nAudiences value characters that come into their own.  Even if a character is handed a mighty power, we like to see how they will go about wielding such strength in a mortal form (With great power comes great responsibility. To err is human. etc.)  Would we really like it if after Peter Parker got bitten he became the collective consciousness of the spider and a little bit of himself? I wouldn't.\n\nWhat is the winning move? I don't know.  It's hard to say with retcon. The characters weren't one way before and, through no storytelling  means, they have been fundamentally altered.  Riot isn't shy about retcon. Using retcon again could be one solution, but that might make other fans upset since having a character you like retconned away is a terrible feeling. The other solution could be just to elaborate more on the parasite process.  Maybe once some of the \"space sickness\" wears off the characters start settling back into their old selves.  At this point, I don't see a solution that makes both sets of fans happy since Riot has already created this messy divide through some sloppy storytelling.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-02-24T21:44:38.889+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Aspects is a terrible idea, it just sucks on Pantheon.

So I'm going to respond to all of this.  Now I don't know if you know who I am.  In fact, I'd be surprised if you did, since I'm just 1 of literally thousands of people on this board.  But I know who you are, and let me tell you I would never \"shoot the messenger\" especially if that messenger is you.  You have been nothing but polite, friendly, and professional in any post of yours I have seen.  Also, we share a liking of maps.  I have numerous negative qualities, but I would not attempt to belittle a man for engaging in the manner you have.\n\nBesides shooting the messenger is only useful as an act to start a war.  And since I am already fighting one war I'm going to lose on this board, why would I ever start another one?\n\nNow among my previously mentioned negative qualities I tend to create overly long posts.  Know I am trying to be direct and clear with my writing.  But I have been informed that what actually comes across is accusative and mean.  That is not my goal.  When reading what I'm about to write imagine not a screaming child, but your most boring professor you have ever had talking in a monotone about a topic only he is interested in.  That's far closer to what I actually am, so let's go from there.  A warning, this has been split into 2 sections.  I’m a wordy bastard.\n\nI think you're asking the wrong question.  The damage is done.  And it's Riot's fault, so I don't know what you expect to come from it.  So, from your idea.  Would Atreus coming back be better than what has currently been written?  Yes.  I actually expect that to happen in one form or another, since Jaredan himself responded after the initial shitstorm when the new lores were released that \"Atreus' story is not over\" pretty much tipping his hand on that reveal.  But does that make it good?  No.  It's still missing the point entirely from the old character, and replacing him with a possessed zombie god.\n\nRiot has repeatedly done this with their lore rewrites.  When reworking a piece of lore, instead of looking at what has been written before and saying \"How can we take this, but more awesome?\" they have gone \"Ok, well, I don't want to do this, how can we change it to something better?\"  This is especially the case with characters that seem more 'generic.'  Warwick isn't a werewolf anymore, that's boring.  That's been done.  Now he's a chimera with a robot arms!  Gangplank isn't a pirate.  That's boring.  That's been done.  Now he's a pirate with a robot arm!  Galio isn't a gargoyle.  That's boring.  That's been done.  Now he's the statue of liberty that punches people!  Pantheon isn't a Spartan.  That's boring.  That's been done.  Now he's a space god!  That’s all way better, right?\n\nThing is, there are people who like Spartans, far more than any of that space mumbo jumbo nonsense they've now saddled him with.  Now the Gangplank, and Warwick examples sort of work, because they still kinda deal with pirate and werewolf themes.  Warwick is still a transformed human, just through tech and not magic.  Or magi-tech I guess would be more accurate.  And the most famous pirates in fiction are missing limbs, replacing them with hooks and peglegs.  And it's not like the robot arms do anything.  They're just an aesthetic to make them look like Riot Products instead of just a pirate and a werewolf.  Which allows the creation of skins to appeal to the old aesthetic, Captain Gangplank and Grey Warwick, in this example. Galio just got the short end of the stick here. Really, his lore doesn't even make sense.  Why would anyone make that design for something that's supposed to be moved with an army?  Holy cow that's idiotic.  That would destroy the mobility of any army Demacia had sent forth.  Any other army could maneuver around them.  Who thought this was a good idea?\n\nBut going by story.  What does Spartan have to do with an extradimensional alien that possesses people?  Nothing, as far as I'm aware.  It was a change just because the writers wanted the change, they didn't think Pantheon fits the setting they're trying to make.  Unfortunately, that leads to a small problem.  You'll get people who do not care about the setting Riot is trying to make.  Like me.  I have read what they're making, and I think it's nonsense.  With no understanding of how economics, politics, and armies function at an even basic level.  Which is fine.  Not all fiction needs to be catered to me.  But that doesn't mean I want something I like to be changed into something I dislike in order to make it fit something I don't care about.\n\nWhich brings us to change and lore rewrites.  For the best example in recent history, which is fresh in all our minds, we can go to Varus.  Cards on the table.  I don't play Varus.  I don't care about Varus.  I think the cinematic you guys released with the lore rewrite was beautiful.  I think Riot is about 5 years too late on creating a homosexual character, of which Varus is only about 2/3 a homosexual character, but I'm not going to get into that.  But I also think, that the character that was created has nothing in common with the original Varus lore.  Now, people can claim that they both share the theme of revenge.  But you know what else does?  Count of Monte Cristo, the Illiad, and Kill Bill.  That doesn't count for much.  But the writers HAD to have known there would be backlash to that change.  I knew there would be backlash to the change as soon as I heard of the change.  An idiot would have been able to see that there would be backlash, and I don't think Riot is filled with idiots.  You don't make the most popular online game in the world, if you're entire lore team is still eating their own boogers.  \n\nBut they chose to go with their new direction anyway.  And now we're here with a new character and what was Varus is suddenly gone.  And he apparently had quite a few followers who were happy with the way things were and now they're just as suddenly angry.  \n\nNow don't get me wrong.  The new Varus lore is fine, in concept.  It's about time we got homosexual characters.  And the visuals are very pretty.  But that does not justify destroying something that the players loved just because the writers had a new idea they thought was cool.  That idea should have been placed on the next Darkin that was released, not warping something that already had a following to fit their new vision.\n\nThat's the solution.  How to win the unwinnable scenario?  The only winning move is not to play.  Don't put yourself in that position.  Develop out of the old lore, don't just scrap it and start anew.  \n\nAlright, so now Pantheon himself.  Honestly, if you want to cater to the players who think the new lore is pants on head stupid.  Like me.  When you rework him, make sure none of his abilities really have a heavy focus on the space magic, like how none of Gankgplank's abilities use his robo-arm, and then also release a Traditional Skin that's just Pantheon as a Spartan with a spear and a shield.  Preferably without any voice lines about the glory of the space empire.  \n\nDone.  I can just ignore the lore completely, and go back to playing the game.  \n\nIf you want ideas on how to improve the lore itself to satisfy people.  I don't think you can.  Here's what's important about Sparta:  They're physically human.  They gained their strength by training since they were 6.  Their strength is determined half by their own prowess, and half because they worked as a unit better than anyone else.  They're polite, but laconic.  They're (unlike the rest of the world at their time) all taught how to read, write, arithmetic, and memorize the state constitution and sacred texts.  But all of this comes at the cost of being disciplined above all else.  Of purposely being forced to live roughly, only given 1 cloak to wear day and night, hot and cold, battle or peace for the entire year.  Their goal is to make man \"perfect\" or at least their view of perfection.  Not by some outside means, but because they've gone through that training.\n\nThat's the opposite of a space power came and made you stronger.  That's a whole different power fantasy.  One is strength through adversity, discipline, and rugged living.  The other is strength through an outside force.  Like a D&D Paladin, only funkier in this case.  \n\nOnce you add the space powers, it's no longer a Spartan and no longer of interest to me.  I have long claimed that my favorite characters that Riot has made are Miss Fortune and Darius.  Miss Fortune beats her opponent because she trained to be the best shot she could.  She outmaneuvered her political opponents and kills them with her own hand.  She uses whatever is available to her and tries so damn hard to succeed.  Darius is the same.  He was nothing, and worked to become a general of Noxus.  It would destroy either character for me, if we suddenly learn that Miss Fortune succeeded because Nagakaborous blessed her.  Or she was born with the magic ability to always hit what she aims for.  That's bullocks.  That destroys what makes the character cool.\n\nTargon is not shaping into a story that interests  me.  Targon is about the mystery of the space parasites, and has been consistently downplaying the needs and desires of people in place of the \"divine.”  Now, Leona, Diana, and even Taric sort of work in the new Targon.  Because the first two always had their abilities granted by a divine being.  And Taric, with what lore he had, was an alien.  They fit, for the most part.  But just looking at their lore the characters and their motivations aren't even really the focus anymore.  Take the BIG MOMENT of Diana and Leona's lore.  The murder of the High Priests.  One, Leona was suddenly changed into an executioner when she used to be a protector just to fit the story beats.  Which is odd.  But, then Leona hunts down Diana.  Which makes sense.  Diana killed her teachers, political leaders, and priests.  She should be furious.  Now, it would have been better if we had made Leona act more like Old!Leona where she hesitated when she was ordered to kill Diana.  Which then allowed for Diana to kill the priests.  \n\nPart 2 in response.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2018-02-25T02:52:13.112+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Part 2\n\nThat could have sparked Leona's wrath with a bit of self-loathing thrown in to spice things up.  And it would have felt more true to Old!Leona.  But that's a tangent.  The actual important thing, is that once Leona gets possessed.  She suddenly loses all motivation, she no longer wants to hunt down the one that killed her new parents and defiled her religion.  That got zapped away in an instant, and now the eldritch entity in her mind says we should sit down and talk.  Which trickles down to everything in this setting.  The high solari priests were apparently the religious and political leaders of the entire mountain.  Able to just go to a Rakkor duel to the death and call it off.  So, what happens to this mountain when the entire religious and political world is destroyed?  All while apparently raiders are a common occurrence on their borders?  That’s an amazing story of political intrigue, hegemonic infighting, and civil war.  Which, you know, to go back to Targon’s earliest roots has a really obvious [historical counterpart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War) that would have a perfect role for your Spartan soldier.\n\nBut we don’t look at that consequence to the story.  After Diana and Leona, we get short stories of things basically just going on as things always went on.  Leona kills some bandits, Diana is off doing whatever she does away from the populace.  We get a huge curveball with Sol showing that the gods we’ve just been reading about are all just petty backstabbing bastards.  This is slightly toned down when some Demacian gets superpowers and is an ok dude.  But then the next bit of Targon lore we get?  It’s about a child who hasn’t mentally developed, despite being thousands of years old.  Then she does the medieval equivalent of a nuke on some poor guards, vaporizing them.  Then abandons this unarmed town which now must deal with spirits without the people who were trying to save the town from said spirits and with a world rune.  Which apparently is destruction incarnate.  And that apparently was how she delivers a message.  The message was supposed to be “Hey guys, there’s a world rune down there.  Maybe be careful about it.”  Somehow got translated into “Imma kill your guards and laugh.”  And that’s supposed to be the endearing character!  Endearing to whom?  Jhin?\n\nI don’t like this story.  I don’t care for these characters.  I’m pretty sure that the Targonian Aspects are basically one big example of a J. J. Abrams Mystery Box.  And even if they aren’t.  I’m out.  The writers have already lost me.  If this was a book I’d put it down and go read something else.  If it wasn’t for Pantheon being involved somehow, which directly relates to whether or not I get to play my main for the foreseeable future I would not be giving this stuff a second thought.\n\nYou ask for a possible synthesis of the old and the new.  A way to somehow make people who dislike Riot’s story to start liking it.  And that’s not going to happen.  There is no easy out in this situation.  I might get some enjoyment if we get Atreus kicking out his parasite, and throwing away his magic equipment and vowing to fight these “gods” that ruin everything they’re trying to protect.  But I wouldn’t consider that actually good storytelling.  That’s just another lore retcon done in a sloppy way.  Even if I would enjoy it.  But that’s the only way back from the place Riot has taken the Pantheon lore where it would even be acceptable to me.  \n\nWhich leads to another question that is going to contradict my entire lengthy post here. Whether I am worth catering too.  Because let me tell you.  I have already lost confidence that Riot can ever own up to their mistakes.  That sailed past over a year ago.  I don’t see that ever coming back.  Not when the writers pull the kind of crap where, if they get backlash, make the completely B.S. claim that the old lore they just deleted was “essentially finished with nowhere left to go.” Which is blatantly and obviously a lie, and Rioters have used it on multiple occasions.  That’s just disrespectful and arrogant that they think anyone would believe that. I’m sold out here.  \n\nI like Miss Fortune, because of the political intrigue of Bilgewater.  But there are more hints dropping about some dark ancient evil secret beneath the surface and the thought bores me.  I like Darius, but we’re getting more hints through Swain that there’s some other dark evil magic secret power that would take up Noxus without Swain’s guidance.  And that bores me, too.  Targon is only about ancient magic evils (and the Protector off being cool).  Darkin is all ancient magic evils.  The Watchers are all ancient magic evils.  Xerath is an ancient magic evil.  The Void is just an ancient magic evil.  Volibear is an ancient magic evil.  I don’t care about any of that.\n\nAt some point, Riot will just have to accept that their direction is going to push people away.  I already reached my limit.  When the Pantheon rework gets here if it’s a starry looking magic wielding nincompoop I’m leaving the game.  I’m a sunk cost on the road of making the game their vision.  I’m sure Riot will survive without me, and maybe it will be improved without me.  And if Pantheon remains a Spartan, I’ll be incredibly happy, but I don’t see Riot’s lore ever drawing me back in again.  My interests and the writers’ interests are far too disparate. \n\nAnd on a final note.  I hope you enjoyed your game night.  And Pandemic Legacy?  Nice choice.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-02-27T00:01:18.199+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't fear, Warlord - I can come across a bit dull-professor myself.

And it's Riot's fault, so I don't know what you expect to come from it.”\n\nI am very aware of the fact that any damage that has been done, HAS been done.  But as a rule, I try to focus on the future rather than the past. That’s why I am trying to be very solution-focused.\n\n>“Riot has repeatedly done this with their lore rewrites. When reworking a piece of lore, instead of looking at what has been written before and saying \"How can we take this, but more awesome?\" they have gone \"Ok, well, I don't want to do this, how can we change it to something better?\"”\n\nYou know what, I agree.  Not sure it was “I don’t want to do this” rather than perhaps “I think I have a better idea” but the result is similar.  What’s more important than _me_ agreeing, however, is that folks in the Narrative discipline seem to agree too (I won’t put words in their mouths).  \n\nThey are explicitly trying to identify when someone’s creativity starts to veer them into retcon-style rework rather than update-style rework (you may have seen Scathlocke talking about something like this) and reign it back on track.\n\n>“What does Spartan have to do with an extradimensional alien that possesses people? Nothing, as far as I'm aware. It was a change just because the writers wanted the change, they didn't think Pantheon fits the setting they're trying to make. Unfortunately, that leads to a small problem. You'll get people who do not care about the setting Riot is trying to make. Like me.”\n\nI’ve got a mix of stuff to comment on this.  Not sure that the urge was to change things for the sake of change - maybe it was, I wasn’t involved in those decisions but Rioters usually have road-to-hell-paving good intentions at the very least.  \n\nI can totally get that they’d want to make Pantheon more distinctive and uniquely Runeterran however - something that when you look at the character you think “Oh!  That’s Pantheon from League of Legends!” instead of “Oh!  That’s a random Spartan dude!”.  And of course that’s tricky - because folks, like yourself, WANT to go “Flipping yes!  I always wanted to play a Spartan dude!” so if it goes too far away from that really aspirational archetype, then you turn away the very players who would get hyped for that.  But if it’s too archetypal then you could confuse Pantheon for any other Spartan-like character in other media - other companies could release a really bad game with a character who looked just like Pantheon and we’d have a tricky time, legally, from being able to ask them to stop.\n\nSo yeah there’s a drive with some of the more archetypal (_not_ boring) champ types to make them a better fit with Runeterra, and more defensible and unique.\n\nAnd right now you’re seeing the growing pains right there.  Where is unique enough and where is losing _the very archetype that people loved in the first place_??  Where is bringing your own cool twist to a sweet fantasy, and where is driving away existing players?\n\nIMO, we’re still figuring out where that line was.  I _personally_ think we’ve definitely found the wrong side of the line a couple of times - gone too far and found the limit by screaming past it.  Like I said, Scathlocke has also said they’re explicitly looking to be less ‘retcon-styled’ in the future which, my belief is, that is a sign that the line has been identified, internalized, and deemed too far.  Riot’s a big beast now, and I have a sneaking suspicion that there’ll be a few last pieces that got finalized before this guidance came into force (or sometimes, something comes out super-quickly and folks don’t catch it).  Momentum is a thing.\n\nBut enough of all that!  Back to Pantheon and what’s the current state.\n\n**Source of Power - **\n\nYou object to his Source of Power (imma capitalize that) being external - from the Aspect from Targon.  You were engaged by the Source of Power being very internal, self-motivated, hard-won, and human.\n\n**Motivations - **\n\nCorrect me if I’m wrong, but I get that you viewed Pantheon’s motivations as being self improvement?  I’m not sure what it would be here, but then again, I personally (because I’m not on that team please don’t bite my head off) know what nu-Pantheon’s motivations are either.  Not sure it’s been made clear :/\n\n**Thematics - **\n\n(This is my view on these things - I may be wrong on all of these)\n\n* Old Pantheon - Discipline, Self-Reliance, Limits of Human Capabilities, Impossible Odds?\n* New Pantheon - Judgement, Astral Power, Impossible Odds, Sacrifice to a Greater Power?\n\nSo to me, it seems that fundamentally the Source of Power is the biggest sticking point here.  Even if we wiped the Pantheon personality from Atreus, him having literally SUPERnatural abilities would clash with the very human-centric ideal of the ‘Spartan’.  The thought that “If only I were born into a warrior culture, into the right class and sex, survived my nights of exposure on the mountain as a babe, trained from birth and managed to survive - I could have been that warrior.”  No amount of training could make you or I into the _Aspect_ Pantheon.\n\nDoes that sound about right?\n\nIf that’s the case, I think we may need to dig a bit more on this to find out if there’s a way we can reconcile this Source of Power issue.  Also, if you have thoughts on the movitation of Old Pantheon, I'd like to hear it (or if you have ideas for what New Pantheon's are).\n\nI think I’m going to follow your lead and break out into a Pt2 here, because the next segment is a bit of a topic jump and could be its own subject on its own.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-03-01T04:16:05.029+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr: *some* retcons are fine, but it should be a last resort, not a default solution.\n____\n\nWow, this thread is huge and I got some work to do, but promises, I'll come back later and read it in full. But for now, there is a rather short point I want to make. (EDIT: Hum, 4 paragraphs, that still counts as \"short\", right? I swear I tried x) )\n\n**I'm not opposed to retcons/rewrites.** I'd venture that most people aren't opposed to them **on principles** either. When Riot said \"Justifying the game in the lore is too limiting, it was a bad idea, let's remove the Institute of War.\", my reaction was: \"OK, I liked the originality of justifying the game, but I understand where you come from, keep going\". But **anything that doesn't directly relate to the IoW should have been considered still canon,** and taken as a starting point, and NOT open to a complete rewrite just because it was part of the old lore.\n\nIn more abstract terms, what I'd like to see is **an effort to make retcons as minimal as possible**. If something is really blocking, sure, go ahead, remove/rewrite it. If something is simply sub-optimal or annoying, well, what's done is done, deal with it. You'll do better in the future, I trust y'all, but you should be much more reluctant about changing the past just to improve it.\n\nConcretely, **there are ways to play around the old lore without actually retconning it.** You can leverage ambiguities, unreliable narrators, different points of view, you can go into more details, into  context that cast a situation under a whole new light. If I could see this kind of efforts to bend around old lore and make \"the Truth\" (i.e. the new lore) better without explicitly contradicting the old lore, I'd be happy.\n\nBut today, I get the feeling that everything that isn't perfect can potentially be deleted on a whim (and nothing is ever perfect). In the real world, you can't go back in the past and erase your mistakes like that; if you want people to be invested in your fictional universe, it should feel real, it should feel like actions have consequences and cannot be erased just like that.\n\n(I'm late to this thread, so even if you don't have time to answer, could you simply ping me if you read that post, just so I know you got it?

All while apparently raiders are a common occurrence on their borders? That’s an amazing story of political intrigue, hegemonic infighting, and civil war. Which, you know, to go back to Targon’s earliest roots has a really obvious historical counterpart that would have a perfect role for your Spartan soldier.”\n\nConsequences.  Oh yes.  Big thing that I’ve been looking into while I’m on the Worldbuilding team.  There’s a lot of catching up and ‘tech debt’ like stuff going on with this - and I tell you this not so that you can throw your hands up and cry “I knew it!” but so you can see how your concerns are being shared.  \n\nFor a while there, and to me this sounds insane, some folks were too intimidated to try to connect any stories together.  It seemed like introducing a new champ was a minefield of story that may or may not still be canon, may or may not be connected to a region that no-one could agree on the rulesets or history of.  A lot of stories, for example (and I’m sure you’ve noticed this and if you haven’t it’ll be really obvious now) only ever happen in one location - they don’t travel.  There’s a few exceptions - Taliyah’s story gets around, Taric goes on a wander, and Lux rides her horse for several days.  But for the most part, stories happen in one place, in one moment, and hardly ever involve other champs (thank goodness for Burning Tides et. al).\n\nWhy?  Because it was a nightmare to work in.\n\nNow even if you didn’t notice this explicitly, it probably sunk in on some level.  A feeling that things didn’t matter.  That things would go back to the way they were like at the end of a procedural TV show.  Heck, this is probably partly why the Journal of Justice is STILL missed by some players - because for all its failings (and boy, were there failings) at least it had champs going places, meeting each other, etc.\n\nIs this getting better?  Yes.  Yes I think it is thank goodness.  You’ll see that more locations are mentioned, with relation to each other, and soon more references to why things that happen today are the result of things that happened in the past.  That Runeterra is a world where a small but significant change _here_ will have knock on effects _there_ because of practical, understandable, connections.  The fact that people want to see these characters interacting in meaningful (consequential) ways is also being shouted loud from the internal Riot rooftops.  It’ll take a bit for these changes to build, however.\n\n>“Whether I am worth catering too. Because let me tell you. I have already lost confidence that Riot can ever own up to their mistakes. That sailed past over a year ago.”\n\nTakes a lot of maturity (and I do not mean that in any way patronizing - it really does and more people (including me) could stand to demonstrate it) to be able to identify that maybe sometimes something isn’t for you.  I hope that Pantheon CAN still be for you but that’s, on a person by person basis, up for them to decide.\n\nYou say “lost confidence that Riot can ever own up to their mistakes”.  Even if I were to stand here, and say “Riot made mistakes with these characters.” - surely that wouldn’t actually fix anything?  Wouldn’t that be simply words where actions are the only thing that matters?  What practical changes could actually start earning back little bits of Warlord Dienekes trust?\n\n---------\n\nPersonal note - sorry I disappeared over the weekend.

I have problems when it comes to expressing what's on my mind clearly to others, especially writing, in a way that's easily understandable. But in two posts you've basically summarized so much about how I felt. \n\nOne big example was the galio update. It felt to me they only made him gargoyle enough to pass as Galio. And what I hate about the new lore is that they introduce some new ideas that have just simply put, logical problems and almost never address it, answer questions or if they do they respond in memes and jokes. Back to galio as an example, he was built to be a mobile anti magic shield (all in his lore) , and this dude comes back with a statue of liberty? How do they move this? Demacia doesn't use magic and from what we can tell they aren't technologically advanced so how did they expect to move him? How was doran not put to death??? And on another note about galio, in his stories with Lux, how does he move and leave the damn city, without anyone noticing or being concerned? How is this not an issue and go unnoticed or without consequences??? Especially in a notably magic-phobic state? I think Galio was just made too huge, his stories and lore would make a lot more sense if he was even just 20 feet. Something that big moving in a war doesn't just disappear into folk tales, that makes no sense. \n\nAnd I think another problem with lore, is that it feels too fantastical. They are too many Gods and unbelievably powerful/ nigh all-powerful characters in the lore now. It's hard to really feel a sense of threat with so many godly level characters running around. There is too much magical powerful beings. I hate Zoe's lore, so much, she is a literal child given the powers of a God she killed people and we were supposed to ignore and say oh well you know she's a child and was defending herself. With the Zoe incident I can see why demacia is so magic-phobic. Lol she literally nuked some guards with families and that's never addressed. I much much prefer Annie's story, she's more relatable and when she killed that lady there it more sympathetic.\n\nChanges today feel like just for the sake of change. The Varus change solidified that in my mind because in posts and videos they said they knew it would have been controversial. I don't mind having a 3some character, I just don't think they needed to kill varus to do it, they should have just made a new champ that would have been the perfect win win. The people who defend and love the new Varus would have loved him all the same if it was a new champ, versus the old varus fans who loved his old lore who lost their champ and riot (I know/ hope they not) basically saying sorry ducks to be you\n**\nI haven't completely given up on lore** the I do admit I tend to hold out hope too much. \n\nI'm sorry that turned into a rant about Gallo, I love the way you think and hope you reply to this.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
