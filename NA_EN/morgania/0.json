What'd be really nice to have though, is the ability to have the images in a quality high enough that a single image could then span multiple displays.  In my case, I run 3 displays in a line, I'd like to be able to have the app ask me about my multi-display layout, and then \"split the image\" accordingly.  Have the each \"single\" image, span all 3 displays.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-05T23:50:47.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaaa I've seen a few players here and there talking about how the images only go so high in resolutions, so they haven't been able to have the images span desktops bigger than the highest res which causes some issues. Thanks for the heads up, but be sure to post this over in General Discussion and possibly Report a Bug as well to get more visibility!","replies":[]}]}
