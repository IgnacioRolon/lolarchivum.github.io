I've been playing this game since beta, and I've ran two teams before hand, both that got into gold ranking for teams. That's in the past, now lets talk about now.\n\nI'm looking for players who want to practice, and to learn together as a team, and willing to play a decent amount of games per day. I have an availabe schedule, so I should be on most of the day to be playing and practicing to get better. I've been playing alot of ADC and TOP recently, but those roles are still open for applications.\n\nCurrently looking for silver 2+, sorry for anyone lower.\n\nTop: Shogun / ?\nJungle:\nMid: 3clypse/LostBast\nAdc: Kinky Klinky\nSupport: Shogun / ?\n\nIf you're interested, the application for is:\n\nIGN:\nAvailability:\nAge:\nRank: \nRole applying for:\nChampion Pool:\nMicrophone/Ts:\nWhy you should be chosen?:\nYour one weakness?:","replies":[{"poster":"Shogun","date":"2015-02-12T03:51:35.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And supports!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shogun","date":"2015-02-12T03:43:55.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking for junglers to play right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lemony","date":"2015-02-09T08:25:17.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well... I tried to make a team, I made a logo and everything for it. I went all out, but the teammates let me down, so I know what you mean. I have been there. I also hate how they rank people in Solo/duo. I am always stuck in bronze, but EVERY game I play, I come out positive. I carry every game, I am a main mid. I use zed, Leblanc, annie, ahri, kat, kassadin, and sometimes heim mid. People get so mad at me when I play because they think I am a platinum player on a smurf account. When I am really not... I just play smart. I even win against champions that counter my champ. It's all about playing smart.\n\nReason why I want a new team: I am tired of looking, I am tired of losing because of my teammates being toxic and/or trolls. I want to take this game seriously. I am a gamer. And that's what a gamer is supposed to do.\n\nProof: You may check all of my match histories. Look at my K/D. Or you could just try me out and I am 100% positive that you will like my game play. Put me up against the best of the best. And the game will be ended in a Victory by me.\n\nIGN: Lemony","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shogun","date":"2015-02-09T02:53:32.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After this current game, looking for jungler tryouts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shogun","date":"2015-02-09T01:39:53.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently looking for jungler/top tryouts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shogun","date":"2015-02-09T00:38:49.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump!
