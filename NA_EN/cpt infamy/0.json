But I&#039;d like to be able to settle into a role or two. As far as my playstyle goes? I don&#039;t know... My friends have told me that I&#039;m a &quot;safe&quot; player (as I am usually a sniper in most games), but in my opinion im more of an &quot;Aggro Sniper&quot; (as in, I like to come out of nowhere, deal massive amounts of damage, and run away and dissapear). I&#039;ve noticed I&#039;m very bad at initiating teamfights so I don&#039;t want to be a tank or any kind of initiator...\r\n\r\nSuggestions anyone?","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-08-22T23:12:32.148+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should try to play mid or jungle and pick assassins if your playstyle is to do burst damage up close and get out.\nIf you like doing a lot of damage from a distance, then I suggest mid or adc role, and pick someone with a lot of range. For ADCs, Varus, Caitlyn, and Kog'Maw come to mind. For mid lane pick, I suggest Xerath, Azir, and maybe Lux?\n\n\nEither way, I think mid lane is your best pick.","replies":[{"poster":"cpt infamy","date":"2015-08-22T23:30:19.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do like assassins but theyre mostly jump in, burst damage, then kinda try to get away somehow.

However your playstyle as you put it was to come in, deal damage and leave with the possibility of getting a kill here or there. Have you tried jungling? Now there is a catch, if you decide to jungle you will have to work with your team to gank enemies and this could be a little heavier on the aggro than you might like but even if you don't grab a kill a jungler can help a lane by simply forcing the enemy lane champion to B thus giving your lane some free farm. \n\nWhy don't we start with, do you have any preferred champions? Anyone you especially like to play?","replies":[{"poster":"cpt infamy","date":"2015-08-22T23:00:25.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been putting some thought into jungling because that does seem like something that fits me but i haven't tried yet.. \nSomeone I do want to play very much is Ahri. ult in, throw combo, ult out.
