He never had a call for him having the hood on when he ulted. In this case, so this would technically be considered working as intended. This was a new feature brought into the game with Night Hunter Rengar, and the tech was limited. *Tbh, it still is.*\n\nIn order to change up the hood, we'd need designer help, and potentially new tech implemented. It isn't a super easy change to make - the animator tried, but it's not something that's purely animation. \n\nI've tossed this onto our backlog, but it won't be something that's heavily prioritized at this time.","replies":[{"poster":"ADC Genocide","date":"2017-12-01T03:12:28.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That makes a lot of sense actually, thank you for looking into it and for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-12-01T20:16:38.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
