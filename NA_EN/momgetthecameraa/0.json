Kinda sucks cuz I was really close to my hextech annie before and wasted money on those dang boxes and now I've gotta start all over.  I assumed it was something to do with the new client.  Doubt anyone got in, I use a very secure password that wouldn't be easily brute forced, and even if they did what on earth COULD they do with them to make them just disappear?  Didn't have extra boxes had the same amount, no extra skin shards or missing ones, just....the rare gemstones gone.  The only thing I can think of is that the data was somehow lost between clients, or was stored locally previously because I DID have to reinstall the game due to my Windows screwing up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MOMGETTHECAMERAA","date":"2017-03-27T06:46:33.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you but i got an email today, it says my account banned because of violation in my account..They banned me until 2100.
