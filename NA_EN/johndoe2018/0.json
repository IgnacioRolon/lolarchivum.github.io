What is the most OP champion, best rune build and etc?","replies":[{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-06-19T03:46:56.199+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is no \"most OP champion\" or \"op runepage\" build, it all comes down to who has more skill. streamers like to say things like \"this will 100% be nerfed\" but that's just clickbait to get you to watch the video. \n\nyou also have to get your current mentality out of the way; in no way are you going to win every mach. couple of tips though,\n\n- you're all over the place. literally stay playing one champion, and only that one champion for a while. once you get decent at that champion can you consider picking up another\n\n- avoid impulse buying champions, especially if they just stomped you, because your more often then not going to drop them immediately because you didn't get the KDA's you were expecting.\n\n- try and manage at least 6 CS/min. pros go for 10/min, but of course it looks like you're just starting out. so aim for 6 for now.\n\n- you might want to try aiming for champions who are less skill reliant then twisted fate, he actually requires a pretty decent amount of map awareness and macro knowledge to play properly. maybe try and stick to champions who can farm easily or control the lane well. toplane you have ones like toplane {{champion:86}} {{champion:122}}, midlane {{champion:1}} {{champion:99}}, ADC {{champion:51}} {{champion:18}}, Support {{champion:40}} {{champion:16}}, and jungle {{champion:9}} {{champion:19}}   (all these champions are super forgiving even if you screw up)\n\n- under no circumstances do you go into a game without flash, unless your taking ghost instead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-06-19T06:57:29.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> How can I win in every match?\n\nSimply put, you can't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"im still toxic","date":"2018-06-19T03:40:35.093+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not trying to be a dick, but you suck.
