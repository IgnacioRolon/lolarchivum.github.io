It isn't acceptable to tell someone that, even if they're the downfall of your team. You're more than welcome to test it if you want, but don't say  I didn't warn you. It's considered harassment, and could get you punished. I'm 100% positive everyone here has had a game where they've played terribly. It happens. Just put yourself in their shoes. Being rude isn't gonna make them play any better, but being kind, and letting them know it's ok, and encouraging them to keep playing just might.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LegitBusinessman","date":"2017-11-28T22:29:43.257+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is just my opinion, I'm being as realistic as possible.  You can't do anything.  The Ekko is gonna feed.  Fizz is gonna delete kids.  You're gonna lose.\n\nWhat can you say?  Nothing.  You can't change it.  You can't say anything toxic, you'll get banned.  Constructive criticism will be met 99% of the time with snarky remarks because no one is humble behind an anonymous screen and society as a whole is becoming incapable of taking constructive criticisms because it's all feel good safe spaces and unicorns.\n\nSo you do nothing.  Take the loss.  Get some coffee.  Requeue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2017-11-28T22:09:44.250+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"im well versed in this.\n\navoid any derogatory words directed at the enemy, replace with food.  \"you're bad\" is toxic, \"were losing because of you\" is toxic, \"vayne you cant split push bot alone 35mins into the game, that gets you killed, then we lose 4v5\" is not toxic. \n\nstrictly keep it factual, ie \"caitlyn you need more cs, ____ item, we have to group up and combo, you go first with _____\"\n\nyou are not toxic for talking about THE GAME, if they cant handle hard facts then chalk up the loss and move on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-28T22:27:10.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Toxicity is independent of fact. Theoretically no presence or absence of fact increases or decreases the toxicity of a statement.\n\nMy personal inclination however is that hurting people (for hurts sake) with truth is even worse of a thing than doing so with a lie\n\nAnd a person so bad or laggy they cannot fight can still be good for something if they buy vision and/or pushing items","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-11-28T22:21:25.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say no. If a player is playing badly, they might not know how to improve. Telling them that they suck, even if it is an objective fact, will not help them do this, and will usually just lead to them tilting even more and playing even worse.\n\nIf you want to talk to a player about their doing poorly, be supportive. It goes a long way with getting them to step up and cooperate with the team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Winek Chan","date":"2017-11-28T22:58:18.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing is objective except ideas","replies":[]}]}
