Just time your attacks right, to hit between the ADCs auto (most games your ADC won't be one-shotting all the melee creeps in the wave, and definitely not the cannon - same goes for mid/top). So sure, I'll make it easier on you when I'm intending to just stick around and waveclear the next wave anyways. \n\nHowever, let's say I just made a good trade and forced someone to B. I want to get some tower damage, or start Baron, or roam, etc... Any second extra I need to wait to give a support 24g because they can't time their auto for a relic proc properly is wasted time. So do it at the right time or miss the CS. I know it sucks to sit on unused stacks, but it helps the team more to have your strong mid Laner roam a few seconds earlier, or your strong ADC get a few extra autos on that tower, than it does to give your tank support an extra 24-100g for using a proc or three on melee/cannons.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2018-03-20T08:38:46.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"5 decently fed champs vs 4 poorly fed champs with fed 1 ADC if someone got a brain then how is gonna win?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-03-19T19:16:34.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is why i stopped playing blitz... i guess i could go back to coin on him.. but its just stupid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gelmous","date":"2018-03-19T22:38:07.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"hey man when we're pushing a lane to get inhib i don't have all day for you to sit there auto each single minion to get your 25 gold, you're slowing us down if i don't clear the wave because of you.\n\nthe downvotes with no counter argument only prove me right","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Bad Touch","date":"2018-03-19T18:01:05.665+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":12,"body":"Yeh... no.\n\nThey always end up overextending and getting reamed.
