This is absolutely oppressive in a lane where Leona is allowed to bully the crap out of the other support. Even if it's somebody who can counter her, if she can play confidently and get the other laner's scared of her? Oh my goodness. Once Kai'Sa is allowed to snowball, she dominates games. I think her best pairs would be Braum, Thresh, Leona and maybe Lulu.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Professor Ward","date":"2018-02-23T20:42:09.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a support {{champion:111}} main, he gets overlooked by leona a ton.
