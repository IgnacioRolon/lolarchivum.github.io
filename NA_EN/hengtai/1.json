{"poster":"HengTai","date":"2014-10-15T02:26:16.206+0000","title":"A Civilized Complaint on a Few Recent Splashes.","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":54,"down_votes":14,"body":"If you look at Ahri's original splash art, you can tell that her face is actually both taller and broader than the new one. The new splash, while it aims for a cuter and smaller look, ultimately doesn't make it look like the same person. Janna's splash art also suffers this but to a greater degree (she has a different body and facial structure in which she's too vertical and skinny : like a twig). Not to mention, I don't really know why Riot is trying to take an approach at making Ahri look less oriental. There's nothing wrong with trying to include every ethnicity in the game, but trying to change facial features for a different look on an existing champions simply makes a champion feel alienating to a player base. For example, if you look at any of Ahri's other skins then compare it to her new classic, it doesn't feel like the same champion. It would be the equivalent of trying to make a champion like xin zhao or Lucian have extremely \"generic\" facial features so that you could more or less not tell what specific ethnicity that individual is (for example, more beige skin, a generic eye structure, etc). I think most of the playerbase would understand this change of facial structures if this were a skin noncanon to the champion, but I think the defaults should do the original champion justice. Oh yeah, I think Ahri's splash might also look a tad better if you tried to make her lip color the same \"beige\" look as in her original splash art (but that's just my 2 cents).\n\nhttp://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/255/b/7/ahri_splash_art_by_aveldine-d5ej1ds.jpg\n\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SVAAVXUMURo/VDwpN4GPLvI/AAAAAAAAbJw/zq1fLshfmrU/s1600/Ahri_Splash_0.jpg\n\nAnd going back to Janna, the summation of my 2 cents is just that she look incredibly frail - like a stick. She's very tall, but also very skinny (both her body and her face). I also feel like the tattoos she originally had and her shorter, stockier look in her original looks better (Even Janna's noncanon skin, forecast Janna, displays Janna's physical features extremely well). I also don't get why she doesn't have pupils anymore. \n\nhttp://img2.leaguecraft.com/lol-splash-art/asset/wallpaper_760px_1522.jpg\n\nhttp://i.ytimg.com/vi/hoMBVHCKloY/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kAVW8jWV44E/VDwpOHJdPFI/AAAAAAAAbKE/xCjp3PlRVmE/s1600/Janna_Splash_0.jpg\nAnd going on to Lee Sin, both I and much of the community agree that while the skin is very well done, Lee Sin's, um, head and facial features doesn't look as good as it could be. Taking from another's post, this individual changed Lee Sin's current splash into one that looks, to many opinion's, better:\n\nhttp://i57.tinypic.com/sc45so.png\n\nThose facial features that are a result of ethnic quirks and details in a champion are really what define the familiarity in identifying with said champion. For instance, when Vladimir came put with his new splash art a year and a half ago, it was extremely well done because of the same feel it held to the original. It ultimately did it justice and even glorified what Vladimir \"felt\" like and was welcomed by the vast majority of the community with open arms. While I feel like the newest array of splashes have done extremely well in doing so (such as Akali's newest splash art) I feel like some of the champions have lost a sense of familiarity to them with their new defaults such as Lee Sin, Ahri, And Janna.\n\nhttp://www.leaguesplash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Vladimir-Classic-Original.jpg\n\nhttp://st.elohell.net/public/chill/a49160828f039486cc81df08a6479c0d.jpg\n\nFor example, in this fan art of Ahri and Janna (done by Artgerm [Stanley Lau] who did Leblanc's splash art and the Yasuo sneak preview arts), I feel like he really captures the champions really well not just in terms of their themes, but most impressively the facial struture of different champions that suit the individual very well:\n\nhttp://th06.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2013/253/5/3/foxy_ahri_by_artgerm-d6lqxo3.jpg\n\nhttp://artgerm.deviantart.com/art/Janna-Poster-Art-407610100\n\nDon't get me wrong. From an aesthetic point of view, the artists at Riot have done a phenomenal job (as with every splash art they release); however, I do feel like I'm not alone when I say that with the newest set of the splashes, I'm not the only individual who feels like some of the neweset splashes don't capture the \"feel\" of a familiar champion (because if they did, I don't think there would be so many people adusting the newest splashes on Lee Sin, Ahri, Etc.)\n\nHere are my splash edits so far. I'll try to do other ones later:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ytl3nLkh.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2014-10-15T16:58:17.947+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"I don't get this fuss around Ahri.

This is why players are drawn to certain splash arts. They fit a mold of beauty that isn't just another Americanized image. While ofc I like the new ahri splash I have to say that it loses that oriental beauty. There would have been a great way for them to make a new splash with an oriental beauty and still making her the most beautiful champ in the league. \n\nI think with Miss fortune around we don't really need much more American beauty. lol\n\nIts nice to showcase that League isn't just one people. When you start to model all the new splashes off the same idea of beauty then you start to make league more bland. Its like another thread I posted in about the new Kayle splash. In making it more sexualized and defining kayle being a she you lose that essence of difference. You start making every female champ a sex symbol instead of a champion that they are. I think this is where the core of the issue comes from with the Ahri splash. While she is clearly beautiful she is just not the same. She isn't who she was defined as for so long. This in turn changes the entire view of ahri.","replies":[{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2014-10-15T20:54:20.219+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"Well considering Ahri's theme, she should be the most sexualized champion in League (not in a vulgar way though) :P\nThe splash might not have as much \"oriental beaty\" as the old splash, but i'm fine with it.

Not exactly in a good way. And I will admit that while I own and quite like news reporter Janna, it's not the same face as the original Janna splash (or the new one for that matter) though in all fairness, she's in a different pose, moving towards the point of view, and having to look over her glasses which have been blown by the wind.\n\nShame the new Ahri splash looks so... different.

Everything else looks fine to me and is really well done. The only thing that they didn't do quite right is that her face looks very anglicized, and doesn't keep the original authentic Korean look that it was supposed to have.

Nasus still matches well with what makes Anubis look like Anubis.\n\nPantheon is based on a Spartan Hoplite, mixed with a Rettari. As far as I can tell, he's always conveyed these looks very well.\n\nAhri not being Korean is like Sejuani without a mace or Bristles / Kevin. Like Vladimir not holding a volume of blood. Like Graves not having a shotgun. Like Twisted Fate not throwing cards. Like Zac not being made of goo. Like Orianna without her ball. Like Riven without her broken blade.\n\nIt just doesn't capture the feel well enough of Ahri, not the feel that the original splash and kit give.
