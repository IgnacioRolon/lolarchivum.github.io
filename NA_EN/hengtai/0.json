As for Janna, I personally see her as more distant/unapproachable/ethereal than sexy, but views may vary.\n\nOne thing I'd like is for the community to broaden its view on \"sexy\". Sexy doesn't have to mean \"low amount of clothes\", sure Bikini Ahri can be sexy, but Slinky Dress Ahri can be just as sexy, if not more. In my view, sexy is more of an aura and presentation instead of just a lack of clothing. I think that the sexiest clothes are actually clothes that reveal a significant amount, but hint at what may lie underneath.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PutThe3dgeD0wn","date":"2014-11-25T21:12:25.849+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> does not piss off our respective female players by oversexualizing female champions.\n\n...
