Shen is my main and having his identity still be there with some more nimbleness for a fight is something im hoping for. I know you guys are probably far along with him but i have had some ideas for him too. Hopefully they're somewhat inline/reasonable.\n\nHis **W** could stay a shield(_smaller_ or _larger_) just lasting 1 second as if youre anticipating a hit. and upon successful timing _ie. shield pops_ you get an additional shield(_small_ or _large_) for a few seconds and a refund in energy.\n\nHis **E** could be the same initial _taunt _  but give it like a Renekton treatment(hitting a target allows you to do another dash), except, hitting an initial target or targets(+1 each maybe?) gives you more(_tauntless_/_dmgless_) dashes either each taking energy or replacing the current energy refund scale. \n\nOr instead maybe a short _stealth_ 1st parter and the single current dash 2nd parter.\n\nHis **Q** could do what it does now but maybe adds an _AoE_ that grants its _life tap_ effect? And if you hit the target actually marked by  **Q** with Ki Strike it would immediately _heal_ you instead of overtime, for that hit.\n\nor instead divide the damage up through multi part casts so you can mark multiple different targets to help your allies and yourself heal. \n\nAnd the **passive** and **ult** can stay largely the same. Full energy upon **ult** cast would be cool. I think this makes Shen feel the same and yet more like a ninja.\n\nAnyway, im sure Shen will turn out Fine, great hopefully, but these were some ideas i had come up with for some time now.

Forcing  him into being more evasive to me just feel like you are making him more one dimension. \n\nShen is more then a ninja or a sneaky sneaky ninja he is Shen. What is Shen you may ask. Let me tell you, Shen is they type of guy who can take a hit. His lore made him out to be a guy who can endure because his trial or test was to watch his father being torture and not even blink or get emotional about it. \n\n_Now I have faith that Riot would make Shen cool but all I'm saying is don't let the reason for his change is to make him more ninja-y and one dimensional_\n\nAlso I would also like to talk about Swain because he is similar to Shen but also an Inverse of Shen. Shen is a ninja but doesn't play like one where Swain is a Tactician who doesn't play like one. \n\n**Swain**\n\nFor me the Swain we currently have is fitting a lot of people want him to be more tactical like he plan a head but I don't think that is what he should be. To me the Swain we have is the other side of the Master Tactician. This side is the side that is just chilin in his oval office one some assassin sneak up on him an BOOM bird the word. This Swain although does not show the Master tactician side of Swain but it show the Bird man side which is equally part of Swain. \n\n**Conclusion **\n\nAll I'm saying is that the champions are **multi-dimensional **and they can be look at from different angles. Also any Naruto fan out there would know that Shinobi mean to endure which would make sense with Shen thematic and it would knock out two bird with one stone.

Definatly pick up a rabadons and a zhonyas at some point, if you are agianst an AD mid I would recommend going zhonyas first but it only because 100% crucial during team fights when you can get a big taunt then zhonyas the burst they throw at you afterwards.
