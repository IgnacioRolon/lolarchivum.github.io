The lore that Riot is producing right now doesn't add anything to the characters we experience in game /because/ these stories are about fighting and killing (bad guys).  Short stories focused on fighting and killing are duplicating the game, not adding to it. If we have Jayce running around in game swinging a giant hammer it takes no work or imagination to imagine him running around a city swinging a giant hammer or running around swinging a giant hammer at robots or whatever.\n\nAll of these vanilla pieces that seem like the writers spent more time with a thesaurus than an editor are a bunch of wasted opportunities.\n\nLike, contrast what Riot is doing with what Magic: The Gathering has. Magic has really high quality pieces that showcase character and tell stories and make you really connected to the flavorful cards - and a lot of it /isn't/ action sequences. When MTG posts a story, my friends will actually message saying that there was an update and then we can sit around at FNM and talk about how much we like Chandra and her cinnamon roll or Jace's cloak closet.\n\nLeague of Legends has a bunch of random oneshots about characters who for years have been established as \"good\" guys beating people up.\n\nPoor Leona who went from being a pacifist support whose raison d'etre was *not killing* to being... uh... grrr rawr kill raiders?\n\ntbh im probs just really salty because i used to love this game because of its lore (and i used to write a lot of fanfic for it) and the quality has spiraled so hard and the characters have turned to cardboard and it's making the game a lot less fun and i don't want to write fic for it anymore because i used to put literally hundreds of hours into it but now if i do that everything will just get reconned to shit under my feet","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-01-19T08:24:30.084+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Leona wasn't rawr kill raiders.

She refused to fight even when her own life was on the line in original lore, and it can be argued that she didn't act when she perhaps should have against the Solari elders and how they were treating Diana.\n\nThis makes her character then feel incredibly hollow when Riot's \"new\" lore completely disregards that. New Leona then feels like an imposter--she looks like Leona, is called Leona, but seems to share none of the defining characteristics that made Leona, well, _Leona_.\n\nIt's like the concept of AUs that you see in fandom all the time, except it feels like a failed front in that regard. Fandoms love creating AUs, toying with this idea that you can change the setting or times but that you can still insert the characters and they will shine through as who they are. It feels like Riot has completely lost the characters though, and it's incredibly disheartening for the playerbase and fans who actually did follow and care about the lore prior to now. I understand the desire to make things new and fresh, but when you change the core concepts behind a champ's personality or driving motivations, that's not reworking or tweaking the champ, it's simply creating a new persona that happens to share the same name and physical appearance...which is not what a lot of people wanted. Change isn't a bad thing, but change for the sake of change with no regard to what drives and defines the original character is just...disappointing at best.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2017-01-19T09:56:20.722+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"But why wasn't {{champion:254}}  piece about how she used her Gauntlets to save all the miners from the cave in ?\n\nDoes {{champion:64}}  not have any other interesting stories to tell besides killing people with his bare hands/feet?

Nothing about these stories is made with the intention of being a defining moment in their history, though that can and has worked in the past with instances such as Azir, Xerath, Illaoi, Renekton and Taliyah. As an example, look at Camille's colour text \"Tea with the Grey Lady\" and the short story \"The Weakest Heart\". The former story was built to showcase Camille in her element, to effectively show her off in the narrative. The latter story was a key moment in her life. These stories were made with different goals in mind, as one is a window in to the character's daily life, a window in to their thoughts and actions, while the other is a chapter in their story.\n\nColour Text is a showcase of a champion in a condensed narrative. Having champions excercising their power against random mooks works well for this as it provides an avenue for letting them strut their stuff in an environment that is appropriate for them. You could effectively title every colour text \"A day in the life of X\", because that's the whole point of their existence and why they're so much shorter than Riot's larger narrative endeavours like Progress Day, Burning Tides, Bloodline, The Bird and the Branch, Shadow and Fortune, The Weakest Heart and City of Iron and Glass.\n\nTL;DR Colour Text exists to put the character in the setting and show them off. They pit champs against random mooks for this purpose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Robertsmash","date":"2017-01-19T14:08:49.201+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shortstacks,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=UUU8Tzvr,comment-id=00000005,timestamp=2017-01-19T09:56:20.722+0000)\n>\n\n> WHY shoehorn a fight into {{champion:103}}  story when you could&#x27;ve made it about her summoning the courage to facade as a human during a festival and taking in all the wondrous parts of human society before having to leave reluctantly showing us JUST how badly she wants to be human and why she reveres them so much?\n\nNot gonna lie, that sounds like an amazing story.

It's established that he wasn't a good person before Singed even experimented on him, and that Singed chose him because he could see the beast beneath Warwick's skin. So he gets experimented on, turns into this awful beast. While I can buy this idea that when he's not in bloodlust, maybe he can think and talk etc. But there's absolutely nothing to sell me on the idea that Warwick as a character is going on some sort of crusade to \"clean up\" Zaun?\n\nThere's no drive, no explanation to such a motivation. It's not sold to me in his character. Why on earth would he suddenly have this massive change of heart that makes him want to specifically hunt murderers when 1) he wasn't a nice guy before and 2) he's now had the beast from within brought out to the surface? The logic does not follow, and so as a reader it doesn't make me buy in and suspend my disbelief. There's no reason for me to believe that this beast of a person and a creature is suddenly going to see the light and want to do good by anyone but himself. The writing never established any reason for me to believe in his humanity or morality, so why should it make sense to me for it to suddenly come to life now when he's arguably more evil than ever? It's a weak storyline, and that sort of contradictory writing is what put me off of a lot of these character reworks, unfortunately.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2017-01-19T19:08:48.283+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Here's my take of the piece—Interlocutioner can tell me I'm daffy when I'm being daffy:\n\n Warwick (though how reasonable he is at that point is highly debatable) through a tortuous experiment, and obvious shame and hatred of the man he was (he'd apparently been trying to leave it behind to no avail), accepts the monster Singed makes him into. He does so because he thinks that maybe Singed was right: Warwick was a monster all along.\n\nThat doesn't stop him hating the monster he sees in his memory. So, after being reborn, then hunting innocents all over the place with no rhyme or reason, his human consciousness resurfaces, and he is again faced with the brutality of the man he was and the monster he is. His hatred of himself, and the other predators in Zaun like him (as he sees them) means he decides to hunt them.\n\nWhen he hunts the monsters, he is feeding his bloodlust by trying to kill the monster he sees himself as. He instinctively knows who he should kill. He spent some part of his life trying to do so before. Now, with his memory and conscious mind fractured, it's become instinct.\n\nIt's an aspect of him that fuels inner conflict. Something we often strive for when developing characters.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-01-19T20:17:13.221+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like you're telling us more than showing us in the story.

I'm sorry to hear that you found the story lacking and Warwick's motivation scattered and confusing. To be honest, it's been a huge challenge writing pieces for Warwick that convey a complete picture of his emotional journey, because his own memories aren't complete. \n\nEven if they were, and I wrote them all into a story word-by-word, the bios and \"color text\" (Riot's weird internal term) are never the complete story of the character. They're not even my favorite part! My favorite part is when YOU ALL take Warwick, or any character, into the game, and follow them for a short time, building new stories in your head. Embodying the character. Wielding their teeth and claws and meeps. Et cetera! You all give these characters life in your imaginations. You create them, not us.\n\nIf that's not a good enough answer (it's probably not, because no answer will change how you feel and how you feel is VALID, all stories are open to interpretation, and can be better), I'll add one more thing.

I completely understand that you all at Riot are trying hard to improve the lore and stories, and I do want to thank you for that and taking the time to respond to my comment.\n\nI will piggy back onto the comment Chromatic Eagle made below, though, in terms of my own critical feedback (and the reason why I'm writing is because I'm hoping the people who work on lore can hear from community what we want and why we get upset about certain things). I hear entirely what you're saying above, but it does feel incredibly as though you're explaining that to me now, but it doesn't show at all in the stories or lore itself. And that it was makes the work feel very...odd and disappointing. The lore does connect us readers to this idea that Warwick as a person was trying before now to better himself; no where do the stories or writing convincingly sell to the readers this internal conflict. And when characterization isn't sold well, it makes it that much harder for readers to suspend their disbelief and emotionally connect and believe in the way a character acts based off of their impression of him. For Warwick, we are never given a good reason or showing of his character to make us believe that this is a guy with reason to want to \"be better\", if that makes sense.\n\nI want to see conflict and growth--it's the core concept in making a three-dimensional and multi-layered character. But it requires the writings to make the character compelling to me first. So not being told \"oh, he wanted to do better before and now wants to do better again\", but being shown through the lore and stories how this champs acts and what truly drives him.

And I find Millar's Red Son Superman to be a more challenging, interesting version of the character than even All-Star. It's just depressing. \n\nAnd when I picture Veigar, I see him floating away from Bandle City holding a clutch of balloons. To this very day.\n\nSometimes iconic things like this come back to a character eventually.\n\nThey took Superman's red underwear away. Let's see if it comes back in a few years.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-01-29T00:37:30.278+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please stop comparing League to comic books.

W H Y. The \"urge to hunt\"? The short story the lore team (meaning who? the lack of attribution to the stories is really weird - and you can tell when some of the stuff that's written is honest to god lower quality writing) came up with for her doesn't explain why she she chose that particular guy to kill. \n\nThe fact that he's some kind of child predator doesn't explain why Cassiopeia would decide to kill him over anyone else and it feels like I'm reading something meant for elementary school kids that I'm expected to accept a motive that thin.\n\nCassiopeia going out of her way to target a child murderer makes her a shallow character.\n\nIt would have made more sense for her character for her to have killed more randomly - and it would not have made her a \"straight up villain\" if it were executed properly by supplying more pathos and motive.\n\nWhy would Cassiopeia care about random murderers killing children? If you stop and think about the organization of Noxus and Cassiopeia's background, it's not actually a logical imperative that she take an interest in the welfare of street people. She was an aristocrat in a society that values individual strength (I assume it still does - everything is being retconned these days). If you assume that her old lore still holds somewhat true, then her pre-snake life revolved around plots involving very high status people, if not straight up focusing on seducing them. Street children are not \"her people.\" She wouldn't have spent a lot of time around them, she wouldn't benefit from their well-being, she might very well not even know how they live.\n\nIf you think she's similar to her sister, Katarina, then (considering the mood of Katarina's character and her in game lines) it's a stretch to suppose that Cassiopeia is hunting murderers out of the goodness of her heart.\n\nIf you think she's dissimilar to her sister and does care about people - then, okay, sure, but you need to do the work to show that. Stabbing Sivir in the back doesn't really support it.\n\nAnd if you think that being turned into a snake made her heart grow a few sizes - okay, but her canon lore gives absolutely no indication of that?\n\nAnd if you think she's murdering murders because no one will care - that wasn't a reason given in the story (and if we imagine that Noxus is focused on individual strength, what kind of government system would that create? Would that system lend itself to a modern and effective police force? Probably not - policing is actually a really recent phenomenon - but, then, the lore these days is doing some really serious \"it's fantasy, it doesn't have to make sense\" like with how Noxus is an effective military despite seeming disorganized when all of military history has been leading towards more highly organized armies on account of their efficacy - so whatever I guess).\n\nCassiopeia isn't a villain or a hero because she's not a person.\n\nShe doesn't make sense.\n\nShe has no depth.\n\nShe's motivated by desires that we're told about, not shown, and even then we're not told everything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"duckarp","date":"2017-01-19T10:06:25.526+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which villain (or even a real-life \"bad\" person) genuinely thinks he is doing a really bad thing?

I'm so tired of being told by riot that they intend to keep the core of the character alive when the lore team does the exact opposite. Sometimes I wonder if they even bother to look up what they are writing about before they put pen to paper. Warwick isnt even the only one who has taken a complete 180 but ill just focus on him.\n\nWhy is he no longer a blood hunter of his own choosing? Why is he now a gangster who is experimented on by singed? Who might I remind was his friend in the old lore.  Why is he a vigilante? Is he not supposed to be a feral beast? Why does he hunt criminals? How would he even know the criminals from the innocents? Does he have some sort of super power to tell who is a killer and who isn't? Don't try to tell me its because they smell of blood because people wash their hands and innocents get blood on their hands too.  Why are both his lore and short story so darn contradictory?\n\nWe are constantly told he is feral by the writers that he struggles with himself, that he isn't cunning and that is how Rengar and Warwick are different. Rengar is a clever, cunning hunter and Warwick isn't. Did you even read what you wrote before it was published then? What I read was a cunning hunter leading his bait  towards his prey to draw them out. He was herding her and he was thinking the ENTIRE time he was doing it. During his 'bloodrage' he was  thinking the entire time.\n\n The.Entire.Time. \n\nThat's not instinct driven.\n\n I cant buy what im being sold because it feels like im being lied to the entire time.  All of these characters ive come to love are losing the soul of who they are. Warwick is no longer a deplorable jerk who chose his own path. Leona is no longer a pacifist.

Some were just the same story repeating itself to the letter: X Champion encounters Baron von Badguy & co. and kills them. I think that story's perfectly fine for someone like {{champion:51}} , {{champion:89}} , {{champion:64}} , and even {{champion:103}} . However, it was out of place, even a little cringey, when someone like {{champion:9}}, of all characters, was playing the role of \"sweet, retribution against the villains\". It just gets boring after awhile when the same exact story is repeated over and over again.\n\nOn the other hand, lore-pieces like {{champion:245}}, {{champion:61}}, and {{champion:24}}'s were, I think, quite good. It showed a slice of life of the character that's different from in-game, yet still recognizable, and expands upon the world around them. \nI think the appeal of the large cast of characters League has is precisely that not all characters are good, or even neutral. Sometimes, you want to play as the villain (like, the truly world-threatening, no redeemable qualities villains) and get inside their mindset.\n{{champion:82}}, {{champion:421}}, and {{champion:202}} had some really fun lore-pieces that showcased their abilities and characters without just being a cookie-cutter \"the evil shall pay\" story.\n\nGood, even excellent stories have been produced so far. At the same time, there have also been ones that just feel bland, un-engaging, and even lazy. I'm hoping some of these are just \"warm-ups\", and that we'll continue to get the more varied stories like {{champion:40}}  or {{champion:420}}'s, and not just {{champion:18}} or {{champion:80}}'s again.","replies":[{"poster":"LegoLogos","date":"2017-01-19T13:55:35.141+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for bringing up these points. One of the big things for me is that I don't want to just come across as indiscriminately flaming the lore team. I understand they put time and work into their stories--so much of it for me (as a writer myself) is that I want to give feedback so they know how fans feel about some of their decisions, and why.\n\nLike I think some of the stories and reworks they've done have been really cool. The Bilgewater event is a key example for me.  I think you guys and gals added a massive amount of depth to pre-existing champs like {{champion:41}} , {{champion:21}}  (minus the whole her hair turned red from blood riot plz), {{champion:104}} , and {{champion:4}} . It was a shining example of taking characters who had previously maybe been a bit flat and tropey, and actually giving them more depth and motivations that made sense to the characters. We see the avarice and ambition of Gangplank, the revenge that drives Miss Fortune, and the greed and betrayal that warped Graves and Twisted Fate. It was, over all, an awesome job. Shurima was another good example (and I loved the stories showing the interactions between {{champion:15}} , {{champion:163}} , and {{champion:75}} ).\n\nGive us more of that.\n\nBut also be aware about examples that don't sit well with the playerbase and fans. Understand why people are upset about {{champion:89}} suddenly not being a pacifist anymore, or {{champion:51}} letting a criminal go, or {{champion:19}} being a bloodhunter who for no believable reason is suddenly trying to clean up Zaun and hunt only murderers. The reason why people are upset is because these changes aren't true to the original characters, and so they feel cheap, flat, and like changes that betray the original champs for no other reason than the sake of edginess and change. Changes, when they happen, have to be for valid and believable reasons--and they should always enrich the champion, not undermine who they are as a character.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cinis","date":"2017-01-19T21:21:36.530+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"This entire discussion is depressing.\n\nThere isn't and there never has been transparency or accountability at Riot when it comes to lore.\n\nFor all we know, the people writing the stuff we're upset with are literally visual artists who have no experience or training in fiction writing.\n\nMaybe Riot has a coder moonlighting as an editor.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, it's probably cheaper than using talented professionals.\n\n(I showed some of the recent shorts to a friend who worked as a professional editor before going to law school - she said she used to be a middle school teacher and that her students could have produced the same quality of content, if not done better)\n\nSo this clever policy of not telling us anything about the process except via red colored screen names means there's not even anyone to be upset with - it's just this vague sense that somewhere inside an inscrutable corporation, someone is making a bad decision anonymously.\n\nBeing upset about Riot's work is like being upset with politics.\n\nNothing any of us say or think matters.\n\nIt doesn't matter how right or wrong we are, it doesn't matter how waterproof the arguments get - it either goes into a black box (and perhaps inside the black box it gets confirmation bias'd out of existence) or it never even gets into the black box.\n\nCritiques about the lore, no matter how strong, are totally worthless.\n\nIn the end though, this is a consumer product.\n\nI'm a consumer.
