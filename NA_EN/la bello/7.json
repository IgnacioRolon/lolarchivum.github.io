Is the number of Key Frags you get based off your recent honors or something? It feels really wierd to see only 2 KF instead of 4 because it gives me the subconscious thought that I've been doing something wrong or offending people.","replies":[{"poster":"DuckCurry","date":"2017-07-06T17:39:35.372+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't go into the details, but there is a bit of randomness to it, and the overall number of key frags you can earn hasn't changed since the last system. Generally, the more games you play, the more keys you'll earn, up to a limit.\n\nReports alone won't impact your drops, unless they're validated by our systems and escalate into chat restrictions or worse.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-07-06T18:29:22.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are frags earned through capsules part of the 12 per ~month cap, or are capsule fragments bonus ones?","replies":[{"poster":"DuckCurry","date":"2017-07-11T15:42:16.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good question.... there's both. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}} \n\nCapsules are meant to be more engaging than their straight up key frag counterparts, so they usually come sprinkled with some sort of bonus. We'll be monitoring how this plays out over time and they'll be subject to tuning and adjustments, so this may change over time.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-07-11T23:24:31.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting. \n\nSo from the sounds of things, I might get 10 key fragments directly, get a capsule containing 2 fragments, and then still be eligible for 1 (but not 2) direct key fragment drops, managing 13 fragments in a month where I was both diligent in playing a lot and honourable.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm quite appreciative of a free means to exceed the 12/month cap in theory, although I appreciate that the tuning around it might be delicate. I've currently got at least a couple chests that I'll never be able to open currently if I keep getting weekly S rank chests (which I expect to be able to do), since I wasn't able to cap out my frags every month. The ability to in theory eventually open them with diligence and a bit of luck makes the system feel a lot better, instead of being 'forced' to buy keys to ever open them.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BabyNaix","date":"2017-07-17T20:24:37.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you get key fragments from co op vs ai games?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-07-03T20:13:19.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"depends on how many games you played since you got your last key fragment.","replies":[{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2017-07-03T20:27:04.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is there a citation for this or are you just guessing?
