Plan is to tidy the definitions of those up a bit and throw them into a devblog for anyone that's interested.\n\nLooking forward to this DevBlog!\n\nSo the enchanter class has been doing very well with the changes to Spellthief and the introduction of Thunderlord's Decree. However, they still have the marksman issue of them being quite similar (Sona and Nami are both generalists, Janna and Lulu are both hyper mobile and excellent peelers. Bard and reworked Soraka are good though).\n\nDo you think you might be making room for their update late 2016/early 2017 or do assassins have priority here?","replies":[]},{"poster":"PÃ¡y","date":"2016-01-07T09:20:54.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, did I read Yorick update might be coming soonâ¢?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2016-01-07T05:27:30.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since I think this is kind of related,I like to ask about {{champion:78}}.\nNow that the update have been out for a month,any new or improved thoughts on her?Or have Riot not have enough time to developed their thoughts on her since the holiday break?\n\nI know her win-rates aren't anything to write home about,especially after a month.And there some other issues that could be improved like her E (She occasionally stops mid dash rather than traveling with the target meaning she just pushes the target away from her).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brutusness","date":"2016-01-07T04:30:39.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=m7515q7e,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-01-07T00:30:54.626+0000)\n>\n> Larger class updates like the Marksmen one take quite a bit of work, so we're probably looking at a couple of those a year.

If he needs work, it should go beyond just nerfing an important ability and leaving him. He needs to be able to deal with his lack of mobility, and nerfing his snare isn't it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cogdacig","date":"2016-01-07T03:50:33.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=m7515q7e,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-01-07T00:30:54.626+0000)\n>\n> Larger class updates like the Marksmen one take quite a bit of work, so we're probably looking at a couple of those a year.
