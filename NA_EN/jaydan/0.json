Im not getting the \"expected argument 'c'\" anymore but instead nothing when i open up my client, i opened up the old client and it comes up with the launch page but with upon launching nothing else happens, no game, nothing. I then found a post for erors with ACCESS_VIOLATION in module League of Legends- GAME CRASH/Help! saying in your league folder is you delete game.cfg and PersistedSettings.json after restarting this would work. Yet it still hasnt done anything for me, im in a bit of a stump and anyone that has any idea of how i can fix this problem please helpppppp im in much need of it. ty \r\n\r\n(P.S) i also have already repair my client and currently doing so again to see if luck is on my side xD and i dont want to contact riot support cause all they seem to do is send random links and take 10 years hehe xd","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-08T19:30:31.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your PC needs to allow the client to launch, otherwise it will not appear at all or give an error.  Your best bet is to use the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to fix this up.  I highly advise against modifying or deleting any files as that can end up causing you more problems.
