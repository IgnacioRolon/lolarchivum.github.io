We're not seeing that same outcome from our own analysis. The win rate you link there's got an extremely small sample size (190 games), which means it's not a reliable number. There'll also be significant correlation between better Zed players and those that take the appropriate masteries. That means that, rather than just comparing different masteries, you're comparing average players with ok masteries to experienced players with better masteries. \n\nOverall we're confident that the current masteries don't serve some classes well enough, with AD assassins being one of the most in need cases, given they've also lost power from the AD itemization changes in the preseason.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2015-12-08T00:58:28.933+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What other classes besides AD assassins are the new masteries not serving well?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-12-08T01:13:36.278+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Current plan is to keep adding masteries over time until we've got 3 options for each of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 keystones (the one point tiers).

He excels at alot of things but teamfights (I assume thats what you meant by \"chaos\") is not one of them and honestly that is perfectly fine. He has a very unique playstyle and can shut down the opposing jungler. The only thing that annoys me is his hybrid scalings. Either make him AP or make him AD . Also a major issue is the general clunkyness of his ult.\n\n\nTrust me.

Very powerful early-mid game. Lategame he falls off as the counterplay to his ult becomes available and most carries can lifesteal or be healed through his damage. This doesnt make him completely useless he simply has to be smarter about choosing his fights (maybe jumping onto that 6 slotted Vayne is a bad idea)\n","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ExecutorDill","date":"2015-12-08T05:14:10.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AKA Another NERF to mages (T_T)\n\n{{item:3070}} {{champion:4}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}
