So I rushed into LoL to go buy it, but I can&rsquo;t. \r\nI am (im)patiently waiting for it to be out to buy, but I have no clue why it isn&rsquo;t now. \r\nIt&rsquo;s under Ekko&rsquo;s skins on LoL, and I can see it but can&rsquo;t purchase it with the RP I&rsquo;ve been saving forever. \r\nI&rsquo;m sure it will be out to buy soon, but can someone - anyone - tell me why it isn&rsquo;t available to buy now? \r\nThank you very very much if you help me out!\r\n\r\n~Maƒçi\r\n\r\nP.S. Btw any Ekko tips are welcome here haha.","replies":[]}
