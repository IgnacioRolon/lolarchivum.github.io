This has happened with both the legacy and new client. Sometimes, I also won't be able to re-log into my account until after the current game is over, with the \"unexpected error has occurred\" message showing up.\r\n\r\nI've tried most fixes, used the hextech repair tool, allowed League through the firewall and inbound connections, and used every fix i could find on the forums but still no luck. It's pretty frustrating especially since I now have very long leaverbuster wait times. Any response would be much appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-03T05:47:02.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some of the symptoms you've described are pretty common for general *unstable connections* to our gameservers.
