First, because that would mean the IFS was working without a report filed. That would hurt 5 man groups that are having fun together. Second, because playing 4v5 isn't fun.\n\nSo, for the period from when they start flaming till the end of the game, every potential punishment functions exactly the same. Permaban, ID ban, finding their houses and burning their computers; that'd all be functionally the same during the game. Punishments will happen after the game. With that as a basis, we have to decide how to act during that time. I've decided to mute them in my games. There's no reason to listen to them. In effect, you hold the key to stopping their flame instantly. Press TAB to bring up the scoreboard, and there are 3 mute buttons by each portrait. Mute Chat, Mute Pings, and Mute Emotes. Click em.\n\nInsulting others is against the rules. Report them after the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-12-07T05:18:49.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont play competitive or possibly any multiplayer games if you are _this_ fragile.\n\nThere is no way to instantly ban anyone who steps on your delicate feelings, let alone fairly.

Maybe they dont want to invest in a better system for a reason.... AAAA maybe like more profit?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-12-07T05:17:49.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot cant stop them from flaming you. They are a game company, not a diety with magical powers to control people. They can punish them AFTER the flame. Thats all they can do, and it is indeed what they do. You can prevent the flame from entering your world though. You can mute, or disable chat. Try it out for a while. I know its hard at first because you fear not seeing the chat in game and kinda maybe fear that you will feel isolated. But just try it for a few games. You might actually like it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skeleton Matrix","date":"2019-12-08T19:53:30.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]}
