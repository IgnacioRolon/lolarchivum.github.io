I noticed my launcher file was not in RADS -> Projects and tried to use the repair tool which did nothing then did a reinstall. The reinstall put the launcher folder back into its place and then I played a game or two for the night then shut down my computer. I turned my computer back on to play again today and could not load the game up after champion select and noticed the folder was once again gone. I am redownloading and going to test if it happens to be my antivirus (AVG) or if it won't continue to happen but I wonder if this is a common/known problem since I know many client/pre-game issues happen daily.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-22T03:01:04.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not 100% sure which you're talking about in the RADS-> Projects folder, but you should be able to launch the game normally by simply using the desktop shortcut or this file in the normal League of Legends Folder.

Everyone who I play with have these folders and they have been there on clean installs and work but when they are gone I can't load into a game after champion select. I can get into the client but not into an actual game once champion select is over.","replies":[]}]}
