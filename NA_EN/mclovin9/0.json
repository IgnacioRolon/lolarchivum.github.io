You don't have to combine the two together!  It works just the same as the new player or day one chests that you obtained at level 5.  \n\nLooking into your account, though, I wasn't able to find any chests on your account.  You'll need to get some, through RP or mastery chests per the [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[]}]}
