One arm looks bigger than the other, giant elephant feet, legs too small, torso could not support that upper body.\n * **HIS TONGUE COLOR DOES NOT MATCH THE ART COLOR**\n * Hair looks like a giant spiky pit.\n * Why does he have 3 toes on each foot but 5 fingers on each hand?\n * His animations, likewise, are pretty bad. \n\nMundo does look like he could fit in pretty nicely in an old PS1 game like Spyro: The Dragon\nhttp://cdn1us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/styles/main_wide/public/2017/08/spyro.jpg?itok=PSU2lbw3\n\n All too often I think we give Mundo a pass because he's iconic and a lot of people really like his old model. *That does not excuse the shape he is in, however!*\n\nA VGU on this guy would be epic, though his kit is strange and probably outdated I don't think he needs a total rework like Sion but improving his animations and model would go a long way.
