Having huge stockpiles of Demacian Steel maybe a bit much, but then again I don&#039;t think it&#039;s super rare considering {{champion:3}}  is made of the stuff.\n\nIn addition to that insane fire rate in her comic her guns are shown to have so much recoil an adult man is thrown backwards firing them just once, so each bullet from her gun should be packing quite a bit of energy probably comparable to a modern autocannon like the 25mm Bushmaster. Though this isn&#039;t too crazy considering how super powered {{champion:104}} shotgun was in the New Dawn cinematic, that thing could easily turn a man to mulch with a single shot. But not only does Miss Fortune have to be super strong to hold her weapons she has to have some way to totally mitigate recoil as she&#039;s never shown experiencing it when firing her guns and she wields them with expert finesse. \n\nSo all of this put together she has got to be some sort of gun mage.\n\n\nhttps://universe-meeps.leagueoflegends.com/v1/assets/images/image-gallery/miss_fortune_vs_gp.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Choke Me Chun Li","date":"2018-10-21T00:50:44.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She dipped her bullets in a mix she made “Every one’s been dipped in Myron’s Dark,” probably referencing impure shots, and her guns have a reloading mechanism \"She twisted the wheel-lock on each pistol and ingenious mechanisms within reloaded each one.\" And for the recoil maybe shes just strong ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-10-21T04:01:31.084+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Choke Me Chun Li,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=tEFzAF66,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2018-10-21T00:50:44.108+0000)\n>\n> She dipped her bullets in a mix she made “Every one’s been dipped in Myron’s Dark,” probably referencing impure shots, and her guns have a reloading mechanism &quot;She twisted the wheel-lock on each pistol and ingenious mechanisms within reloaded each one.&quot; And for the recoil maybe shes just strong ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.\n\nMyron's Dark is a brand of rum, actually.

It even show summoners and the champions in the animation were comppletely random, some of them robally never encountered each other in the lore.\n____________________\n>  \"Make it Rain\" is described similarly as Miss Fortune firing hundreds of bullets into the air and raining them down on the enemy, this is cool and all but her weapons are just a pair of muskets, and considering she does this in about a second, she's loading and firing her guns faster than a minigun at 6000rpm at a minimum. \n\nAgain, the game isnt 1:1 with the lore, I mean, why would Miss Fortune even bother shoot in the sky and trust in the gravity to bring her bullets at the exact point she want them to reach(and fast enough to kill a man), when she can just shoot them in the face of her enimies? The ability in general dont makes any sense from a lore point view.\n_______________________________\n> All without any sort of advanced loading mechanism present on her guns or even giant drums of ammunition to even feed the guns (where is that ammo even stored?).\n\n Choke Me Chun Li already answered this so I gonna skip it.\n______________________\n> And speaking of ammunition her bullets in the Harrowing story were capable of hurting ghosts as well, something only demacian steel or powerful magic could achieve.\n\nThey didnt really hurt the ghosts, it was just temporary:\n> The mist began coalescing throughout the square, first in thin tendrils and wisps, then in glowing outlines of monsters; things with conjoined legs, fang-filled jaws, and arms that ended in hooks or pincers.

She’d wanted to show the people of Bilgewater they didn’t need Gangplank, that they could forge their own destiny.\n\n_________________\n> Having huge stockpiles of Demacian Steel maybe a bit much, but then again I don't think it's super rare considering {{champion:3}} is made of the stuff.\n\nMiss Fortune's blade in Shadow and Fortune was made of Demacian stell, and she left pretty clear the difference between the blade and the bullets:\n> She slashed her looted sword through the creatures and felt the same bite she’d felt before. Her bullets might be useless against the dead, but this Demacian blade hurt them. They fell back from her, screeching and hissing. \n\nAlso Galio isnt made of Demacian stell, he is made of Petricite. The map mentions that Demacian stell resistance against magic comes from \"blessed waters\" not the stell itself, and in the /Dev of Demacia they mentioned how Demacian stell was _suggested_ to have middle magical resistance, while Petricite was stated to have protection against magic. Until stated otherwise, I believe that Petricite and Demacian stell are unconnected. \nAnyway, I can understand why Demacians have so many Petricite. I mean, have you seen those Petricite trees in Ryze's animations, they're just..._a llittle_ big for trees.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeracadaVenom","date":"2018-10-21T05:29:30.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But that’s just a theory\nA GAME THEORY\nTHANKS FOR READING","replies":[]},{"poster":"ez mental boom","date":"2018-10-21T00:48:10.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"She uses mana, so sure why not","replies":[]},{"poster":"RookPusher","date":"2018-10-22T20:36:10.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's not a mage she's a goddess.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Minimac2000","date":"2018-10-22T20:31:08.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure {{champion:3}}  is actually made of petricite not demacian steel","replies":[]},{"poster":"Criomhthann","date":"2018-10-21T05:23:55.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gameplay and story segregation.

They're blunderbusses (specifically, they're dragons).  Those were often loaded with multiple projectiles (think of birdshot, buckshot, etc.), and there are historical reports of users shoving random junk in them like eating utensils, rocks, or shards of glass.  MF's dragons have exaggerated proportions, so the amount of crap in a single load could be substantial, although that still wouldn't account for the multiple waves fired.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Caretaker Jack","date":"2018-10-21T19:01:48.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it's just the guns are magical...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hter","date":"2018-10-21T05:17:21.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"Pls Buff Shaco he is useless.
