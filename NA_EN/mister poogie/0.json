In order to resolve this, we'll need to complete a reset of the configuration file saved server-side that has that incompatible resolution in it. First, log into League then minimize the client and navigate to the following directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\n***Delete*** these two files inside the folder:\n**- input.ini\n- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nAfter deleting those files, I'd like you to hop into a custom match so you can confirm whether or not that reset worked. Let me know the results!","replies":[]}]}
