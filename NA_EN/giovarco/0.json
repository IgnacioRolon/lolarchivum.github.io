My problem is that I can&#039;t identify some parts of his &quot;uniform&quot;. \n\nThe main image is this:\n\nhttp://orig10.deviantart.net/8a1e/f/2013/140/7/b/lol__katarina_the_sinister_blade_by_ippus-d65n95x.jpg\n\nHowever, as I can&#039;t see anything under her knees from this image, I provided for two other images;\n\nhttp://img13.deviantart.net/915f/i/2014/062/8/f/league_of_legends__katarina_wp_by_chrisbjors-d78ruro.jpg\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Katarina_5.jpg\n\nNow, let&#039;s analyze what I&#039;ve written:\n\n> She wears coffee color slacks, wrapped with a dark leather belt and iron buckle. Two light greaves to protect the zone between her knees and her ankle. A reinforced leather bra which descends until her abdomen\n> \n\nThen, there&#039;s that kind of light jacket that she wears and I can&#039;t identify with a specific name.\n\nBesides, my problem isn&#039;t only saying what she wears, but also their materials. Cotton, leather...?\n\nHow do you see Katarina? How would you describe her clothing?\n\nPS: I&#039;m sorry for my bad English, but I hope that you understand me anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-10-20T20:18:36.102+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could perhaps refer to her type of cropped jacket as a bolero jacket?  It could also be called a shrug, but those are usually associated with softer fabrics.  Also, I'd be inclined to call her top a cropped leather strapless top.  SEKAI calls it a sports bra, but sports bras are renown for their support and coverage.\n\nHowever!  What I would ask is - for what purpose are you trying to describe Katarina?  Who is doing the describing, and what kind of spin are they putting to it?  Are they being described by a fussy old biddy who disapproves?  Are they being described by a poetic young would-be-lover who sees beauty in every fold of fabric?  Are they being described by a tailor or seamstress who will viciously judge the stitching and how the fabric hangs?\n\nUnless you're writing a police report, I suspect you can use this description as an opportunity to tell us about the opinions of the describing character.\n\nEg: fussy old biddy description of Katarina:\n>    She's practically naked!  I mean, really - skin from hip to armpit just exposed to the air with naught but a few strips of flimsy leather between her and complete scandal!  Maybe, MAYBE, if she put as much effort into wearing sensible clothes in the morning as she does in finding enough belts to drape around her middle, she could show herself in public without decent people blushing as red as her hair.  And as for the rest of her?  Well - all I can say is - if your pants are so thin that one can tell if you missed a bit shaving your legs, then it doesn't matter how well covered they are!\n\nEg: poetic young would-be-lover description of Katarina:\n> One might call her hair the color of flame, yes - but in truth, flame begs to be compared to the incandescent hue of her extravagant tresses.  As full of fire and life as she, they cascade endlessly and ceaselessly like a waterfall upon her steely, armored shoulder.  And is that not her in short?  Blood red fire and shining sharp edged steel?  Like the glint in her eyes mirrored in the flash of her curved blades.  Those blades, so sensuously sheathed against the warm, skintight leather of her clothing - mere hairsbreaths from her pale firm skin.\n\nEg: tailor or seamstress description of Katarina:\n> Clearly an example of someone with more money than taste, or perhaps someone seeking to shock rather than impress in the right circles.  The fabrics are, of course, of the highest quality - light moleskin riding breeches cut for flexibility and reinforced in the seat - double stitched for strength and overdyed in chestnut for color fastness.  Accessorizing with double-hole belts in black, however, was not particularly well advised.  Couple this with fastenings in silver and pewter, and we have quite the color mix up.  Lace on a leather cropped strapless top suggests bedroom wear, while loose padding on the sleeves provides limited support for the pauldrons.  They are likely there for identification and ceremonial purposes, and not expected to see real, defensive, use.\n\nOops, lunchbreak over.  Anyway - take advantage of any opportunity to twist a description for your own purposes! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-10-20T21:57:27.776+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally my favorite Rioter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LVL 5 PORO","date":"2015-10-21T09:48:24.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Word game savage","replies":[]},{"poster":"Giovarco","date":"2015-10-21T07:35:38.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry. I missed some context on that. To answer your question, I had to gather my basics of literature.\n\nNo one is describing Katarina. Actually, the narrator is omniscient, precisely to zero focalization. As I would like my story to be addressed to generic public, they couldn't know her visually. Therefore, I'm trying to describe her with lots of details first of all, without omiting how beautiful and lethal she is. I'm describing a determined Katarina because she's getting ready to leave Noxus towards the frontline.\n\nAnyway, I feel a little incapable to describe people, so I would appreciate some advice, if you have one, on that.\n\nThanks for wasting your time for my purposes :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-10-20T20:33:49.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I almost asked why you were having lunch at 4:30, and then I realized time zones.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-10-20T20:33:33.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I almost asked why you were having lunch at 4:30, and then I realized time zones.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sp441","date":"2015-10-20T21:04:45.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know know what you use as fuel during \"after hours\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rustling Bush","date":"2015-10-20T18:28:39.883+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"B.attle R.eady A.rmor","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-10-20T18:25:25.803+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"A red head in medieval sports bra and yoga pants that holds a shiet ton of knives..","replies":[{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2015-10-21T07:44:08.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> A red head in medieval sports bra and yoga pants that holds a shiet ton of knives..\n\nIt's not even a sports bra considering there are no visible straps.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2015-10-21T00:21:51.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"you realize she is a person who needs to blink quick and fast in combat less cloths make that fast and much more flexible.so yes i could understand her clothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2015-10-21T08:47:44.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Read the topic pls.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2015-10-21T02:43:29.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly just came here for the pictures...
