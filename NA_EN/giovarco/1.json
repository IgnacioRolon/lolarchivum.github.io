So yeah, I'll try to remember for 5.17.\n\nIt's always confused me that Garen's ult has a longer tooltip than some of the most complex and overloaded abilities in the game when it's just a targeted nuke.\n\nThough if you do that, you also need to buff the damage to 30/35/40% missing health, because looking at your tooltip and seeing \"28.6% of the target's missing health\" is going to be even more annoying than seeing the current overexplained tooltip. Besides, I doubt the extra 1.4% at rank one would be the kind of buff to break him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoopyD","date":"2015-08-17T08:56:35.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pEAe91Av,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-08-11T18:24:56.510+0000)\n>\n> Craaaaaaaaaap, I meant to do that at some point.\n> \n> Unfortunately, we're past localization cutoff date at this point for 5.16, so it will have to wait until 5.17.\n> \n> For those that didn't know and are interested in knowing, we have to have all tooltips and other text information completed for a patch about a week in advance of the patch so that they can be translated into all the other languages the game.
