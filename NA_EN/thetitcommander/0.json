I was having issues connecting so I took it to IT and I saw they just added two DNS servers. Well it works now but I cannot login to League. It's giving me that connection error popup then closes the client. I looked it up and I saw the article on adding servers 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 and deleting the others. Well if I delete the others I won't be able to connect to the internet.\r\n\r\nNow that I think about it, I remember this happening every year I'm pretty sure. Shame I cannot remember my fixes each time. Well this is my final year so,\r\n\r\nthanks in advance","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-26T18:02:56.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does sound like your network can't make a connection to the authentication servers.  If you can, hit up your IT personally and ask them to make an exception.  Otherwise, dns configuration and other troubleshooting steps are also available at our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.  I'm not sure how much that will help, so hit them up if you can.  On that note, grats on your final year.  Pay attention, and finish strong!!!    {{item:2009}}","replies":[{"poster":"TheTitCommander","date":"2016-08-26T19:42:23.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went and they fixed it for me!
