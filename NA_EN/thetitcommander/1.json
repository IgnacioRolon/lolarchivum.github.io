I just logged in and received the prompt for the mystery gift [and pressed ok], but I have no idea what I got or where it is. I don't think there's anything new in my loot page and I checked my purchase history and all I got was the icon. Does everyone get the icon or is that what I got for having the champ and skin?

A chest briefly showed up on my screen but wasn't openable.

According to the [announcement](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/announcements/thank-you), players who already have the champion and skin will receive a mystery gift instead.  Looking into your specific case, you received the notification banner for the Anniversary Icon.  Hang tight as gifts continue to come!","replies":[]}]}
