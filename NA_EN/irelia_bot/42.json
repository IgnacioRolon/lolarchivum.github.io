Say a team would be a huge pain if their last pick was Orianna. You can ban Orianna so they don't get her as their last pick.\n\nThis is not removing the potential super strong meta champs from being banned every game but should diversify what is banned a bit past the first round of banning since other strong champs will likely get picked a lot.\n\nAlso there is a trade option within the team. It might however need to be changed a bit so that you can say you are trading with a player so that player can pick their champ and then you pick later on ifthe captian or second pick. But beyond  that it shouldn't be an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2015-04-23T18:40:12.823+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point, but still if you're a later pick it doesn't prevent those bans from being power bans rather than team-comp bans.

Not sure how dota compares to league in terms of viewership of pro leagues but the biggest reason to not do this is probably that. It would change the ability to bring out a comp someone doesn't expect, it would also destroy certain team comps, nunu, lulu, kog, janna, and ori all make it through bans on the regular and when a team goes juggermaw the other team has to react to a lulu nunu pick by trying to figure out what they want to pick away or not pick away. With the format of ban pick ban pick then in competitive comps like juggermaw get wrecked.

Whatever it is they try to ban out, you can expect that to be picked next unless your [person in said role] has a very deep champion pool. \n\nWhatever gets picked last is going to be the LEAST banned out role. You're going to have 1 champ from your pool banned out tops.\n\nUnless you willingly let the enemy team ban out that role in favor of securing winning picks in _every other role_.","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2015-04-24T23:11:22.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are you, challenger?\n\nThis IS SOLO QUEUE we're talking about.\n\nLike seriously, if first pick is a mid main they're going to pick mid. They're not going to secure a top lane champion because the enemy banned 2 tops. They're going to be happy their favorite mid lane champion wasn't banned and will lock it in before you can even say \"hi\". \n\nLikewise, the last pick won't necessarily be the least banned role. It might happen frequently because most players don't ban supports and more often than other roles last pick gets stuck with support, but that's never a guarantee. If first pick is a support main and second pick is a mid main and third pick is a jungle main and fourth pick is an adc main, last pick is going to be going top. Regardless of whether all 5 of the enemy bans were directed at top laners (and perhaps 2 of your own bans). Add on to the fact that last pick is likely not a top main in this scenario (odds are 24/625 that each role is mained by each player perfectly, assuming all roles are equally popular [lower if not, which is the actual case]) and therefore your last pick is now forced to pick a champion in an off-role which is guaranteed to have 1 or 2 bans in that role and likely has 3-6. \n\nHave you ever played solo queue? When's the last time you've seen players (that aren't a duo) offer to secure picks for each other? Or coordinate champion synergies with their teammates beyond filling each role and possibly having a small synergy like a top Hecarim gets an ADC who mains Jinx and has Sivir as their back up opt to play Sivir? I occasionally see the support and ADC coordinate a pair that works well together (when the support is actually a support main) but otherwise I've never seen someone say \"hey champions W X Y Z form a great comp together\" and the team proceeds to pick even 3 of those 4. In the LCS? Sure. In premade 5s? Sure. In Solo Queue?

If you're afraid of ur OP champ getting banned you'd better take it in the first round of picks.  If your champ is getting banned in the first 4 bans every game, there's prolly good reason and you're just spamming FREELO champs and you'd be banned out in the current system anyway.\n\nGetting the double pick is an advantage in synergy pair picks, but the other team gets the first pick and the last pick to counter.

It's not often you can ask not to ban someone, especially when you're picking 3rd or 4th and don't know what role the team will want you in yet.\nb) Playing top tier champions is not spamming FREELO for 2 reasons:\n1 - there's no such thing as FREELO. The closest any champion gets to it is a 55% win rate. If you don't have some practice with the champion you're not going to rise up by playing them\n2 - it's quite likely you stick with your main champion, it's RIOT and Pro Players who change what is considered OP or META. I mained Hecarim in season 4 back when every tier list I looked at had him in tier 4 or 5 on a 5 tier scale. I never needed a different Jungler because in about 500 games he was not banned a single time and was picked by someone other than me a grand total of 3 tiimes (one of which I picked him and the person who was last pick and had asked for mid whined that they took his Zed and he couldn't go mid and I offered to trade). The fact that Hecarim is the god of top lane now doesn't mean I'm suddenly abusing FREELO by playing Hecarim jungle and top, I've always used him as my preferred jg/top. \n\nTo be honest, aside from Jinx, every champion I've ever picked up was not a tier 1 champion on any list I looked at when I picked them up. Jinx was tier 1 on one list and tier 2 on the other 3 when I picked her up. It just so happens my main champions are almost all tier 1 now. Maybe I was just REALLY good at picking dark horse champions that were really strong and people didn't know it, but I think it's a lot more likely that it was just random chance that caused it to work out that way. \n\nAnd to the other point, I'm NOT maining those 2 champions. I said people have 2 comfort picks in their OFF roles. No one mains their off role.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SLangedEdge","date":"2015-04-23T22:24:51.530+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"This idea would be hard to do in LoL since many picks are easily telegraphed and comp flexibility is pretty low.

Jungle positions aren't mandatory, heroes can be in various lanes, you can run with dual supports, etc.\n\nGenerally in dota first bans can be OP bans, respect bans, or strategy bans.  The next set of bans are generally to break comp.
