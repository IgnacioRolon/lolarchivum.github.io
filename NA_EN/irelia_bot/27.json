There would be a fair number of build concepts opened up with something like that.\r\n\r\nCompare the 8 items that long sword builds into with the 12 that Amp tome builds into or the 17 that ruby crystal builds into.\r\nAnd jsut for reference\r\n8 for pick axe, 6 for blasting wand, 5 for giant&#039;s belt\r\n4 for BF sword 6 for NLR\r\n\r\nAD items with secondary stats seems to be lacking when compared to AP and health.\r\n\r\nAs it stands the only item you can build from a single {{item:1036}}  that you are likely to ever get is a {{item:1053}}  since no one gets {{item:3141}} \r\n\r\nSo while I like the LEET reference of 1337 on Brutalizer it might be for the best if Brutalizer was divided into 2 different items One with CDR and the other with armor pen.\r\n\r\nJust an observation. I don&#039;t expect anything done about this since a lot of people love Brutalizer but it is limiting the creation of other items from happening given that it is both the AD armor pen and CDR item.","replies":[{"poster":"Squirtle123","date":"2016-02-19T18:22:40.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Brutalizer is for op but hard to play champs like {{champion:92}}.
