Unless their support is protecting them, in that case, what do you expect??? \n\nMarksmen get bursted down by high damage, so sorry tank/bruiser mains, if you're gonna build tanky, then you aren't gonna be able to 1 v 1 a good marksmen, so yes, there's a drawback to building defense, and yes there are and should be actual champs in the game that can't kill Marksmen. Nitpick and downvote me all you want, you know its true.
