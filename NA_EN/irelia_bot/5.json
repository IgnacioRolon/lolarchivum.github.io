If no one talks about or protests it then they are saying it is fine. The initial complaint that started this whole situation could have lead to generally positive change but what is happening at PAX is way overkill and going to reflect on the company in a negative way. \n\nDaniel Z Klein has displayed himself as someone who is out of touch with the reality that men tend to put more effort towards getting into the game industry. It is no different than saying that a majority of mechanical engineers, truck drivers, crab fishers or mechanics are male. It is due in large part to biology and what men want to or will do that women tend to prefer not to do. Yes &quot;science is sexist&quot; if you are being realistic about what is actually observed, there are differences between men and women, how they think and what they prefer to do for a living. Daniel is a face of riot and the fact that he is willing to disregard men under the premises that women are &quot;under represented&quot; when in reality women are less interested in the field of work is a kind of discriminatory mind set that should be seen as dishonest and dangerous.\n\nIF you want a field of work dominated by women look into something like nursing or teachers. Are we trying to push more men towards these fields of work? Should we? I don&#039;t think we should. If men wish to go into these lines of work they are allowed to just like women are allowed to become an engineer or truck driver.\n\nIf a woman is interested in any of the jobs above and is able to do the job effectively that is fine. The same applies to men. But to suggest women need to be funneled toward something they are not as naturally interested in as men and be given an easier time getting into the field just because they are female is going to not only disregard men who are interested in the line of work but often times result in a worse product or service.\n\nBy excluding men Riot is trying to be stylish, and that&#039;s a hell of a price to pay for being stylish.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rcIJIWqYmo","replies":[]}
