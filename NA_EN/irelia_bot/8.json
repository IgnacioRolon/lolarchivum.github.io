(though not sure about the latest update)\n\nAs for champs that have an unfair advantage over other champs, I'm not sure what you mean, don't all champions have things about them that make then unique? Or are you accusing me of having an ARAM account? I already implied that I don't. If that's not what you're trying to say then I have no idea what you are trying to imply here.\n\nI also don't see what this has to do with anything, we obviously have different ideas of what we want out of this game mode, which is fine, we can both advocate for our our own view points and tug on Riot's ears and heartstrings to get what we desire. Our 'discussion' for lack of a better word already serves this purpose, but its not really going anywhere, don't you have anything interesting to say? Any good ideas for the game mode that might not backfire? Anything to refute or rebute or whatever in my earlier explanation of why your idea might be a bad one?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-21T03:14:49.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What an odd way to spell \"fix\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Myrkrvaldyr","date":"2017-04-21T02:23:35.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I wonder why Riot is so stubborn or lacks so much common sense. Common sense, for example, tells you that any new champion released must be unavailable for ranked for at least 1 week or 2 weeks.

History has told us it takes them a fucking long time to even recognize their failures. Their company is either run by stubborn youngsters or grumpy blind old people.","replies":[]}]}
