Same exact problem with Akali tbh. Mobility + long range. In fact, you can see that with every champion; ban rate correlates with mobility. This game simply should not have hyper mobile characters, it only gets worse with range and burst. When Urgot is extremely strong his ban rate still does not climb very high. Why? He is not hyper mobile, even though he is strong it is still fun to play against him to some extent. Same thing with Cassiopeia. She is extremely strong, but yet still doesn't see a lot of bans.
