The reason being that, for ADCs to be out of meta, you'd need **major** changes to so many core systems.\n\nThe reason we have an ADC bot lane is not that they need the support and protection from another player. It is just that ranged auto-attack-based champions are the one class of champions that suffers the least from sharing XP, as melees want XP for the invaluable tank stats (base HP and Armor triple to quadruple between level 1 and 18) and ability focused champions want XP for the improvements on their abilities (higher base damages, lower cooldowns, increased utility...).

Lifesteal should be the only defensive stat for adcs.

The problem is it's becoming way too easy to make use of lifesteal; back then, adcs were deleted instantaneously no matter what if they didn't get peel, so lifesteal only worked in a clutch manner. Now they have defensive options and much more survivable early games, allowing them to make much more use of lifesteal even though it isn't as abundant as it was before.
