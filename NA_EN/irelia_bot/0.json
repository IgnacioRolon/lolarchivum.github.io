I think you should be planning to add more strategic map control items for supports (and supportive tanks in top/jungle) instead of considering nerfing Zz'rot.  I am sure you are already fully aware that supporting is already the least popular role in general.  Zz'rot makes supporting feel impactful and strategically interesting.  \n\nIt's not even a really common item.  Even the champs that frequently get Zz'rot, like Shen and Nautilus, are still statistically much more likely to get other tank items like Sunfire or Spirit Visage in a game.  Now, I know some people hate anything that doesn't rely on twitch reflexes, so they'd love to whine until strategy is penalized as much as possible.  But, if you ignore those narrow-minded and selfish complaints, you will realize that destroying a strategically interesting item with only 2.5% overall popularity (according to lolking) would clearly be jumping the gun.  \n\nI think you can better justify nerfing almost any other item in the game.  Zz'rot is clearly a somewhat rare, strategic, niche item that is fairly well balanced and that makes the least popular role (supporting) far more interesting, enjoyable, and impactful.  The only possible reasons for justifications are: 1) supports should be/feel useless; 2) strategy = cheating/unfair; 3) strategy in LCS is boring/confusing for stupid viewers.  None of those reasons hold any water whatsoever.  \n\nAlso, the gold generation concern isn't an issue - when is the last time you heard someone say that supports have too much income?  Even the non-support use cases are mostly low-kill-potential tanks who aren't going to get as much income as damage carries regardless since they can't pick up kills nearly as easily and usually don't even farm as well.

I think I ended up with 1000 gold after several minutes of planting it near lanes the enemy pushed in.\n\nRushing ZZrot is typically not all that great. ZZrot is worthless when it comes to top lane dueling. As for supports? It offers no utility outside of lane pushing which is unnecessary early game and even mid game. Not to mention, as a support, you want to create a scenario where your adc can cs flawlessly, and rot is not conducive to that.\n\nIf you rush zzrot and I rush something like black cleaver, you're just going to get pulverized. Not to mention, since the minion damage scales off your max HP, the minions also have a hard time last hitting the wave.\n\nI fought against a zzrot rush and what I did was simply kill the little purple things in one hit (they were awfully squishy) and then pushed the wave all the way to the enemy turret since I could (black cleaver has way better dueling potential than zzrot ever could).\n\nIf the other guy ever tried to leave lane \"cuz he could with the rot keeping pressure\" I would just outpush the living hell out of his rot, and while the turret is sniping my minions, just snipe the rot.\n\nRot rush is bad. Sirhcez did it for a while on top lane, but even he realized just how bad it was and is now trying out things like cull starter and the good ol corruption potion starter.","replies":[{"poster":"Jasiwel","date":"2016-04-21T02:59:58.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, I don't blindly rush it unless I'm playing someone like Illaio who has very strong counterengage against someone who has weak waveclear, but I understand what you're saying.

Of course, it's a gamble when you buy it and I don't do it every game, but I easily net 1000 gold over several minutes when I do.

Maybe 5 gold or so, but 8 is overkill and would just allow people to get an extra 20-30-40 or whatever gold per minion wave which adds up to be a bit too much.
