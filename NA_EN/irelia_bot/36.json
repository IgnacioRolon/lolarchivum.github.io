Why not magic damage as well though?\n\nRiot: Oh magic damage block, that is getting removed.\n\nIrelia player: So it is a nerf.\n\nRiot: We are increasing per level stats a bit.\n\nIrelia player: so are we getting the same base AD as Jax, Fiora and Camille of 68 and might have better per level attack speed since you wanted to make Irelia more about sustained damage?\n\nRiot Hell no, you are getting 10 more health per level.\n\nIrelia player: so basically 9.3 is an all around nerf.\n\nRiot: WAIT! we have one more buff\n\nIrelia player: Oh great, what is it this time? Are you deleting the slow on Irelia's ult and increasing the damage by 25?\n\nRiot: Actually we are making Irelia get stack for hitting enemy players and you can get stacks from minions.\n\nIrelia player: So does this mean I get a passive stack for every minion hit by E and every champ?\n\nRiot: no you only get one stack if you hit a minion or a minion and a champion together.\n\nIrelia player: so basically it didn't change anything.\n\nRiot: no if you are getting ganked or in a team fight you can get more than one stack from hitting more tha none enemy champ. \n\nIrelia player: That would be an alright buff if you were not nerfing the passive so much.\n\nRiot: Hey you want a buff or not.\n\n*Irelia player sighs and stops for a moment* \n\nIrelia player: Honestly I just want to be able to kill minions with Q past 25 minutes again without waiting for another sheen proc. That flat bonus damage to minions is worse than when it was 70% more damage to minions and is getting me killed a lot because of how reliant Irelia is on Q resets to do anything.\n\nRiot: Not going to happen.\n\nIrelia player: Well thanks for a whole lot of \"buffs\".\n\nRiot: You're welcome","replies":[{"poster":"Ratpie","date":"2019-01-28T06:05:12.880+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have no problem with nerfing Irelia into the ground, ever since they turned her into one of these high mobility cancerous champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2019-01-28T06:09:53.923+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ratpie,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=r6Ig6VOP,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-01-28T06:05:12.880+0000)\n>\n> I have no problem with nerfing Irelia into the ground, ever since they turned her into one of these high mobility cancerous champs.\n\nAnd that is the one thing they refuse to actually nerf.\n\nI have evne said turn the marks into 70% cooldown reductions but people say that would kill her identity so they can't do that.\n\nThey have tried nerfing or removing everything else and only now with Irelia effectively being a gutted shell with limited impact is she below a 40% ban rate and about a 44% win rate.\n\nAnd here we see more nerfs that riot said would be \"buffs\"\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2019-01-28T05:41:03.534+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot: \"We really do not know what to do with this champion\".","replies":[{"poster":"Fckjaxsuo43v3r","date":"2019-02-07T01:58:15.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Better delete Irelia, plain and simple.
