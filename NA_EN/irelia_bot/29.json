They would be able to clear waves with a single basic attack without a shiv crit...\nThe simple fact of the matter is that ranged vs melee is a very real disparity; range is bar none the most powerful safety tool in the game, and AD ranged champions have the strongest itemization and pool of items to pick from... they litterally have a roster of items catered to them, and synergy with just about every item intended for melee champions as well.\n\nTheres also the fact lethality is an early game stat that scales to the late game pretty well, and marksman are supposed to be almost exclusively lategame champions.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2017-02-12T16:56:00.718+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Irelia Bot,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aGKW6TsU,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-02-12T07:31:48.706+0000)\n>\n> So you admit there are cases where making an item effect melee only is a really good idea.\n\nHydra and Hurricane are basically equivalent items that were separated between melee and ranged.\n\nHydra was better for melee because the active would allow extra burst immediately around yourself - it's really rather pointless for ranged. Likewise hurricane was better for ranged because the splash is centered on what you hit, rather than where you are.\n\nThey're melee only ranged only because their stacking would be pretty nuts (probably more-so on melees because of the aforementioned argument, hydra really wouldn't help ranged as having aoe damage around yourself isn't helping when no one is there). \n\nThey could make hydra and hurricane share the same unique name and they wouldn't need to be melee only and ranged only.\n\nThe only benefit Ravenous offers over hurricane is lifesteal. Basically it would give ADCs lifesteal instead of crit on their aoe item. Which would benefit SOME adcs but overall wouldn't be oppressive. It would moreso just promote boring gameplay. It's the same reason they change Bloodthirster so that ADCs rushed IE instead. Not because it was necessarily broken (albeit strong), but because it promoted boring gameplay as that much lifesteal that early in a ranged lane basically means you can't get kills 2v2.","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-02-12T07:57:59.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"and cases where making an item ranged only is a good idea, owever lethality/penetration isnt a serious case of abuse like hydra/hurricane could have been","replies":[{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2017-02-12T09:49:49.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am not even naming any items but you seem to be trying to defend an item.\n\nIs it proving to be too good at something?","replies":[{"poster":"Gibberwatt","date":"2017-02-12T09:53:03.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"reamer isn't trying to defend a specific item.
