Pre 5.2 Ahri WAS an assassin, hence that title. Her charm gave 20% damage amplification and allowed her to 100-0 squishy targets. Post 5.2 Ahri is no longer an assassin by definition. She can be built like one (at least when ahead), but nonetheless she's no longer an assassin but \"an ultra-mobile kite mage.\"\n\nAs Riot said themselves in patch 5.2 notes:\n\"Fantastic Ms. Ahri's success as a support-killing, pick-making assassin has always been tied very closely with Deathfire Grasp. With the item gone, however, it became obvious that Ahri's unique role in the game was losing focus, so we set out with the goal of moving her back to her original vision as an ultra-mobile kite mage. Technical improvements and updates to Fox-Fire and Spirit Rush should make her feel smoother to play, while Orb of Deception's new mobility effect allows her to both outwit opponents in close duels or remain elusive as she repositions in a fight.\"\n\nAs to your definition of assassin, you're largely right. They need the ability to 100-0 though. No one would play an assassin if all they could do is 100 - 10 their victims; they need to be able to finish them. I mean, even though an assassin by definition has the mobility / stealth to get in and out, they are still taking a risk by going in that they will get locked down and killed. Why take that risk if the reward doesn't measure up?\n\nTaken from the \"assassin\" wiki:\n\"An assassin is an agile champion that specializes in killing or disabling high value targets. Focused on infiltration, deception, and mobility, assassins are opportunistic hunters who find favorable moments within a fight before jumping into the fray. Regardless of the size of the enemy team, assassins specialize in positioning and artful killing. They strike when the time is right â no sooner, no later.\"\n\nMy definition of assassin at least is the ability to 100-0 a squishy paired with the ability to get in and out despite other non-squishy enemies nearby (if the squishy slightly mispositions, etc...). Most \"mage assassins\" that the OP is complaining about lack the latter point (ability to get in and out), while some miss the former. I suppose I'm missing the disabling part, but with the amount of lifesteal on ADCs I don't think you can disable one unless you kill it...","replies":[{"poster":"Weasel Kensei","date":"2017-01-18T08:02:52.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like a lot of your points, and its true that Ahri did lose a fair bit with the damage amp removal.

Well the time has finally come and after much anticipation, we wanted to reveal the gameplay style for Ahri, the Nine-Tailed Fox.\n\nAhri Ahri's gameplay style revolves around **mobility** and managing position to aim her spells. When played properly, Ahri darts around teamfights, picking off wounded stragglers and harrying soft enemies.\n\nThis is largely accomplished through her Spirit Rush ultimate, which allows her to dash multiple times before going on cooldown. Ahri can either use all three quickly to chase, burst, or escape, or she can spread out their uses to keep enemies guessing and juke around the battlefield. Combining this with her high magic damage and her Charm ability to **lock enemies down**, she can strike from unexpected angles or bait enemies into over-committing to disadvantageous situations.\n\nAhri's major gameplay decisions are based on her **assessment of risk/reward**. Her burst is high, but must be in short range to maximize it. This creates a dynamic that requires her to endanger herself to reach full potential. Play it safe and have more light damage, or commit and go for the kill? Use your dash for damage, or save it for escape? The choices are constant with these opposed strengths and weaknesses.\n\nHer kit is really designed to appeal towards **opportunistic** players who prefer characters with a lot of action, and especially players that like to lull enemies into overconfidence, only to capitalize and punish them. Ahri's dangerous, seductive nature is something we're happy to deliver for players who like to toy with their enemies before destroying them.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nI know what the wiki says for assassins, and Ahri plays like an assassin.

And it's why I don't think she's an assassin like the others. Ahri needs to poke poke poke first. Since when does a Talon or Zed poke the enemy ADC a few times before going all in? Never. Ahri has the ability to do it. Maybe that makes her an assassin, she's able to get targets down low enough before going all in. \n\nI think Ahri CAN be played like an assassin. You CAN build her for lots of burst with {{item:3285}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3135}} . Most players prefer to build her like {{item:3165}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3157}} (I just looked that up, I expected the last item to be {{item:3116}} but I guess the nerfs stopped that). She doesn't quite have the burst there then, not enough AP or item actives with AP ratios to get her there.\n\nRegardless though, she still could be defined an assassin. I guess the point then comes down to \"when's the last time someone has seen an Ahri support played seriously?\". I personally build {{item:3116}} on her and play her like a kite mage though - that is until I'm 6/0 and start assassinating people with the lead.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2017-01-18T03:44:45.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The tag system used in the client is outdated.

Thats complete bull. Even Koz and Ziggs are going to have a hard time bursting you.\n\nAdditionally, all the mages you listed are extremely immobile, even zigg's mobility is his only hard CC and is unreliable, and are skill shot reliant, except annie. None of the mage, except Annie, are able to easily land their damage reliably like old Talon, Rengar, Leblanc, etc. \n\nAnd your for some reason getting upset _over the fact that burst mages are bursting you_. \n\nOverall, your forgetting how someone like Rengar can take a dragon, and a Syndra can't, and how Rengar is much more reliable and slippery than someone like Koz.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slazll","date":"2017-01-19T00:27:13.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well couple big problems main 3 unbalanced champs/positions eh eh jungle, very linear map progression cause it's clearly best to gank bot every game easiest turret dragon and the most kills for ganks, and finally the very linear build paths for most mid laners, adcs and supports atm.
