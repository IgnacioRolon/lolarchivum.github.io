This can be shown mathematically. 2 chimes spawn every 50 seconds. Your passive upgrades scale up to 145 chimes (sure, there's an infinite flat scaling after, but let's say 145). So let's say I want to collect 145 chimes as soon as possible (so, not missing a single one). How soon can I do that?\n\n145/2 = 72.5 spawns, let's round it to 73 spawns because spawn #2 and #3 are only one chime each.\n73 spawns x 50 seconds = 3650 seconds, which = **60.8 minutes**\n\nSo to get the full benefit of his passive, you have to play a 61 minute game. I can't remember the last game I played that lasted that long. But let's say you just want to get that 4th meep (95 chimes)... well, that would be 48 spawns and exactly **40 minutes**. Still a pretty long game, and that assumes you don't miss a single chime.\n\nCompare this to, say, Cassiopeia's stacking passive.

I'd rather use him solo lane top, he's got decent sustain with his W and his Chimes, and people just flat out don't know how to react to him at all. Not to mention you can use your R on your laning opponent and set your jungler up for a good gank. I just don't see him being a good support, just because communication is something vital to playing Bard Support. {{champion:432}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"arcinex","date":"2015-03-16T08:09:16.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only times I have enjoyed playing with a Bard so far is him being on the enemy team (freelo4dayz) or playing jungle for my team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoRdJeSuS6969420","date":"2015-03-16T10:17:52.499+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"No damage, no CC, no tankiness.....throw in the ability to harm your own teammates and you have a terrible champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2015-03-16T12:10:04.090+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LoRdJeSuS6969420,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OKHLzbxI,comment-id=0018,timestamp=2015-03-16T10:17:52.499+0000)\n>\n> No damage, no CC, no tankiness.....throw in the ability to harm your own teammates and you have a terrible champion.\n\nNo CC? Sure, he doesn't have it in spades like Lulu, Braum, Thresh, or Leona, but he has as much CC as Sona, Karma, Soraka, Zilean, and Annie. \nHis Q slows if it strikes an enemy, and of course stuns if it strikes a second or a wall. Once you collect a mere 5 chimes, his Meeps slow for 25%. It doesn't seem as impactful because people devalue slows that aren't Thresh-Box or Zilean-Time Warps with their insane 99% caps, but a slow is a slow, and I've had games with Bard where I could chain Q, Meep, Exhaust to keep an enemy sluggish so the ADC could stick to them for the kill.\nThe largest problem with Bard right now is the players. He's brand new, he's been out for less than a week, and people do not know how to play him. Sure, I think his chime rewarding and the priority of his Q could use some tweaks, but those are very minor tweaks that are far from the accusations of weakness that everyone keeps throwing at him. The exact same thing happened to Kalista, Gnar, and Azir on release, and they were buffed, only to have them become cancerous to the game until they get clubbed over the head by the nerf bats (which for Kalista, hasn't happened yet). So let's give Bard at least until the next patch to see lots of play and allow the players to get used to him. If people still think he's overly weak, then maybe the buff talks can happen. But right now, it's too soon to pass judgement.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2015-03-16T04:25:14.675+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"I have some thoughts on Bard. First off, Ancient Coin is a horrible start for him, especially since he can't really utilize the passive while roaming.\n Starting with {{item:3303}} is better for him early game so he can sustain his income if he gets the chance to roam. If, a little later, you want to bypass the coin and go straight into {{item:3096}}, that will do better for him.\nFollowing his income item, a mana fixing item is a must. I reccomend {{item:3165}} or {{item:3222}} depending on your needs. Personally, I prefer the book because I think he can do exceptionally well with the poke. \nAnother GREAT item that seems really made for him is {{item:3285}}. It has very desirable stats for him in the movement speed boost and the high AP, coupled with the extra damage from proccing the passive with his Meeps or his Q. If you can't afford it (or, alternatively, something to run in tandem), {{item:3023}} can be exceptionally effective for helping to root out opponents while you roam, and, again, providing extra speed and AP with CDR.\n\nSome things to note while playing Bard:\n- Your chimes spawn nearish to you at set intervals. So if you time it right, you can try to be near where you need them to spawn, and hopefully away from the enemy jungle. \n- While the Chimes help Bard immensely, you can be functional with the few you can collect in your bottom half of the jungle and in lane. As the game progresses, you'll eventually get a good supply. What I mean is, it isn't incredibly necessary to run off and collect chimes willy nilly. Bard is still the support and you need to stick really close. \n- For now, most players are ignorant of Bard's abilities. Tell them how to utilize them, especially the health packs. \n- Bard's ultimate has an INCREDIBLE range. If you can time it well, you can ult a mob of enemies from a great distance and give your team time to respond to their advance. This means you can ult the dragon and prevent the enemy from stealing it if your team reacts fast enough.\n- Bard can ult towers. This is incredibly useful when an opponent thinks they're safe. Just ult on the edge of the tower closest to the terrain wall; generally, most players never stand there and you can usually put only the tower in stasis, allowing your ADC to quickly wipe up the enemy.\n- You can ult an area with Bard using the mini map, similar to Jinx' missle, Ashe's enchanted arrow, and Caitlyn's snipe. This saves a lot of time when trying to quickly ult an area in need of stasis.\n- Magical Journey is a great way to keep moving around the map and to escape in a pinch. It is also a wonderful tool for flooding your team into the Dragon/Baron pits to disrupt the enemy's attempt to take them.\n- Magical Journey makes Bard a master baiter. If you can collect your jungle and ADC near your exit, you can often get an enemy to follow you into a trap they can't easily escape.\n\nAnyway, that's all I got for now, and while I do think he needs a few loving touches here and there in regards to his chimes and the order that he gets bonuses for his Meep, as well as a much needed Champion prioritization for his Q, he's a fun champ if you have a competent team and an ADC who understands how you actually support them.","replies":[]}]}
