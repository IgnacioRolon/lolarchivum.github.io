If she didn't have low enough cooldowns that she can just rapid fire them in quick succession with no thought process at all because they're all ridiculously low to begin with. If she didn't scale off one single stat only. If she wasn't a cancerous piece of shit that's probably the worst designed champion in the game.\r\n\r\nYeah, i'm mad.
