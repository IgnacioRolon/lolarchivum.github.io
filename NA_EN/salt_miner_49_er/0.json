You can clearly see where the champion is going after they take the lantern. Not only that, but they cant just grab it from a long distance away. They have to be within that little circle that gives a shield in order for it to even be a teleport/jump/whatever you wanna call it. All the other champions with a blink ability can go anywhere their little heart desires. Most of the time while they do massive damage or lower defenses of the thing they teleport to.\n\nAnd lets not forget, Everyone else that i mentioned has a better version of Thresh's Kit that does more damage and takes less skill to land because they're either a press one button or they're point and click.","replies":[{"poster":"Ventira","date":"2015-06-28T21:43:45.734+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=doiminat0r3600,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XnmGzazK,comment-id=000200010000,timestamp=2015-06-28T20:34:38.707+0000)\n>\n> *snip*\n\nThe problem with your comparisons, is that you're comparing them to non-designed around supporting Mages/assassin.\nOn a support to support comparison, Thresh can do hella lot more then most.","replies":[{"poster":"doiminat0r3600","date":"2015-06-28T21:46:59.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What can Thresh do over most?\n\nAlso, I never said *snip* btw. idk what that is supposed to mean.","replies":[{"poster":"Ventira","date":"2015-06-28T21:56:22.222+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=doiminat0r3600,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XnmGzazK,comment-id=00020001000000010000,timestamp=2015-06-28T21:46:59.470+0000)\n>\n> What can Thresh do over most?\n> \n> Also, I never said *snip* btw. idk what that is supposed to mean.\n\nSnip means I removed the words from your prior post to cut down on the overall size of the reply to save space.\n\nThresh gains both free damage and armour as time goes on, thanks to his passive.

This is a thread about what Thresh brings to the table compared to other supports (and not mages that can happen to fulfill the support role.) \n\nThresh brings free, semi-sustained poke through Flay passive something that only ranged supports have (and their poke is weaker, as they don't have bonus Magic damage on their autoattacks..I am referring to poke that  has no mana costs),  he has a fair distance stun/gapclose through Death Sentence. He is the ONLY support capable of dragging an ally to him coupled with a fairly decent shield. He has an AoE displacer that hits both in front of and behind him and slows as well, in a forwards or backwards direction.  He has the strongest slow in the game, tied with Zilean's max rank W, and once again, infinitely scaling Armor and AP meaning unlike most other supports, he gets both tanky and remains a threat throughout most of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"doiminat0r3600","date":"2015-06-28T23:35:47.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do me a favor and DONT QUOTE THE PREVIOUS POST PLEASE.

Nasus isnt a support. I never said he was. I was just bringing up that nobody complains that he is able to get 3 extra damage on his Q when he kills a minion because of it. Thresh can do alot. But so can other champions. Janna can stop people from dashing. She can also engage and disengage. \n\nThresh doesnt bring free poke. His poke is an auto attack. And it has a charge up as well. If he hasnt auto attacked in a while, you might wanna avoid him. Orianna has magic damage per auto attack, and yes, she is a support deemed by Riot. His gapcloser doesnt apply to his entire team, just him. He isnt the only support capable of shielding his carry. His shield is also WEAK. Really really weak. 220 damage is the shield's worth. Most other supports give a much stronger shield and offer a better peel potential that doesnt require a meat wall. Yes he has a displacer, but it's not that strong of a displacer. It doesnt move you very much. The only issue is if youre chasing him. Then \"OH NO! YOU GET SLOWED, BIG DEAL!\" He might have the strongest slow in the game but you shouldnt be complaining about a 2 second slow **ultimate**. It's an ultimate, meaning it has a high cooldown. Not to mention that it has to be cast on top of thresh. And it covers only a small area. Youre acting like he blocks off an entire lane or something when in fact the best he can do is block off an area  the entrance to dragon or baron with it. You can say its infinite scaling but the fact is that most games are over by the time he naturally reaches around 150 armor and 75 AD (without runes/masteries/items/etc.). He is a tank, of course he is gonna be tanky and a threat.

I'm so sick of this stupid-ass strategy that I see numerous Thresh' using, where they will sit in a bush, wait until you walk close enough, hit you with their ridiculous damage E passive, and then walk back into the bush, knowing you can't do anything about catching them off guard because they can just Hook and Flay you. Seriously, the most frustrating strategy I've ever seen in a champion comes from Thresh. Sitting in a bush like a little bitch and throwing an E at you, then walking back in and waiting, all while his ADC can farm and not worry about me OR my support getting anywhere near his ADC is an absolute nightmare. Otherwise Thresh doesn't anger me as much, it's just when I see these few Thresh' supports that do this I want to scream.","replies":[{"poster":"Aspynn","date":"2015-06-28T20:15:09.565+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sounds like you need to find a support duo buddy.

If all he does is sit in the bush, then as Karma or Nami you can throw stuff into the bush. Karma can Q him all day and drain his health fairly quick, since you out range his autos. Nami, if you catch him in a bubble you can actually get some good damage on him, and depending on your ADC might even get a kill from a single lucky bubble. \n\nThe other thing would be to play closer to the river, to force him into either waiting till you push up to try and harass (In which case you have a better chance of catching him if he stays in the bush) or he has to leave the bush to try and harass. Advise your ADC to do the same, and as long as you keep river well-warded to avoid junglers, you should be able to avoid most of the harass. Ward a bit deeper into river/enemy blue territory when doing this to get a better early warning about enemy junglers, or roaming mids. Also, the other option is to just stay close to the bushes in lane, and just keep them warded constantly so you can just harass/catch him anytime he tries to pull that. If he keeps it up enough you can probably snag a few kills when he things there's no ward.\n\nAlso, if you have a Vayne ADC, Thresh is basically dead. The bushes are so close to the wall, if she can see him, she could easily get a tumble and pin him against the wall for a ton of free damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2015-06-28T22:41:08.387+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for this advice!!! As Karma, I do exactly what you said; I spam Q in the bush until he's forced out of it. Sometimes it doesn't work since my Q doesn't do enough damage, but I will try focusing on my Q versus my E next time I fight one. As Nami it's much harder due to how squishy she is, and since her Q is a little bit expensive, so sometimes I will miss the Q and then get grabbed, but I will definitely do my best to practice this. Once again, thank you!!!

Keep an eye on him when you can, and if you have a decent amount of mana, and think he's in the bush, you can try to catch him as long as your ADC is near to help out. It's definitely a risk vs. reward thing. More advice for Nami would be, don't be as afraid of trading here and there, keep in mind that Nami does have the ability to heal, which makes it much easier to come out on top of close trades if you and your ADC know how to trade decently. Even if you go even in a trade, that means you win, because Nami can help her and her ADC heal up, while Thresh can only hit Targon stacks for heals, which isn't nearly as much as Nami can do.\n\nAnyway, hope it helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shrek Luigi","date":"2015-06-29T15:51:56.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3165}} {{item:3504}}  Both of these give AP, CDR and mana regeneration.

A lot of people might say to run AP flats but her scaling really isn't all that great and the base damage is already pretty decent, so there's really no need.","replies":[{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2015-06-29T23:18:13.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm always hesitant to get Ardent Censer nowadays, primarily due to the lack of AP it provides for ME.

But yes, I will definitely try it regardless, hope it helps my ADC out enough. When it comes to Morello I've always built that on Karma myself, but you see, the way I play her is that I ALWAYS go for Liandry's Torment as the first item for her when I support, so that I still have enough AP to inflict massive damage with my Q, but lets say my ADC doesn't realize I'm engaging with my W, I have enough health to at least make it out alive when it's a failed engagement. Would you recommend me choosing those two items above Liandry's? Even with the upcoming AP itemization changes? \n\nOH, and when it comes to my rune pages, this is what I currently have for all of my supports (works best on Nami though :P). Should I really shift to more offensive runes for support? I've always been hesitant to do that, but maybe it would work out better in the long run?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
