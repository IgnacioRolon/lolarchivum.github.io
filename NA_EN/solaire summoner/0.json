The thing is, it has an i-7 and a GTX 1050.

A few things that come to mind to try assuming you're using windows 10 is disabling automatic updates (including the p2p transfers, google windows 10 choose how updates are delivered and turn it OFF)\n\nUnder start > settings > notifications > turn all those OFF.\n\nUnder start > settings > power options > change power plan > Show additional power plans > select high performance and then click change power options for high performance profile > +Processor power management >Min + Max state 100% (While plugged in ONLY if you want to keep your on battery lifetime around the same)\n\nDisabling the service ''superfetch'' can help improve performance too in some cases, ranging from slow hard drive all the way to your monitors too wide(not really). But keep in mind that over time your system might start to slow down as a result and reenabling it while you're not playing games might be in your best interest.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure what motherboard you're using but some have some evil power saving options in the BIOS which you should google and try to figure out what's what and what should and shouldn't be on. take pictures of your screen with a phone or something so you don't have to keep rebooting to check names of things like p1e or whatever it is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-08T23:09:35.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That lag between when you press a button and the thing actually happens might be caused by packet loss.
