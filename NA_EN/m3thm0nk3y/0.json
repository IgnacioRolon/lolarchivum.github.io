This forced a remake for my team and I tried to do this in a custom game but the same error occurred with the black screen.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-09T20:47:27.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cases like this can be due to your hardware having issues rendering the game.
