I sent one bug report then I restarted the client in the hope that this would fix the issue.  The client then told me there was file corruption so I let it fix itself but after that completed I was unable to actually get to the login screen.  After restarting again, the client then told me that it failed to patch and I had to uninstall and reinstall it.  Considering yesterday was perfectly fine and I haven't turned off this computer nor have I changed anything, this is a bit disconcerting.  \r\n\r\nNever had anything like this happen to me before the Ivern patch and I've been playing since late beta.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-06T20:17:14.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you are bugsplatting, which is a crash that can happen when a driver or game file issue fails to render the game.
