After character select during the loading screen the game freezes.  This has never happened before but happens every time now.  The % of load is all over the board from 10% to 90%.  I have to kill the game client and restart.  I get in after that but the game has already started and I'm behind a minute or so.  Not a big deal, just annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Veiss7","date":"2014-11-05T21:22:49.969+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"here you go.\n\nlooking at that log there is a whole bunch of \"error\". lol","replies":[{"poster":"Bark Wahlberg","date":"2014-11-08T05:47:43.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I also forwarded your logs to engineering.
