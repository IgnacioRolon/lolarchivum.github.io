If you don't want the silver border after the end of the season, you can reach out in a [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) after we've sent ranked rewards out for the 2017 season and request we remove it. Ranked rewards won't go out until the season ends, though, so that won't be for quite a while.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-01-16T13:30:52.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, they can't mess with your Rank/LP/MMR at all. It's built that way to prevent abuse. If you don't want the season's rewards you can request they be removed after you receive them, but you're going to have the MMR and be considered whatever rank you were no matter what.\n\nI don't really understand the purpose of your request, though.","replies":[]}]}
