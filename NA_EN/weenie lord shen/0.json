So is this what we are to expect of the next VGU for Volibear, or at least the canon world? Also, do his followers look like what Volibear looks like currently, or are we talking something more humanoid.\r\n\r\nPLEASE tell me we get something about Volibear and his cult and how they tie to the Winter&#039;s Claw and everything. Very important to know (plus I run a D&amp;D League campaign and I wanna make sure things are correct and I don&#039;t have to look back at it later like a dummy)","replies":[{"poster":"Valaran Nara","date":"2017-08-23T01:26:30.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you ever heard of [werebears](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Werebear_(Dragonborn)) ?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-08-23T02:08:43.789+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ursine are worse...  much, much worse.","replies":[{"poster":"Rambi","date":"2017-08-23T02:15:43.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=RktpuZb3,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-08-23T02:08:43.789+0000)\n>\n> The ursine are worse...  much, much worse.\n\nSo is Volibear canonically evil now?","replies":[{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2017-08-23T05:59:18.196+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. All of the stories we have with Volibear use him as an antagonist for Ornn, who is portrayed in a heroic light. We don't have any myths or stories about Volibear, and if we heard a story about Volibear told from the perspective of a Winter's Claw warrior or Lokfar barbarian, we'd probably get a very different interpretation where Volibear is associated with themes of bravery, valiance, strength, and self-sufficience. Meanwhile, in those same stories, Ornn could be portrayed as selfish and uncaring.\n\nImagine a different perspective on the story where Ornn and Volibear's fight destroys Hearthhome and the Hearthblood. Perhaps Volibear was there, seeking weapons and armor from Ornn, to equip a band of savage survivors who were faced with insurmountable odds VS the Watchers or some Void creatures or some other invading force. Ornn doesn't give two shits about the little people Volibear is trying to help, much less is he willing to part with his own creations for them, and so the two come to blows.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tommy PickleNose","date":"2017-08-23T03:09:16.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't think so. I'm hoping it's more of a false interpretation of what they think volibear is. Like they see him as some savage beast god. You see this stuff all the time where cults and groups of people will kill or do terrible things in the name of something or someone but the person they are doing it under doesn't actually share the same ideals as them. I don't know the exact words to describe it but it's basically just the ursine misinterpreting what volibear is all about and killing in his name. The only thing that ruins my theory is that in the new short story volibear is there with the ursine so that kinda chops my theory to pieces. UNLESS HE WAS THERE TO STOP THE URSINE AND ORNN JUST HAD BEEF TO SETTLE AND THATS WHY THEY FOUGHT.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2017-08-23T06:00:48.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anything like the [Stitched Tracker](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/media/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/9/95/Stitched_Tracker_full.jpg?version=86f2aac3ce170ebdcac6c9035e404a5d) from Hearthstone, just not stitched?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tommy PickleNose","date":"2017-08-23T03:02:17.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I brought this up in another post.
