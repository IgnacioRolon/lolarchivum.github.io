At around 15mins it started to increase the time. I wasn't paying attention to the client, I had it on my second monitor, because I was playing another game on my main monitor. I now have to wait 18mins and already waited 32. \r\nThe Low Priority Queue is already a total time waste, but waiting 50 or even longer is just crazy. Rito pls fix.\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \r\nSincerely, A guy who is an expert on being in a low priority queue for too many times.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-08T17:59:11.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, this can happen if your connection lost sync to matchmaking.
