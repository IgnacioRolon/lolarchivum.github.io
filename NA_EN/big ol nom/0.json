Should be easy with any basic knowledge of how to manipulate waves. Buy a control ward and plant it behind you to prevent a dive and go from there. Back off and lose farm instead of feeding and losing farm. You're also talking about \"shitty attitude\" while stating \"why should I care?\" You also seem to lack basic knowledge of jungling. Your lane is not the only lane available to gank and the metric to judge junglers off of is not the number of ganks attempted. Time is a key resource when you jungle and if the jungler deems a lane a waste of time to gank, then ganking that lane is, by proxy,  a waste of resources that could've been spent doing something productive. That \"shitty attitude\" is basic position knowledge.\n\nIt is the team's responsibility to defend objectives, it is fine to roam.
