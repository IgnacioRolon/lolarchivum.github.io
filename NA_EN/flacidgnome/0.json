That being said my queue times have basically gone from 3-7 min to 30min+ due to dodges. I understand that asking players to pick two roles will effectively lower queues times. But really adding all the dodges this has been the complete opposite for me. And the fact that there is only ranked draft and regular draft right now makes for an extremely unbalanced  team.

The new CS doesn't pull you back to the client automatically when it's your turn to pick like before, and just selecting the champion before your time is up isn't enough, you have to select and lock in.\n\nGuarantees that there will be a drop in DCs at the start of games, but people are missing their lock in Windows.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"High5","date":"2016-01-15T14:36:02.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"24's against 30's was a flaw in the old system too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dread Pirate Jah","date":"2016-01-15T12:49:24.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or just remove dynamic queue in general...or split it...so premades dont go vs randoms...","replies":[]},{"poster":"159309_DEL","date":"2016-01-15T11:22:47.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should probably change the \"Done\" button to a \"Locked In\" or \"Ready\" button.","replies":[]}]}
