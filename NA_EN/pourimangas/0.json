Depending on when this issue started (eg. after a patch, after reformatting your hard drive, or after initiating System Restore), it could be various things. Most of the time, this problem is caused by the computer not having the proper video drivers; as such, the system isn't able to utilize its hardware while loading the game client.\n\nI recommend updating your video card drivers. We have a steps in our Support Site here that will help you accomplish that: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq2\n\nTry loading into Custom Games by yourself afterwards to see if the problem has been resolved. If you still have issues loading into games, I recommend contacting my colleague through the Support Site here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
