IT is one of the best and most addictive games I have ever touched. IT has created many emotional and mental challenges for me to over come. I just wanted to say that in this time, I have heard many things about riot and people constantly blaming riot or getting on their case for a variety of things. However I honestly would like to say, Thank You. You guys go above and beyond the call of duty for your players. I have seen you guys listen to your players and come to terms with us on many things to constantly increase our fun and interests. Ive also seen that as a company you guys come to us as players not as customers. Ive read stories where rioters go above and beyond to help individual players. So again, I would seriously like to say thank you guys. I feel like you honestly don't get enough praise for al the things you do.","replies":[{"poster":"Shiny Reshiram","date":"2014-09-26T19:51:17.212+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Now if only they would fix their horrid treatment of Soraka.","replies":[{"poster":"BetaDude40","date":"2014-09-27T02:04:01.154+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please.\nNo.\nNo more of this.\nIt's not like we all weren't too busy playing Thresh and Blitz anyway...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-09-26T20:40:00.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Here we go again...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AutumnMemory","date":"2014-11-17T23:14:37.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For positive feedback like this, I thank you for your recognition, and I've learn what we should continue be doing. \nFor negative feedback like what Naoki mentioned below, I thank you for that you cared about League, and I've learn what we should be making changes/improvements on. \n\nFor those who are willing to provide any feedback at all, that means you CARE regardless whether the feedback is positive or negative. Imo, any feedback is better than \"I don't care about League\" or \"I don't know about League\". \n\nAfter all, only the ones that CARES are willing to give feedback.
