I was joyed to see I got an S- on that game but I was left wondering why you are not eligible to earn mastery level 6 tokens the same game. Technically at the completion of the game, I had mastery level 5 with her. Should I not be allotted the level 6 token?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-30T21:56:02.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, nope, not on the same game that you earned mastery 5.  Per the [champion mastery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide), you need to already be Mastery level 5 before the game starts to be eligible for tokens.  It's not possible to level up AND get a token in the same game.  Sorry for the confusion, but grats!","replies":[]}]}
