Once it is installed you must open the old launcher in order to install the new one and be able to play, but whenever I try to open the old launcher just the league logo pops up and then disappears without opening anything more.  I looked up in the task manager and league is executing and downloading so i left it there. But when i came back to my computer a message which bugsplat dll is not found was there, what should i do in order to  get the game installed and play?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-16T16:24:20.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like something is blocking your game files from being accessed, so the patcher isn't able to launch or locate assets.
