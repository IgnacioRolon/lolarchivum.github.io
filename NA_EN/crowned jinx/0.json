For Two weeks it showed the purchase in my history and removed 1350  Rp from my account. The skin was for whatever reason unavailable for me to use for the last two weeks. Today I added 10$ to my account to use the remaining 1300+ rp i had leftover to buy a bundle. I still haven't received Snow Day Bard or a refund of my Rp. Also the purchase of the bard skin no longer is in my account purchases. I'm just a guy who wants either his money back or his skin. Please help me, it would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time.            \r\n\r\nYour Friendly Jinx main, J {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-24T16:55:27.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account and was unable to find a record of your snow day bard purchase.
