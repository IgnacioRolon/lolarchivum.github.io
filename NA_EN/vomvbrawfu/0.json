Mostly to smack away on the tanky champs on the enemy front line. Now they kind of feel like they burst people as quick as assassins (go ahead and get caught out by a shiv/ie Vayne). And I think the reason why is because they added damage onto everything.\r\n\r\nSee, there is supposed to be a cool balance thing where Assassins > ADC > Tanks > Assassins. But there was a point where tanks were weak and assassins were killing everything \\*cough zed cough\\*. I think we all remember where the team that got Zed one. It was annoying. So what did they do? Added damage to tanks. And when I say tanks, I'm included all those goofy words that you guys like to use, vanguard, diver, fighter, tank, etc. By way of items, etc. Well then ADCs couldn't as effectively kill those champions. So they added more damage to ADCs! Yay! Most recently, we went through a phase where assassins are useless, except a select few. Why? Because ADCs can just burst people.\r\n\r\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is, stop throwing damage on everyfuckingthing. Just look at the whole knew masteries system. Basically damage, damage, and tankydamage. People say, \"adc in 2k17 lul\", but it has nothing to do with ADCs being weak. It has to do with tanky champs just being able to dive through your team and nuke your backline....because everything got damage added on. I mean seriously, release Ekko has more damage in his kit than Veigar does. Makes no sense considering how much other shit Ekko has built in. And then rito wondered why Ekko was batshit crazy.\r\n\r\nTl;dr: If you could stop throwing damage on everything, that'd be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Twinity Ferce","date":"2017-02-02T13:21:48.534+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:7}}","replies":[{"poster":"vOmvbrawfU","date":"2017-02-02T14:54:41.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about her?","replies":[{"poster":"Twinity Ferce","date":"2017-02-02T17:15:37.440+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Champions that feel way too bursty, considering their rework was supposed to remove that playstyle","replies":[{"poster":"vOmvbrawfU","date":"2017-02-02T17:29:04.553+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought she was supposed to be an assassin?","replies":[{"poster":"Twinity Ferce","date":"2017-02-04T08:11:54.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing wrong with being an assassin.

Everything has a purpose, one or two roles they must fulfill depending on their champion (one Support may protect through absorbing damage and CCing enemies, while another may protect through pure sustain).  \n\nNow we have damage everywhere, Poppy and Maokai deal a surprising amount of damage just by themselves add on that they also take forever to kill and their damage is usually up there with the ADC's at the end of the game. Assassins either completely obliterate anything and everything with very little you can do (like Kha or LeBlanc) or they struggle against the burst of ADC's after a certain period of time has passed (like Talon). ADC's are burst drain tanks, massive instant damage with a ton of lifesteal, makes them incredibly difficult to face once late game hits. Fighter and Divers are either useless or build Bruiser builds making them incredibly difficult to deal with as well, while retaining their damage (since their items are generally cheaper they tend to be stronger early game and snowball, thus games \"end\" quicker and ADC's don't have time to get strong).  \n\nLike you said a big issue is A) items getting random damage (plus tank items getting less tank for some reason) and B) certain champs being designed with too many tools available to them to deal damage (Ekko is a prime example of this, I mean wth did you think would happen with him? look at his kit its disgusting...)  \n\nIf anyone doubts there is more damage nowadays, just look at the Support Role. {{champion:63}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:90}} these 3 dominate it and their damage is absolutely ridiculous, especially Zyra. This should be a huge red flag to the balance team, when the best option for a Support is just more damage, you know something is wrong. Why peel for ADC when they are just going to get blown up instantly anyways? Might as well just blow up whoever killed them or better yet kill the enemy before your ADC gets blown up. I am not saying the other Supports are garbage, just look at Janna's winrate, but there is a reason why those 3 mages are so popular in the Support role.
