As a quick try, you can mouse your cursor to the corner of the client to make it smaller.  You may also need to configure your scaling, which is a recent workaround due to some recent windows updates that's caused a similar issue:\n\nRight click the LoL icon -> Properties -> Compatibility Tab -> Check the \"Disable Display Scaling on High DPI Settings\" Box.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
