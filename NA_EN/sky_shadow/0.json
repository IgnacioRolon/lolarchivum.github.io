The fact that someone like Vayne can fire an arrow at you that will follow you, even through walls until it hits you or that you can teleport/blink/flash and still be hit. You would think it would perhaps raise suspicion.\n\nI think a lot of things are answered and explained in the lore, but I&#039;m curious about the unanswered questions more. I may just be digging too deeply into a game mechanic, but I'm curious about the explanation story-wise, if there even is one.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2015-07-15T00:43:14.224+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, purely gameplay.\n\nSeveral mage attacks might make sense, but stuff like arrows or bullets are not supposed to be heat seeking, yet they are due to the game being as it is.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-07-15T04:48:59.079+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Kyoki FTW.

I've been thinking about this in relation to {{champion:91}}, for example. He has levitating blades and a Shumpo-style move, but this wasn't mentioned at all in his old lore-material, so it seems at least ambiguous from the lore-side? \n\nOther examples that I feel are _somewhat_ ambiguous are {{champion:84}}, {{champion:107}}, {{champion:36}}, {{champion:86}}, {{champion:64}}, {{champion:11}},{{champion:2}}, {{champion:80}}, {{champion:78}} & {{champion:98}}. To what extent do their in-game abilities correspond with their abilities in the story-world? \nHow important, extraordinary and explainable is **Katarina's** ability to shumpo; is it \"noteworthy\" that she can do that, considering it hasn't been \"commented on\", other than art and videos _showing_ that she _can_ do it? Does Lee Sin use magical or regular sound? Is there an explanaiton for Rengar's stealth-ability other than \"he just can\"? Does Mundo _actually_ summon orbiting fire? Is it commonplace or explainable for Shen/Garen/Poppy to do something like their ults? Is this something that you intend to explore in future stories?\n\nA more generalized and non-specific answer would also be welcome, of course.","replies":[{"poster":"The Soulforged","date":"2015-07-17T17:27:17.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm quite sure kat has a small amount of magical ability that she uses to shunpo, but the rest is just a lot of skill with blades.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kitcat300","date":"2015-07-15T16:50:07.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always assumed enchanted weaponry.
