Due to privacy laws, his behavior / punishment is literally none of your business.\n\nSo if the dude had a one off game, your encounter with him will not get him punished. But if he was consistently toxic, then the system will pick him up.\n\nEven if he got chat restricted the next game, you'll never know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"duckarp","date":"2017-03-19T09:46:24.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Naming&shaming?
