The system is designed this way so it cannot be abused. In this situation, the best action to take is to report the suspected player and provide as many details as possible. In this way, you help us prioritize who we look at. \n\nCheaters really stink, especially if they're in ranked games trying to ruin other's games. I encourage you to continue reporting those who are not upholding the competitive spirit and are cheating so that we can ensure the playing field is even for everyone.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"PuryPuryPrisoner","date":"2016-09-18T21:08:50.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not really then no, how is it possible tho? to still have hackers in league?\n\nhis name was skybladerz btw i dont know if am allowed to mention the hackers name.","replies":[]}]}]}
