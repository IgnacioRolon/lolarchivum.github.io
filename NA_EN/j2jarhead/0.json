I dont know why this happened or if it was intentional or not. I have not contacted him because I feel a bit rude if I asked what happened to my skin and he maybe refunded it or something, so I just want to know what happened. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T20:25:37.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That'd be pretty upsetting to see a skin gift randomly stop working =\\ . I went ahead and looked over your purchase/gift history, and it does show that the Debonair Jayce skin was refunded by the person who sent it.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-08-11T20:34:31.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought you couldn't refund gifts.
