Are you getting error messages?  If you have any feedback as well, be sure to share it on the [client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards while the updated version is still in testing.","replies":[{"poster":"Netherfang04","date":"2017-03-18T23:01:29.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do not know about him however I know I am having plenty of problems with this new client myself. It keeps crashing on me (often enough) sometimes before or after I pick my champ. In fact just a min ago i picked my champ got locked out and then they had to remake the game and I got punished for not being able to connect. Now i cant get awards (key shards) and it is super annoying to get punished because the client keeps freezing. This is not the first time this has happened. I like how pretty the new client looks but the crashing is annoying. If you watch Youtube it happens to plenty of the well known League Youtubers such as Redmercy. His client crashed in his D2 Promos like 2-3 times.","replies":[]}]}]}
