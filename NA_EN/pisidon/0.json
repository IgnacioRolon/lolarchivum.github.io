But I feel like it has to be done. \r\nHer \"Q\" could be very similar and look exactly the same just a re color.\r\nThe underground \"Q\" you can shoot a tiny wave. \r\nFor her w she could have the fun stick out of the water like you see in jaws evt.\r\nWhen coming out of the \"water/ground\" she can be doing the generic lunge where the shark flies out of the water. The bite into more of a sideway shark like bite.\r\nThe tunnels can be replaced with whirlpool. Rek'sai could ride a wave for her ult. \r\n\r\n     I haven't seen anything like this I think this would be a great skin for Rek'sai.","replies":[{"poster":"LordJado","date":"2015-01-21T00:00:32.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not my picture","replies":[{"poster":"DragonJLove","date":"2015-01-21T00:05:42.063+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ohhh lochness reksai","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-21T00:03:15.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, to me the whole appeal of Rek'sai is that she's a shark, but on the land.  Taking away the land part pretty much just makes her, you know, a shark.","replies":[]}]}
