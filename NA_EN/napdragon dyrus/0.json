He randomly received a perma ban despite never before getting banned or even receiving warnings for being toxic, cheating etc. He's had this account (plat 4) for nearly 10 years and over time has spent a lot time and money on skins. I wish in this ban riot would at least show what proof someone has been cheating, but of course then they would have no reason to ban him. Sadly perma- banned accounts apparently are very hard to get back, so we're looking into either getting his money back for his skins or sueing LoL for wrongly banning him. He has much more respect for riot then I do so it makes me sad to see how bummed he is about loosing the account he's had since he was a 12. \r\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}\r\nIf anyone has any tips for pursuing  this I'd appreciate it! \r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}
