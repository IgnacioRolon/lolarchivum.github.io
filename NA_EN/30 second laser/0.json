It seems that no matter how good I do, no matter how many triple kills I land with my Ultimate I cannot get an S. I noticed the system is entirely flawed when I saw that my friend who went 9/3 got an S- and I who went 21/0 got an A-. We were together the whole match helping each other score kills. I understand that he got the S- it was well deserved, but for me to receive such a low score is just unfair. I don&#039;t know what you want from me riot! I can only one shot their carries so well! Lux is an ambush assassin mage, its Q E R thats it! I cant do the amazing dashes and close up fights like Yasuo. Lower the &quot;MASTERY&quot; for Lux. I find it impossible to score any thing better than an A with Lux no matter how well I do (not just score wise but setting up kills and combos ect...). \r\n\r\nPS- is this serious? not at all... Im just very upset my time is wasted so often by this what seems like rng based ranking system!","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-30T01:05:27.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So.. the moral of this story is you are not very good at playing lux, or..?\n\nAlso, FGMs always give really easy S ranks, i got something like 8 S- or higher out of 10 ARURF games, nemesis draft is also a gold mine for them. Anything nonmeta totally screws with the grading system.","replies":[{"poster":"30 Second Laser","date":"2016-09-30T01:19:14.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are all bad lol, the only person who ever believes we are good is ourselves.

Even if you're a mid laner you should be warding both side bushes, and keeping a pink in top river bush. \n\nYou avg 88 CS per game on Lux, AND your KDA avg is 6/10/5 \n\nYou've got a lot to work on if you want to get those mastery levels! \n\nGood Luck {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"AdeBug","date":"2016-09-30T01:23:02.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if it's not kda, it's cs, gold, damage\nat least til 2 days ago when I actually had most kills, most cs, most gold, most dmg and 2 other people got S's :| sometihng changed?!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pantheon Forever","date":"2016-09-30T01:03:02.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"S rank depends on many things including roll/cs/kills/deaths/objectives and most importantly so I will include it separately is the relationship of how you did compared to others.
