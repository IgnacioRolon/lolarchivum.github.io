I was happy with that. Then the next day when I got home from work, I jumped on and checked and it said I have 1151 MMR................why? I didn't play any Ranked games since then, so how would it drop that much?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-07T22:14:14.218+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As *Deep Terror Nami* mentioned, third party sites are only able to estimate your MMR. Your \"estimated\" MMR can change even by checking different sites, as they all use slightly different formulas in how they calculate your MMR. **Riot** is the only one with access to your actual MMR figure and we don't release that info publicly, therefore third party sites cannot accurately provide that information.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"OtakuGaming","date":"2016-08-07T23:36:22.609+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"why does riot not provide those information? Can you give us the reason behind that one? Wont change much if you know how bad or good your MMR is just through knowing it. You can just tell by your MMR : well it is pretty low for that elo and i got a 3 game losing streak on 0 lp. I guess ill drop after the next one for sure.. but nothing else , or do i miss something?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-08-07T19:10:59.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MMR doesn't move very quickly. Only Riot has your real MMR, while third party sites (like op.gg) only have a rough estimation based on their own algorithms with incomplete information.","replies":[]}]}
