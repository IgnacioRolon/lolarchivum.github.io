Champs with heavy AoE can blow up his turret nest. Someone like gragas can simply knock him and his turrets away from each other. Yi annihilates his turrets since they are coded as minions (and take tons of bonus damage from alpha strike). If your solo laner can take smite without giving up too much, the two of you can instantly delete his ulted turret and then rage on him. Champs with spammable poke (ziggs, lux, xerath) can prevent him from ever really building up a turret nest. You can also bait out his ult turret, walk away, and come back in a minute for a kill.\n\nHeimer is a one-trick pony. If you know you're going up against him, he's extremely easy to counterpick. And he's pretty much useless against the right lane opponent/comp. IMO, his solo queue win rate is ridiculously high because people aren't organized enough to play around him. They underestimate him and play into his strengths. He's not too hard to counter if you understand his kit.

If you're trying to gank heimer it should be before then. Also you may be better off doing something other than ganking him. He doesn't roam well, so you can go bot or top w/ you mid and dive them pretty easy.\n\nTLDR; Match ups and options.\n\nIf you want to win lane there are a lot of options and probably a half dozen hard counters at least. I'll go through lane and jg options below and say how each can do something to shut down heimer if they know the match up and play right.\n\n{{champion:1}} I think can still set up ganks really well. Not sure if she can still out range turrets w/ her autos after the nerf but I think she can. Have her auto turrets and q them when they're low (she has to be able to dodge the laser but that's not hard). If you can get him down to 1 turret, 2 if you can't kill them faster, then she can stun (may need to flash) and her r,w,q,ignite will chunk him hard. He can't ult q untill after the stun, and if the jg brings damage then he's dead before he can react (or if you're lucky he ult q then immediately dies and you can just back off while he wasted ult), or if the jg brings more cc then you chain cc him so he can't ult q and you can live bc he doesn't have 3 turrets up.\n\n{{champion:31}} It's probably not something you're gonna like, but if heimer drops ult q, cho can use r to kill it instantly. a jg smite to kill one turret, and maybe cho dropping him to one or two turrets before the gank by using rupture and scream to kill turrets while clearing the wave (just find the right angle), and suddenly heimer has very little damage and is probably pushed up and silenced.\n\n{{champion:122}} Not a good option, but if heimer isn't careful a good e can pull him out of turrets and a jg who is lane ganking can stun and you can probably kill him without getting double killed. Heimer has to misplay bad though, so this isn't a good one, just worth mentioning that even bad match ups can have options.\n\n{{champion:131}} If he doesn't take exhaust she can burst him pretty hard and her shield can keep her alive, just bait the lasers first (it's a big damage difference if they're on cd) and then as jg use the time he is interrupted by her pull to stun him so he can't react. If he brings exhaust you have to bait that first bc the only option w/ this lane is to burst him fast.\n\n{{champion:268}} Forgot this one as I was going through pictures. His soldier clear heimer turrets pretty easily actually and the hole knock up ult push thing can bump heimer into his tower if heimer does push and goes to far.\n\n{{champion:245}} Not a terrible match up for heim, but his q can clear turrets to set up for a gank, he has a stun to lock heimer down, and he can ult out before dying. His burst w/ a damage jg, or chain cc if he can land his and you don't have dmg from the jg can work well.\n\n{{champion:81}} Can poke down turrets and poke heimer. Get him low, reduce his turret count, then cc him ult him, kill him.\n\n{{champion:60}} Ganking her stun can lock him down so he can't ult q, and rappel can drop turret aggro if she's close to death. Go in w/ enemy minions on their way and you can even rappel to the incoming creep wave before they hit his turrets so you can get out.\n\n{{champion:9}} His ult deals a ton of damage, and also clears turrets in the area. Heim can't ult q or ult w while feared and silenced, and drain should keep you alive even in 3 turrets long enough for ult to drop his turrets or for you and the lane to get the kill and get out.\n\n{{champion:114}} Ult drops aggro. You need hard cc from jg, and you're screwed once he builds zhonyas. It's a really bad match up for her and you're probably screwed, but if you can help w/ an invade or get an early roam or two off and get even a little ahead you can burst him down w/ the jungle (or lane if you're jg and got fed off other ganks) super easy w/ your ult. You just have to make sure he doesn't have exhaust or zhonyas up, and don't get hit by his stun when you go in.\n\n{{champion:105}} Same as the above. You're gonna get zoned and poked to death in lane. Get to a sheen and roam, if you can kill bot or top you may have enough damage to one shot him w/ the jg quick enough to troll pole out and be fine. It's a bad match up for fizz, but if he gets ahead and heim doesn't have exhaust up then just make the squishy go boom and then hop out. Only works if you can avoid heim stun and land your shark.\n\n{{champion:86}} Can silence to prevent ult q and can actually get tanky enough to survive in 3 turrets. Use the bush control like a garen master, don't get hit by stun, silence and burst down w/ the jg. Need to get at least a cowl first though probably.\n\n{{champion:79}} His ult can knock heimer out of his turrets so heimer loses safety. Generally just ult q isn't enough to save heimer in a 1v2. If you're really good you can ult him out then body slam to keep him from ulting or flashing, and any major burst or cc from lane should seal the deal.\n\n{{champion:120}} Ult stops heimer ult and escape, q can kill turrets while killing heimer if the horse gets ahead enough to out damage heimer. Also if you knock back w/ the speedy charge thing you can kick him out of the turrets so everyone takes less damage by not fighting in all 3 turrets.\n\n{{champion:39}} A good one absolutely shits on heimer. With sheen and w up she can one shot turrets w/ q unless heimer is way ahead. This is a match up I end up leveling rockets first about half the time. If heimer gets ahead and can stack up enough AP to give turrets more hp than irelia can one shot them for, it becomes pretty bad for her. However, if she isn't entirely crushed to start then pop w and use q w/ sheen proc up and just 1 shot the turrets. Heim won't be able to keep them up and a heim w/ no turrets is easy to kill.\n\n{{champion:40}} I'm pretty sure heim turrets are effected by her ult, so a well place ult in team fights can remove heim ult q. Not a match up for solo lanes or a jg so I'm not sure but it's worth mentioning if your team has one mid game.\n\n{{champion:126}} Learn to hit the minion wave and his turrets w/ shock blast and poke the turrets down while you farm. Jumping to a minion behind him lets you hammer knock back to kick him out of his remaining turrets and jg can lock him down for both to kill.\n\n{{champion:30}} Q skittles the turrets and get rid of them before the gank. Then just land your wall and let the gank play out like normal bc heim won't have 3 turrets for safety.\n\n{{champion:10}} Use ranged attack to kill turrets, ult if need be during the gank.\n\n{{champion:96}} Poke heimer low, kill his turrets, gank to finish up. This is a really bad match up for heimer. In team fights though be careful bc heimer ult E is surprisingly long range and kog doesn't have escapes so heim can lock you down and kill you.\n\n{{champion:64}} Use ult kick to displace him from his turret nest. Let go of the gank if he flashes back into his turret nest. Just come back for him, your ult will be up before his flash is.\n\n{{champion:99}} Poke him down, get cc from jg and maybe a little dmg, kill w/ ult. Stay out of turret range and heim is easy for this match up. If he can dodge the lux skill shots though the spread of his rockets makes them easy poke to land and he will out poke lux, so it's pretty even honestly.\n\n{{champion:90}} I get this guy a lot as heimer, I think people assume it's a free win. If you can kill the turrets w/ nightmares then the suppression ult and silence can make him easy. The thing I've seen good ones do is use the pool w/ the nightmares to help make sure the nightmare actually kills the turrets and keeps jumping. A decent heimer will move turrets farther apart so he doesn't lose them all, but this reduces damage if you try to dive him in his defenses.\n\n{{champion:57}} AOE dmg reduction bitches. Pretty good, but you're not doing anything until 6 probably unless you get saplings and Q's that hit enough to keep his turret count down. Then you can kill w/ jg. Jg mao should look to kill at 6 or if the lane can keep his turret count down and use the hard cc on mao to keep heim from ult q early in the fight.\n\n{{champion:11}} Can wipe out most of his turrets leaving only the ult to deal w/. Time your alpha strike and gank for when there are no minions so ideally it bounces to all 3 turrets and removes his damage at the start.\n\n{{champion:25}} Try to pool minions and turrets at the same time to keep the count down. A decent heimer won't let you. If you can keep turrets to 1 or 2 (and if it's 2 you better be sure he is out of kits so it doesn't become 3 on your jg immediately) then land morg stun, shield the jg, and have jg smite a turret as they go in (if they don't have a smite that can hit heimer). Should be an easy kill or summoners blown.\n\n{{champion:76}} Kill the turrets w/ spears and get his count down. Land one or even a few to chunk heimer down. Get cc from jg and burst him ezpz.\n\n{{champion:20}} Not the best option, but consume and smite can remove a lot of heimer damage and you're probably tanky enough to take the aggro while the lane kills him.\n\n{{champion:78}} Can knock him out of turrets for ganks, but honestly just wait for team fights, ult someone else so turrets don't hurt, go kill heimer.\n\n{{champion:33}} Fuck this guy. I hate him so much. Rammus ult eats heimer turrets for breakfast and his taunt makes it almost impossible to get a double stun on jg and lane when heimer is ganked (bc heim has to use it early or he's probably dead by the end of taunt). Watch out for stun as you roll in on the armordillo, and remember that heimer can drop a q turret to interrupt the roll knock up.\n\n{{champion:107}} and {{champion:92}} Can burst heimer easy if they get ahead. Watch out if heimer takes exhaust top lane bc it probably means he knows the match up, and if you don't get ahead you may not have damage to burst him and will have to be a bit more careful.\n\n{{champion:13}} Can work if the shield is strong and you can live. The w or e (whichever isn't the stun) will bounce w/ his turrets so the damage is increased. Depends on the jg ganking, but you probably need a gank to get a kill. Wait for late game and just scale up.","replies":[{"poster":"dEAdbUs","date":"2015-07-28T05:58:39.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poppy is probably worst pick vs Heimer.

To win you would have to be more comfortable on the champ than the person on heimer is, but if you early pick a champ you're really good at and get \"countered\" by a heimer pick, it is possible to still do something. Irelia has to play the match up right. It's not easy, but it's definitely not as hard to win as many champs. If you pull off a 3 or 4 min gank when heimer isn't as strong or fully set up and can get first blood, it's hard to lose as Irelia bc you one shot heimer turrets and can hit him pretty hard when his defenses are down.\n\nAlso heimer is kinda a champ who is great against some match ups and terrible against others. He's too match up dependent. Most of his bad match ups/hard counters are in the second post of match ups that is a reply to this one.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mr Spaceman","date":"2015-07-27T08:07:59.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i play the best game as {{champion:14}}  vs. top {{champion:74}} \nall i did was lvl e and then e them away it was SOOO funny\nhe had noo turrets that where at the minon line i even got his tower","replies":[{"poster":"dEAdbUs","date":"2015-07-28T05:51:29.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sion can't kill good Himer, but Heimer can't kill good Sion too.
