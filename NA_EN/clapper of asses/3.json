Heck its faster in some ways than a voice system as that's mainly for planning. Also considering how so many other game's with similar or even weaker infrastructures behind them succeed in having a voice chat system without breaking things i don't see how that's a problem for a big company like Riot.

The issue isn't that there can be more team work... it's that one side gets the team work and the other side doesn't.  In other words, when you're the one solo que going up against a premade.  As the original poster is making a joke about it I think they hit the problem spot on.\n\nIf I'm mid, and I see that mid, top, and their jg are also a premade I expect to get camped by them for the next 20 minutes straight especially if the top laner is a shen or pantheon.  That isn't indicating skill levels (when it happens to anyone), it just indicates how well you can get a group together to cheese the people who are not grouped.\n\nI thought it wouldn't be so bad if it matched premades to other premades, but I've had several full team solo que games against 4 and 3 man premades as well as those games where you get the premade that just feeds in every lane and feel like there's nothing you can do.\n\nI've also been the JG in a game where there was a trio on either side, and their trio invaded my JG in waves every 2 minutes and our trio BM'ed me by also taking our own JG camps.  One of them even last hit one I was already killing then spammed laugh command.  Everyone fed except our mid. :/","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"bill84","date":"2016-03-29T01:40:14.085+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You forgot the toxic adc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darius or Dunk","date":"2016-03-30T17:55:14.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup that happened to me last night I was {{champion:236}} with {{champion:89}} supp we were a duo premade there mid and jg was in our lane every other minute","replies":[]},{"poster":"TNHA Baritone","date":"2016-03-30T10:56:10.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the reason why I despise Dynamic Q","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Liberal","date":"2016-03-30T05:57:40.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whenever I am afraid of a dive heavy team comp I always pick Morgana or Lissandra.
