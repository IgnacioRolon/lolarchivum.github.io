It makes the Q resets very unimpressive and just tells you \"You're not allowed to go near minions anymore or you die.\"\n\nHer damage and everything when she lands it feels a bit high, but I think that's mainly because she's able to land it relatively easily now.  Just toning down her ability to be more mobile in a minion wave than Yasuo would probably do it.","replies":[{"poster":"PowerSlave993","date":"2018-11-20T22:52:26.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"''You're not allowed to go near minions anymore or you die'' was a thing even back on old Irelia.\n\nBut for damage, yep it is high due to bad kit design.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-11-20T23:53:08.391+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think old Irelia would consistently kill minions from full health with just her Q though.

The only difference is adding the magic damage which is good to not miss minions at the very low health.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CithriaC","date":"2018-11-21T01:54:14.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Votable Jester,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=msdX7Fqp,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-20T23:53:08.391+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t think old Irelia would consistently kill minions from full health with just her Q though.
