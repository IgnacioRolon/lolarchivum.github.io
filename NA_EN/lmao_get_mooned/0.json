I cant see my summoner spells, runes, masteries, the champions that anyone is selecting and i can very rarely ban. After this happens the client will crash and stop responding forcing me to restart the client and wait 5 minutes. Yes, i've tried repairing it. It's a completely useless feature.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-26T15:33:58.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client is unable to keep a stable connection to the servers, which is why you're having issues seeing content and actions in champ select.
