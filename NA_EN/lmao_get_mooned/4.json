I&#039;ve never been able to beat a syndra in lane no matter what champion i play becaise he spells have a .1 second cast time and you definitely don&#039;t have enough time to walk out of. Not to mention that at rank 2 with 200 ap her ult does 800 damage and is point and click. The only way to not get hit by this champion&#039;s spells is to have an hourglass, 4 ludens, and mobility boots then you MIGHT not get hit.","replies":[{"poster":"WolfChases","date":"2016-08-20T21:53:32.995+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wtf are you talking about Mr. Nonsense?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2016-08-20T22:19:11.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"What's this?

To be completely honest with you, I was hoping to be placed in bronze 5 because it is so much fun. Not to be an elitist or anything, but people who do belong in bronze are unable to dodge MOST abilities in the game, while also having to worry about farming and map awareness. \n\nBut I know you are asking right now, \"Subject 5, How do you beat a Syndra in lane?\" I am so glad that you asked this and definitely not me forcing the words into your mouth just then. How do you beat her? Stay out of her Q range, use abilities to farm and punish her for being aggressive- she is very weak against mobility and weak against long range champions. So you want to pick champions like:\n\n{{champion:238}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:112}} \n\nChampions you don't want to pick against her: {{champion:1}} {{champion:84}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"UltraGigaNiga","date":"2016-08-21T01:21:01.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even platinum syndra mains are pretty crappy; how the hell do you lose to a bronze one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrDiaga","date":"2016-08-20T23:10:51.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.

Winning lane against syndra is virtually impossible if you play normal mages, even with a champion that technically counters her - look at the stats on websites like matchup.gg and op.gg. Her constant nearly unavoidable poke is really absurd.\n\nYour best bet is taking a mobile ranged champion or someone who can easily dodge her Qs without mana issues, and wait to outscale her.","replies":[]}]}
