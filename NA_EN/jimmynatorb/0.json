You can post your suggestions / worries / thanks in this thread. Here are some guidelines:**\n\n1.  Please, don't say OMG RITO YOU KILLED SONA GG WP. Keep the discussion constructive and let's try to help Fearless instead of giving him headaches and depressing him.\n2. Ignore comments of the sort of \"Riot doesn't care\" or \"This is just bad\". Don't harass Riot or other people. It doesn't help anyone pointing out mistakes and not giving any solution.\n3. Inform yourself before offering a suggestion and make sure it hasn't been discussed before, otherwise you're going to be ignored.\n4. Please, post your thoughts before up- or downvoting a post. This way people will know why their post is being disliked or liked.\n\n**Why was Sona reworked?**\n> Essentially, we took Sona to the update board because we saw a unique opportunity to make her more rewarding and more fun. She wasn’t terribly strong or weak, but her kit clearly lacked high moments and overall satisfaction. We wanted to keep her theme as it was and retain her awesome Crescendo while giving her basic abilities a more visible and tangible impact. Oh, and if we could sneak in some fancy texture updates in the process (and we could!), then all the better.\n> \n> *- Fearless*\n\n**What is the rework supposed to feel like?**\n> Sona’s gameplay now revolves more around moments of power. Instead of hanging back and winning a war of attrition during laning, Sona’s now got the kit to power up her allies and save their lives when a fight turns against them. Auras are smaller and more visible now, so getting the most of them requires great positional awareness for Sona and coordination with her allies. This allows us to reward great play with much more impact for each of her songs. You’ll be able to make plays as Sona, earn your team kills and save lives with clutch ability casts and smart positioning. At the same time, the enemy team has larger windows to fight back in thanks to her longer cooldowns, adding in clarity and counterplay to Sona’s kit. We can't wait to see what players can do with her update.\n> \n> *- Fearless*\n\nHere's the rework page for reference:\n[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/champion-update/sona-maven-of-the-strings](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/champion-update/sona-maven-of-the-strings)\n\nPlease remember to like the thread so that the conversation doesn't die and to keep the thread on top of the page (It would be nice if it could be made a sticky post, but I don't have the power to do that).","replies":[{"poster":"Straight Jackin","date":"2014-07-30T01:56:39.967+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played 296 ranked games as Sona over Season 3 and 4. I've felt like Sona has been in a good place for the last 2 seasons. She has a lower than average pick rate. No one has ever requested me to play her in champ select. No one considers her God tier support. Sometimes people will even ask me if I can play Morgana instead when I go to pick her. However every Sona main I know seems very happy with where she is. How many champs in this game can you say that about unless that champ is overpowered? \n\n**She feels extremely balanced currently as she is on Live.**\n\nReworking Sona so that everyone in game knows that after she uses an ability she'll probably move in the direction of her ADC to 'tag' them is a serious telegraph. Making her squishier early game, lowering her aura range and increasing her cooldowns is going to kill her early laning phase. Currently I take Q at lvl 1. Every Sona main knows that if you get hit by anything at lvl 1 you are in a VERY bad spot compared to most supports.\n\nI don't like the direction they are taking her at all.

I love Sona, but this is a real kick in the happy place to the poor mute...\n3- She needed to stay back because of her low defenses, and her kit was designed to help her AND allies so she can: A) not die and B) make sure her allies don't die annd C) make sure the enmey dies. Now she is much more suspectable to the powers that be ganks and enemy pushing...\nI know you will probably ingore this... but just, let the mute girl be..

Do you really believe that?  There have just been way too many VU/GU that were downvoted into oblivion but pushed Live despite player feedback for me to believe that.  Karma and Trundle are two that stick out like sore thumbs.  There's also Xerath who got a lot of negativity spewed toward his rework.  \n\nThe fact is that people grow to love Champions how they are.  Then a designer comes in and shifts them entirely, whether gameplay wise or visually/lore wise.  Then fans get ignored in favor of people who never play them.  And you expect us to believe you care about our feedback?\n\nI don't know you Fearless, but if you're anything like the myriad of designers that have worked on reworks in the past, you aren't looking for the feedback that hurts.  You're looking for \"Where can we fix what's wrong with NEW Sona?\" instead of \"Do players like NEW Sona?  Should we revert to OLD Sona?\" etc.  \n\nMaybe you aren't like them at all.  And like I said, I have nothing to contribute about the Sona Update.  All I will say is that the players here that are giving their concern that you seem to be pushing to the side as if it's unimportant (that's the tone I received reading your messages), they're the fans of Sona that just loved her how she was and didn't want a change.  Don't ignore their opinions.  And I know that you can countless others have worked on Sona for a long time to make her feel good and be more interactive.  But maybe Sona players never wanted that...maybe Sona players liked her how she was.  Don't be so prideful as to ignore the \"revert\" option.  \n\nI still miss old Trundle to this day.  And I still feel Riot spit in Trundle fans' faces when he was redone.  Don't leave Sona fans with that awful taste in their mouths.  I know you have no desire to do that.  But like I said.  If the majority are shouting \"revert\", don't shout back \"onward we march with new Sona!\"  Because you won't get applause back.  You'll just leave a lot of the playerbase feeling anger and frustration with Riot.\n\nI guess that's all I've got to say.","replies":[{"poster":"Fearless","date":"2014-07-31T02:22:53.240+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":19,"body":"So the idea that we would stop all progress to address something that we believe is problematic or unhealthy is not something we can support. Sometimes, we as designers make mistakes and create things that are bad for the game. We have to change them. Sona's previous iteration was very problematic, and led to us always having to keep her less satisfying to keep her even close to balanced. We did seek out player feedback to shape what elements we kept and what we changed. The information from the Let's Talk about Sona threads shaped our understanding of Sona and changed some of my goals. \n\nThat being said, we don't make every change players want, and sometimes we look at the changes players request, and try to understand what is causing those desires, and react to that.\n\nI'm sorry Trundle stung. No one on Champion Update is anything but devoted to players. The team has a really rough job of changing things that we know will be better for the health at the game, at the cost of disruption and pain for some amount of existing players. I can't tell you how much that does weigh on people, but they happily tank that for the good of League. We don't do these projects for applause, and I signed up for Sona knowing I was going to be changing a champ that tons of our players love, that I love, and that my very good friends love. I knew I'd have to do a bunch of these posts to defend the work, and try to convince people that we make these changes because we are working on our favorite game, and we believe these changes make our game healthier, and better, and give us room to keep making this game for a really long time. \n\nThanks for the post.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-07-31T02:32:22.246+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get that you probably know better than us, but when you make several threads asking for feedback and state that you're going to put her on the PBE longer for more feedback and then seemingly ignore said feedback, it leaves a bad taste on my mouth.

Nami was just nerfed not because she is overpowered but because quoting a person at riot \"she is starting to see a lot of play.\" That's because of the ADC changes and support changes you guys made, not because Nami has secretly been OP for months.  So according to Riot if a champion starts to see a lot of play that automatically makes them overpowered? That's ridiculous, and the game will never be balanced with that mentality. Where are the masses of people who were calling for a Sona rework? Most people just wanted small buffs to her base armor and health so her early laning wasn't as squishy, you know how a lvl 1-2 draven can like 2-3 shot her? I can't stand when people are misleading whether intentional or unintentional it's BS.\n\nYour team needs to hire some actual normal gamers for testing purposes, because right now it seems like there is a big disconnect.

Although the role itself is now in a healthier place, many of the champions who were traditionally played in that role are pushed out in favor of \"non-traditional\" supports.\n\n- In the immediate aftermath the community is told it's too soon to jump to any conclusions.\n\n- About two months later a few Reds post on the forums saying that, yeah, those changes were unintentionally harsh on the squishy utility-mage type supports.\n\n- Absolute silence on the issue (or any other issue for that matter) for several months.\n\n- About five months post-change: Riot re-confirms that the issue exists\n\n- About six months in: the balance team starts discussing actual fixes. They say they're going to take a multi-step approach to the problem, and the first step is going to be some itemization changes.\n\n- Month seven: the itemization change comes out. This doesn't seem to help the traditional squishy supports at all, but support Morgana is now a thing.\n\n- Month eight: Riot begins denying that the problem ever existed. All hopes of seeing it fixed are quashed.\n\nI know you weren't personally involved (at least directly) with many of the past instances, but there is a pattern here.

I think it's more visible whether or not something is is being buffed or nerfed if you actually look at the numbers. When the changes to Nid came they displayed all of her numbers, it feels like they're hiding it for Sona = =; I already posted my thoughts on a forum I made yesterday so I guess I could just repeat it here.\n\nSona is my main support and while I haven't been keeping count I'm fairly certain I've played over 100 games with her. I don't have PBE access so I haven't been able to try the new Sona. I love Sona how she is and I find this rework completely unwarranted. Despite many players saying she's under powered or can't compete with current high pick supports, she's had an over 50% win rate for quite some time. The justification for the rework is that Sona is unsatisfying to play and lacks play making ability outside of her ult, and that much of her power is invisible because they reside in her auras. Not everyone will or can appreciate the aura support play style that is a huge part of Sona's identity. Not all play styles will be popular in comparison to others, much like not all genres of music will be popular in comparison to others. I don't understand why Sona must be changed to conform to more popular play styles when there are over 100 other champs to choose from who can be flashy or make plays if that's the desired style. If her auras are too invisible new visual effects should take care of that, or at least try that first. The new VFX should help players realize and take notice of Sona's auras more. Appreciation is sure to follow realization. Reworking her kit without trying just the VFX first seems like cutting off a leg because of an infection without trying antibiotics first or something of the sort. I also feel that part of Sona is that she is seen as one of the lower skill cap champs and often relaxing to play as a result, and I don't think that should change. If you MUST give her more play making ability I like an idea my brother came up with where if you get a certain combination of chord procs you get a new effect. For example, since it is possible to get 2 chords off if charged initially, hitting an enemy with an e chord and an additional e chord before the effects of the first chord wear off results in a root. If more visibility is needed the first chord can mark the target like Nid's abilities now do. It doesn't make sense to me to change Sona from an aura support to a friendly AoE caster nor do I find the idea of chasing allies to tag them appealing.\n\nTo add to that I don't like how her ratios have been cut. I liked the fact that Sona had an AP off build and disapprove of Riot funneling supports into one role, as they've attempted to do with Lulu and Soraka. I agree with many others on the fact that her range decrease is an AoE hazard and that she really doesn't have any added play making ability, she still has to rely on her ult for that. Her increased cooldowns also take away Sona's ability to spam which was a huge part of her gameplay identity imo.","replies":[{"poster":"JimmynatorB","date":"2014-07-30T01:05:56.623+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"Numbers aren't in the rework page because they can be tuned if she needs some power. It is a bit early to talk about her power level, so we should try to talk about the overall changes more than about balance. Also, remember her Q aura now has an AP ratio she didn't have, so some ratios may seem like nerfs, but they just moved that power to another place, just like hew W heal was moved a bit to her new shield.\n\nIt is true that they could have tried giving auras some kind of VFX before reworking her to see if that fixed her problems. It would be nice to have a response from someone involved in the rework to see if they actually tried this.\n\nYour brother's suggestion is something Riot doesn't want because it would make sona very hard to play. If you've ever played DotA and tried Invoker, you'll see what I mean.\n\nAs I played her on the PBE, I can say that she is still relaxing to play, as her only new mechanic is the aura tagging one, which isn't as relaxing as the passive auras she had, but they are OK in that regard.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowGlaive213","date":"2014-07-30T01:49:47.497+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you look at the PBE forums you can see how much Riot is willing to change their ideas as a result of feedback from the community.

Her new Q and W are pretty awesome and the snuggle zone mechanic makes her a really fun support to play. Her ult keeps being that old teamfighting wonder we've all grown to like and her passive keeps being a good gameplay mechanic that makes you mix and match your abilities to get the desired effect.\n\nThen there's her E, which I feel could be better. Maybe it's just me, but her E doesn't give me the desired feedback. It basically only gives good feedback when initiating a teamfight, meaning that while laning and disengaging the ability feels weak. The ability is very selfish if you don't tag allies with it, which is strange given her other two abilities can support your team even when you can't tag them. Given this, I'd suggest giving it a better active so that we can feel we are helping our team even when we aren't able to tag allies with it.\n\nHer weaknesses are AOE comps and all-ins, while her strengths are giving team-wide sustain and damage that can help skew a fight heavily in favour of sona's team, and let's not forget her wonderful initiation with her ult and E. All of this gives sona fairly good weaknesses and strengths that can be balanced around if one of them is abusive for Sona or the enemies.","replies":[{"poster":"12tales","date":"2014-07-30T00:57:22.394+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not a Sona player, so sorry if this is a silly question, but why are AoE comps difficult for her?

I posted this earlier, but it got downvoted to invisibility (I think?). I've always loved Sona, and I'm eager to play her to see the rework, but I just wanted to know that the following possibility has been considered. Also if I wait, I'll probably forget to post this, heh.\n\nSona's basic abilities now get strengthened by ranks in Crescendo. Instead of just having more \"invisible\" power, I thought it would be a lot cooler for her aura *ranges* to increase with ranks in Crescendo (could have it in addition to the more direct numerical increase--that's up to balance).\n\n* Sure, it makes thematic sense for a crescendo to amplify the power of her auras, but I think it also makes sense (and physical sense, too) for her allies to be able to hear them from farther away.\n* The new aura zones necessitate a major playstyle shift for Sona, causing her to have to be more up front in fights to tag her allies. But the problem everyone has been complaining about is that she's too squishy to do this reliably later in the game (even midgame) in basically anything except a poke comp. As fights grow larger and she concurrently ranks up Crescendo, this way she gets slightly more wiggle room to manage (danger + tagging allies) vs. (safety). So, I think this change would keep Sona's potential effectiveness on par with the natural pace of the game.\n* I'm certain these range increases would have to be very small, but small radius increases should still have a very visible effect, as it's the *area* of the zones that's most visible, and possibly what's most important (though I guess area vs. radius being important depends on the situation).\n* Rather than thinking of it as simply making it *easier* for Sona to tag everyone as she ranks up ult, I would rather say this mechanic would give her a larger area of allied influence (which seems to be part of the premise of the rework), which could potentially affect team play in interesting ways in fights, etc., as Sona's allies try to interact (and have more possibilities opened up) with her zones. She of course shouldn't be allowed to sit way out of danger and tag everyone on her team, as if she had her old auras but instead with these more powerful tag effects--but again, that's numbers balance.\n\nIt might be tougher to balance than just having aura strength increases, but I think it's much more interesting and might alleviate some frustrations of her being too in danger to contribute meaningfully in larger fights.\n\nAs I said, I haven't really played her much yet, so I don't know if this is totally unreasonable. But regardless, I still think it's a cool idea, and of course I hope it is in fact reasonable.","replies":[{"poster":"DreamingOf Peace","date":"2014-07-31T03:22:27.468+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suggested this about 10 different times on the PBE boards.

Sona can easily be caught out of position and she get bursted down.

The shield duration is so low, that it probably won't tank any damage off if someone get focused. And her new e is.. pretty selfish, since sona benifits the most out of.

I really liked it that it gaves actually a speed buff to minions, so she can help them coming faster in lane.\n\nBut\nThey gave sona more strenghts.

My heals were incredible strong, the speed buff is extreme and my powerchord damage did hit the sky. with the upcoming Sona changes, I might be more risky with going AP support, but it might be really strong.

I don't personally feel comfortable poking with her early on unless I'm sure the opponents aren't going to react (e.g. aren't very skillful, aren't playing aggressive supports, can't keep me in place the second I step up to poke). She dies in very few hits.\n- With how squishy she is, I feel like taking W first is the only viable option for survival in case she gets caught level 1, but the heal still feels extremely insignificant (even with the shield).\n- I don't feel like I have much impact in lane early on. The Q buff feels clunky because I'm likely to steal CS with the two bolts.\n- I really wish the Q buff would work on towers, but I can see why it doesn't, since it gives a ton of siege potential later on when you can Q your whole team to take down a tower that much faster.\n- Sona really starts to pick up the pace when she gets her ult - not only because of the ult itself, but also because of the buffs it gives to her skills (in particular her E).\n- Sona REALLY starts to pick up the pace around when her ult is rank 2 and she has a couple of items.\n- Her late game feels considerably more powerful.\n- W feels very bad to use before late game. A small heal and a small shield are much harder to notice/less satisfying than just a big shield or a big heal. The effects are also conflicting - do I use my heal (with high mana costs) to keep my teammate topped off, or do I save it for when a shield is needed? The fact there's two of those combined in one makes the skill most useful only for a very specific situation - a trade where the teammate I'm trying to use the skill on has already taken damage. A pure heal is useful in any situation where a person has taken damage, and a pure shield is useful in any situation where a person is about to take damage. The shield is far too small (at least early on) to use with the teammate(s) at full health - it's a lot of mana for a tiny shield. It feels... restrictive, unlike other shields with extra effects which feel more comfortable to use even if you don't need the additional effect (e.g. Karma, Janna). Likewise, other heals with extra effects feel more comfortable to use even if you don't need the additional effect due to how Sona's heal scales.\n\nI think her very very weak early game could use some tweaks. Largely because she is so risky to use that she can become a null presence in lane, or be kill fodder and cause her opponents to snowball. My only qualm with a support having a very weak early game is the fact that typically, ADCs do, too, which can really hurt the lane as a whole early on. Support is typically the strong character who babysits the ADC while they're still weak, and Sona is far too squishy without any hard CC to compensate to be able to really babysit her ADC early on. Her sustain potential also took quite a hit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2014-07-31T18:29:56.776+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only time I really played Sona was as a non-meta mid laner for the most part.  I could not get over the fact that laning against two people could melt Sona easier than anyone else in the game.  So i stuck to mid lane as a poke mage with high sustain.  It works decently and it negates the issue.  As for Sona as a support, when playing against a team composition that wasn't particularly agressive, I had great success.  Unfortunatley the meta is firmly stuck in Leona, Braum, Thresh, and Morgana, which go for huge damage to lock down and take out ADCs in one play, something that Sona is hard countered by.  But despite this, Sona had a very firm presence in lane, and her buffs to her allies were still substantial with the auras despite the nerfs.\n\nWhat Riot did with the rework pigeonholed Sona as a homogeneous textbook support without any buffs for tradeoff.  \n\nThe only thing I like about this kit is the idea of tagging allies with abilities for bonus effects.  Everything else is the exact opposite of what needed to be done.  This rework makes Sona have to get on the front lines to do anything useful, which as squishy as she is (and with no ungodly buffs to her defenses to compensate for this) she might as well be Karthus with boobs.  She literally might as well get a passive buff her dying, because she'll do it a lot the way this kit is meant to be played.\n\nThe removal of permanent Auras might have been good if she was meant to be played as an AP mid like I play her, but it contradicts her whole attrition aura support aspect.  You're putting her in a position that detriments both her and her ADC.\n\nI know that you have said that you aren't supposed to attack Riot, but sometimes harsh criticism is necessary.  This rework is literally the worst one I've encountered.  If I could pull only one rework back out of any of the reworks that have been done in League's history, this would be the one.  And I'm pleading with Riot to undo the rework in patch 4.14.  This is not Olafing, this is Urgoting.  Sona will have a win rate and play rate around Urgot and Yorick if you do not change this next patch.  I guarantee it.  I don't think Sona needs a rework, but if you are dead-set on giving Sona a rework anyways, it's time to follow the PBE players advice and scrap this.  Take it back to square one and start fresh.  And like I said, I'm not attacking anyone, but this needs to be said.  Start fresh and put this rework behind as a neat idea that just didn't pan out and start over.  It happens.  I make champion concepts all the time, but I know when to scrap a concept that doesn't work after fan criticism.  It happens.  We're only human.","replies":[]}]}
