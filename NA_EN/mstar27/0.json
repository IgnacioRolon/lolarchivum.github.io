Or if one person carries your team and everyone honors them, you don't get the flair next game. You just have to get one honor (premades honoring you would be cheap so you would have to get 2 honors from premades).\n\nI didn't know this until I reviewed honor when I hit level 3, so I thought I'd share in case anyone else didn't thoroughly read through :p","replies":[]},{"poster":"justi1337","date":"2017-08-03T09:11:45.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive got honor lvl 3 and ive seen some people with flares so at this point people will probably start getting it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeeeesus","date":"2017-08-01T21:10:06.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just got level 3 honor, thanks Riot. <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dadelina","date":"2017-08-01T03:36:46.089+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am Honor level 3 and now going for Honor level 4.

I believe that the honor system has a daily limit, like most things in LoL. That means that if you play x amount of games such as a win per day and maybe 5 honors a day you max out for the day in gaining honor to the next rank. I believe this because I have been trying to climb out of bronze and I have been getting a lot of honor but it wasn't until i saw someone who got honor three that I logged back in and got honor 3.  I may be completely wrong but it was my next log in that tipped me off that it might have a max cap per day.","replies":[{"poster":"MSTAR27","date":"2017-08-18T07:04:49.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i hit honor 4 about a week ago. i wasn't even being active. but i guess i wasn't getting reported either.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sub to DKtruster","date":"2017-07-29T21:48:55.696+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, just got it\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/143113268968423424/340966745370263553/unknown.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"Diamondonger","date":"2017-07-29T20:55:16.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recently did, i played about 6 games a day for the first month receiving honors fairly frequently, then i went away for 3 weeks and within 2 or 3 games i got honor level 3","replies":[{"poster":"MSTAR27","date":"2017-08-18T07:05:21.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol yea. i heard a rumor that they lowered the bar for lv 3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrLegend","date":"2017-07-29T01:13:30.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i just got honor 3","replies":[{"poster":"MSTAR27","date":"2017-07-29T19:59:24.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"how long did it take you?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-08-21T15:48:53.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People have reported to be on Honor4 around a week ago.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MSTAR27","date":"2017-07-31T17:28:29.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got it yesterday.
