I am wondering what the Riot Sound and Music Team uses in this area. The post-college dream is to be a member of this team, and I think knowing the software to which I should be accustomed is ideal. Thank you for any help with which you can provide!","replies":[{"poster":"Utora","date":"2015-10-03T03:35:50.215+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great to hear about your goals TheElamite! Everyone at Riot uses the programs that they're most comfortable with. The composers on the audio team use Nuendo exclusively.  Some sound designers do as well. Other sound designers use Pro Tools and Reaper as well. A few others have Ableton Live as a secondary application. But those first three, Nuendo, Pro Tools, and Reaper are the main DAWs that the Riot Audio team uses with Nuendo being used by all of the composers. \n\nHope this helps! Best of luck to you!","replies":[{"poster":"TheElamite","date":"2015-10-05T02:05:45.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!

All DAWs do pretty much the same stuff nowadays, it's more an issue of flavor than functionality at this point. \n\nIf your dream is to become a professional media composer (with Riot or else), I suggest you get acquainted with pretty much everything out there, and make sure you make wise investments (composer rigs can be bottomless money pits!). Besides your DAW of choice, you'll most likely need to use Vienna Ensemble Pro at some point, as well as engraving software such as Sibelius or Finale. Some knowledge of Pro Tools is always helpful (I keep badgering my colleagues Vonderhamz and Riot Eno with PT questions :P ).\n\nBest of luck to you!","replies":[]}]}
