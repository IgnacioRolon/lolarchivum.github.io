The key difference here is that while *snared*, you can still use abilities and spells, however, a *stun* prevents all action from being taken. What likely happened is that you *snared* them with a dark binding, then they used Comet of Legend while in your *snare* and took off once the *snare* ended. Also, a snare will not take away their stars, but a stun will. \n\n*Reixis* is correct, we typically won't punish a player off a single report, so there's not much to worry about there. I hope this cleared the situation up for you. Please let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"a4gPMwM96q","date":"2016-09-13T01:46:36.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Youll be fine. More than likely, unless he was reported by a ton of people over the course of multiple games, they wont really look into it. (With all them un-intentionally feeding reports :P) Im pretty sure his E doesnt break stuns, maybe you mis-counted the seconds or something to that nature, ya know? You cant revoke that report. No way, no how. But theres no reason to ponder on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Riverisco","date":"2016-09-13T01:59:06.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it was done instantly after i hit him witch is why it was super super weird to me, but it was just the one time so a report not super necessary for that one. and it most likely wont get him in any trouble like you said i just feel like a grade A  a-hole is all, im Canadian, i cant help it XD but good to know to look things up before i report","replies":[]}]}]}
