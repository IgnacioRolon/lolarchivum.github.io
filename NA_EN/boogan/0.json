It's super important you regularly change your password, and it's possible that someone could be trying to gain access to your account.  Your region on the login page could also be incorrect.\n\nSee if [resetting your password](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751734-Recovering-Your-Password) is possible for you, otherwise you should be able to use that form without logging in.  Instead, you can input an email address you currently have access to.  If that doesn't work for you, you can also hit us up via support@riotgames.com.\n\nI also highly recommend running through our account protection guide to secure your info in and outside of League!  Don't worry, we can help you out but I want to make sure you get these pieces situated as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Boogan","date":"2017-10-07T22:12:35.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have access to the email currently on the account.
