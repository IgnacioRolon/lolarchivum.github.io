Don&#039;t Friend me","replies":[{"poster":"Dotrix","date":"2018-07-16T04:04:46.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ign: Dotrix\n\nRank solo and flex: P3 Solo Queue (was almost P1 but I tanked down a couple weeks ago, I got there once though so I can easily get there again after this unlucky losing streak turns around) P5 Flex gaining upwards of 30 LP per game and climbing fast.\n\nAvailability: Flexible after August 3, Tuesdays Wednesdays and Thursdays tend to be best until then\n\nAbout you: I've competed in several online leagues, against local colleges, and have a little bit of coaching experience as well. I've also played on two low diamond teams. I don't tilt at all really (unless we are just joking around and wasting time during practice), and I play every game until the very end without surrendering.\n\nStrengths: Teamfighting, consistency, damage calculation, and playing from behind. Even if I'm against a much better player, more often than not I'm able to contain them and lose gracefully in the worst case scenario. In other words it's not easy to shut me down and snowball on me. I'm pretty vocal usually, and I'd say I'm an average shotcaller if you need me to fill in for that role (my style is a bit micro manage-ey though so some people love it and others hate it). I'm also pretty punctual and organized, so I almost always come a little bit early to practice. I also can assist with the google docs/scheduling scrims etc.\n\nWeakness: I could improve on roaming more and being faster on rotations. I have much fewer issues in these areas if we have a very vocal shotcaller though. I'm also aware that sometimes when I think out loud, some of my more sensitive teammates in the past have gotten tilted. It's not my intention to be nitpicky or anything but I'm not thinking about my tone of voice etc mid-game, I'm thinking about the game. My champion pool is another thing I'm addressing because the difference in comfort between my best champions and my average champions is night and day, and I'm trying to close up that gap a little.\n\nWhy you want to join: I highly prefer team environments over solo queue\n\nTop 5 Champions: Azir Viktor Orianna Syndra Malzahar\n\nAny other champions you are proficient on: I used to be solid on Zed and Brand but I'm very out of practice. I'm also learning Corki, Cass, Galio, and Lissandra but I'm not very comfortable on those characters yet","replies":[]}]}
