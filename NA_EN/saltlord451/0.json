Talon&#039;s W is a pretty predictable, slow, and short ranged skillshot. Mages, especially ones like {{champion:115}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:101}} can easily sidestep the W on its way back if not, dodge the entire thing. I tried Q&#039;ing in then using W but Talon&#039;s Q has a short range and the mages will just kite back and i end up taking a bad trade. Any tips will be helpful. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2017-08-31T15:47:01.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can use Q as a means to lasthit a nearby minion then W into them while you gapclose just a bit, but enough and also get your Q on a reduced cooldown so you can use it while the Passive stacks on the enemy are still up. since they are slowed, chances are high you will land a crit aswell meaning you get to surprise them hard.\nbut it requires some work to get a minion thats nearby low enough while the enemy champion is also nearby aswell. Start training how to bait a trade is my advice for this Little trick. but be careful because considering earlygame you still have a 4 second cd on your Q with the last hit refund you can end up in a bad spot if said enemy put a point in their cc spell for Level 2, meaning your crit may be wasted, but you are likely to still land your Q then passive assuming they don't waste a flash. if they do, be sure your jungler gets a fiesta in your lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-31T15:44:26.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try casting it when they go for a cs or when they go to cast a spell you can use their cast time to dodge the spell and get closer (like, mid range).\n\nLike, if Lux goes for her E you can run towards her to dodge it and throw your W out. It is trickier on skillshots, but still very possible.\n\nGoing for the W when they try to cs can cause them to miss that cs if they dodge it, meaning even if you don't land both hits you still cost them gold.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shaydrox","date":"2017-09-01T11:58:51.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally I would advice you to use the skill much like most have already mentioned, when enemies lock themselves into an animation or lasthit of some sorts. Remember however, that Talon's main strength (past his lvl 2 powerspike) is his roaming power. If you struggle to land your W on players for any possible reason, it's a viable strategy to stop bothering and instead use it for farm only. Then after you've cleared a wave you look for a roaming opportunity. If you cannot roam you just stay and keep waveclearing. This way you won't fall behind because you're getting cs, while playing to your strengths when possible. Of course if you force your enemy back or kill them that's very nice, however I feel most good midlaners won't give you many opportunities to do so, so this option is a very good alternative for Talon in particular.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ActivatingEMP","date":"2017-08-31T17:14:33.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Use it as a zoning tool and punish people for getting close to cs","replies":[]},{"poster":"AmazoX","date":"2017-08-31T15:48:30.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Use it the moment when they are in the middle of an action, For example like when someone uses an ability, Auto attacks ETC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Final Spark Lux","date":"2017-08-31T15:51:53.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Especially mages with no mobility?
