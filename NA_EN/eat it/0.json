Don't call for other people to help report someone, for multiple reasons:\n - because multiple reports don't stack so ganging up on somebody won't actually increase their likelihood of being reviewed and punished.\n - because ganging up on somebody to make them feel persecuted is actually a form of bullying, and is absolutely punishable in Riot's eyes.\n\n2. Don't call attention to the person. Because if they are trolling, this is exactly what they want. Don't feed the troll, you will only make them want to behave even worse. This applies both to calling for reports against them AND talking to them repeatedly in response to their trolling actions.","replies":[{"poster":"eat it","date":"2018-02-17T14:28:21.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Somebody who is doing what this guy did should absolutely feel persecuted.

I hope he does eventually. Nobody wants an inter to get away with it. The issue is how you handled it. Which imo, wasn't that bad. I don't know exactly how the game went so I try not to make grand sweeping judgements, but yeah that singed deserves a permaban if you weren't exaggerating... just hard to trust strangers here cuz they exaggerate all the damn time. Just you should have done your best to adjust to the team you have.
