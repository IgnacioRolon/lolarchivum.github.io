Ive about had it with getting incompetent teammates and getting demoted due to trolls or teammates who arent even at  the right level. Fix your ranked system, the game is turned into complete shit and is totally unfun because the game is probably 30% winnable. You need to make your ranked system about performance, not wins. The fact that people get caught in the endless hell of low elo and are completely unable to climb out of it is totally ridiculous.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-10-29T17:35:46.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello TheLastAlligator!\n\nI think I can help answer your question ^.^  It really depends on what your rank is.  In a recent patch, we made it so that you can no longer decay while in Bronze, Silver, or Gold.  If you are Plat or Diamond, you have 28 days before decay.  Lastly, for Master/Challenger, you only have 10 days.  You can find detailed information about it here:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/26035840-2014-Season-Ranked-Play-FAQ#h5\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Zakt0n","date":"2015-02-16T08:26:05.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How can 8 more wins than losses =  -18 points ???\n\nHow do i ever get out of Bronze5 if i need to win 3 times to make up for every afk loss.\n\nHow in the world is it possible for your teams to win more than lose yet you gain no points(let alone actually have points taken away ,,,seriously negative 18 is that joke?)\nI am just flabbergasted that such a well made game has such a time-wasting, frustrating, non-rewarding point system. \nHow can we ever have a fun 5 player team when obtaining team goals gives no rewards in terms of LP. The toxic, selfish, greedy play that is so common in ranked games is a direct result of this point system that rewards nothing but getting kills. \nHighly disappointed, after spending much time to learn this game and play well, to find out that helping your team win will get you nowhere. That is not competitive gaming. \nNo wonder \"ranked\" play in is so different than the team gaming you see on lolesports.com","replies":[]}]}]}
