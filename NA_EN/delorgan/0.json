When i press the launch button, the image of league disappairs, and that's it. When i look at the task manager, there are no traces of anything that has to do with leauge. I have read that an antivirus software could be the program causing these problems, but i don't even have a software of this kind.\r\n\r\nI have tried running as admin, reinstalling and repairing the client. \r\n\r\nAre there anybody out there that could take a minute and help me fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T02:07:56.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't sound like any antivirus is blocking League, but you might actually be onto something with that assumption. When a program opens and closes quickly like that it's typically caused by your OS missing permissions for that program. Hit up our [**permissions guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) for steps on how you can set those up properly, but definitely, let me know if that doesn't help.","replies":[{"poster":"dudelaxbro","date":"2017-10-02T02:59:35.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having this problem as well, i've seen multiple people with this problem, yet no solutions.
