Thank you Riot, guess I have to make yet another account. And use my RP points from the other 3 to send champs to new one. So ridiculous I have to do this every couple months. I don't curse in chat at all, yes sometimes i may tell someone they are bad, but seriously Riot you worried about me telling someone who goes 1/15 that they are bad when I get a kda of 9/0/8. IDk about the rest of the community but I would rather have the most toxic player on the planet on my team that has a KDA like that who i can just go and click on \"mute\" then someone who feeds, doesn't listen to advice, afk's, trolls, etc etc. Thanks to your garbage system you allow all the trolls and \"baddies\" literally kill all the joy of attempting to rank up. \r\n\r\nBut please Riot explain it to me how you implement a \"mute\" option but still restrict accounts for \"verbal abuse\" but do NOTHING about trolls? You people realize that if someone wasn't int feeding enemy team there would be no reason for the flames right???? Oh well guess i could always try DOTA2 or Heros of the storm, I spend probably $600 a year on LoL maybe they can do more with my money then a company who caters trolls who completely ruin your game.","replies":[{"poster":"OhBoyItsaMegaman","date":"2015-07-06T20:16:59.581+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Oh well guess i could always try DOTA2 or Heros of the storm, I spend probably $600 a year on LoL maybe they can do more with my money then a company who caters trolls who completely ruin your game.\n\nIs \"permanent ban\" a hard concept to understand?

Stop telling bad players that they are bad.  They know, reminding them does nothing but make them report you.  If you would actually try to help them, okay, but that doesn't seem to be what you are doing.  You do well, someone else does poorly, and you think it's perfectly appropriate to say, in whatever terms you do, \"hey you're bad\".  It's not helping.  In my opinion, and Riot's, you got exactly what you deserved.  The problem comes up when they let you make another account, on which you will inevitably drive away new players while leveling up by telling them they are bad compared to you.  Reading some of your comments in this very thread, such as \"road the short bus to school with you\" and \"Slow kids like this\" makes me think Riot should just ban your IP from connecting to the game.
