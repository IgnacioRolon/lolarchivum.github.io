Let's be real here.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"How is it even possible that 5 teambuilders in a row, every single person on my team gets completely shit on. Do I actually have to start looking people up on op.gg to see if they are capable of doing some fucking practice games? I am there to learn new champs but when the team is 5-30 at 16 minutes every single game in a row, I&#039;d like to get the capable people on my team ONCE. Surely it could be quite simple to write a program to modify the teams, maybe even swap laners between the teams when they are matched to even out the skill level of the teams. Let&#039;s stop putting every person who loses their lane every single game on one team. Thanks.","replies":[]}
