I get a leave buster penalty for five games. I'm ranked in Gold, do I lose my reward for this? Or do I just need to finish the punishment out by the end of the season? Can someone tell me if i'm eligible for the rewards if I didn't receive them for toxicity reasons last season, but reformed this season?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-27T03:51:11.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As *SteveTheMiner* mentioned, Leaverbuster will not affect your Ranked Rewards eligibility. Toxicity and behavior bans only affect ranked rewards for the season they happened in. You should be fine for Ranked Rewards, but if you'd  like, we can troubleshoot the issue that caused you to load into late if you can dive into more specifics.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2016-10-25T03:40:51.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should be able to get your rewards even if you get Leaverbusters, just serve them and you should be good.","replies":[]}]}
