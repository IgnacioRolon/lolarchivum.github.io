Hi I am **Mine All Mein** and I have been a {{champion:107}}  main over multiple accounts for the good part of 3 years now and after all the nerfs after all the changes through the good times and the bad times I have played and stuck with this champion through thick and thin because I fell in love with his **hunter like fantasy** and **savage ferocious nature**. But in his current state I feel his identity has become lost to you. Now this may be a rant/debate, but I am trying to take this objectively and in a civil manner as possible. Nor am I trying to single out a single Rioter, because singling out a developer gets nothing done, for this update and all the nerfs he has received  post rework, it unfortunately is a group effort in this nature and I realize this so I will just refer to Riot as a whole for this argument. Lets start with some definitions according to Riot {{champion:107}}  is primarily classified as a **Slayer/ Assassin** and by definition a **Slayer** is &quot;a **fragile** but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to **swiftly take down their targets**.&quot; Then by definition the **Assassin** sub category is  &quot;specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to **quickly dispatch high-priority targets**. Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put them themselves into dangerous positions in order to execute their targets. Luckily, they often have **defensive tricks up their sleeves** that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively avoid incoming damage.&quot;\r\n\r\n Now these definitions are key to finding the holes in where his rework, current itemization, and current play style (according to patch 7.8)  are very off from where he needs to be to be classified as an assassin. Now you might think that {{champion:107}}  is in a healthy state and this might sound bizarre but honestly I cant disagree with you, as far as a champion goes he is pretty balanced not to strong and not to weak, HOWEVER since we are talking about an assassin by nature they need to be strong to be a fear factor for the enemy team. Lets start this debate out with EXHIBIT A) {{champion:107}} &#039;s MOST POPULAR BUILD :\r\n* {{item:1412}} {{item:3071}}  {{item:3047}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3026}} \r\nNow I am no expert at the game by any means, but I can see the value of this build in Pro Scene where there is more coordination and jungler&#039;s need to be tankier to absorb precision damage but this is also in regular Ranked and Normal Queue play where there is inconsistent players, disorganized play, no voice comms for the whole team. Just you and maybe a buddy if this is Ranked  and maybe a group of friends if this is Normals who, lets be honest, are just playing the game to have fun and not taking it to that LCS/LCK or whatever region of pro play level of strategy.\r\n\r\nWell if {{champion:107}}  is classified as an Assassin why is he building Bruiser like items in Normal and Ranked play? Shouldn&#039;t he be building items are high AD items like {{item:3074}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3147}} {{item:3814}} or {{item:3035}} or similar items in games more consistently? \r\n\r\nWell my friend, normally you would be right but this Rework changed some things about him that made {{champion:107}} say NO in a stern voice to the drugs known as AD Assassin Items and HELLZ YEA LETS BLAZE to Bruiser items. \r\n\r\nLet&#039;s go back in time to before the Rework. Ah the good ol&#039; days of popping squishies before they can react for their folly of picking squishies into a Rengar. That TRIPLE Q was really nice, it felt so fluid so satisfying but its gone so no use crying over spilt kitten milk and on to EXHIBIT B) FEROCITY STORING :\r\nThis...THIS MAGNIFICENT BASTARD was what made {{champion:107}}  so versatile, you had a immobile squishy out of position triple Q combo them, you had a annoying hyper mobile carry your team needed locked down hit em with the embowered bola and let the team follow up, you wanted to team fight but also have a little fun? say no more {{item:3089}}  {{champion:107}} wizard cat to the rescue with his handy dandy triple battle Meow. Paired this with the fact that ult gave you ferocity generation after use oh baby {{champion:107}} is the champ that can have an answer to any solution mindful though that as long as he was able to start the snowball he could do work for his team and pick up their slack.\r\n\r\nNow lets look at current {{champion:107}}. Can he do these things still and be just as versatile? Well the short answer yes, the truthful long answer is NO. Now that ferocity storing is a thing of the past mobile carries into {{champion:107}}  can shove that huge F U finger in his face. Want to gank that squishy with a blink? Oh sorry they blinked the second you landed from ult because you only can queue 1 ability mid air Oh but they were slowed but now they are safely in the middle of their team. Oh that squishy with mobility is right next to a tank and half hp you can kill them right? Sorry tank knocked you up the second you landed and both got away but don&#039;t worry that CC removal sure works wonders when you were only able to get one ability off before you got CC&#039;d. Oh it didn&#039;t? Because you got instantly CC&#039;d and only got 2 stacks because of the jump and what a Q, weird right? Alright I think you get the point how  the loss of ferocity stacking actually hurt {{champion:107}}  versatility with ganking.\r\n\r\nNow on to this next point EXHIBIT C) PASSIVE :\r\nBONETOOTH NECKLACE: {{champion:107}}  gains a trophy whenever a champion he damaged in the previous _**second**_ dies. {{champion:107}}  can only gain one trophy per enemy champion, up to 5, with an additional trophy made available through the event The Hunt is On!.\r\nBonetooth Necklace 1 TROPHY: Rengar gains 1 (+ 1% bonus AD) bonus attack damage.\r\nBonetooth Necklace 2 2 TROPHIES: Rengar gains 3 (+ 3% bonus AD) bonus attack damage.\r\nBonetooth Necklace 3 3 TROPHIES: Rengar gains 7 (+ 7% bonus AD) bonus attack damage.\r\nBonetooth Necklace 4 4 TROPHIES: Rengar gains 13 (+ 13% bonus AD) bonus attack damage.\r\nBonetooth Necklace 5 5 TROPHIES: Rengar gains 20 (+ 20% bonus AD) bonus attack damage.\r\nHead of {{champion:121}} : Rengar gains 30 (+ 30% bonus AD) bonus attack damage.\r\n\r\nNow lets examine the failures of this passive shall we. Firstly lets talk about the worst part of this, &quot;gains a trophy whenever a champion he damaged in the previous SECOND dies&quot; now the reason this is bad is because the tools given to him from this rework they made {{champion:107}} want to extend fights rather than just hyper burst someone 1 second for this if played right by the enemy can easily be played around. Oh r{{champion:107}}  is coming to gank me and I&#039;m low die run from him for 1 second when he lands and die to his team mate or tower or whatever. Now guess what if you are one of his last stacks to complete bone tooth necklace you can safely assume he will be back when his ulti cooldown and if the jungler  is smart that is very simple and preditable counter ganks. Since {{champion:107}}  can only see the nearest enemy champion he can easily be baited for those final stacks over and over and OVER again. Then you have an assassin with a similar assist/kill timer who is just as if not more bursty and does it in an AoE format, and I&#039;m talking about none other than {{champion:55}} who has a whopping 3 SECOND assist window to benefit from her passive 3 FREAKING SECONDS. So what makes her so special that she deserves a 3 second window and {{champion:107}} gets a measly 1 second window hmm?\r\n\r\nThen we move on to the next part of his passive the Trophy system. Oh boy Riot this screams to me easily not meant for an assassin. Firstly, off 1 kill what do I literally gain? 1 (+1% bonus AD) that is so laughable its disheartening, reason being giving up first blood to a him is no where near as punishing on giving it up to any of the following champs {{champion:55}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:104}} the list is much bigger however I don&#039;t think I need much more to show how weak it is. But for arguments sake lets say {{champion:107}} got 3 no lets go with 4 unique trophies now his damage is comparable to your average bruiser/ juggernaut {{champion:58}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:122}} but depending on how long it took you to get those stacks the time to effort ratio becomes more and more inconsistent. Then there is that all to important 5th stack that one champ is all you see so you tunnel vision for them. Now let me throw out that air of caution for an ASSASSIN that tunnel visioning is BAD DESIGN especially when that last stack is most likely not their squishy carry its a tank or another bruiser. Now if you recall a Slayer is suppose to &quot;quickly kill priority targets&quot; so why is it that I am forced every game to do try and do the opposite of that. Last I checked an enemies damage dealers 99% of the time take priority to kill when you are playing an assassin so why am I punished so hard for ignoring that rule? NO OTHER assassin in this game but {{champion:107}} is forced to kill every enemy on the opposing team to snowball, nope they just keep killing squishies over and over again and let their ADC clean up tankier targets. Oh that assassin mid solo killed their lane opponent 3 times guess I&#039;m not roaming to that lane that guy will insta gib me if I do. Oh {{champion:107}} top did the same thing whelp time to rotate on him,  he only gained 1 plus (1% bonus AD), and kill him then take his tower.\r\n\r\nThe next problem I see with a passive like this and I have noticed you did this is you toned down his base stats and scaling in order to compensate for this new passive which is not good either. This is because unlike other assassins {{champion:107}}  is fighting on 5 fronts to snowball : his base stats, his scaling, his lane opponent (or jungle counterpart), his trophy system, and itemization/gold income when those other assassin only have to deal with 2 of these because the others are in good standing and that is itemization/gold and their lane opponent (jungle counterpart). Now I think I beat this passive to death but I am sure I have missed some nuances with it so if there is anything I have point it out please this is more of a debate then a 1 sided fight after all. \r\n\r\nOn to EXHIBIT D)  (Q) SAVAGERY :\r\n\r\nNow I like this ability honestly, its wave clear, its poke behind minions (sort of), its kinda bursty, and the scaling on it is pretty nice. However, this would&#039;t be a well built up case if I didn&#039;t go over it. Now I have already beat this horse but this Q SHINES on full passive stacks but is very lack luster without it at least for an assassin. Now, lets take that mystical time machine back to pre rework {{champion:107}}. Can you picture it, that clean Q animation that was an empowered auto attack and TARGETED so you couldn&#039;t miss it? I can it was glorious.  Now I am not saying its hard to land Q but what I am saying is that it having a possibility to miss paired with the fact the piercing animation is also apart of the damage for this, that can also miss, and that cant be re aimed mid cast in certain situations this can become clunky. The fact it&#039;s also a casting animation rather than just a quick empowered auto attack leaves room for error also. Yes it provides counter play but at the expense of the {{champion:107}} player and the champion&#039;s fantasy of being a hardened and trained hunter. Then there is the actual EMPOWERED Q from before lets come all the tools it gave {{champion:107}} : 1) harder hitting Q, 2) attack speed, 3) increased AD for the next few seconds (which made Q hit harder, which made bola hit harder, which made auto attacks hit harder). Now compare this to current EMPOWERED Q : 1)harder hitting Q, 2)movement speed, hmm much less interactive nuances with the rest of his kit then before. Now like I said its a decent change to this new Q but the old one fit so much better for both his fantasy and game play consistency.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT E) (W) Battle Roar :\r\n\r\nLet me start off with this sentence &quot;This is sooooooooooooo counter productive for an assassin.&quot; Here is why the whole grey health thing doesn&#039;t belong or is needed on an Assassin, reason being is because of the current itemization for him right now as seen above. Why build like a normal assassin when this literally screams value for a bruiser. Besides the new QSS ability linked to his empowered cast this just doesn&#039;t work with how an assassin needs to be played instead it says hit me as hard as you can so i can make full use of this ability instead of let me quickly use my abilities to go for a kill because I am an assassin. The old flat heal and resistances gain was so much better for an assassin play style, made you harder to fight and gave a nice little bit of sustain. Now its like a &quot;Please hit me but only burst hit me&quot; sign on the champions back. Honestly not much to say other than these points so lets move on.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT F) (E) Bola Strike :\r\n\r\nThis right here is fine. Could it be better? YEP most assuredly. For example go back to the no cast time mid jump. But that horse, I am sure has been killed 10 times over. So for all intensive purposes this ability is fine for me and I wont argue this point. 1 FREE and EASY point for RIOT GAMES{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}  \r\n\r\nEXHIBIT G) (R) Thrill of the Hunt :\r\n\r\nNow I am sure you have heard it all before but I gotta bring up the elephant in the room. Why, just why did this become what it is from what it was. Lets go pull up the definition of a Slayer again.  &quot;Slayers are fragile but agile damage-focused mostly melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets. They are often highly mobile and specializing in single-target burst damage. What they generally lack in resilience, they more than make up for in their potential to cover large distances and quickly kill priority targets. Epitomizing a high-risk, high-reward playstyle, slayers are natural opportunists, and prefer to strike when their targets are vulnerable, rather than engage them in a direct assault, favoring damage-oriented item builds to capitalize the most on their offensive capabilities.&quot; Now I am sure you are tired of reading this but I gotta quote you on where you stand for what he is classified as versus what you have him. Lets start with the biggest point the indicator. Oh god this is so bad for so many reasons: \r\n1)It instantly goes over the targets head when {{champion:107}} presses R, not when he can leap to them but for just pressing the freaking button. \r\n2) the range of this is huge for this 2000 / 3000 / 4000 that is a HUGEEEEEEEEEEEEEE notification for the enemy that I pressed R. \r\n3)The double movement speed from ulting thanks to old bonetooth necklace being gone means that people can easily run from you into the safety of a turret or their team if you ult just the smallest bit to far from them. \r\n4)I can only see the nearest enemy champion instead of every champion in my range like before so getting baited into a bad fight is super easy now because of this and indicator.\r\n5)the indicator is dynamic so it acts as a compass to where is {{champion:107}}  and not targeted so once team fights start breaking down and the enemy team wants to group your team is looking at being engaged on as a 5 v 4 because you are looking to ult. Couple this with the fact when you ult the enemy team, once that first target sees you pressed R they will go hug a tank and your position will be roughly known because of that darn indicator totally giving up the element of surprise.\r\n\r\nNow lets look at this.  All of these downsides for a {{champion:86}}teed, haha I got jokes (ill walk myself out), Crit on that indicator target just don&#039;t feel fairly compensated I mean sure the ult is long but that&#039;s just that much more time for the enemy team to pinpoint your location and protect their carries. \r\nBut its cool for champs like {{champion:91}} {{champion:28}} and hell even {{champion:56}} to come out of no where and not advertise to only 1 target that I am trying to kill you. But yet you can go full on assassin builds on these champs and insta kill that priority target but no one hard complains about them doing it to the point they are forced to turn into a bruiser so why is {{champion:107}} the one forced to suffer as as assassin?\r\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS IN REVIEW :\r\n\r\nThis is not a 1 sided I hate everything about new {{champion:107}} cause truthfully I still love the champion but I am sad to see the current state he is in and think it needs some fixing. It may sound like I am saying bring back the old knife cat, while that would be nice, even I know old knife cat did have some issues and I wont try and glaze over that. While I am a believer in the synergy of his old kit I just want to say that these flaws pointed out cause him to suffer and not play like a true assassin. Also I personally know that {{champion:107}}  can still 1 shot squishies as an assassin tends to do, going assassin builds in the current patch (7.8) but that requires much earlier snowballing than every other assassin in the game which isn&#039;t as consistent to pull off like others can do by camping a single lane. Regardless I will keep playing the knife cat because I prefer play a 45% winrate champ while having fun than playing any other one while getting bored.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU FOR READING.\r\n\r\nV/R\r\nMine All Mein\r\n(http://pa1.narvii.com/5867/195a0e85f576b99ee56058e629d3e81d98cb7300_hq.gif)","replies":[{"poster":"SheSucksForNimm2","date":"2017-05-03T15:42:46.081+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"You better pray that Riot doesn't take an _objective_ look at Rengar, because that would mean Yoricking until Sion-level rework.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lowanti","date":"2017-05-03T16:19:29.887+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Gonna call it and say that a bunch of salty Rengar haters will downvote and trashtalk your complaints.\nPost makes sense, I preferred to play as adc against old rengar than this one, because if he made mistakes we could kill old rengar, and he only oneshot if he was fed, dont feed = dont worry.","replies":[{"poster":"Mine All Mein","date":"2017-05-04T00:48:24.243+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you learning a matchup is half the battle in league of legends","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"N3mO06","date":"2017-05-03T18:44:58.515+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want just to say that if you have to go in the middle of 5 ppl to do your job:\nFirst I don't want to waste my w to gain stacks\nSecond I want a secure font of damage.

some new mechanics or maybe a tuned out version of old Q (maybe no longer grants attack speed bonus from emp effect but instead make your emp Q deal dmg based on enemy's missing health while also having a low base dmg to avoid instant oneshots).\n\nidk they should Grant old Q some sort of mechanic while maintaining the concept which is an auto amplifier , take talon for exmple his Q is an auto amplifier and a gap closer at the same time which works perfectly with his kit (get in , do your dmg get out wih ult or E if ur close to terrain).\n\n-personally if i were to make rengar VERY unique in the game id update his passive from not only jumping on targets when in bush but also every certain amount of time he can ignore terrain and bypass it by climbing it making him very mobile and agile to chase his target but to avoid no counterplay issues if he uses the terrain then his brush jump mechanic will be disabled for a certain amount of time so you'll have to think before going in and calculate your most effective route in order to catch your target.\n\n-as for Q id leave the concept as it is (stabbing ppl is very satisfying) but make it not able to crit but instead whenever rengar use Q on a certain target then that target will be debuffed for a certain duration which will make his Emp Q deal extra dmg for the duration of the debuff , if the debuff expires before he manages to emp Q then he will only deal the normal base dmg of the emp Q this will be just for balancing issues and make his Q stand out as a solo target ability which goes side by side with his hunting theme.\n\n-his W could be better than just healing dmg taken or breaking out of cc but since he already has an escaping/chasing passive then cleansing your way out of cc is unhealthy with this kit therefore i think his W should be more or less a defensive ability only and not afree getaway card.\n\n-his E remains the same.\n\n-as for his ult , i thought about this for a very long time but why not make his ult unlock his passive for the duration of the ult , that means he can jump over terrain as much as he like but his ult will remain a camouflage ability and also a solo target ability that means you'll need to position yourself carefully and you'll have to know where your target is before taking action , and as always when he leaps hes only allowed to use one ability mid air in order to avoid instant burst but also after breaking out of camouflage he gains an instant  empowered stack right after his first ability chosen that means if u press Q after leap and your Q lands on your target you'll get an instant empowered ability to choose from wether its Q to takedown your target or W if ur scared that you'll get bursted or E to root your target right after.\n\n\n-and for the ferocity mechanic , i personally think that old ferocity mechanic was probably better since you would always be prepared before going in but the only difference is if u use ultimate you lose all your current stacks instantly just to avoid triple Q situations or double roots etc.\n\n\nthis is just my idea of how rengar should be since this new passive will allow him to be truly mobile because he can jump from everywhere and not just bushes i mean hes a frickin lion , lions can climb trees rocks mountains everything why cant rengar do that ?\n\n\nAnd for his bonetoothnecklace i also believe that old bonetooth was generally better because it offered him more bonuses to hunt his prey instead of raw bonus ad with a litte bit of tuning (this is just my perfect version of rengar , i honestly think if they gave him the jumping mechanic from talon's E into his passive while also having the animation of a climbing cat [take it as if it was new warwick running animation but instead rengar used that animation to climb terrain] it wouldve been way cooler and matched his lore and theme as a hunter) but thats just me

You want the unreasonably lethal unavoidable opener: These are the parts of the kit that made everything click and made the character live up to it's power fantasy. The bulk of your post is basically a very long retelling of how satisfying these parts of the kit were, and how awful and clunky it feels to not have them on this character. \n\nI think you understand how frustrating it was to play against repeated reliable insta-gibbing, and also how frustrating it is to play hug-your-support-24-7. But you rationalize it: every pick causes some kind of neccessary changes in the play style of the other team and it's reasonable to expect adaptation, and all in all rengar is supposed to kill shit. \n\nI feel you do owe the other side of the discussion some concessions, though. While it is reasonable to expect adaptation of play style, if that adaptation is in a generally less fun direction than i don't think it's reasonable to say it's ok if it happens all the time. For me at least, I hated having to lulu it up and hug the ADC 24/7 because some guy on the other team is having fun with Rengar. \n\nIn addition to this, most of the characters people WANT to play are squishies. People are innately drawn to the eves, the yasuos, the rivens. You aim to punish the other players away from their favorite picks, simply by the virtue of you liking mr. knife cat. i don't understand how this is reasonable. \n\nI agree with you that current rengar is not in an optimal place. what should play as a surgical lion jumping his pray from ambush plays now like a maddned boar on a rampage. I feel this challange requires a complete redesign, because the triple-q-from-stealth is both rengar's (desired) thing that makes him an assassin, and also the thing he can't really have.","replies":[{"poster":"Mine All Mein","date":"2017-05-04T12:19:31.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I thank you for this counter argument so so much it is always welcome here. Unfortunately I being a Rengar main obviously have my bias on the subject. However my aim for this post is to become as unbiased as possible. Am I asking for a return to the old rengar? No and let this be clear old rengar was problematic. However what my true aim is to have him change for the better in a way where his kit flows and matches his themeatic. I see your points about my stance on the old kit. I just want you to know I in no way shape or form was using it in the intention as a crying plea to return to that it was only used as a base point because obviously for playing from rengar's perspective the kit prior to the bola cast time change mid air was the kit that had the best flow, not the best counterplay, but the best FLUIDITY. And that is what I honestly care about. So my stance is not damage and the whole insta gib, but THEME, FUN GAMEPLAY, and KIT FLOW. And damage is obviously a factor when choosing an assassin but not my stance for this arguement. In memory the rework that met all conditions THEME, FUN GAMEPLAY, and KIT FLOW was Warwicks rework and I thoroughly enjoy it as a side pick to Rengar even if warwicks builds are kinda cookie cutter. Hopefully this replied to all your points made and if I missed things, as I am human, please I am more than happy to talk to you.\n\nEdit: also going over why an assassin is going a bruiser build almost every game. When in recent memory riot is shown to stat adjust assassins seen to do this in order to have their assassin builds become more viable but still leaving the bruiser build as a fall back at the cost of damage trade off which I feel is lacking with him as his current form as stated above him having this go to bruiser build.","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2017-05-04T13:26:58.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> change mid air was the kit that had the best flow\n\nFlow is just a buzz word for getting your spell off when you want it without the character having to play animations or deal with internal timers. With Rengar, the \"when you want them\" was invariably \"all spells immediately upon destealthing\". I am not a rengar player but I feel that there is no other moment in Rengar's gameplay where efficient spell transition plays a major part. \n\nI.E. \"fluidity of gameplay\" is another aspect of playing (OLD) rengar that is exclusively enabled and realized through the ability to stealth-instagib.  \n\nI apologize for being somewhat insensitive here: but having read your longer post above, it is clear to me that when you say \"theme\" this means \"stealth instagib\". and when you say \"fun gameplay\" it means \"stealth instagib\" and when you say \"kit flow\" you mean \"stealth instagib\". All the fun things you've mentioned, all the pluses to playing Rengar, they all either enable stealth instagib, or are directly resulting from the ability to stealth instagib. \n\nThe element that made rengar the least fun assassin to play against was his incredible \"reach\", combined with his short TTK. From the perspective of a support player, my personal gripe is that there are a lot of things in the game that i can do. I can threaten, initiate, chase, ward, etc. Against other assassins some measure of safety is received through warding and staying back, and this frees me to actually play as opposed to be leashed to the ADC and guard-dog. But rengar required tight point defense, which pinned me to the ADC. \n\nSo, actually there's a point here, do the right play VS the right character. But if the right play is consistently not fun maybe next time i don't queue as support? I'll just get some other role and badger the other guy to go lulu and stick on the ADC. \n \nfrom my point of view, the obvious solution is to dump the ult and reach some kind of idea on how to realize the thematic goals without the stealth instagib?","replies":[{"poster":"Mine All Mein","date":"2017-05-04T15:20:50.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your reply and I respect your opinion on the subject I will be sure to get back to you and give this awesome counter argument a equally awesome reply.

Hmm, let me try and use an out of game example of something I find was in a simillar spot to Rengar, not matching him on a point for point bases, but needed tuning. If anyone here has ever played SMITE and remembers release Bellona, she was broke AF no matter what you did she had an answer for every thing and had the kill pressure to back it up. A auto attack was becoming a problem blind his ass, needed to duel someone here take this pantheon aegis passive form, needed to burst someone hammer form for days baby, needed an escape/engage plant that flag on the heads of your enemies. She could do it ALL, but after some tuning she was in a fine place, if she wanted that hammer form burst build she was forced to sacrifice being tanky and become a glass cannon, if she wanted all those utilities she needed to sacrifice damage. But regardless her kit was still solid no matter which way you wanted to build her and everything felt right on her and had smooth transition between spells. Now SMITE is most definitely not League. But what I am saying is kit synergy is important on champion design. I am not arguing in favor of the old Rengar to return honestly the opposite, however what I want is a synergistic kit for him one that flows on all elements. I am not saying damage numbers nor have I mentioned me begging for another one shot Rengar. What I want with Rengar is for me hard to get out into words, yes i love and want his assassin fantasy, obviously I am a Rengar main so that bias exist, but above that I want the build versatility that was in previous iterations of previous rengar's which at the moment is lost with bruiser build. I want a change to the Q, NOT SAYING BRING BACK TRIPLE Q, however i did like the single target aspect of it. Cause lets be real the AoE Q is very forgiving in a team fight and allows you to nuke multiple squishies if they stand right next to each other in 1 spell cast and lessens the precision needed to play him.\n\nAs I want to answer your points lets start with the theme counter argument :\n* Bushes are what I like about Rengar over the one shot, the bush outplays are so fun for me personally. Just like {{champion:72}}  spire if you see bushes you should be cautious and fearful. I like the mind games it brings of \"oh shit this Rengar knows how to effectively use bushes im so scared of bushes now. Just like the just released maokai buff to sapling in bushes or with ap schao boxes in bushes every bush should be fearful to go near as that is now his territory of power. Open lanes where there is no bush near you, he should feel weak and way less powerful.\n\nI guess my Fluidity of Gameplay counter argurment could be I want Rengar to have this fluidity when he is in his element as stated above, the bushes maybe i can see the speed at which abilities come out is effected by him jumping out of a bush. Maybe its slow and clunky by itself but use a bush and the speed and fluidity of the abilites start to synergize. This is just a potential that I have gone over it sounds good to me but maybe not so good to everyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2017-05-05T09:41:46.206+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMHO the core design issue that makes all the bad aspects of rengar necessary is that he is all-in with jumping in through ulting. \n\nIn that I mean that his follow up mobility is very weak. His ability to execute additional jumps is very restricted given that opponents can and will make the fight outside of bushes and generally a 1.5 second MS boost isn't the best mobility tool out there. \n\nOk so khazix can make do with that, butKhazix gets multiple instances of MS boost on demand, and also gets a short instance of stealth and collision avoidance on top that helps him at least avoid skillshots while he's running. \n\nIn the absence of real outplay mechanics, Rengar relies on tanking up through battle meow and Dariusing his way through the situation. Which gives your the \"wild boar on rampage\" experience. Not sure what exactly you mean by kit flow, but im pretty sure you don't mean this. \n\n---\n\nRengar's mechanic with the bushes makes him a very polarized champion. near bushes he has a lot of outplay potential with a good number of tricks to play but out in the open he's like a Darius that gets dropped on top of you: If you can peel off the initial, what's he got left? \n\nIf Rengar is weak outside of the jungle, this means you have to constantly think about how to make the other team fight you in the jungle. I am not sure this can be done reliably enough and if you are punished because you have to fight off a counter-push straight down mid lane because you are trying to control dragon, it is possible that the reliability of the champion is taking too big of a hit here. \n\nIn addition there is the same problem that khazix is generating through isolation damage. if you're guaranteed superiority over the other jungler than that makes Rengar oppressive same way khazix is/was ??? (not sure, havn't kept up with events).\n\n---\n\nIMHO the solution to both issues is to find some way to give rengar more mobility, and specifically more reliable mobility. If this happens there is no more need for the rengar insta-gib or the tanking solution, and also regar can be less polarized between jungle and no jungle and become a more reliable champion.\n\nhere is my proposition for a solution:\n\nR: thrill of the hunt. \n* thrill of the hunt begins it's cooldown when it is cast.\n\nActive: Target a large area of the map. for 15 seconds, The area is filled with bushes of random size and direction. The bushes are not connected, including to any existing bushes. Rengar's bushes grant vision inside and around them for the duration.  Large and epic monsters are not hidden by these bushes.\n\nActive: While thrill of the hunt is on cool-down, rengar may activate the ability to dash (600 range) into a nearby bush (12 second CD). \n\nNotice that this replaces the stealth with something that can be similarly used as stealth, through exploiting bush mechanics. The basic idea is to allow rengar to exploit his passive into an engagement in the middle of an open lane, and to extend rengar's mobility to give him outplay and dodging potential.","replies":[{"poster":"Mine All Mein","date":"2017-05-05T12:51:27.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do find that an interesting prospect, as at least for me when I play {{champion:107}}  i tend to not rely on my ult as much as i rely on my bush mechanics so that ult sounds very fun and interesting to me.

However a situation where these bushes do not participate in the vision game at all (they dont count as obstructions) is also possible.\n\nRengar having vision in the area is a must because otherwise he'll have to face-check into his own ult which sucks. \n\nHis team should share the vision because otherwise there is a huge difference between \"competitive rengar\" (where the rengar feeds his team info through voice comm) and \"soloQ rengar\"\n\nI really like the concept of just blocking out the vision for the enemy team and putting them in \"panic mode\" through just killing their sight lines. I am not certain how close this is to Rengar's thematic but the denial of vision does allow him to play out the \"jungle predator jumping out of the bush\" theme, IMHO. \n\nAlso breaking vision through abusing brush mechanics very much sound like something that will be good on rengar.\n\nThe core of the idea is to allow rengar to outplay opponents by sneaking into a brush and breaking the sight line, and then abusing his passive to jump back onto his target.\n\nOnce you press your ult button, you have a second dash available for you that accomplishes that, and the ult makes sure that there is a brush nearby that enables you to use the second dash. \n\nSo the kill combo is actually, to get into a brush nearby to your target and passive jump to them and do your first rotation, and then jump out into a close bush and wait for your cool downs and/or dislodge any exhaust / pacify etc that you got tagged with. once you have your spells back up there is a bush near your target and you jump on the target again. \n\n","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kurogami","date":"2017-05-04T18:49:23.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm aware that the conversation was between you two, but I hope you don't mind my own input on the matter, especially seeing as you're one of the few people that actually give legitimate criticism, as opposed to crying \"waah waah he one-shot me\"...

I picked up the knife-cat midway through s5-6 ish, can't quite remember, and while the \"flow\" of the champion is somewhat difficult to explain to someone who (I'm assuming here, feel free to correct me) has played little to no Rengar.

This has been argued so many times, and to some extent, I do agree. But that wasn't the only \"flow\" to his kit ruined with the rework. Previously, one of the most-used combos (at least top-lane), was: Jump> AA reset with Q, cast tiamat mid-Q animation. This created a kind of \"double-q animation\", since the tiamat active used the Q animation. Combo #2 was- Bola>Leap> AA Q reset> Tiamat. Same concept, but with another skill thrown in. The old W could also be cast mid-q. His kit was somewhat simple, but had more complexity to it than you'd think from first glance. That's more or less the issue we all have with the current rengo. ALL of those animation cancels/combos have been, \nmore or less, taken out entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2017-05-04T22:27:04.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rengar had a fair amount of hidden complexity to his kit.

Talon, Katarina, Fizz, K6 (just to name a few) and a good number of other assassins right now still 100-0 close to how fast pre-reword rengar did. Katarina in particular is a pain in the ass due to her near infinite blinks and stupid amounts of AoE damage. The Gunblade + Lich LB is stupid right now (and she has dumb mobility, too)... And the list goes on. Rengars strength was that he did it from total stealth- something that's now been more or less balanced out with the camo change. So if your only argument is that he instagibs the ADC if he's not being babysat... I'd have to say your argument is somewhat flimsy. I will admit, though, the fact that when breaking stealth, the fact that the damage dealt was pretty much unavoidable was BS.\nBut that's all from a balance perspective. \nWhile I can't speak for the OP, what enraged me the most about this rework is that Riot neglected the most crucial aspect of any rework- preserving the champion's identity. He went from an AA Reliant assassin to a weird AD bruiser/caster hybrid. Simply put, it's just not rengar anymore. I would have given up more than half of old rengars damage if it meant keeping his fluidity and identity, rather than being given this unbalanceable, unrecognizable champion.\n\nEDIT: Regarding the triple Q, as far as I know, it's not been possible for a fair amount of time now.

It was an item to buy for 800 gold that was pretty much another stack item.\n\nBut then, the second rework came around and then they gave sooooo much free shit on his bonetooth. Like, I know this is part of his theme but come on, with the jump in the bushs and with the ferocity mechanic, it's too much for a passif (I know ferocity doesn't count as his passif but it's at best 2 passif and we all know how much we hate double passif champions {{champion:157}}).\n\nNow with the assasin rework, it got changed and I really hate this new Rengar too. They made him harder to kill in exchange to delay our dead by like 1 extra second. So I'm on your side for that part.\n\nHis ult, on the other hand, is where I'm disagree.\n\nI know as a support main, I have less experience when it comes to Rengar. However, I believe his ult is the source that ruin Rengar, for both his fanbase and his opponents. Riot never had the bright idea to I don't know... change his ultimate. His ult only had some minior changes like the indicator and now the vision and... free crit?\n\nThis is like {{champion:13}}'s w all over again, they change everything except the source of the problem.\n\nSee allow me to quote you: \n\n> But its cool for champs like {{champion:91}} {{champion:28}} and hell even {{champion:56}} to come out of no where and not advertise to only 1 target that I am trying to kill you. But yet you can go full on assassin builds on these champs and insta kill that priority target but no one hard complains about them doing it to the point they are forced to turn into a bruiser so why is {{champion:107}} the one forced to suffer as as assassin?\n\nBecause there's a massif difference between all of them and Rengar.\n\n{{champion:56}} is a **diver** that does delay dmg, he doesn't burst at all so he is forced to be a bruiser, his ult doesn't hurt that much.\n\n{{champion:91}} only has 3 damaging abilities and he needs to use one as a gapcloser if he wants to kill someone quickly before they escape.\n\nI am not a fan of {{champion:28}}'s passif either, however she is very frail and very predictable once she reveals herself.\n\nThe problem with Rengar is that he's **a ball of stats that can gap close to his enemies super easily.** He's basically a  strange mix of a hypercarry and an assasin.\n\nI know what I'll say will seem farfetched but  bear with me for a second: imagine that {{champion:75}} would receive a rework when he would lose his tankiness but in exchange, he would get a quick access to the enemy backline while also keeping his stacks mechanic.\n\nThat would be broken right? Well that's {{champion:107}} in a nutshell for ya.\n\nYes he doesn't have a stack mechanic, but his bonetooth necklace **is the reason** why he's a ball of stats. The assasin rework just made the ball harder to kill while also slighly nerfing the ball itself.

However, the triple Q from stealth can not return and i feel the great effort invested in preserving rengar's 'jump from stealth' is the first major roadblock to making him a different but interesting champion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mine All Mein","date":"2017-05-04T14:56:02.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello thank you for commenting and it is highly appreciated, I will be sure to get a proper response back to you when I get to a computer I am on my phone ATM and I don't want auto correct and phone misclicking to mess up giving a very valid argument a reply.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-05-04T09:59:05.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While its understandable Rengar mains are upset, but he needed the rework. He just didn't get a good one. Before it was completely unfun and oppressive to be 100-0 instabursted from stealth. Now he's just shit after being made a bruiser and got nerfed repeatedly for still 100-0ing squishies and being tanky.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cyrusklep","date":"2017-05-04T04:09:31.327+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an adc main I did hate old Rengar buttblasting me but new Rengar doesn't feel that great.

This way I could know someone at Riot is at least aware of the fact that there are players who are no longer enjoying {{champion:107}} , and thus League of Legends as a whole.\n\nI feel that {{champion:107}}  was very feast or famine - but that was okay. This only seemed to become an issue when enough people complained about how \"{{champion:107}}  is too easy! He's killing me by pressing buttons!\" \n\nThe problem with {{champion:107}}  was that he could preemptively stack his ferocity. This led to combo's which allowed a lot of damage to come in a short amount of time. So how do you fix that? By changing the ferocity system, which of course they did. \n\nBut did the other part of his passive need to change? He obtained unique tools as he became stronger. Hell, keep the \"kill unique champions for next rank\" portion, and bring back his unique tools. Current rewards are boring and uninteresting.\n\nDid Q need to change? To me, {{champion:107}} 's Q was the must fun part of his kit. If you're that concerned with players pressing Q before jumping onto his prey, create some restriction such as \"can only be used if in combat\", such as his new ferocity system.\n\nI'm indifferent on the W change.\n\nI'm indifferent on E, as it wasn't changed during the rework.\n\nAs for his new ult, though I don't like it as much as I like his old one, I don't find it so much different that I no longer enjoy playing {{champion:107}} .\n\nThere's my opinion on it all... Q change made {{champion:107}}  (and League of Legends) not fun to play.\n\nMake {{champion:107}}  an assassin again.\n\nThanks for reading, and thanks for this post OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2017-05-04T01:39:25.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didn't read it _yet_.... but here's your upvote...\nif you spent that long to write it... you did your research...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silverjust","date":"2017-05-03T16:48:27.595+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think the reworked version is better than the old one **on paper**\nBut he gets too much damage and can build tanky and still do his job","replies":[]},{"poster":"Astoreth","date":"2017-05-04T02:43:46.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read most of it, I'm, proud of myself. Book for this week, checked.\n\nJokes aside, I would love one of the following for Thrill of the Hunt:\n\n* Keep the indicator and crit, but at certain distance you get vision of champions nearby. (i.e. They are all in mid river brush and you come to maybe twice jump range or a bit less and you can see the garen, thresh and sejuani hiding behind ashe)\n* Select a target to be hunted, who will get the eyes on top of their head and you will have true sight of them. You don't get vision of her team unless you can actually see them, but they will be vulnerable to your additional damage for being hunted.\n* Last one I'd like reduce stealth times, switch back from camo to invis, give us a bigger move burst (sort of like Talon) Current position indicator without the bonus damage on nearest target but vision of all enemies withing your ult range.\n\nEDIT:\nDisclaimer, I suck so this ideas probably suck too are probably not what he needs on his R, but for me they seem like something that could make it feel more llike a hunter again.","replies":[]}]}
