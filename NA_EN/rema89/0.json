That said, around the same time we saw these reports we also noticed Windows released it's latest update. If you're on Win10 make sure that the update didn't re enable Game DVR since that can often make LoL's fps drop considerably. Let me know if either of these steps helps out or not at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Egonics","date":"2017-11-16T13:19:52.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have only played two games in recent months, and both today, I did suffer a bit where my FPS would drop randomly, without anything intense happening in game, nor did my system resources spike, it does point a little bit to LoL being the problem. I did make my own ticket to technical support, just wanted to mention that the knowledge base list have not helped me, although I have not tried the repair game files option yet, or lower game quality options since there is no hardware bottleneck on my end.\n\nI am on Windows 10, and fully updated.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Just a weeb xoxo","date":"2017-11-15T07:15:48.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Same.\nWelcome to the Patch 7.22 :)\nI'm playing Overwatch on highest settings with constant 100 fps.\nBut League it is laggy af.\nAll drivers updated, it is the worst patch i've played on. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}]}
