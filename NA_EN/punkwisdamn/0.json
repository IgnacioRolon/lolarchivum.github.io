You may need to delete your config files.  This may require you to re-do all your in-game settings, but should allow them to save and update properly. Go ahead and try this:\n\n* Log into League of Legends\n           *  Important! If you delete these files before logging on the server will just give you a copy of your last know config\n* Navigate to your Config folder (Default is C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config)\n* Delete Game.cfg and PersistedSettings.json\n* Load into a Custom game and update settings appropriately\n\nLet me know if this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Punkwisdamn","date":"2016-05-10T00:35:10.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It worked marvelously, Thanks! {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}]}
