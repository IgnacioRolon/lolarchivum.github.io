And its quite different as I'm no longer fighting a 1v1 in mid or top.\n\nI used to like playing against: Riven, Yasuo, Irelia, Nasus, Gnar, Teemo, Jayce. But this was back before Fiora got reworked. After Fiora got reworked, I stopped having fun playing against other champions, just having fun playing my champion (which used to be Akali and Diana after that).\nEven to this date, i hate the Fiora rework.\n\nOh, I also liked to play vs Zed or Yasuo on mid back when Lulu mid was viable.\nBut ever since Fiora got reworked, I never have fun 'fighting' against some enemy champions.\nI'm just not having fun fighting against certain champions such as:\n{{champion:45}} - fucking aoe cage, disgusting\n{{champion:41}} - like veigar, but with slow instead of stun.\nIts just that their AoE zone of control is INSANELY BIG.\n\nAnd ofc, {{champion:67}} {{champion:223}} and {{champion:18}} .\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI got no problem against the likes of: {{champion:17}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:142}} etc\nI do ban Zoey quite often simply because she can one shot my adc/mid/top and that can shit the entire team fight from a looooong range. She just have a number issues with having to much damage or to low cooldowns.\n\nHowever, for me the most disgusting champions are Veigar, Gankblank, Vayne, Tahm and Tristana.\nWhich is probably a very unpopular opinion.\n\nMeh, at least Janna has counterplay. Even if she protects her carries, she's squishy as fuck. Tahm is tanky as fuck and protects the carry....\nVayne and Tristana just got to much self peal for a \"hyper carry adc\".\n\nAt least Kog stays in one fucking place. And without his team protecting him, he will fucking die. So, I can just switch my focus to 1shotting his janna/soraka/nami/lulu and then him. But if there's a Tahm..... fuck that. Vayne and Tristana doesn't even need peal from their team, if the player is good, they are pealing everything themselves...\nTwich jungle is also disgusting. But only twich jungle, its very disgusting as a laner, because there's literally nothing you can do against it... he gets invisibility while you are lv1 and can just auto attack you with red buff to either kill you or force you to flash before even 2 minutes... Twich ADC is fine because he doesn't shit on your early game......... the idea of an 'late game adc' bringing pain in the early game (from minute 2 for fucks sake) its disgusting........ not even shako does that.","replies":[{"poster":"Charm With parm","date":"2018-02-02T20:42:50.316+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, pre-rework fiora was busted, she needed the rework. she had literally zero counter play.

Her Q was a point-and-click gap closer with the same range as an ADC auto and it had double cast, so you couldn't even get away if you flashed the first dash. Not to mention her E gave her bonus MS so that she could stick to you regardless of you have higher base MS than her.\n\nAnd her ult on a single-target did dealt over 1000 damage at max rank to a single target, excluding on-hit effects (Hydra, Botrk). You literally had to goon-squad her like Nasus just to stop her from 1 v 1ing almost everyone in the game, and even then, the Hydra splash damage and the horrendously high base damage meant that she would often kill at least 1 person before dying, likely two since she almost always won lane against everyone.\n\nThe fact that her %max hp damage is position dependent and needs to be procced by auto attacks means she has to actually move around in lane and teamfight properly to proc it, or time her ult use to effectively burst a target. Not to mention her current parry has an objectively lower invulnerability window than her ultimate and old W to work with, and only returns CC in the direction she casts it, so she actually needs to worry about positioning more than before. Armor tanks in particular absolutely eviscerate Fiora in lane, and even regular tanks that can time their CC chain and dodge W can trade effectively against her.\n\nThe mere fact that Fiora can miss and mess up now is already a huge improvement over pre-rework.

Her passive is unfun to play against (your weak point positions are choosen randomly, so they basically feel like if you had a number between 0 and 1 constantly in your head that indicated how much extra damage you'd take if engaged on right now). Her Q denies her passive either way, because hitting weak points with it is really easy if they are not literally on the opposite side. Her W is really infuriating because it can a) dodge CC that you already landed on her but have a delayed effect and b) has a shit ton of interactions that are not clear or intuitive at all.

You know you are being hunted, and you can either get to a safe position, or prepare a counter attack.\n\nSion is kinda like this. He’s a cc monster, but to get as much cc as possible, he needs to charge it. He also pretty predictable, so if you are getting destroyed by him, it’s partly your fault. And no matter what lane you are in, if you hear that ult sound, everyone is terrified. However, late game with a metric butt ton of health on top of health items and resistances is an annoyance, but he doesn’t do much damage. He is a tank period. A big, bulky, lumbering giant that soaks up as much damage as possible, and sets up plays for his teammates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2018-02-02T20:27:14.001+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's fun to play vs Thresh because you can always predict and dodge an average thresh's hooks.

However the thing that's most unfun about Yas and Vayne are their cock block mechanics. They do a lot of damage, but they also have their anti-fun mechanics. Yasuo can make half of the champ roster useless for around 5 seconds by pressing a single button. Even if someone gets the jump on Vayne, she can just press E to knock them away or stun them, then just delete them.","replies":[{"poster":"xGunna1","date":"2018-02-06T13:47:10.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"even ornn before he got the buff was considered trash because they didn't \"buff his dmg\" not  because he was super tanky \n\ni can be super tanky with garen but 0 dmg \n\nbut ornn gets free dmg from his tanky items which made him op \n\nthe damage is so essential in this game","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Psilocybinium","date":"2018-02-03T02:15:28.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a love playing vs {{champion:238}}  as {{champion:99}} {{champion:7}}","replies":[{"poster":"sutora3","date":"2018-02-03T08:24:23.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you are a masochist?","replies":[]}]}]}
