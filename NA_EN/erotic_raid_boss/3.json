It seems like Garen will be one, but how long before you look at champions like Azir, Kalista, Shen and others this in depth rather than just love tapping them? \n\nAnd who else are you looking to get to? Most importantly, are you guys going to have any sort of formalized team going after these minor updates going forward? \n\nIt&#039;s fine if  you don&#039;t have all the answers, just in general it would be nice to have more information on this","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-11-19T01:27:20.374+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's likely we'll do more work along these lines, though scope of that work's going to vary quite a bit from champion to champion.

I have been a Shyvana/Anivia main since I started playing league back in Season 3 and it was a great feeling to see both of them getting some changes in the same patch. Though Anivia's was more of a power shift, taking some reliable damage from her E (So her R>E isn't as annoying to enemies) and putting more power into her Ultimate which I'm all for and can't wait to try her out.\n\nAs for the changes of Shyvana, I like every change but for the passive a bit. It just feels like she doesn't have a passive. Getting 10% damage against dragon on a champion that generally had no problem solo'ing dragons in the first place and a little amount of Armor. I get the idea of the change for lore and to help her persuade her to take those early dragons, but I feel that also kind of forces her into the Jungle even more. \n\nI'd be alright with the passive if the Armor still doubled in dragon form, that way if you are behind and have no dragons, you could at least get 10 Armor instead of 5 and if you wanted to reach the Live server's armor of 20/40, you would only need to kill 3 dragons instead of taking 7 to break even on resistances on Live server. Also I hope if you do any more changes to her, if you could balance her with Top lane in mind as well and not just jungle..As some one who plays her exclusively top lane for the past 4 years, her current state in the top lane in this meta...is not the best.\n\nOther then that, I love the changes and can't wait to give her a try. I know some of my other old favorites are also planned for changes or a rework soon, and can't wait to see their changes {{champion:266}} {{champion:3}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-11-19T01:56:49.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Meddler anything for Jax?
