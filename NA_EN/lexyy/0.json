I have 20 fps and that's the only thing that's changed on my laptop.\r\n\r\nI dont have good laptop, my graphic card is fine, but processor is low (pentium).... \r\nI also have a lot of free space on (730 gb on disc C). It's not the greatest laptop but it was able to give me 100 fps before all of this....\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy is this happening? Is it because of the sims? Can i fix it somehow without deinstalling the sims? Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-19T17:50:15.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An install of another game should not impact you like this, but I know the uncertainty can be a pain.
