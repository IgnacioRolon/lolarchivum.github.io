Can anything be done about this without having to clear the leaver buster?

However, keep in mind that we never punish for leaving a single game.

Because it is so high, even leaving a single game will trigger penalties.  The best advice I can give is to simply play out the Lower Priority Queue games.  After playing enough games without leaving, your Leaver Level will eventually decrease and you won't get automatically punished.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!","replies":[{"poster":"CatKitty3","date":"2016-07-10T13:13:17.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dArtagnan,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=pLhhBNXR,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-06-07T00:11:43.563+0000)\n>\n> Getting punished for something out of your control can definitely feel pretty awful.
