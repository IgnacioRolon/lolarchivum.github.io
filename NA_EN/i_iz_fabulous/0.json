I've played A LOT over the past week and I've only gotten one key fragment while everyone else has been getting insane amounts. Some of my friends are getting stacks of 4 and 2 every few days, and I've only gotten 1 since the honor system came out.\nThey also play way less than me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"i iz fabulous","date":"2017-07-06T11:48:11.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok so i have found out the issue, you are right keyfragments have dropped infact a decent amount about 5 but the game has never notified  me about these drops ever so thats what caused my confusion, thanks for the reponse hopefully it will start actually letting me know when keys drop next time","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tronald Dumb","date":"2017-11-15T09:28:49.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:11}}  + {{item:3211}}  = {{champion:24}}","replies":[]}]}
