You should go to lane and play the game normally until the remake becomes available.  What if your teammate returned, for instance?  There is no benefit to waiting in base until the remake becomes available.\n\nHere's a few more details on how the system works if you're interested: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/play-games-matter/remake","replies":[]},{"poster":"hh the thinker","date":"2016-06-22T06:33:46.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds like a bug since you shouldn't have lost any points from remake, unless you were the one who didn't connect to the game. basically you didn't misunderstood how it should work.","replies":[]}]}
