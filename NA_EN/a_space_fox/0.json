(Bugsplatrc Resource Dll Missing, Windows 10, Game Not Opening on launch.)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, I haven't been playing this game for about a year or so now, and I wanted to come back recently. So I go to download the game again, and run the installer, no problems. Then I start up the exe as an administrator, and I get the familiar 'LoL Logo' in the middle of my screen, and a little progress bar underneath while it loads, then it suddenly disappears. I check my task manager for what happened and it is running the LoL Patcher (32 bit) and it's in the background processes. About 10 or 15 minutes go by and I get an error saying, \"Missing BugSplatrc Resource dll\" Nothing else happens, I can't even see the client updating or anything. I've searched around and come up with nothing really as an answer for this. I found some old threads on here and reddit saying to delete some files in the \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\etc. But the thing is, I dont even have the air client in the  projects folder, and like I said, I can't even see the launcher or updater or anything appear after the 5 seconds of the logo appearing. It's kinda frustrating, so if anyone can help/suggest things for me to try, I'd appreciate it.\n\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention on Windows 10 and I'm also 64 bit. So maybe that's why, but I didnt see any 64 bit download.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-15T23:00:22.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there are drivers that your OS is missing so it can't load content properly.  As a first step, make sure that you have Windows updated to make sure you have necessary assets.  I suggest going over each step in our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) to get this fixed by making sure drivers and game files are setup accordingly.  I also do not recommend deleting any files as it can end up causing you more issues than solve them.  Hopefully, this gets you fixed up!","replies":[]}]}
