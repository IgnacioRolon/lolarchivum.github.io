After a 14d ban, you are requested to be irreproachable. You were toxic again, hence the permaban. If it would have been your very very first offense, you may have only had chat restrictions.\n\nRules are simple and have been the same for almost 5 years. Getting permabanned on lvl22 account makes me believe you had a permaban on a previous account. If you dont make an effort to read/respect simple rules, bear the consequences. You are not permabanned because of this last single incident, you are permabanned because you kept breaking the rules.\n\n\"But officer, I saw people driving  way faster than me, how come Im punished and not them?\" ----> useless defense because you are responsible for your own actions and you dont truly know what happens to other accounts.\n\nEDIT: every time I see \"reformed\" \"V2\" or summoner name ending with a number, thats usually the sign of a smurf:\nhttps://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=yankydoodledied\nI guess you got permabanned on a lvl 43 on the 22/01 and a created an account right after. \nYou show zero sign of reforming permaban after permaban, you belong to this even smaller group of people who must uninstall the game as soon as possible. Its unhealthy for you and unhealthy for the Community.","replies":[{"poster":"Nekoworkshop","date":"2020-02-27T14:48:55.996+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> im tryna CS \n\nThe most depressing thing is OP can't even consistently farm 4 cs per minute on Caitlyn, yet he has the audience to flame his support the entire game.

You gotta stop  trying to get attention in games man. Your teammates arent your audience and no one actually cares about your opinions, so stop spamming and telling everyone every damn thought you have in your head. Just keep it in your head unless its a shotcall. Anything beyond that, no one cares. It was only a permaban because youve worked your way up to one. Had you not been punished multiple times before, this would just be a chat restrict probably.

The 14 day should show a wake up call and you should know you're on your final strike. Just mute chat if you get chat banned and never look back, then you'll get the honor back and never have an issue again because you can't say anything to anyone. Its fantastic.\n\nYou can get an instant 14 day or perm though for super bad stuff like lots of racism and IRL death threats, but it doesnt sound like that here. Just mute chat when you first get warned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThyDelutionist","date":"2020-02-27T12:15:02.984+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I wish the number of permas gets quadrupled in 2020....
