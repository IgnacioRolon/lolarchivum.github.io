I check my email to see i had three emails from riot with account info/ links to change it. They had access to my email, and attached are the three emails i received as well as an email from Yahoo about a suspicious sign in attempt. Clearly my account was compromised. I've submitted two tickets now but the links to update info for them don't work. The account has my credit card info on it and i'm very upset that this has happened, I would love to resolve this as soon as possible. Luckily I have majority of my friends added on this account and on other apps such a skype I've let them all know of this situation. \nHere are the two numbers for the tickets #23491968 and #23482552\nDespite this accounts name I'm not an incredibly toxic player, don't hate me please.\nThe emails from support have a link to add new info and view the ticket don't work which was one reasonI made a second ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-27T20:21:15.365+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you and see your ticket has been escalated to be reviewed by our account team.  Just as a heads up, one ticket is enough so the other will likely be closed to prevent confusion or delay in responding.  Our account team will review the situation and reach out to you to help restore access to the account.  Response time may be a bit depending on the size of the queue for today.  Don't worry, you'll be in good hands!","replies":[{"poster":"Thicc Dicc","date":"2016-09-27T20:44:35.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah my apologies for submitting a second ticket, I was kinda just worried the email i received for the first ticket had a broken link because i wanted to add more information. Thank you for the fast response!","replies":[]}]}]}
