The email that was sent to me contains a link and tells me to post any new information there. Problem is, when i click the link it tells me to sign in even though I'm required to be signed out when creating the ticket. When I'm signed in it brings me to the screen I've posted. Is something wrong, or am I missing something?","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfess","date":"2016-09-29T10:09:18.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds pretty weird since I'm pretty sure you have to be logged in to submit a ticket, and even if that wasn't true I'm VERY sure it wouldn't require you to sign OUT to make one.\n\nI'd suggest going over to your settings, which can be located by clicking on your summoner name up at the top right here on the lol site or boards, and making sure the partial email shown associated with the account matches what you originally put. If it does not, then your account is likely compromised and someone else is getting the ticket replies from riot and then that person is potentially sending you fake ones to phish for your information by taking you to a fake site.","replies":[{"poster":"Thicc Dicc","date":"2016-09-29T10:13:20.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you submit a ticket for a compromised account it requires you to sign out for security purposes, and Porocles has confirmed they received my ticket.

If you reply to the email before then (your messaging will all be through email), you'll bump your ticket to the back of the queue.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Thicc Dicc","date":"2016-09-30T03:18:21.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So is there no real ticket to view?
