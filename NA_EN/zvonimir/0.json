Once your elo accurately reflects your personal skill you can be matched with other players of equal skill easily.\n\nToday LoL uses a similar system called Matchmaking Rating (MMR), though people use Elo and MMR interchangeably (and that's fine). When you win a match, your MMR goes up based on the supposed difficulty of your opponent, and when you lose it goes down.\n\nWhen playing Ranked you gain and lose League Points (LP) based on that, and LP determines your climb through the ranks. MMR is not visible to the players, but if your MMR is low or high for the average of the division you're in you'll get more or less LP so the LP gains are an indicator of if you belong in the rank you're at. For Normal games they use a separate MMR than Ranked, and there are no rewards so there's no LP. MMR and LP are not affected by your personal scores in game (mastery grade).\n\nSome third party sites such as [op.gg](http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Mikethedragon13) will show a player's MMR, but it is only a rough estimation based on publicly available data, so it's only a rough guess.\n\nYou can read a little more about the Matchmaking system and Ranked in the articles below, and if you want to read a more detailed explanation of MMR/Elo I'd suggest Googling up a guide;\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide","replies":[{"poster":"Zvonimir","date":"2016-07-27T01:11:52.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-26T17:02:18.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DTN provided an amazing response that I hope has been helpful!  As mentioned, ELO and MMR can be used interchangably.  Everyone has MMR, and it's something that will continuously adjust as you play games.  I highly recommend checking out our [Matchmaking Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide) which will provide more details.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
