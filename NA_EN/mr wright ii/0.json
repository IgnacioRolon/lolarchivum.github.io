Don't get me wrong, its very useful when talking to someone in a higher position of power than you but when trying to argue one side or the other it basically comes down to me saying \"well i feel like its been different than you said\" and I will have the exact same amount of credibility.  \n\nI feel like dynamic que is just as competative or even more competative than the old que and is better than a solo que.  See what I did?  You can say im wrong because you don't know how I feel.\n\nHe also said he would cover the negatives of implementing solo que but he didn't so I'm going to find some off the top of my head.  \n\nIf solo que was added to the game then dynamic que would die.  Straight up.  There is no possible way to have them co-exist especially if they are both ranked.  \n\nSolo que would take all of the people who would normally play solo in dynamic que and dynamic que would not be able to handle the massive loss in players (try matching groups of 3 or 4 with the 4 single solo players left in dynamic que).  Hell I play tons of games with my friends in dynamic but I also play a ton solo. All of the games I play solo I would just play in solo que now.\n\nAs to why that would be a bad thing, to quote him \"sure, dynamic que is very fun to play with friends, it feels like a fantastic environment, less trolls, less ragers\" All of which is true about dynamic que but to add more, its also very competative.  \n\nTo counter the point of \"oh people get carried\", I've seen this one used a lot against dynamic que.  If you are going 3 or 4 or 5 man and are going ham with your friends in ranked. GUESS WHO IS ALSO DOING IT. The enemy team.  With the sole exception of d1/master/challenger the matchmaking is very good.  It will put you against fair teams, teams which also have 3 mans or 4 mans who have 1-2 players who are clearly smurfing. \n\nOn the topic of d1-challenger players.  This should not be an argument for solo que to be implemented or why dynamic que is bad.  This should be something brought to riots attention and fixed  (which is what they are trying to do with the premade limits at the top ranks, look at patch 6.7 notes http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-67-notes premade limiter bout after the items notes, it may not fix it but they don't want to limit the # of people allowed to que quite yet).   \n\nTheir que times are also a problem but again, So?  It doesn't affect a large majority of the playerbase and like above should be something brought to riots attention and then dealt with.  Que times would still be bad in solo que mode.  The top doesn't have enough players for them to only pick 2 roles each (with overlapping roles most of the time as well).  Remember master + challenger is like 1200 people total. Add another 1200 for d1 and you get 2400 people.  Thats not enough to have decent que times when each are only filling 2 our of 5 roles (and they aren't on at the same time either).\n\nAlso I would like to point out that queing as solo still accuratly reflects your rating and I personally havn't noticed a easier or harder climb over previous seasons due to 4 man premades.\n\nAnd don't give me that dynamic que isn't competitive. Yes is fucking is.  Gauging a players skill level by rank? Yes its still accurate. top of the ladder? wtf is this challenger? No one looks are their ladders below that.\n\nHere is a video that plays devils advocate. \n[(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pzwnD_HV7g)]\n\nJust my 2 cents\n\nEdit video link didnt work here is url","replies":[]}]}
