The extra health and CDR helps her as well. \nReally evens out her build-pathing imo. \n\nPhage is a really good item on her, and the problem of it only building into Trinity (not a good first buy on a champ with only bonus AD ratios and long cooldowns) before has finally been changed.\n\nI imagine Riot will nerf the CDR from 20% to 10% like they did with Spirit Visage. It will still be a good item.\n\nGP is probably a good candidate for the new BC as well, along with the obvious Garen and Darius.

There's also the fact that armor reduction applies before armor penetration, and it would effectively make LW penetrate less armor. It's best to just leave it to someone who can easily apply the debuff and still get a dps increase on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2015-04-28T18:00:12.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll be playing it on Garen (obviously), but based on how well it works I'll see who else I can try it out on.
