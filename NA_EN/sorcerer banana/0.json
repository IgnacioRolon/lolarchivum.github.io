Now we'll try to patch it up to the latest version.  Upon selecting Okay, the client immediately says, \"There was a problem patching League of Legends.  We'll restore a backup version and try updating again after you restart the patcher.\"  This repeats once the patcher is restarted and if I close it myself.\r\nHowever, occasionally I'm able to log in, and the restart message pops up again and the loop continues.  I was actually able to get into a game and after it was remade and I returned to the home menu the message popped up again. \r\nI installed the hextech helper tool and the tool itself crashed when trying to force the update.  Any ideas on how to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-13T01:01:50.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We were having some pretty hefty login issues earlier this morning, but most of them seem to have been cleared up at this point.
