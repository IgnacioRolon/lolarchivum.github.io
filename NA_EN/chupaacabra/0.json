If you’re a party member, you hear a little sound, and BOOP you’re in the new mode. No need to accept another invite.\r\n\r\n**READY UP WHEN YOU WANT TO ON THE EOG SCREEN!**\r\nParty members can now click “Play Again” on the EOG screen to return to the lobby—until you click it, everyone in your lobby will see that you are “not ready”. Click “Play Again”, when you’re “ready” to play. After all party members are ready, the party captain can enter matchmaking.\r\n\r\n**REMEMBERED POSITION PREFERENCES!**\r\nYour position preferences will be remembered through gameflow. So if you’re playing multiple Ranked games (or draft games, anything with position select) we’ll remember your positions from game to game when you click “Play Again”. If you switch between two lobbies with position select (I.E Draft to Ranked Solo) we'll remember that too. You’ll have to pick them again if you quit out of your lobby and create a new one or when you relog.\r\n\r\nIf you run into any problems with lobbies, play again, or position select please post em here and we'll get down to fixing things!","replies":[{"poster":"MaliceCity","date":"2017-10-31T03:30:30.862+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://i68.tinypic.com/4qrdcm.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-10-31T15:53:54.908+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"tell Riot Tantram of the behavioral team that if he does a similar post on the behavioral system every quarter or so, it would be a great way to improve the system's visibility and clarity.","replies":[{"poster":"xXwipeDxXglass","date":"2019-07-28T12:32:24.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hockeyslade","date":"2019-02-07T22:56:01.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fix your fucking client so people stop crashing and getting afk penalties.
