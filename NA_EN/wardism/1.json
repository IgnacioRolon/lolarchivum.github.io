However, when I played Morgana earlier today i didnt have the option of using it. Usually the client shows that a skin (classic or not) has a chroma and I didnt even have that available to me. So i was forced to use the base classic. Can't say if this is the case for the other chroma packs, only noticed it for the Morgana set.","replies":[{"poster":"o Mim o","date":"2015-11-08T20:37:48.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Chroma skin doesn't work in Team Builder at all.
