Its an execute on hit. When you have a clone attack minions you can get bonus gold for yourself and heal the clone with your own executions,since usually the clone will be the closest hero to you. I highly doubt this was intentional, since it makes early tower dives on shaco almost guaranteed (as a support) since you can execute and heal from the minions, while your AD does all of the damage. This is especially a problem late game, because if you have Eye, you have 8 stacks every 50 some seconds that you can use at once for tower dives.\r\n\r\nAgain, I do not know if this is intentional, but it seems a little bit busted\r\n\r\n{{champion:35}}","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-10T20:06:17.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A better question: Why the hell is _Shaco_ building support items.","replies":[{"poster":"Krumbulus","date":"2016-11-11T07:12:30.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"compared to his old kit, his damage is extremely low. you cant clear krugs or raptors until about the 8-9 minute mark, so why not just build him tank ap. boxes are stronger now ( and hp scales slightly), and especially with this mechanic, it makes tower dives free from about 15 mins on. you really shouldnt end a game with over 3k gold on an Eye of the equinox.
