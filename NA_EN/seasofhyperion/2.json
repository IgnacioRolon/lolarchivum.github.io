I got up to 80 some odd LP and was very close to getting into my series for gold 4, but then ranked took a turn and I plummeted on a losing streak. I'm back to zero LP, but even then I played, in hopes I could gain something, unfortunately I lost them all. I'm incredibly concerned that I will get demoted if I lose another, which gives me a lot of anxiety when I debate about playing ranked again. I'd like to win another, so I can have a cushion to play more, but I really don't want to be back in silver. Does anyone know how to tell if you'll be demoted if you lose another? I've tried looking at the ranked board in my profile, but I don't really understand it. It has a little 3 with an arrow pointing down next to my name, does that mean three more loses until I'm demoted? Any help is appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-19T03:55:30.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Losing at 0 LP will make you demote.
