It doesn't give enough AD to satisfy people who would build hydra/bt/ie, it has no crit, no armor pen, no lifesteal, and its passive is nowhere near as good as that of BORK which has nearly identical stats. Just increasing the AD a bit would help a lot, but that would make its gold efficiency rediculously high. I don't think a boost to the movement speed would help very much at all, it would just be regarded as a better upgrade for boots. Increasing its attack speed wouldn't help too much either, as it has nothing which increased attack speed would work well with.\n\n...speaking of which, I've had an idea. Give it an additional passive which is similar to wits end, except movement speed instead of magic resistance. Could then be made to build out of phage instead of pickaxe as well, which would be useful as it would give phage an additional build path rather than forcing the player down the triforce route.","replies":[{"poster":"Davids Uploader","date":"2015-03-27T01:24:44.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The phage idea is actually great, now if only we could get a Red in on this....","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Collar Bear","date":"2015-03-27T01:26:47.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree!

Tenacity is generally a tank thing and yet most of the other stats are strictly for damage dealers.  So it can only be used on a damage dealer but since it gives stuff other than damage you'll just deal less damage with it than some other damage item.  So nobody really wants it unless it can replace some less useful item in your build, like Yi's boots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reformed Dunni","date":"2015-03-27T00:54:50.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ill probably leave it in and see the state of the item since no one builds it if it is OP I would take out the passive MS or reduce it","replies":[]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2015-03-27T00:47:49.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's an alright last item","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-03-27T00:47:06.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a luxury item prob because you can get tenacity for less on boots, and because tenacity doesn't stack between items.","replies":[]}]}
