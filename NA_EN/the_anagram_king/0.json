A city **low** in crime and **high** in living standards. Quite possibly the single most enviable place to live in all of Valoran... Assuming you&#039;ve got what it takes to get in. It&#039;s kind&#039;ve like a world-class college, in that respect.\nFor the past few decades, the city has been held in high esteem by the other nations; a forward-thinking, environmentally-conscious settlement comprised of morally upright citizens devoted to the gradual betterment of all of mankind. Also Heimerdinger and Ziggs make bombs.\n\nAt least, on paper, this seems to be the case. But as it stands, it has been _years_ since Piltover has managed to churn out anything revolutionary. New Zeppelin models, slightly more efficient power sources, weapon upgrades - all, admittedly, admirable in their own right, right? Right! And yet... \n\n...across the river, lies a city. A twin city, split from Piltover due to a difference of opinion. And the things they do... the things that they've... *acheived* there...\n\n\n{{champion:53}}\n**Artificial Intelligence** - the artificial creation of new, _fully aware_, synthetic lifeforms capable of learning and growing.\n\n{{champion:6}} \n**Techromancy** - bringing the very dead themselves _back to life_.\n\n{{champion:154}}  \n**Synthetic Life** - the capacity to create self-aware biological lifeforms. Apparently packed with every variety of human emotion. Love, fear, hatred - and a desire to protect those dearest to them; cultivated in a test tube.\n\n{{champion:112}} \n**Transhumanism** - The absolute culmination of human achievement. Mastery over life, over death. Your form and frame, completely subject to your whims. Where you can live, what sensations you can feel, the intricacies of your very own mind - all within your own grasp; editable, modifiable. The beginning of ascension to a new, unexplored, plane of hence before _unfathomed_ heights of existence.\n\nAnd it&#039;s all found within the city borders of Zaun.\n\nWhere Piltover toils aimlessly on trinkets and luxuries, Zaun unravels the very fabric of reality and stares upon the framework of the universe. Clambering out from under the boots of the privileged, the citizens can&#039;t even see the sky through all the smog. Monsters like Warwick roam the streets, collecting specimens for insane experiments; striking terror into denizens and foreigners, alike; and yet, from these anything but humble beginnings, the city unlocks the secrets of life and death; of **unbridled potential **in a future limited only by the imagination of its citizens.\n\nFriends die in poverty, and vengeance festers. Mere _children_, like **Ekko**, obtain the means and methodology to **bend time, itself.** \n\nAnd all the while, Piltover stagnates. A fossil of the past, unable to deal or profit like Zaun does. Unable to shirk its responsibilities to its own citizens, as Zaun does. Rules, regulations, infrastructure - Piltover makes money, but so very *little* of the money makes it back to the city.\n\nEven now, as Piltover frets over the wellbeing of its citizens, Zaun closes in on the possibility of biological immortality. A city not concerned with death, coming close to overcoming that very flaw with each passing day. How would Piltover feel, to stare across the coast that separates the two cities from one another? How would it feel, to witness the budding reality of a new world; envisioned at the hands of those you despise; those who forsook all that you stood for and chased dreams that you dismissed with as simple a gesture as a passive waving of your hand?\n\n#How would it feel?\nYour ambitions, your ideals, your reputation as the utmost leader in science and ecology, outmanoeuvred in a swift moment of scientific growth at the hands of your competitors. And now Piltover is left standing with its hands in its pockets.\n\nThe first hit is to your city&#039;s funding potential. \n\nAs affordable immortality becomes the latest craze, ecological concerns take a swift and noticeable back seat. Grant money thins, divisions shut down and masters in their field find themselves struggling to secure work. There is still money, but nothing like before. Piltover falls back on its last major field of study still happily backed by its funders; **Weapon development.** And then, slowly, but surely...\n\n#The dream dies.\n\nPiltover, the city of ecological advancement. Of scientific progress. A place of innovation and invention. Of empathy, of morality - a place to secure a better tomorrow.\n\nAnd also Heimerdinger and Ziggs make bombs.\n\nI guess some outcomes are just inevitable.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-05-24T21:06:27.718+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zaun scares me.  Now, don't get me wrong - I love Zaun - I think it's a fascinating place with some of the juiciest, most potential-filled characters in the game - but it scares the pants off me.\n\nEveryone likes to think that if they were in Zaun, or somewhere like it, they'd be the one making the inventions and overcoming death (or whatever the challenge they've taken on is) but for the most part, scrubs like me would be the one slowing dying to poisoned air and water, or selling my plasma to afford the medicine for the magical malady that I picked up from working in an unregulated hextech factory.  (Medicine smuggled in from Piltover, and sold at 10 times the price.)  I might have a tiny single-end apartment somewhere with a workshop table, trying to convince myself that my next big invention will be the eureka moment - but it probably won't be.\n\nPiltover, on the other hand - yeah, it seems almost staid in comparison.  But I imagine that even if I were one of the middling normals, I might be able to visit a free-to-the-public concert or museum once a month, and probably work as a filigree apprentice for hextech devices; expecting to spend 5+ years of my life on a single device that will go to a wealthy patron.  I may die in my old age still an apprentice, if my master/mistress chooses another to be their successor.

Is two sides of the same coin. They're the same place, but they're different because of the people who live there, and the attitude of said people. Zaun vs Piltover is (in my mind at least) a fun way to answer the question \"What happens when an unstoppable force, meets an immovable object?\".\n\nZaun is the \"Unstoppable Force\". They've made all these amazing technological advances because they don't have the same... \"code\" as Piltover, and don't care. They don't want to be anything like Piltover.\n\nWhereas Piltover is the \"Immovable Object\". They've got technology sure, they've made some great advances. But they won't budge from their moral code, what they see as right and wrong. To them it's black and white. They're set in their ways, and look down upon those in Zaun because they're different, and don't follow the same rules.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-05-24T23:36:00.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=sp441,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Q01lK4pz,comment-id=00040001,timestamp=2015-05-24T22:47:35.437+0000)\n>\n> Honestly, I don't like this idea that Zaun is some sort of hyper-industrialistic hellhole and Piltover is Steampunk Heaven, if that were true, most people would move over to Piltover and nobody but madmen like Mundo or Singed would live there.

P. Lovecraft\n\nThe dichotomy between Piltover and Zaun is a classic examination of restraint and zeal; Piltover does produce exceptional inventions, but does so at a languid pace in comparison to the marvels regularly manufactured by Zaun. The acclaimed inventors and brilliant minds of Piltover are just as capable of producing incredible creations as their Zaunite counterparts, what prevents them from doing so is no doubt the city itself. Authoritative figures are likely quite aware of Zaun's incredible advancement, their leaps and bounds in fields of medicine, magic, and technology. Likewise, they are also knowledgable of the consequences these changes have wrought.\n\nUrgot was returned to life, openly defying what many consider to be the natural law; all things must die, and that is the final word. Whether or not this defiles some divinely ordained decree, the cost of doing so is openly called into question. Urgot's life is one of complete misery; body filled with whirring constructs and bulbous tubes, flesh barely held together, an image that barely resembles his former humanity. Is the result worth its cost?\n\nBlitzcrank and ZAC represent previously unexplored fields of artificial life, living things born outside natural means. Not only does this require the world to consider what qualifies as a living, independent being, but the implications of creating objects with wills of their own. Does the creator have some form of jurisdiction over their creation? What is their place in society? Do the rights which apply to those who were made through wholly natural means apply to those who were not? The answers are not clear. More importantly, these questions do not take into account what _kind_ of artificial life was made. A vaguely humanoid robot meant to clean toxic waste, and a good-natured amorphous blob have greater ease adjusting to the world, and the world to them, but what about an automated defense system, whose fingers are wall-mounted rifles and eyes are security cameras, that grows tired of the purpose it was explicitly built for, and perhaps opts for a different means of achieving distinction in the world, like chess?\n\nNow far be it for me to play devil's advocate, which I am doing, as I laud scientific progress and am a staunch advocate for the Glorious Evolution, but the consequences of Zaun's unbridled advancement raise significant concerns. Piltover may seem the stuffy conservative in comparison, but its caution is not without merit. The focus of invention within the City of Progress is for the sake of the people and the world, not experimentation for its own sake. I have no doubt Piltover is far from a utopia, someone must man the factories after all, and wherever there is wealth there is poverty suffering in its shadow, but the quality of life is significantly better than a life lived across the bay in Zaun. Perhaps you sleep in the gutter beside a nobleman's mansion, but at least you can sleep without errant fumes suffocating you in the middle of the night, or an escaped experiment gnawing off your face.\n\nFailure, if it is coming, will do so slowly within Piltover. For Zaun, an eruption is not merely likely, but expected; it is a shooting star, brilliant and beautiful for all its danger, but it swiftly burns out.\n\nOr leaves a sizable crater.\n\n>Yeah, yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.\n- Dr. Ian Malcom","replies":[{"poster":"The Anagram King","date":"2015-05-24T16:05:05.105+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty, detailed, and well-written to boot. I always like your posts. :P\n\nIn my opinion, Zaun is rising at exponential rates. It is unlocking and taming secrets that citizens - Piltovian or otherwise - would consider impossible, even if assured that those secrets were availble for commercial use, today.\n\nIt is destroying its environment, but in the same breath is creating the means to overcome the effects of any catastrophic results. The more they innovate, the more toxic their city becomes; and the more toxic their city comes, the more they need to innovate.\n\nThere is, however, already one of many solutions in of the augmented. The Herald would no doubt appreciate the opportunity to win over citizens' hearts with assisted fittings through which they may shrug of the environmental hazards they create.\n\nBurning out, I think, is not an issue. Zaun has defeated the slow burn. But a catastrophic disaster - say an explosion - could level the city's above-ground districts in the blink of an eye.\n\nAnd so I agree with you.\n\nZaun's a huge risk; and there's a reason Piltover remains distant. But Piltover will be dwarfed if Zaun should prosper; and unless they're content to be a distant number 2, changes will need to be made.\n\nOr maybe a new Piltovian champion will come out in 2 weeks who can turn everybody into energy that transcends time.

The real question is if it can maintain its momentum without falling apart. Zaun is rapidly reaching a climax, and at such an accelerated rate it is guaranteed to be an explosive one. The city of unrestrained science is a pendulum swinging back and forth, at one moment digging itself a grave, at another, compensating the danger it has caused; the real arms race is not between it and Piltover, but with Zaun itself.\n\nIf Zaun fails to overcome its danger, then the progress it so eagerly pursues will overwhelm it; the advances are borne on the backs of mortals after all. Piltover could win by default. However, if Zaun maintains control of its hazards, and permanently overcomes them, then, in all honesty, it is not just Piltover that has been left behind, but the whole of Runeterra.\n\nAnd yes, lore is a little funny, though we still love it.
