But sincere thanks to all the people that boarded the DhaMa hype train, helping create the skillsets and lore. It was a very interesting week! \n\nThis is Dha Ma, a League of Legends character that I concepted. They are supposed to represent yin and yang and they are a paired duo/team that sort of plays like Ice Climbers in Super Smash Bros. \nThe basic storyline:\nKarma and Syndra had a very powerful battle, and after their most powerful attacks collided, two beings were born. These two are truly neutral, being both good and evil, and stopped the battle. But, they aren&#039;t perfect, as they are still young, so they are very playful and chaotic. They have a duty of keeping balance in the Fields of Justice. \n\nI haven't thought of a skill list yet, but it could literally be anything. If you guys can think of anything, feel free to post suggestions and comments. \n \nHere are some images that I've done.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/zk1Ktce.jpg http://i.imgur.com/Rq2opzn.jpg http://i.imgur.com/8uWLonQ.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/36vwNBj.jpg http://i.imgur.com/sZejYi7.jpg http://i.imgur.com/g1cCJUv.jpg\n\nEDIT:\nHere's a Blood Moon skin that was inspired by my cousin.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ni0KA2N.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Baconhawk","date":"2015-05-16T02:02:55.589+0000","up_votes":427,"down_votes":3,"body":"Wowowowowow!

These energies are in balance, but require even more energy to become unbalanced. \nDha is male energy who is playful, defensive, and prefers a safer playstyle.\nMa is female energy who is serious, offensive, and prefers a riskier playstyle.\nDha and Ma keep each other in balance by mere existence. They trade off certain qualities to make a unique champion that highlights the >differences of an offensive strategy and a defensive one.\n\n**Playing Dha Ma:**\n>Dha Ma requires a lot of mana for his/her combo. At level 3 their combo can easily cost 305 mana consuming over half of Dha Ma's mana. Using Dha Ma's abilities for farming become very expensive mana-wise, so saving a large amount of mana will always be a necessity. Dha Ma has passives which are self sustaining, but the need for mana means that Dha Ma will have to build mana items and mana regen. Dha Ma is recommended as a tank, but can be squishy AP.\n>\n**Using Dha** - allows for a larger ranged auto attack, but a lower amount of ability range. For laning, he will be a safer option naturally, but he does not have a long ranged poke. He would be able to farm safely but not trade with enemy laners. Dha offers limited damage options that scale with AP. Dha can run from danger when the jungler comes to gank with the passive and knock back. He will also be able to avoid a lot damage taken from abilities for a brief period if he can time his ability just right. Switching back into Dha also heals him so he >will be able to survive and evade.\n>\n**Using Ma** - allows for a shorter melee auto attack, but a higher amount of ability range. Her short auto-attack range opens her up to receiving damage from her opponent since she does not have a ranged auto attack. She can trade with the enemy laner with her damaging abilities that have range and flat damage. Her passive builds up AP that fuels off of damage being traded in an area. To best use this, it is best to wait till a minion wave. Her passive also can be a fight changer since it can be built it really quick if an ally dies from a burst. Ma doesn't have any escape potential, so it's best to use her for an all out offensive rather than a laner. It's best to switch into Ma once you >have locked down an enemy, since she can deal a percentage of her max health as damage. \n\n**Advanced Techniques**\n>To maximize damage potential, use Dha to AA then Q and Quickly E. Flash on top of the enemy and switch to Ma, W the enemy to increase the damage, E then Q and end with AA until you can switch to Dha and W to escape any damage. \n>\nWhen laning, use Dha to last hit minions and Ma to kite the enemy laner away. Dha will have 350 movement speed without boots if the enemy jungler comes for a gank. Using Ma should only be for an all-out offensive since she lacks mobility and an escape. Be mindful of cooldowns and mana at all times. \n>\nDha Ma has a built in kit that allows a lot of damage, but a high mana cost. Switching to Ma can sometimes be more damage efficient if a poke needs more punch. Dha Ma has to have a long term presence in order to be effective due to their long cooldowns and passives. In order to achieve this, Lots of mana, health, armor and magic resist would be needed. This would effectively make players have to build tanky. A typical tank build may look like this:\n{{summoner:21}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3259}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3361}}   \n>\nAlternatively, Building Dha Ma squishier may raise his/her burst potential, but at a cost of survivability and mana. A typical glass cannon build may look like this:\n>{{summoner:14}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3255}} {{item:3003}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3361}} \n\n**Going Against Dha Ma**\n>Dha has the escapes, Ma has the damage. Be ready to pounce whenever Ma is activated because the damage is coming. Ma has a longer range and more damage, but has to continue with a melee attack. Attacking while Ma is active is the most effective because Ma will be focused on an all-out offensive and isn't able to be defensive. Whenever Dha is reactivated, he gains health, but this can be negated with a simple ignite or grevious wounds. Saving ignite to execute Dha Ma will be crucial in getting the kill. Dha is not very great at soloing, so it's best to 1v1 him at that point rather than to try to chase him down as a team because he will get away. Watch Dha Ma's mana carefully, they will need at least 600 mana to burst at max level. Dha Ma has long cooldowns so avoiding their abilities will set them back tremendously. Dha Ma is scaled Mid-Late Game despite their early game potential. Taking advantage of Dha Ma early and not allowing them to buy the >most expensive items available to Mages will keep their overall output low. Ironically, Inescapable Truth is escapeable when Ma uses it.\n\n**Ideas Surrounding the Concept**\n>**1.** _I want Dha Ma to be a defensive and an offensive character._ Two extremes in a symbiotic relationship.\n**2.** _Dha Ma must have high mana costs._ In Chemistry, unstable atoms take little energy to bond to another (Hydrogen and Sodium) and stable atoms ( Argon and Neon ) require even more energy to separate. Knowing that Dha Ma is a balance character, I feel as if the high mana costs should be a part of them because they require lots energy to manifest any imbalances that can be turned into abilities.\n**3.** _I want Dha to be male and Ma to be female._  To better contrast the two. Also the gender assignment helps break a gender appropriation rule, so it's kickass. \n**4.** _Dha should prioritize defensive ability, excelling at mobility and damage reduction._ Because of this, Dha pushes away enemies, runs from them, laughs and screams high pitch during his abilities, has a quick ranged attack and does minimal damage. \n**5.** _Ma should prioritize an all-in offensive ability, excelling at damage and retention._ Because of this Ma pulls enemies toward her, grunts, growls and roars (tiny roars) in her abilities, has a melee attack and does maximum damage. \n**6.** _To keep Dha Ma from building pure AP, because that's boring, I started with a 1.0 AP ratio, and split it unequally_, to give Dha a higher AP ratio and Ma less. Ma does more damage then Dha, so being safe with farming with Dha means that you don't do much damage. Switching between Dha and Ma costs mana at early ranks to avoid constant harass. \n**7.** _I wanted the passives to reflect the nature of Dha and Ma._ Dha feeds off danger to be more slippery ( adds to clowny nature ) and Ma feeds off damage ( adds to malevolent nature ).\n**8.** _To keep Ma from being extremely powerful, her abilities have more damage, but less speed and CC._ Avoiding Ma's abilities will mean that she is already screwed and cannot afford to keep throwing misses at you.  \n**9.** _To keep Dha from being the most used half, the damage is reduced and has no CC counter._ Dha is easy to catch if you chase with 1 person only. If the team chases he will get away.\n**10.** _A thematically interesting character._ Dha or Ma will hover behind the active half just meandering. The stark contrast in sound >and visual effects I believe will make them a very eye catching.\n\n________________________________\n\nThat's my AP Dha Ma concept, let me know what you think. \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Benzooka","date":"2015-05-12T01:25:48.377+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":1,"body":"Here's what I think is a fantastic idea, Instead of transforming ult which many champs have, you could make it to where if you use one ability as Da, next would be a Ma ability which would limit but create some interesting combos.

Basically, you have a unique bar mechanic called Alignment that starts out at 50% full.  At 100% full, they are fully Light, causing Ma's abilities to be empowered.  At 0%, they are fully Dark and Dha's abilities are empowered.  In other words, the farther from the midpoint they are, the more they want to try to return to it.\n\nPassive: Harmonic Oscillation\n>Every ability cast shifts the Alignment of Dha Ma in the direction of the caster.  Auto-attacking causes Dha and Ma to trade out.\n>Ability strength scales with Alignment \n>-    100% Alignment scaling would be an increase Dha's ability's power by 50% if alignment were 0%, \n>-    50% Alignment scaling would increase an ability's power by 25% if alignment were all the way at the other end, \n>-    Alignment yields no increase in ability strength if it is neutral or toward the current actor's own\n\nBasic Attack Range: 625\nBasic Attack Type: Beam (like Azir and Vel'koz)\n\nQ: Oder/Chaos\n>Dha - Order: fires a bolt that creates a slowing field that slows movement speed by 20/25/30/35/40% and attack speed by 10/12/14/16/18% of all non-allied champion entities (so this works on enemy champions, enemy minions, all turrets, all neutral monsters, and allied minions).\n>Ma - Chaos: fires a bolt that creates a Corrupting field a stack of Corruption every second to enemies within the field\n>Corruption: causes the target to burn for 5% of their current health over five seconds.  If a target receives 5 stacks, they are stunned for one second\n>50% Alignment Scaling\n>Cooldown: 12/11/10.5/10/9.5\n>Alignment Shift: 5%\n>Range: 900\n>Radius: 375 (scales with alignment)\n\nW: Exonerate/Condemn\n>Dha - Exonerate: heals (based on alignment and AP) an ally (or self) and applies 15% tenacity to the target player for 2/3/4/5/6 seconds\n>Ma - Condemn: deals high damage (based on alignment) and increases the duration of crowd control effects on the target enemy champion by 20% for 2/3/4/5/6 seconds\n>100% alignment scaling\n>Cooldown: 14\n>Alignment Shift: 10%\n>Range: 900\n\nE: Exorcise/Possess\n>Dha - consumes all stacks of Corruption on the target to deal damage (based on alignment, stack count, and AP) and self-heal (based on alignment and AP only).  Self-heal is reduced if the target of Exorcise is a champion.\n>Ma - deals damage (scales on alignment and AP) and applies 3 stacks of Corruption to all enemies within 400/500/600/700/800 units\n>60% alignment scaling\n>Cooldown: 8\n>Alignment Shift: 8%\n\nR: Equalize\n>Dha - Fires a slow, wide, penetrating skillshot that heals allies that scales with your current health (and Alignment and AP)\n>Ma - Fires a slow, wide, penetrating skillshot that deals damage that scales with your missing health (and Alignment and AP)\n>150% Alignment scaling\n>Alignment Shift: 50%\n>Range: 1100\n\nThis would make Dha Ma a rather unique champion in that they could quite possibly do any role except ADC.  With Order's intrinsic ability to control minion waves, it will be effectively impossible to gank Dha Ma, so enemy junglers will have to focus their efforts elsewhere or at least wait until after Dha Ma decides to go aggressive after the first few levels.  To compensate, Dha Ma has a rather weak laning phase when alone because Possess starts off with a very short range and without it, Dha Ma can't stun.  Dha and Ma are likely to be selected for games where tank busting is necessary due to their intrinsic %health damage.  Unlike Brand, they don't burst and unlike Malzahar, they aren't a lane bully.\n\n**Top**: probably going to go with a hybrid light/dark style to sustain\n{{item:3152}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3157}} \nOnce Dha Ma gets WoTA and Liandry's, Dha Ma will have scaled up into a monster that can shove the lane with impunity.  I expect R->E->Q->W after a level 1 point in Q.  It's likely that first picking Dha Ma would result in an enemy picking someone with range or escapes so they won't get ganked to oblivion before Dha Ma goes on the aggressive.\n\n**Jungle**: dark style using amplified heals to sustain.  Likely a farm jungler as hard CC or a burned flash is basically mandatory for a kill.\n{{item:3709}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3020}}{{item:3065}} {{item:3157}} \nLaning phase will likely be spent focusing on farming, requiring use of Chilling Smite as otherwise Dha Ma has no hope of catching the target for a stun.  I expect the leveling will be R->E->Q->W as E provides clear speed and healing while Q provides even more clear speed.\n\n**Mid**: dark style, using amplified Exorcisms to deal damage\n{{item:3151}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3089}} \nProbably similar to top lane, but assassins like LeBlanc and Zed would absolutely destroy Dha Ma as they can both tower dive with impunity and Dha Ma has high sustained damage, but has no instant response to burst, so a mid Dha Ma is very unlikely to be picked until the enemy mid laner has selected their champion.  I assume the order will be a  R->Q->E->W.  Laning is likely to be spent spamming Q on minion waves to hide under your turret while poking periodically.  If/when Dha Ma finally does go aggressive, it'll be after Possess gains enough range in the mid game to actually be of use offensively.\n\n**Support**: tanky light style to spam defensive spells yet still apply reasonable damage\n{{item:3401}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3020}} {{item:2045}} {{item:3001}} \nWhile none of the starter items are ideal, Face of the Mountain and Talisman of Ascension at least give relevant end-game stats.  They'll probably max abilities in R->W->Q->E after level 1 which will probably be Q.  Dha Ma will focus on heal and poke of enemy champions with Q fields in lane and probably only use Condemn if the jungler comes to gank.\n\nA person using a tanky build may decide to max CDR so that they can charge in and use Possess and Chaos and immediately start burning away enemy health, possibly with a Zhonya's in there to survive.  On the plus side, Dha Ma has no engage, so while _The Force of Balance_ can't get to you easily, if they do they'll probably destroy your team with AoE stuns.  Additionally, not targeting Dha Ma means they can apply a larger heal to their allies while targeting them means that they can deal more damage to your team, so depending on your disengage, heals, burst, and whatnot you'll have to decide how to handle them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aelvr","date":"2015-05-11T07:32:18.834+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"P: Dha Ma's basic spells differ depending on which twin is currently active.

DhaMa should be a capable midlaner or support with this proposal.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**Passive - Self Expression**\nIdentity checks occur every 70/60/50 seconds of combat. /laugh at the beginning of the game grants **Well-Spirited** while /taunt grants **Mean-Spirited**. (Afterwards, manual form changes are done with a function key like DJ Sona.) This effect recharges after maintaining identity for 3 durations. These form changes have a 1.5 second cast time. If neither occurs, a random identity is chosen upon first entering combat.\n\nIf (magic damage) x _a1_   +    (healing done) x _b_  > a (logarithmically?) growing constant, then DhaMa maintains **Well-Spirited**. If not, DhaMa reconsiders identity, switching to **Mean-Spirited**.\nIf (magic damage) x _a2_ > a (logarithmically?) growing constant, then DhaMa maintains **Mean-Spirited**, otherwise switching.\n\n**Well-Spirited** grants   _f1_ mp5 and   _g1_  chance of circular healing pulse for _h1_% of DhaMa's max mana upon spellcast. The healing pulse is less effective on DhaMa and minions. The pulse also lingers around DhaMa for 0.5 seconds but only heals allies once per proc.\n\n**Mean-Spirited** grants _f2_% movement speed and _g2_ chance of applying a DoT for _h2_% of DhaMa's max mana upon spellcast for every unit hit as well as a small movement speed buff upon every spellcast.\n\nAn **amazing** idea would be to have Self Expression to instead have a growing chance of being one side over another based on a ratio using the formulas above, not a boolean, so there could be several unplanned \"identity changes\". Unplanned changes would remove the stored manual change, if attained. Scaling is based on the same stats in this proposal so that this affects playstyle changes, not effectiveness. In other words, doing more damage and healing increases the chance of maintaining identity. A UI gauge could be implemented to help show the odds of the sides being selected and when \"identity checks\" occur.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**Q - Tail Swipe** \nDhaMa slithers, gaining _a_%/_a_%/_b_%/_b_%/_c_% increased movement speed for 1.0 seconds and swipes its' tails forward. A ground-targeted skillshot is also fired based on DhaMa's identity.\n\nIf **Well-Spirited** is active, Dha's energy overpowers, firing a ball of ordered energy to a nearby target location, persisting for 3 seconds. This ball damages enemies on contact and heals nearby units. The heal is less effective on DhaMa and on minions. The ball may be destroyed with enemy damaging abilities, even before it reaches target location. Scales with max mana.\n\nIf **Mean-Spirited** is active, Ma's energy overpowers, shooting forth a stretched tail to a nearby target location. This damages all units in the area and the champion hit closest to DhaMa is pulled half of the distance Ma's tail travelled and stuns for a very brief time. Scales with max mana.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**W - Spirit Burst**\nDhaMa manifests a ball of spiritual energy behind it (purely graphical, ball follows behind and slightly above) and fires small energy bursts in a cone.\n\nIf **Well-Spirited** is active, Dha's energy overpowers, firing more bursts and over a longer distance, dealing no damage, and marks collided champions, revealing them and reducing their Magic Resist. This can be body-blocked by champions. Scales with a combination of AP and max mana.\nor\nIf **Well-Spirited** is active, Dha's energy overpowers, firing a laser for up to 2.5 seconds, slightly growing in range and damage for the duration.\n(Please reply which of these two you prefer. If the second one, then the ball from DhaMa's Well-Spirited Q could grant vision for the 3 seconds it's up)\n\nIf **Mean-Spirited** is active, Ma's energy overpowers, dealing moderate damage, firing dark shards that apply a DoT and a minor slow. Scales with a combination of AP and max mana.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**E - Spiritual Upheaval**\nDhaMa unleashes spiritual energy in a circular target location. Activating DhaMa's teleport/burst, respectively, has an additional chance of proc'ing DhaMa's passive.\n\nIf **Well-Spirited** is active, Dha's energy overpowers, unleashing a purifying pillar of light, dealing moderate damage to all enemies in the area. May be activated again to teleport DhaMa to the center of the pillar within 3.5 seconds of activation, removing slows and debuffs on allies in the area (removes half of the max duration of debuffs on DhaMa). Scales with AP.\n\nIf **Mean-Spirited** is active, Ma's energy overpowers, unleashing a chaotic frenzy of darkness, dealing moderate damage and launches DhaMa to the target location, building up another burst of darkness, which explodes around DhaMa after a short period of time, dealing low to moderate damage. The second burst may be interrupted by hard cc. DhaMa is immune to soft cc between the teleport and the burst. Scales with AP.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**R - Matured Identity**\nDhaMa becomes one in body, halting the identity check system, losing **Well-Spirited** and **Mean-Spirited**, gaining **Wisened-Spirit**. Matured Identity may be reactivated multiple times while **Wisened-Spirit** is active to freely switch between forms. Form changes have a .2 second cast time and a 1.0 second mini cooldown. **Wisened-Spirit** also causes DhaMa to take 40% less damage for 4 seconds, as well as the boosts associated with the selected skills. Cooldowns between forms are not shared but are slightly increased and mana costs are decreased.

You know how they first started out with that \"3 mark combo\" system, where if the target enemy gets 3 marks on them, something different occurs? For example Braum has to get 4 marks off on a champion to stun them? Or how Vayne, Varus, Gnar, or Tahm have to get 3 marks on you for you to have percent health damage done to you or other things? \n\nI think they should not use this on these two.\nAlso I think the story if it goes should be tweaked a little.\n\n For instance putting that the battle was over a special ancient spirit orb that was located in a spiritual realm kind of like a place where bard might of come from, where spirits protect it because of its great spirit energy. Life isn't just created from two strong powers colliding, it would have to be done under certain circumstances such as in a spiritual place where spectacular things happen. Karma and Syndra were on a quest to retrieve this Spirit energy orb at the top of a mountain, (Karma doing so to keep it out of the wrong hands) and Syndra{{champion:134}}  doing it to get greater power. They go into this realm and both fight but Syndra's power is absolutely too over whelming and Karma is almost completely defeated after a long battle. At the last moment Karma unharnesses every last bit of her power unlocking special gates in her energy, and she calls forth on the spirits of peace to aid her as Syndra is about to finish her with her most powerful magic. Surprisingly Karma{{champion:43}}  aims at the orb and knocks it between the two with intentions to destroy the orb.{{item:3112}} \nThe impact creates a bright light that silences both Syndra and Karma from fighting any further. The orb hatches into twin spirits of both dark and light, girl and boy.\n\nAs for skills some suggestions might be:\nInstead of mana, Dha-Ma uses 2 different sources of energy so they look as if they have 2 energy bars. One is the dark energy bar and one is the light bar that works kind of like rage. One energy bar is filled up by using the opposite skill type(dark/light). At full or half bar filled up different things happen(which is up to your imagination).\nOne skill should be for movement, such as Ma catapults Dha and their intertwined tails move them a distance forward with a temporary an energy sheild sort of like how gnar hops a distance foward. They should be mobile and nimble.\n\nAs for the ult I thought since in the story tweak I included had this and it'd be interesting. The ult would do no damage but would have an AOE  wave _silence_ instead. The silence goes a long range about as long as Tahm's ult range but in a wave. The silence is about 2.4 - 3.6 seconds depending on how far it went. This ult is a silence of peace. All allies in the wave are refreshed with a slight movement speed buff for the same duration. Ways of avoiding the wave are to become invulnerable (example: Fizz, Zhonya, Bard ult, Lissandra ult).\n\nDha-Ma should be AP with high ratios to contest going mid lane or as support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PalPlays","date":"2015-05-12T16:56:04.696+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rakoon Jesus,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=8hhT41YP,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-05-11T02:49:55.569+0000)\n>\n> This is Dha Ma, a League of Legends character that I concepted.
