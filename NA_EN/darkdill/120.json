Additionally, late-game he might have mana-capacity items to help stem his issues, but if he&#039;s constantly cycling Gemcraft he&#039;ll burn out regardless. To add to the problem, Chalice of Harmony and Mikael&#039;s Crucible aren&#039;t ideal items for Taric because he&#039;s essentially required to build armor, not magic resist.\n\nI feel that Gemcraft has some untapped space for it to help Taric with his mana issues, so let&#039;s try there:\n\n>#Gemcraft\nAfter using an ability, Taric&#039;s next basic attack deals bonus magic damage equal to 20% of Taric&#039;s armor, **restores a small amount of his mana**, and reduces his abilities&#039; cooldown by 2 seconds.\n\nThis lets Taric refund some of his mana when he properly uses Gemcraft, but hopefully not to an overboard degree. It&#039;d at least let him mitigate his costs without going completely overboard.\n\nAs for what stat his mana restore should be based on, that&#039;s up to debate.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-11T00:21:57.576+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frozen Heart can help to silve his mana problems in some way, but its not a bad idea refund some mana with his passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2015-04-10T23:44:28.279+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's getting reworked currently.
