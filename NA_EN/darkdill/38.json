Wouldn't do a straight skill shot heal as a result. A skillshot that, if it damaged an enemy champion, could then heal your allies in some way (e.g. missile that on enemy champ hit boomerangs back healing allies) by contrast might work, especially if the return speed was slow enough allies could react to it, putting themselves in its path.","replies":[{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2016-01-08T01:31:22.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right, didn't ezreal W used to heal allies by the same AP ratio it damaged enemies?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-01-08T01:40:24.223+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It did.

Ez built AP. Pressed W in middle of team fight to heal his team for around 500-800 + making all of his allies attack faster while doing the exact opposite to enemy team.

Just spitballin', but think of something like a reverse Fiddle Drain or a Karma tether which an opponent could body-block to interrupt might have some more satisfying gameplay.
