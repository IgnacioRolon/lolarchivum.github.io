Haunting guise currently is a good hp + ap + magic penetration item to rush early, giving burst users more damage and survivability. While it doesn't upgrade for them later, that means it's a trade off between getting better components for later in the game, or try to secure a lead with your greater damage. Making it upgrade into a good item for burst just means it'll be a 1st pick rush (hp is better at the beginning of the game, and an item giving penetration AND AP and HP early for cheap while building into an even better item is bad) on everyone.","replies":[]}]}
