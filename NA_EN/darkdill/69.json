Do you have any suggestions for how it should work? Or at least what specifically is broken about it?\n\nWell, I hate irelia and think she's absurdly broken on many levels, but since you're asking about her stun specifically, i'll be brief:\n\nEven though it's unreliable, it's not something that you as an opponent can stop from happening; the only \"positive\" situation for you is that, if you're running away low on health rather than trying to fight her, she has less stopping power, it's \"just\" a slow, but when laning or fighthing her or whatever you can't do anything about it, she WILL stun you (unless she completely curb stomps you, and even then she can still stun you because it stuns even if you're both on 100% health). As such, since there's no sure fire way to avoid it, i think it lasts too long - especially considering how much damage irelia deals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-08-12T06:18:09.051+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's more a case that Irelia stunning you for outplaying her is simply something that feels wrong in principle. You got ahead, you should be beating her, not the other way around.\n\nNow, if it were a Snare instead of a Stun, it'd be reasonable, as you could at least shoot back at her. Or if the Stun couldn't last longer than 1 second, it'd be acceptable. But being stunned for 2 seconds while being on a pretty good cooldown is just painful.\n\nOr maybe a little bit of both Stun/Snare. Maybe it could be \"stuns for the first half, snares for the second half\".

Not in the sense that having .1% less than their health should be justification of a 2 second stun, but in that the amount of health missing should dictate the length. Not by a heavy amount, like the .1% would still stun, but only for a jiffy (enough for an AA to get through, say). \n\nInversely, if her health is just .1% OVER the target's health percentage, Irelia should get a slow that is **longer** than what she has now. That slow length should decrease with the more health she has on her opponent, fitting the theme of balance.\n\nidk just my two cents I like her alot, I think her ratios are fine, it's just it's a little too easy to get away after a trade with a massive stun that even allows me to get a couple autos in before Q-ing to a minion away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2015-08-12T05:32:01.088+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"The fact that it's a stun if you're both at equal % health is definitely not fun to play against.

Do you have any suggestions for how it should work? Or at least what specifically is broken about it?\n\nimo, it shouldn't work based solely on her percentage of missing health. due to her kit having access to so much raw damage and tenacity, she's allowed to become extremely tanky, hard to lock down and even harder to duel. there's no reason a triforce-tank irelia with a quarter of her health missing should be able to stun a squishy full-health champion for two seconds given the fact that she can repeatedly close the gap with bladesurge on minions until she's in range of her target.\n\nas for how it should work... uhhhh... this is a tough one to tackle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drey Gasai","date":"2015-08-12T20:47:56.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hJJ3JFJc,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2015-08-12T05:20:28.412+0000)\n>\n> Irelia's stun has had its paradigm since she was created as far as I know.

Do you have any suggestions for how it should work? Or at least what specifically is broken about it?\n\nI think something as powerful as Irelia's stun shouldn't be a point and click. Seeing as she's the \"Will of the blades\", how about she sends one of her blades ahead a certain distance. She would use her \"force\" and just plant it into the ground ahead of her. The aiming reticle thingy would look like Aatrox's q, just not a gap closer. Instead of the low/high hp thing she has, if it hits someone on the inside it would stun, and on the outside it would slow. The range would have to be pretty short considering her love of dashing. Anyway, that's an idea I had for her. One of the worst things about fighting irelia is knowing that she will just e > auto you 3 times with w on if you have more hp. With a skill shot on that strong of a skill, some counter play could be introduced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Failbot Deploy","date":"2015-08-12T13:05:23.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is either the duration or the cooldown that is broken. The balance team seemed to have problems with long point and click stuns (Rammus, Taric, etc.), but it's okay on Irelia, even though her DPS is wtf levels higher than those two combined. That, combined with an inability to cc her back effectively to kill her (passive) makes it incredibly frustrating to counterplay, especially given the circumstances where she can bladesurge a couple of times and be on the squishies, cc them to death since it only takes 1 second of her beating on them to die, and still find an easy way out.\n\nI'd say increase the cooldown. 8 seconds for a 2 second stun is just absurd. With CDR it can be 5 second CD. 40% uptime essentially on a point and click stun on a tanky fighter assassin character. I'd say it isn't a stun, but Irelia players never play with more health than you, but they can outtrade so heavily in those 2 seconds.\n\nEdit: Didn't know it was 425 range. WTF is that? Shouldn't it be really close to her AA range? No wonder she can close on squishies with no punishment. Can't kite her since the range is basically AA range for most marksmen.

It is a stun, but it is single-target, melee, and requires her own health to be low to even work. The only thing that makes it seem long to some is that everyone feels they have such a strong need to duel with her, in my opinion. She doesn't even have the burst to harass most of the time, and you're free to pelt away at a distance, and run at your whim. There are a number of champions like that, but she actually stuns while pecking slowly, which makes her CC feel particularly strong, as opposed to champions that simply clear that last chunk of HP instead, like Darius, Garen, Gangplank, and Nidalee.
