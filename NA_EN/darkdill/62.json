Varus used to do this, though not for noble reasons (he just wanted revenge), and now he&#039;s all Darkin stuff. As for Kassadin, his lore is too old, so I say he doesn&#039;t count.\r\n\r\nTo that end, I&#039;d absolutely love it if we had a new Champion, preferably a Demacian, who ends up filling the Dark Knight niche.
