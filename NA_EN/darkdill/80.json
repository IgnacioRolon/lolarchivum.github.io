The way it works is as follows.\n\n>**Q - Regrowth**\nHeal target ally over 20 seconds. 5 second cooldown. Does not stack.\n\n>**W - Moonfire**\nDeal weak magic damage in a small area and reveal enemies struck a short time. Allies with an active Regrowth are healed for X health for each enemy Hero hit by Moonfire.\n\nBy itself, Regrowth will not heal very effectively due to spreading its healing over such a long duration, but when you apply it to multiple allies and then start hitting enemies with Moonfire it becomes very effective.\n\nSoraka presently tries to do an inverse of this with her Rejuvenation effect along with sacrificing her health to heal allies, but this constantly leaves her in &quot;balance sensitive&quot; situations where a slight buff can make her broken. I think that if she were reworked (AGAIN) to use a style similar to Malfurion, it could promote some much healthier gameplay, requiring you to be aggressive to get real mileage out of your healing.","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-04-15T07:04:50.908+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Originally Soraka had a heal over time and it was more fair in lane.

Every time DoTs are mentioned, Riot repeatedly says how the effects are poorly visible and how they don't really see the gameplay in them, which is why Swain was reworked to lose practically all of the damage over time from his kit. On the few occasions when they were questioned on healing over time, Riot has said the same thing.\n\nPart of the problem here is that Heroes displays DoTs and HoTs with much more clarity than League: in Heroes, any kind of health change over time is clearly displayed on a hero's health bar, whereas in League, there's no such indicator, with Gray Health being only small and situational progress towards that territory. As such, damage and healing in Heroes is always visible, even when it's delayed or staggered over time, because you will always be able to see its full impact, which also leads to this natural subset of gameplay where healing over time is the perfect \"cure\" to damage over time. By contrast, League can't do this yet, because unless a DoT or HoT operates in large chunks per interval, it's not going to be easy to spot. As such, it might be worth updating health bars further so as to be able to reintroduce damage and healing over time in League, in such a manner that it would always be appreciable to all players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JustaNewb","date":"2018-04-15T06:05:33.349+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"So... the Original Soraka?","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2018-04-15T06:14:15.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, not the same thing.","replies":[{"poster":"JustaNewb","date":"2018-04-15T07:30:18.862+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"She had a HOT that was amplified by her Starfall, that did low damage in a wide area.

For a time, I thought Soraka's health costs were a good way of introducing risk, but in practice, Soraka slowly damaging herself has only pushed her to become more passive, and to cheese those costs with regeneration items she shouldn't ever be touching in the first place. In the end, Soraka's healing is still boring and uninteractive, even if there's now this extra layer of complication that does little to make her more fun to play as or against. By contrast, Malfurion's recent rework gave him this tremendously unique gameplay where he has to juggle marking allies and spamming spells against opponents (especially with Moonfire being a lot like Soraka's old Q) in order to power his healing. In general, I feel League could take a page out of Heroes when designing its supports, not necessarily by making everyone a healer (that's a whole other can of worms), but by updating the design of several older supports to have actual gameplay systems and inbuilt challenges, rather than just on-demand blanket protection and free stats for the marksman.\n\nWith Soraka, I think it might be time to remove the health cost mechanic, and instead have her power her healing through participation. If Soraka's offensive abilities and/or basic attacks built up this reservoir of power that she could spend to massively empower her next heal, or if she marked targets so that they'd get healed when she fights, as mentioned in the OP, she'd become significantly more interactive, and would be prevented from simply hanging back and healing without having to participate first.","replies":[{"poster":"FakeGravity","date":"2018-04-15T16:07:29.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i remember when was even worst, she use to be like tahm kench, you focus her she heal herself being impossible to kill, you focus anyone else and soraka just heal that person denying you \ncurrent soraka does suffer from lack of interaction, maybe if they could rework her heal and passive into something like malfurion example then make her a more rewarding champion things would change","replies":[{"poster":"2Charmnot2Charm","date":"2018-04-15T20:59:25.788+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget her old heal also gave 50 armor.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BLIGHTBRINGER","date":"2018-04-15T06:35:25.315+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thing is, there's a reason as to why Soraka's heal was changed from the heal over time to what she has now.
