While I grant you that many champions are... um... strongly inspired by real world things a lot of the time, I would ask if maybe you'd want to think about this character archetype in terms suited to Runeterra (or Ionia specifically) instead of real world things like the Shinto religion.\n\nFor example - you mentioned that Ionia probably has temples - and it absolutely does!  But I'd caution against assuming that those temples are carbon copies of Japanese places of worship - instead, what would the guardian of an _Ionian_ temple be like?  What would _their_ ceremonial clothing signify based on Ionian ideals, rather than anything specifically real-world (or real world myths and stories).  What forces and challenges have helped form their priorities.\n\n**Usual disclaimer that I am not a Rioter who works on League directly** - so I can't help much - but I can recommend taking a closer look at what you find appealing about the archetype and looking at it through a League lens.  Is it the dedication to quiet service that appeals?  Magic use through the written word?  The costume?  (Problematic).\n\nI'm no expert on Japanese culture, so I can't go into more detail on the pertinent details of what makes a Miko and what elements of the archetype would inspire a League character, and what other inspiration points it might work well with.  \n\nFor examples - \n\n* Does it have to be female?  \n * Would the guardians in Ionian temples be as likely to be male as female (or neither).  \n* Does it have to be young?  \n * Could it be something that very old Ionians dedicate their final years to guarding - because the evils held captive within corrupt those nearby, shortening their remaining days.\n* Does it even have to be Ionian?\n * What would the guardian of a Demacian official temple look like?  How about the guardian of a run-down and near-forgotten Zaun temple?  Do they even have temples? \n\nI know it may seem unfair for me to ask _you_ these questions, but these are the sorts of questions I'd be asking _myself_ if I were trying to come up with a champ concept.","replies":[{"poster":"GenoXx","date":"2015-09-02T02:22:40.309+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You come here and discuss with threads like theses for a reason......\nEspecially when it's world building related......What are you guys plotting?

If only Riot had this kind of Ambition\n\nThey only need a business incentive to trek into different game development waters. Despite LoL being this super massive and successful game, its probably the main reason why we wont see any new games from Riot (large games, not counting the mobile ones cause those dont take much development time and are simple in design).  I mean I have to mention Blizzard, cause duh, they are company that is successful  with multiple games for many years and are sticking with those games and those game genres they are currently in. Why arent we seeing another Warcraft Strategy game, well its because WoW is so successful and takes the main stage in development for the Warcraft series. Plus they already have a successful strategy game, Starcraft 2. That game doesnt need another game to compete with it in the same market. \n\nNow League of Legends and Riot games have another key aspect about their game, and that is obtaining the game and playing it is for free (with the added ) and is because it is free it grew into this monster with a massive player base to boast around. But the company in general isnt that large, or organized. So the option of them creating another game that has the same development requierments as say Mass Effect to ive an example is not something Riot is prepared to do. They dont have the budget, the manpower, or the necessary skill leaders to undertake a new genre of the AAA nature. And as somebody probably pointed out, they dont have to, they are content with the current state because they are getting a stable income from the popularity of their game and the constant patching and updates are basically what keeps any Multiplayer Online game upfloat and thriving.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GenoXx","date":"2015-09-02T16:12:15.511+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quiet.
