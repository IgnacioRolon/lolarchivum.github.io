Suggest seeing if you can find something your concept can offer to a team that no other champ brings. Unique niches help avoid 'better or worse version of champion X' syndrome and give people another reason to be excited about a kit.\n2. Off reading through the skill descriptions I'd expect players to build a champion with that kit pretty tanky (E and R especially offer very strong incentives to stay right in the midst of things). That seems at odds with the thematic you're looking to capture however. \n3. Suggest looking out for any opportunities to remove mechanics that don't drive interesting decisions and instead put that power into places that do. The CD reduction on the ult for example will, best case scenario, only ever offer -25s off a 60s CD, and that's assuming you aced the enemy team, had max CDR, max rank ult and got assist markers on every enemy champion. Even then there's not much gameplay to be had from that mechanic existing - there's little way for the player to really take advantage of it, it's something that'll just happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2014-11-17T15:35:14.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I think about the dancer class in various videogame, i think the two series who do pretty well with the concept are fire emblem and etrian odyssey.\n\nThey both propose a character very fragile (they are often oneshot if in front of the battle) but who buff their ally so much than having them in the team is a big +.\n\nSo, in league, if a dancer should be made, the only role I can see it is as a support.\nTo make a niche, i would probably turn him around the concept of \"provide cdr for ally\" mage who, by using his most powerfull abilities, either debuff himself (ms lower, armor lower,...) or sacrifice his mana pool (for exemple 20% mana for 10% cdr on an ally)\n\nI will also give the champion only one damage ability (like zilean) to put the \"I'm here to buff/help you to attack more\" before anything else in the champ feeling.\nFor other spell, except the cdr to ally probably for the ulti, something around cc transfert (ex: remove the cc on an ally and put it on himself for the full duration) and another with mana transfert would probably fit the character in the \"I give all i have to you\" (but no heal ability to not step on soraka territory)","replies":[{"poster":"0fficerJenny","date":"2014-11-17T20:47:34.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> When I think about the dancer class in various videogame, i think the two series who do pretty well with the concept are fire emblem and etrian odyssey.\n> \n> They both propose a character very fragile (they are often oneshot if in front of the battle) but who buff their ally so much than having them in the team is a big +.\n> \n> So, in league, if a dancer should be made, the only role I can see it is as a support.\n> To make a niche, i would probably turn him around the concept of \"provide cdr for ally\" mage who, by using his most powerfull abilities, either debuff himself (ms lower, armor lower,...) or sacrifice his mana pool (for exemple 20% mana for 10% cdr on an ally)\n> \n> I will also give the champion only one damage ability (like zilean) to put the \"I'm here to buff/help you to attack more\" before anything else in the champ feeling.\n> For other spell, except the cdr to ally probably for the ulti, something around cc transfert (ex: remove the cc on an ally and put it on himself for the full duration) and another with mana transfert would probably fit the character in the \"I give all i have to you\" (but no heal ability to not step on soraka territory)\n\nIn final fantasy tactics all the dancers abilities were to give the enemies debuffs.\nI think this could work really well also.

That is, their abilities are basically elements or forms or runes or sigils that are stacked and combined, only to be discharged in some way when a cap is hit or the player likes what they've made.\n\nSay, for instance, there was the Dancer champ. Q was a spin that dealt a small amount of damage in an area, W was a leap that functioned as a dash and could maybe cross the smallest of walls, E was some other movement (maybe a Plie that 'anchored' their stance, increasing defenses), but R would take the various dance moves that were done and perform some large, more complex maneuver that combined the effects and the order of those effects into some larger, more effective dance that could be directed as it unfolded.\n\nThis sort of thing could probably work more easily in a magical/elemental sense - combine effects to make more interesting, differently-shaped, differently functioning effects like Fire + Water = Steam - but I imagine there would be a lot of possible applications for a system that let multiple smaller actions/abilities grow into something greater than the sum of its parts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tortferngatr","date":"2014-11-17T07:04:06.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AFAIK, Riven was sort of intended to fill the assassin/light fighter \"battle dancer\" role already, and her autoattack/ability weaving does sort of resemble some sort of dance flow.
