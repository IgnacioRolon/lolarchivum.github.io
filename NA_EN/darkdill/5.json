Sylas looks like your average Kratos knockoff and he doesn't sound like a peaceful charming guy either. The fact that Lux even talked to this guy is enough to show her naive curiosity, given the world she lives in. Pretty sure Sylas is a murderer, given his goals. There is no way in hell i would forgive someone like that with that kind of a power complex. He's basically God-King Darius in-lore and Lux has that \"Curious hopeful 10-year old with SPARKLI POWEEER <3\" built around her. Even her voice actor sounds exactly how i'd imagine Lux to sound like but that's beyond the point.\n\nPoint being, you can guess Lux's entire motif just by looking at her at a glance. She feels very generic, with the only interesting aspect about her character being her relation with Demacia and her family in relation to her powers, not her own character.","replies":[{"poster":"Cetri","date":"2019-01-12T00:13:01.469+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a problem because.... she trusted a guy whose position she could VERY EASILY have been in were it not for sheer luck and the influence of her family?

They probably knew each other for several months, and struck up a friendship during that time. You seem to think she maybe came to visit him once or twice, whereas i feel it was significantly more than that. On top of that, as I have said repeatedly, _she could very easily be in chains herself_. If the wrong people found out about her, she'd certainly be imprisoned or worse. _Him being locked up for being a mage is no reason to not trust him_.\n\n> Oh an out of context ad-hominem deleting the part where i said &quot;If that person went around slaughtering everyone&quot; which means innocent people too.\n\nI see you're electing to ignore the part where I addressed that Sylas likely _isn't_ \"slaughtering everyone.\"\n\n> Because juveniles on the Boards just can&#x27;t contain themselves, huh? \n> \n> Well enjoy your report, ironically because in case you&#x27;re too stupid to spot the irony, it&#x27;s because you started insulting me before i ever said anything about you, meaning you&#x27;re metaphorically the &quot;bloodthirsty&quot; one.\n\nWhat.

I mean, he would have been hanged if he didn't kill those people! His faults are more in the fact he wanted to use her to escape in the first place but even then I bet she's torn on this. She knows far too well how it feels being \"caged\" just because.. you have magic within you (even if hers was not a literal cage). I suppose she would feel really broken about this because at the end of the day all this situation wouldn't have happened if Demacia didn't have this anti-magic stance in the first place, at the same time you can't just forgive and forget a mass murder ..","replies":[]},{"poster":"ï¬oo","date":"2019-01-11T08:40:51.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really depends on the person, doesn't it?

Sylas is, in my opinion, every nightmare, every feeling of hatred, despair, depression, dislike, distrust, sorrow, regret, and fear that exists in the Core of Lux's character--that is, her dislike for what she is, her hatred for her lack of full control, and her fear that one day her power will escape her control and actually hurt someone. Using **her** power, Sylas **hurt** people. He **killed** people. With **her** power.\n\nAs someone who didn't have to resort to violence to make herself known, I don't believe that Lux has any positive feelings for him. I don't even believe that she has any negative feelings for him. Not only did he betray her, but he caused her to betray herself in the worst way. Yes, she led to his escape and him hurting people, but he also led to **her powers hurting people**.\n\nHe broke all the effort she ever put into bettering herself for her people. If she sees him, pretty sure she's going to completely obliterate him. To obsolve herself. To save her people. And to save him from himself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2019-01-11T02:56:45.786+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sylas and Lux are diametrically opposed which is probably why they are involved at all when in my opinion Sylas's bio makes Luxs' lore messy from a timeline point-of-view\n\nIt's worth it for the metaphor though\n\nShe's the squeaky clean idealized mage that Demacia could perhaps one day swallow and he completely validates Demacias' fear. It's not even an issue of meeting Sylas's demands anymore because there's no guarantee that he would even stop.

That's just his kind of magic, some kind of redirection. To hate or fear him for that alone would make her no different from those who would hate her for her light. He used what he was born with.\n\n>Would he try to take her away from her responsibilities and get her to join his revolution?\n\nProbably. He would then see it's impossible to recruit her and think that her power is going to waste, but still choose to keep her magic a secret (despite the upheaval it would cause) in accordance with his special interactions with her. I believe that it's because he does truly respect and care for her in a way, as the only kind person who gave him a chance and a fellow mage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Breezy Boyy","date":"2019-01-11T02:48:36.334+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like she'd be a bit mortified honestly.
