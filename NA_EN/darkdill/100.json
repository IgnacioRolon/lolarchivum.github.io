But what do you think, Meddler? Would a Zerg-esque Champion be too much for this game (or make Blizzard mad)?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo address some concerns, here are some core elements to a swarmer&#039;s minions (I&#039;ll call them Broodlings here) I&#039;d have in mind:\r\n\r\n- Broodlings do not cause unit collision except with each other; Champions can walk right through them at all times.\r\n- Broodlings are melee, very fragile, and expire after a few seconds.\r\n- Broodlings attack the closest enemy, and DO NOT prioritize enemy Champions.\r\n- Broodlings die upon attacking structures.","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-04-19T20:59:22.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you see it say anywhere in his new kit that he's limited to a max of 3 voidlings at once?\n\nFor maximum voidlings, you cast visions on a champion standing right next to you, followed immediately by W. Each time a new voidling attacks that champion, another will spawn, up until the last few seconds of the duration. There doesn't appear to be a hard cap on them, but realistically I'd say 5-7 at max.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cloud273","date":"2016-04-19T20:47:29.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We already have a swam champ.

RIOT is free to add a swarm minion champ if they so desire, and is something that they are likely interested in for the future. I know I would like it a lot.\n\nI could easily see it as fitting a battlemage archetype, with a focus on constant pushing power but shorter range, and possibly an ult that gives sieging strength (larger broodling(s) that tank or damage turrets well). Broodlings could be weaker after leaving a certain distance from the caster to promote more interactive gameplay patterns, or require close-range upkeep/buffs to keep them as effective.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WinBoat","date":"2016-04-19T20:37:59.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick could end up the swarm champion.

If that Voidling kills a unit, or attacks a champion, large monster, or epic monster, another Voidling is spawned with the same remaining duration as the one that spawned it. New Voidlings are not summoned from existing ones with less than a few seconds remaining in their duration.\n    When 3 or more Voidlings exist at the same time, they all gain 100% Attack Speed.\n    Voidlings' attacks deal a percentage of Malzahar's Total AD as physical damage plus magic damage equal to a percentage of Malzahar's AP plus a base amount based on spell rank.\n    Voidlings prefer to attack enemies affected by Nether Grasp, followed by champions affected by Malefic Visions, followed by other units affected by Malefic Visions, followed by the nearest visible enemy to them.\n        Note: Voidlings no longer react to Malzahar's auto attacks. I know some of you will be upset by this, but I cannot make them strong if they are simply always attacking exactly what you want them to without opponent play available. You can, of course, get around this by using Nether Grasp or Malefic Visions on priority enemies, or also by positioning yourself such that the Voidling is closest to the enemy you want it to attack.\n        Note: Voidlings no longer have a leash/returnTP range. Historically, Voidlings would leash back to Malzahar if they ventured too far from him, and they would teleport to him if he teleported. This is no longer the case.\n    Voidlings gain 100% Movement Speed when chasing enemies affected by Nether Grasp or Malefic Visions.\n    Voidlings gain Health per Malzahar's level, not Void Swarm (W)'s spell rank.","replies":[]}]}
