I'd argue that it's the best of the FF series, but I don't want to get into a flaming war, so let's just say it's the best to me.\n\nSample of said music? This.  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSUgvs0UK50  \nGODLY.\n\n\n\nIf you've ever played this gem, you'll know what I mean. If not, go find an SNES emulator, a rom of FFIV (get an English translation of the Japanese version), and play it. You'll thank me later.\n\nAs for this topic, what's your favorite moment of FFIV? For me, it's hard to call, but I'd have to say when Rydia returns and saves the party from Golbez. That is an EPIC moment for my favorite green-haired Summoner.\n\nAnd in terms of relation to League, Riot should really look at making a Dark Knight Champion.

It shouldn't really be a spoiler at this point.)*","replies":[{"poster":"cautomaton","date":"2014-05-29T17:38:36.993+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed. Great game, though I've only played it on iOS. I missed it the first time around on SNES. I do have a SNES emulator for my Fire TV, though.

Best version, IMO.\n\nProblem with the US version (which is named Final Fantasy II, and is the \"Easy Mode\" version) is that it removes various gameplay bits, such as Cecil's Darkness ability.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-05-29T18:49:53.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the PSP version had the darkness ability intact.

In the original JP SNES version, it deals damage to all enemies at the cost of Cecil's health; in some other versions, it increases Cecil's attack power at a cost of health per attack.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-05-30T02:13:07.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure the PSP version is an AOE attack.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dvolt","date":"2014-05-29T16:46:22.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, the legality of emulating a game is always under question, seeing as Square Enix still sells copies of their Final Fantasy games, be it through ports to mobile systems or via things like PSN/Virtual Console. With that in mind, I think it's fair to say that these games still make some money to this day. So I'll have to say don't promote emulation here. \n\nBut yes, the music is gorgeous. I do approve of the music, though \"Dancing Mad\" holds a special place in my heart for it's absurd length and awesome name. \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbXVNKtmWnc\n\nThough, on the note of 4/Whatever number it is, I think the most amazing moment I've heard of was a friend who went through the game maxing out Cecil, then crying when he got reset as a Paladin. The moral here is that unless you only have one character, don't max them out by them selves.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2014-05-29T17:41:31.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True enough on the legality of emulation, but my point is that Nintendo doesn't sell SNES's anymore. They're only selling modern versions of FF4 at the moment on PSP's, Wii's, and iOS platforms. Square Enix doesn't stop various websites from hosting the ROMs for SNES versions of the game, so it's safe to say they don't really care.\n\nAlso, just because I've suggested the idea of emulating the game doesn't mean the reader has to do it. It's their call.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tiropat","date":"2014-05-30T06:25:04.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel sad that FFT isn't your favorite FF game imo it had a great story, unique game mechanics (delayed spell casting with meaningful tradeoffs anyone?), and had a great sound track.
