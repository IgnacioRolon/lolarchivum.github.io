DOTs need to be really unique/strong to be satisfying and Neurotoxin/Venomous Bite are pretty simple spells with nothing to them outside of damage (and the gapclose on Venomous Bite obviously), so they're not fun enough to justify DOT - they need the instant \"omg so much damage\" gratification to be satisfying. On the other hand, even something like Cass Q has the \"yay skillshot\" fun and the great feeling of the speed boost, Malz E has the bounce mechanic and obscene damage, Malz ult is overall really fun, and so on.

Thematically I would agree that she's lacking, even Cocoon which technically fulfils the \"trap them in your web\" thing doesn't do it in a very spider-y way.\n\nBalance-wise Elise is quite a bit better than her reputation suggests. Her problem with balance is entirely down to how strong she is in co-ordinated play and if it weren't for that, she'd be considered balanced 90% of the time. There's nothing in her kit that actually reads \"either way too strong or shit\" (unless you disagree?), it's just that as long as she's at all good she's going to be a popular LCS pick and people will always register someone as OP when they're competitively viable. Elise has only been broken outside of coordinated play on two brief occasions over the last year - immediately after her major buffs last summer, and immediately after the release of Runic Echoes. Outside of that and the last few months before her buffs, she's spent the majority of the last year in a \"usable but not overpowered\" state. The mage update shouldn't affect her too much either given that it's primarily focused on mana itemisation which is irrelevant to her.\n\nTo make Elise more thematic you'd need a massive, ground-up rework. Given she's a pretty healthy champion in most ways and is considered fun by a decent chunk of the community, that seems like a bad idea. To make her more balanceable they'd probably just need to make her kit less valuable in coordinated play and more valuable in disorganised play because the gap between a Silver Elise and a Challenger Elise is what causes pretty much all of her balance problems. That'd probably not be the easiest thing in the world though.","replies":[{"poster":"Thales","date":"2016-03-29T00:37:38.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did mean for competitive — I'm never scared to face an Elise (or a Lee Sin or a Nidalee) on the ladder.

I just don't want all that crowded out by a slightly evasive AP fighter.\n\nRiot seem somewhat happy to have competitive-exclusive champions but it is a pity. What I will say for Elise is that pretty much every balance change she's received from 2015-onwards has been either a bigger buff for low ELO Elise than high ELO Elise or a bigger nerf for high ELO Elise than low ELO Elise, so the gap between the two has shrunk a bit, but the difference is clearly still there and unhealthy to her performance in both types of play. Not something a full on rework is needed for, just a decent bit of tuning. It's tuning I imagine Riot is unwilling to do, though. \n\nMy personal opinion is that as long as a champion isn't a disaster it's not really justifiable to delete their old kit for almost any reason, particularly something as flimsy as thematics. Thematics contribute to being fun but Elise is already pretty popular so she's clearly succeeded in being an enjoyable champion as is despite her weak theme. On top of this, going very far with the spider theme is tricky as spiders are rather niche appeal at best - Elise was actually deemed too creepy due to her SFX in development and had to be toned down because of that, so I'd be cautious of really uping the ante here. Elise has some pretty unique mechanics and a somewhat unique place in the game (one of the only AP junglers and one of the only AP fighters in the game) so deleting that would sacrifice a lot more of value than is typical for VGUs. Elise is worlds apart from ... anyone that's ever gotten a full gameplay update.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2016-03-28T21:57:58.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually comparing her human Q to her spider Q.

Now she doesn't really have that major defining trait.  Hitting that Q isn't satisfying anymore as it is basically a check skill to set up her cougar form.\n\nUnfortunately I don't think designing transform champions to be satisfying without transforming is a good idea. As far as I'm aware, Jayce was designed to be a transform champion that was designed to transform to fit different situations/games, but didn't necessarily need to use both forms to achieve a good result. The result of that design is that he spends the vast, vast majority of his time in ranged form despite a variety of incentives to use his melee form (mana return, resistance steroids) and when he was at his best, it felt like both forms were good enough to be individual champions on their own. On top of that, it meant crafting basically no synergy between his two forms which makes one wonder why he transforms at all and leaves him lacking a single satisfactory combo. While Elise and Nidalee can certainly feel linear (the ranged > melee combo is repetitive), it a) makes sure they're making use of the entirety of their kits to do their job b) introduces risk to their kits (they need to take risk to get their highest rewards) c) makes the transform aspect of their kit satisfying and sensible and d) makes \"I caught this champion in the wrong form\" a useful thing to have done.\n\nTo be clear, my experience with both Elise and Nidalee is that neither of them feel like they need to transform to do their job in every situation. Nidalee has sieging as a major strength which is primarily a ranged endeavour, but when it comes to roaming around the map, cougar is the one for the job. Elise if looking for picks, peeling or sieging, will spend extended durations in human form, but will use spider form for travelling the map, finding squishies that are particularly incapable of fighting back, and melting tanky targets (this is primarily post-Rylai's admittedly). To combo someone they absolutely have to do a set combo (which I would argue is healthy and fun), but neither individual form is lacking in \"can be useful on its own\" situations. Jayce I do not believe has any incentive to run around in melee form unless farming in an empty lane.\n\nRegarding the dilution of power budget versus concentration of power into one skill, that is an issue but not too big an issue IMO. Nidalee's spears are arguably too weak to be defining anymore but you'd hope that players would enjoy how her whole kit works together. Elise has Cocoon which feels kit-defining without being kit-dominating and Jayce has his EQ combo but I would hazard a guess at that fitting into the \"overwhelms the rest of the kit\" category.\n\nIn the end I think transform champions just have different appeal to non-transform ones. Someone who loves combo-oriented play and \"do one thing right, then go in\" champions will love people like Elise because a EQWRQW combo is button-mashing madness. This is especially true if you actually like the theme of \"Hi I'm a lady-HA I'M ACTUALLY A MONSTER DIE\". Having a major iconic ability isn't necessarily something everyone finds essential either - some people will be more interested in a high moment with a whole kit working together (Nidalee's cougar form combo) than one ability being particularly amazing. It's probably OK if transform champions don't have the same appealing factors that more normal champions do as long as long as they have other fun traits instead (which they do) and people like them. For people who don't like transform champions, there are 120+ champions who don't transform.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2016-03-29T02:59:25.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Unfortunately I don't think designing transform champions to be satisfying without transforming is a good idea.\n\nI see what you are getting at here but overall it feels to me that for both of them, pressing R is basically to extend a combo from human to animal form.

As I said in my original post, I think Elise and Nidalee both have that in different ways - admittedly heavily weighed towards their human forms. It could be a bigger thing for them, but that leads to people like Jayce who rarely transform and that's not good either. \"I want to focus on X form for this game and build for that\" isn't something I really like the sound of, because it is basically just \"This champion is good in way more situations and is way more flexible than other champions\" which is something transform champions already tend to show - pretty sure all of them have been called overloaded at one point or another.\n\n> Interesting.
