Hopefully one day they do something about the system, but as it is that's the only way to deal with it.  Lately, I've been trying way too hard to stay positive and keep every comment as nice sounding as possible, and while it's certainly annoying and kinda painful to force yourself to speak nicely to a furious brat, it actually works sometimes, and that's better than any other approach I've seen. \n\nRiot won't do anything about your matchmaking no matter how unlucky you are.  I've spoken to support multiple times about having upwards of 80% troll games, and they just say \"sorry about your luck, keep trying to win and you'll get out eventually\".  Well, I doubt it, but I am trying, and that's all you can really do :)  That and don't rage on your team.  I'm sure it feels appropriate at times, but think about it.  Has anyone raging on their team ever produced even a remotely positive result?","replies":[{"poster":"Full AP Venusaur","date":"2014-08-19T05:20:48.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah 2 of my last 5 ranked games had an afk on my team.

You influence every game you are in, you are what all those games have in common. While some games are unwinnable, you could have made different choices in each one. Take something away from losses instead of blaming everyone else.\n\n3 Bronze mentality - Trying to give orders to your team is not leadership. Everyone is trying to win, most players will follow someone who is doing well and not being a jerk about others mistakes.","replies":[{"poster":"MEMEME670","date":"2014-08-19T00:12:13.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Seconding all of this.
