Since she doesn&#039;t, I&#039;m guessing there&#039;s something else to it.\n\nMy guess? Lux had some part to play in how Fiora&#039;s father was exposed as a fraud, and Fiora blames Lux (partially) for the shaming of her family&#039;s name as a result.\n\nAnyone want to chip in to this thought?","replies":[{"poster":"The Soulforged","date":"2015-08-14T01:08:31.627+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:114}} I know what you did that day.

Lux is gifted, born with a talent, and magic came to her naturally where as  Fiora who train hard to prove herself might resent/feel that Lux never really work for any of it. An example would be like from Naruto, Sasuke born talented and very skillful where as Naruto who was the the weakling who had to bust his ass to reach the other person level.
