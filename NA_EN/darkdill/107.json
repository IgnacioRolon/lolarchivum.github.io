Then when your teammate gets ambushed because he was spotted, you get blamed.\r\n\r\nPretty stupid, IMO.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, and let us tell our teammates \"That spot's warded\" in a hurry, we need a ping that says \"Warded\". In fact, I recall seeing some assets for that appearing once on PBE, but they were promptly removed and never seen again. What gives?\r\n\r\nAny context to why we don't have one yet, Riot?","replies":[{"poster":"Ceridran","date":"2015-03-25T17:31:49.302+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-03-26T00:59:57.946+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It just needs to be \"Ward\". \n\nDanger + Ward = enemy ward in the area\nAssist me + Ward = please ward this","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-03-25T20:57:55.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zerokk,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=V8KwNJk6,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-03-25T17:31:49.302+0000)\n>\n> Have one for warning about wards, and have another for requesting wards.\n\nThis.","replies":[{"poster":"ChromeFluxx","date":"2015-03-25T21:26:35.304+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yousosmart,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=V8KwNJk6,comment-id=000a0001,timestamp=2015-03-25T20:57:55.817+0000)\n>\n> This.\n\nYou could call it \"Warded\" and \"Ward it\" i know it sounds similar but that'd be fun","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ã…ron","date":"2015-03-25T19:29:50.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zerokk,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=V8KwNJk6,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-03-25T17:31:49.302+0000)\n>\n> Have one for warning about wards, and have another for requesting wards.\n\nThis","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Risurin","date":"2015-03-25T14:08:02.185+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"seen some people use the missing (question mark) on bushes to ask if warded, and the caution(the red one) to answer it is or the normal blue ping to say it isnt.\n\nbut i agree we could use a warded ping.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Richard","date":"2015-03-25T09:33:01.379+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with having a ward ping, I don't agree with having a marker stay there for a minute or so-- This just gives you too much information without having to really put any thought into it.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-03-25T22:33:42.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Markers would probably be a no-no, as ping-spammers could use it to clutter up their teammates minimaps as a form of griefing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MadCakes","date":"2015-03-26T16:20:26.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when i read the title, i thought u mean a ping that can ward places, that willl be so op","replies":[]},{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-03-25T16:19:44.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They gave fairly good context at the tie they brought it down.
