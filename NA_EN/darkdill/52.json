She differs from Rammus, Shen and Galio in that she&#039;s an AD-scaling Champion, not AR-scaling, and is less durable than they are in exchange for more firepower.\r\n\r\nOne of her skills, however, is one that I&#039;m concerned might break some Gameplay Design rules. Here is a rough description:\r\n\r\n>**Demacian Retribution**\r\nFire a skillshot that deals moderate physical damage to the first enemy it hits and Curses it for 3 seconds. Whenever a Cursed enemy performs a basic attack, it takes a small amount of physical damage _(this damage cannot kill, but will reduce the Cursed victim to 1 health if it would otherwise be lethal)_. Additionally, you gain bonus movement speed when moving toward a Cursed enemy Champion.\r\n\r\nI worry that this breaks the \"Burden of Knowledge\" rule, but given how some newer Champions (i.e. Rek&#039;Sai) have borderline broken that rule (i.e. crushing a Rek&#039;Sai tunnel will not stop her ultimate if she is already channeling on that tunnel), I have to ask whether or not a skill like this would be excusable.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-04-28T05:00:17.628+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems ok to me. Burden of Knowledge can be a problem if a gameplay mechanic isn't communicated well in game but a player would alter their behavior if they were aware of it. In the case of this ability you'd want to ensure the damage taken was clearly linked to the act of basic attacking to avoid any problems. Could do something like a spurt of blood from the attacker when they hit an enemy, or even a missile back from people they've hit that inflicts the damage, that sort of thing. Pair that with a really clear 'you are cursed' visual effect and this sort of mechanic should be clear enough.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-04-28T06:01:32.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Coolies.

This gives you the option to do something else if you think it would be less harmful.
