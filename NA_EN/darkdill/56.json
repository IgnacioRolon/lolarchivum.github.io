He goes that route with pretty much every champion, always going for the most obvious, cringeworthy insult possible, with the possible exception of maybe Leona/Diana.\n\nThe fact that they were going to imitate people like James Spader makes it even more painful, since that guy has so infinetly more wit than going \"neener neener\" half the time.\nHonestly, as far as taunts go, I'd consider Aurelion Sol only one step above Tahm Kench, as far as cringeworthiness goes.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kenanja","date":"2016-03-10T11:09:41.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes i agree, but i feel like Aurelion Sol should be wise and powerful enough where he doesn't need insults or threats.\n\nI would have loved for him to have similar personality as old Nasus, wise powerful and as taunt a simple \"Have it your way.\".
