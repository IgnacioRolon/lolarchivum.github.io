This means that the vision reduction is isolating you, but it isn't outright taking away your ability to fight back.\n\nIt works for Graves because he is both an ADC, the class that is naturally the squishiest in the game, and has a play style that generally wants him to get up close and personal. When you take both of these factors into consideration, Graves has to offer just as much in return to the opponent for that vision reduction.\n\nWhat it probably should never work on is a siege/long range mage. All that causes is that you can't see them while they poke you down presumably *outside of your vision*. You can't use your targeted spells on them for obvious reasons and it's ineffective to use skill shots because you're so prone to missing at that point.\n\nIt's entirely possible vision reduction may be introduced again in the future, however you really need to realize that the niches it can be allowed into the game while still being healthy from a balance point of view are few and far between, and both Nocturne and Graves are already taking 2 of these niches.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2014-08-06T03:47:11.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Short-range supports could have it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MarhsallLee67","date":"2014-08-05T20:25:28.574+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Similar to Blind, Block/Dodge, and projectile-blocking walls, if the vision reduction mechanic was made available to more champions, it would become a serious problem.

Dashes and MS steroids didn't use to be 'normal' or 'required' for certain types of champions. Even so, many of the popular/common picks have mobility as some part of their kit. If a champion does not have mobility, they better have CC. If they don't have either, they better be so good at something else that neither of those matter.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\nMobility replaced hard CC as the thing that isn't necessary for a team but so useful that you're probably better off picking someone that has it anyway. Look at this timeline <http://timeline.leagueoflegends.com/>. Start taking note from Xin Zhao onwards. Look for all the things that are relatively common in today's picks - steroids, knock-ups/backs, dashes, sustain, %HP damage, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Helios734","date":"2014-08-05T20:22:10.232+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"The same reason why only Teemo and Quinn have blinds to make a champion special in there own way","replies":[]},{"poster":"Helios734","date":"2014-08-05T20:21:10.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"same reason why only Teemo and Quinn have blinds to make a champion special and make reasons to play that certain champion","replies":[]}]}
