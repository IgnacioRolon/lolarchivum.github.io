Earth incentivizes teams to seige, water to poke, fire to fight, and air to split push. While these traits are simplified for the sake of this post, they each have a clear purpose. Reducing recall times would make it more powerful but it wouldn't open up much room for teams to plan around said bonus.\n\nLet's also take a look at the numbers that would be needed if this were implemented. Assuming that Riot allowed for the dragon recall buff and baron recall buff to stack, which would adhere to most of their other design principles, then the air buff has 4 seconds to work with. Let's assume a team were to get 3 air dragons and an elder dragon making the bonus 4.5 times its base value. That would mean that if a single air dragon granted a .89 second reduction, the team with those buffs would have instant recalls. Since instant recalls are never going to be a sign of good gameplay, the most a single air buff could reduce recall times by would be .75 seconds, and even then any champ's total recall time would be less than .75 seconds and still be an absurd amount of safety to provide. Teams likely wouldn't feel the effectiveness of a single buff much if it was .75 seconds or less, but that's what the numbers would need to be in order to avoid edge cases where it would become unbearable.\n\nI was thinking they could split the movement speed buff in half with one half working like the assassin mastery, having there be movement speed associated with no nearby allies being around. If you were split pushing you'd see no significant change in power, but people in-combat would still maintain half of the power the buff provides. Both good for split pushing and makes people able to recover from being caught out more frequently, but also allows people to attempt riskier tasks such as stealing buffs because if someone were to come try and stop them they'd still have half of the buff helping them since they were in combat at the time but alone. The air buff would go from it's current role of split pushing to an all around solo-champ speed boost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GankLord","date":"2016-05-22T17:20:28.502+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I'd say a small tenacity boost instead of  reduced recall time or ms.","replies":[{"poster":"Bloodsoaked Eve","date":"2016-05-22T18:13:40.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GankLord,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vXM6IGfq,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2016-05-22T17:20:28.502+0000)\n>\n> Honestly I&#x27;d say a small tenacity boost instead of  reduced recall time or ms.\n\ntenacity is a bad Idea. with the mastery you get 15% and boots add another 30% to that, making 45%. reducing ALL CC BY HALF.
