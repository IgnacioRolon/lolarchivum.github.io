Stuff like 80% resistance to CC, 500 AR/MR, extremely high regeneration, lots of AD/AP, etc. Basically, you are supposed to be unstoppable unless your opponents are good or have a composition with lots of suppression. And even then, some Champions would be 100% impossible to beat. Balanced? No, but why would you want it to be?\r\n\r\nOh, how the inner sadist in me would love stomping those trolls' heads into the pavement and leaving bloody footprints in my wake...\r\n\r\nThis would only work on Howling Abyss, or perhaps a new arena that is more like a small ring with few places to hide.\r\n\r\nWant to go troll-stomping? I do. I actually want to stomp on some of them in person, but this would suffice.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-07-29T10:04:48.130+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't mean to offend, but your overt enjoyment of violence (and your desire to enact RL violence) comes off as rather disturbing.\n\nOther than that, the game mode is inherently antithetical to the teamwork that makes up the core of the game. It seems like a glorification of the toxic \"I can 1v5 their whole team!\" attitude that pervades the game when a carry believes themselves to be above the rest of their team. \n\nWhy 9v1 when they can substitute that one person for a boss-like monster or Super Doom Bot?","replies":[]},{"poster":"AdaptiveCoffee","date":"2014-07-29T08:41:01.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">little black mark\n\nI'm asking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tau43","date":"2014-07-30T16:24:49.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make it like the Halo game type, he who slays the Juggernaut, becomes the Juggernaut.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hoi Im Temmo","date":"2014-07-29T18:06:19.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As interesting and fun as this would be....3 things.\n1) Your description of other players and the violence you describe, while possibly meant to be humorous...is odd, and awkward.\n2) I wont ask about the black mark...but if both teams are after you, while I cant judge, maybe you are actually doing something to cause it? Especially if its most games.\n\n3) It would be a 1v5 to be most balanced, with more starting gold, and a higher level.
