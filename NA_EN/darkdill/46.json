I feel Ashe has two distinct aspects to her identity the \"precise\" archer (aka crit and landing her stun), and the utility adc, which goes with her vision control, passive gold generation and her slows, which she sacrifices damage for. Will the latter be nixed in favor of focusing more on the former? I'd be very sad to see enchanted crystal arrow get changed, as that's one part of ashe's kit that has always been very dear to me. I would, however, like to see some of her power shifted away from her e and into her other abilities (or for that to be reworked entirely).
