Such a shame he had to get ousted by Vilemaw, right? Well, with the retcons going on, I think now's the perfect time to give this bad boy a new identity.\n\n---\n\n#**Ebonmaw, the Terror of Zaun**\nhttp://imgur.com/uKlkzLq  \nhttp://imgur.com/uWpehlk    \n(The above pictures are for reference only; I did not make them; credit goes to Nintendo and Retro Studios)\n\n**General Concept**\n>Ebonmaw is a melee fighter who, like Rumble, uses a Heat system to regulate his abilities. Compared to Rumble, Ebonmaw is more oriented toward using basic attacks than just spells, and excels at straight-up close combat. With natural bonus resistances and a powerful dive game, Ebonmaw can rip an enemy team to shreds rather quickly when he goes all-out.\n\n>Unlike Rumble, whose Danger Zone grants him bonus damage and potency on his abilities, Ebonmaw’s Danger Zone upgrades his abilities with bonus effects. This means that managing his Heat level is critical to success, as some of Ebonmaw’s capabilities are not available outside the Danger Zone. Consequentially, enemies can capitalize on Ebonmaw being out of the Danger Zone and try to take him out before he enters it.\n\n>While Overheating, Ebonmaw takes a tremendous risk, gaining a very powerful immolation effect, but also reducing his resistances for the duration and preventing him from using his abilities. This makes him easier to kill, but a serious damage threat, so Ebonmaw should only purposefully Overheat when he has the advantage. His Overheat, however, can let him shred jungle camps quickly, making him a potent jungler.\n\n>Ebonmaw gives the option of a very powerful dive fighter that works exceptionally well with AOE \"Wombo Combo\" Champions like Orianna, Malphite, etc. His ultimate can allow for powerful setups or work extremely well in conjunction with those who set his shot up for him, letting him bunch up the enemy team for an AOE beatdown. Being a heat user also gives him gameplay akin to Rumble, but in a much more autoattack-centric kit. As a last bonus, he's a full-fledged dragon, not some half-breed like Shyvana. ;)\n\n*Last Update: March 13, 2016*\n\n**Statistics** (numbers are subject to change; updated for Season 5)\n>HP: 595 - 2210\nHPR/5: 9.0 - 24.0\nDamage: 61 - 119\nRange: 150\nArmor: 26.9 - 85.4\nMagic Resistance: 32.1 – 53.4\nAttack Speed: 0.658 (+0% – 42.5%)\nMovement Speed: 350\n\n#Abilities\n\n(EXPECT CHANGES; NUMBERS ARE NOT FINAL)\n\n**NOTE!** - Ebonmaw, like Rumble, uses the Heat Resource.\n\n**P – Draconic Reactor**\n>Ebonmaw gains 10/20/30 bonus armor and magic resistance. (increases at levels 7 and 13, respectively)\n\n>Ebonmaw generates 2 Heat with each basic attack. Heat generated by basic attacks cannot exceed 80.\n\n>While in the Danger Zone, Ebonmaw’s basic abilities have bonus effects.\n\n>While Overheating, Ebonmaw gains an immolation effect that deals **20 + (5 X level)** magic damage per second (*ticks every 0.25 seconds*) to nearby enemies (175 range) for 6 seconds, increased by 1% for every 1% of Ebonmaw's missing health. Ebonmaw cannot cast his abilities and loses his bonus resistances for the duration of this effect.\n\n>*Maximum Magic Damage per second (at 1 health): 50-220*\n*Total Magic Damage: (150 - 300) - (660 - 1320)*\n\n**Q – Fission Breath**\n>Ebonmaw’s next basic attack breathes radioactive fire in a cone (500 range cone, 60 degrees), dealing 30/60/90/120/150 (+1.0 AD) physical damage to all enemies hit. Resets attack timer.\n\n>While in the Danger Zone, Fission Breath inflicts Severe Burns on enemies hit for 3 seconds. Enemies with Severe Burns take **20/35/50/65/80 to 40/70/100/130/160 (+0.1 AP)** bonus magic damage from Ebonmaw’s basic attacks based on the percentage of the target's missing health.\n\n>Generates 10 Heat. 5 second cooldown.\n\n**W – Meltdown**\n>Ebonmaw releases a burst of flame around himself, dealing 60/95/130/165/200 (+0.6 bonus AD) physical damage to nearby enemies (deals 25% bonus damage to monsters).\n\n>While in the Danger Zone, Ebonmaw gains 40/55/70/85/100% increased attack speed for 3 seconds if he hits an enemy with Meltdown.\n\n>Generates 10 Heat. 6 second cooldown. Can be cast while moving.\n\n**E – Terror Drive**\n>Ebonmaw leaps at target enemy (600 range), stunning it for 0.25 seconds and releasing a shockwave, dealing 50/90/130/170/210 (+0.5 bonus AD) physical damage to all nearby enemies (350 radius) on impact.\n\n>While in the Danger Zone, Terror Drive shields Ebonmaw for up to 50/90/130/170/210 (+15% of bonus health). Lasts 5 seconds.\n\n>Generates 10 Heat. 10 second cooldown.\n\n**R – Catastrophe**\n>Ebonmaw fires a skillshot in target direction (1100 range). If it hits an enemy Champion, it vacuums in all enemies near the point of impact (350 AOE radius) and deals 150/300/450 (+1.5 bonus AD) physical damage to all enemies hit. The target that was directly struck is stunned for 1.5 seconds.\n\n>If Catastrophe does not hit an enemy before reaching the end of its range, it still explodes and deals physical damage, but does not stun or vacuum.\n\n>No cost. 120/110/100 second cooldown.\n\n**Tips**\n>*Playing as Ebonmaw*\n- Wait for a teammate to immobilize an enemy before firing Catastrophe to ensure you get the vacuum effect.\n- Fission Breath resets your attack timer, so use it just after an attack to inflict surprising burst damage.\n- Staying in the Danger Zone will allow you access to the more powerful aspects of Ebonmaw's kit.\n- Items like Titanic Hydra and Frozen Mallet are great choices on Ebonmaw, drastically improving his staying power.\n\n>*Playing against Ebonmaw*\n- Most of Ebonmaw's power comes from when he is in the Danger Zone. Try to engage him before he enters it.\n- Ebonmaw has powerful engage and dive capabilities, but cannot retreat well. If he overextends, punish him for it.\n- Avoid clustering together to avoid being pulled together by Catastrophe.\n- If Ebonmaw is Overheating, his defenses become weaker and he cannot use his abilities. Capitalize on this whenever possible.\n\n**Champion Synergy/Difficulty**\n>*Champions who synergize with Ebonmaw*\n\n>{{champion:117}} - Lulu's entire kit can greatly benefit you. Whimsy makes engaging much easier, while Help, Pix! both protects you and improves damage output. Wild Growth combo'd with Terror Drive is devastating if you dive into a clumped-up group.\n\n>{{champion:54}} - Your ultimates work extremely well together. Malphite can initiate and set you up for Catastrophe, or you can cluster the enemy together with Catastrophe and set Malphite up for Unstoppable Force. Either way, this will leave the enemy ripe for a beatdown from the both of you.\n\n>{{champion:61}} - Get Orianna to tag you with Command: Protect before you dive, bunch up the enemy with Catastrophe, then Terror Drive in and let Orianna use Command: Shockwave. Your enemies aren't going anywhere, and should be Wombo Combo'd in short order.\n\n>*Champions Ebonmaw struggles against*\n\n>{{champion:122}} - Darius is obnoxious for most melees, but you in particular are ruined by him. Darius can outpower you, prevent you from retreating with Apprehend, and later on can effortlessly cut through whatever resistances you might have. He's also tanky enough to withstand whatever punishment you can throw at him long enough for him to stack up his passive for a good old decapitation.\n\n>{{champion:48}} - Trundle can deal with anything you can throw at him, siphoning your resistances with Subjugate and lowering your attack damage with Chomp. Pillar of Ice can be used either to disrupt your Terror Drive or prevent you from running if you make a bad engage. His invade potential also will mean trouble for your jungling. Expect to get Trolled BADLY by the Troll King.\n\n>{{champion:40}} - While Janna can't kill you easily, she presents a huge problem for your engages. Howling Gale can stop Terror Drive, while Monsoon can quickly derail any setup you make with Catastrophe. Eye of the Storm will also let her keep your targets alive long enough for them to kill you. You might have more success if you target her first instead of her teammates, but she's hard for you to catch too.\n\n**Background** (ROUGH; SUBJECT TO CHANGE)\n>Ebonmaw was once a notorious fire dragon who lived near Zaun who, after a century of roosting near the technological city, was slain by dragon hunters. His remains were brought to Zaun, where the scientists sought to resurrect the dragon in the same way they had reanimated Urgot.\n\n>With Ebonmaw’s body mostly broken, the scientists replaced many of his body parts with Hextech and various weapons systems. The process took considerable time, but yielded what the Zaunites believed would be the ultimate weapon. Upon the completion of the augment process, necromancy was used to give the dragon new life.\n\n>Unfortunately, the scientists underestimated the will of a dragon’s soul. Ebonmaw was revived, but not as their thrall, and destroyed the lab in which he was recreated, killing everyone in the lab in the process. Blasting out of the destroyed lab, Ebonmaw flew to the highest skyscrapers in Zaun and claimed them as his new roost, and now dares anyone to challenge him.\n\n**Quotes** (in-progress; suggestions are welcome)\n>**Selection**\nAhh, more victims!\n**Movement**\nThe air is rank with fear.\nAshes rise in my wake.\nThese cretins disgust me.\nA dragon never relents in the hunt.\n**Attacking**\nBeg for mercy.

It's my victory!\n\n**Inspiration(s)**\n>My primary inspiration for the new Ebonmaw is, obviously, Ridley from the Metroid series. In Metroid Prime, Meta Ridley is easily the best boss in the game, and I wanted to bring that bad boy into League somehow.\n\n>Other inspirations include Predaking from Transformers Prime, and Beast Wars Megatron.\n\n**Login Theme** (Credit goes to Nintendo)  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90f9wfZKF9o\n---\n\nOpinions and suggestions are welcome.

He is a dragon that is called the terror of Zaun right? When dragons attack, they usually fly over attack, then turn around and fly over an attack again. This is a pattern that I think that you can use to strike terror into your enemies, what if he gains the special effects of danger zone if he has been out of the enemies sight radius for a while (or in a bush), when he re enters the enemies sight, all of the abilities will be available for the special attack, but he can only use one special per re entry. Then he'd have to leave again to get another special. This is terrifying b/c you know that every time Ebonmaw enters your sight, he going to hit you very hard, and you have a high chance of dying, this is balanced by the fact, that Ebonmaw must be out of sight for like 1 sec or way evs","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2014-11-24T00:04:06.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This suggestion seems more appropriate for an assassin than a fighter.

Good designs but not focused. \n\nRidley is a ruthless hunter. Not just mechanical. Even becoming Mechanical only gave him more tools to be a better ruthless hunter and predator, it didn't make him change his approach.

Good line of thinking.\n\nHowever, I do think that his basic skills, at least, fit for a fire dragon. Breathes fire, releases a flame nova, dives at you, etc. Shyvana does those things (in a sense), so why can't Ebonmaw?\n\nAlso, in terms of the ultimate, it'd be Ebonmaw making use of a new tool to become a deadlier threat. My vision presently for his ultimate, in a gameplay sense, is that he fires it into an enemy team, vacuums them together, then dives in and wails on them all at once.\n\nLastly, remember that this is a concept, and Riot usually has their own concepts go through dozens (if not hundreds) of iterations before even being made into a Champion.

What the crap?\n\nWell, even with Aurelion Sol coming out, I say more dragons would still be welcome, so I'm putting Ebonmaw forward again. And in doing so, I have some changes.\n\nFirst off, I'm making it so Ebonmaw's attacks now generate 2 Heat per attack. However, Heat generated by basic attacks can only take you up to 80 Heat in order to avoid cases of accidental Overheating from attacking too much. If you want to Overheat, you gotta use abilities, which results in more deliberate use of it.\n\nSecond, relating to the first change, all of Ebonmaw's basic abilities now generate 10 Heat instead of 20. I might be off in my numbers, though, so let me know if I should adjust things.\n\nThird is a change to Ebonmaw's E. I've never really liked the slowing effect on Terror Drive, so I've replaced its Danger Zone effect. Now when Ebonmaw dives, he gets a damage-absorbing shield that scales off bonus health. Again, numbers are probably off, but this means that Ebonmaw won't blow up as easily when he goes in. To compensate, however, the cooldown was increased to 10 seconds from 9 seconds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-10-14T06:09:03.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been a long while since I worked on Ebonmaw, and I need an opinion: do you think Ebonmaw should be designed as a fighter or as a juggernaut?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fowus","date":"2015-06-30T18:03:04.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"m","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-02-10T21:33:19.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another update.\n\nI felt the fire field from Ebonmaw's Danger Zone E wasn't the most appropriate thing, despite him being a fire dragon. It just felt like too many damage sources.\n\nNow Ebonmaw's Danger Zone E just slows all enemies it hits, but the slow is stronger now. This helps Ebonmaw keep his victims in place without being uncounterable. Also, Terror Drive now has a bit better base damage at higher ranks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2014-12-24T20:02:35.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update on Christmas Eve!\n\nEbonmaw's passive has lost its AP ratio entirely and a bit of base damage, but now increases in damage as Ebonmaw's health gets lower (ala Olaf). Now if he's almost dead, that immolation is going to ROAST YOU if you don't finish him off.\n\nFission Breath got its Danger Zone bonus damage reduced a little bit, but now deals greater damage to targets that are low on health. Now you have a much bigger reason to run away from Ebonmaw if he marks you when you're injured.\n\nLastly, I've given Meltdown bonus damage versus monsters to compensate for the strength of S5's jungle monsters. 25% bonus damage might seem high, but remember that Ebonmaw's Meltdown is physical, so it loses damage against jungle monsters unless he has flat armor penetration.\n\nFeedback on these changes would be appreciated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2014-12-05T23:22:15.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update!\n\nEbonmaw's base stats have been changed for S5's standards, but I'm probably off the mark on some of them.\n\nI've also nerfed Terror Drive a little in terms of base damage, bonus AD scaling, and halved its stun time on its primary target. However, I also modified the slow potency of the fire field effect, making it better at levels 4 and 5 (though worse early). I imagine this would make Ebonmaw's jungle ganks a tad less scary, especially if he has a red buff.\n\nI also slightly buffed Meltdown, increasing its bonus AD ratio to 0.6 from 0.5, compensating the nerf to Terror Drive. I feel Meltdown is more appropriate to have that scaling because Terror Drive is more utility/mobility-oriented.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DreamsGoneMad","date":"2014-11-18T04:58:50.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ideas are close to Rumble, Shyvana, and a few others.

He has to dash to get the wall, and it only goes in a straight line, it cant curve like Shyvana's, and his would be shorter than her trail, since its more like a wall. Also I think that Ebonmaw is acting very much like a dragon, and not like a machine at all, except for the ult but u gotta understand why its there. Understand that this is just a concept, and that the creator clearly stated \"Suggestions would be appreciated\", so if you think theres a problem dont just point it, out come up with a solution too. For example read my comments, I see that there might be room for improvement, I dont just point that out, I back up my reasoning for that statement with suggestions for improvements. (back on topic) All of his abilities (execept ult) are things that you would think a dragon would do. (Look at what im gonna do her other commentors, Im going to see that there may be room for improvment and make a suggestion.) I see that his W is a bit similar to shyvanas, Burnout, in its initial cast, before the mechanics set in. What if instead of releasing a burst of flame around himself, he spins once to deal a flaming tail attack around him self. Id also be cool if (in danger zone) he hit a target that has higher life than him, then he would gain a small shield (hes supposed to be a tank right?, that makes him tanky). If we are talking about shields then the whole ability could just be a big fire shield that surrounds him, it could deal damage to enemies within 100 units of him, while still protecting him, for a short while, but to balance it out, the more enemies it damages, the less shielding the shield will do (this effect is less for minions and small monsters, and the effect acts normal for champs and big monsters). And then the danger zone version could be (i kno you might take danger zone away, or do something different) that he makes the shield explode (or implode, range of 400 units, you likey?, i think its legit) or do some other thing else. These are all just suggestions, you dont gotta do any. (thats how its done noobs)\n\nI have a question does Ebonmaw become immoble, for a short while, while over heating, or does he lose MS, or is it that he just cant use abilites. \n\npertaining to the ult that i mildly suggested,(which i likes) Ebonmaw would gain some slight armor (or health) within the field of fire, also have you though about having the ult use all his heat?

I kind of meant for the trail to raise up behind him has he dashes leaving a wall similar in height and length to Aniva's wall, so even though its passible it still acts as a wall for those who dont want the extra damage, and I might give that wall some high damage. I also felt that it could be used defensibly too, dont chase Ebonmaw. I feel that the Ult radius of the field could be medium to large, but the damage is low to make for the large AoE, like they are standing on embers. But think about what a dragon would do if they were standing in thier element, i wouldnt say a slow, or a  MS buff has much to do with fire.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2014-11-18T05:14:09.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shyvana's Burnout leaves a fire trail if she's in Dragon Form.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shamont","date":"2014-11-18T04:34:49.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait Singed, and Corki, dang. haha not that unique, but still its a ground dash and its supposed to act like a wall (now I get why you put the slow in, to still give it the aspect of a \"wall\"). Also would you really have to worry about have the fire field and trail at the same time? Its not that easy to stay in danger zone is it? Maybe since the ult costs nothing the side effect could be that it takes him out of danger zone? since he just used all of his heat? the ult could make his resource act in the reverse! I know you dont like that, but I dont mean it acts as energy its still heat but think of the ult as pooling the heat into the shell and discharging all of that heat in that one attack. its like he used all the heat in that one attack, and the more heat he had when he ults, the stronger the explosion and embers will be. Hed still be able to use abilities, but he'd have to build up again to the danger zone. That way he never gets the fire trail and fire field at the same time, and its not redundant.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2014-11-18T05:12:14.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I gave the Overheat version some more thought, and I now think it wouldn't be the best of ideas. Part of Rumble's gameplay is careful management of one's Heat to stay in the Danger Zone without Overheating, which takes skill. If you constantly wanted to Overheat as Ebonmaw, that'd take away skill requirement and just be a case of hovering at near-Overheat before engaging, which isn't as fun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shamont","date":"2014-11-18T03:14:48.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really loove this champ, like it was said before, we need a dragon champ in LoL, (when Ao Shin gets here, having two will be even more awesome) and feel that this guys really fits the bill. I dont know what other peeps r talking about, a heat resource is perfect for a dragon, and we needs more champs to use the heat resource. I mean hello hes a dragon, the heat resource just fits, and plus hes part machine now, so a resource/ energy that works like mana doesnt really fit anymore, because he couldnt generate fire off of natural ability, it has to be built up by his machine parts and then used. I feel that since hes a dragon, that you really gotta deliver on the DRAGON, you kno wat I mean, the awesome, just quake in your Ionian Boots,  its a powerful, dang dragon aspect. And you mostly have, but I think that you can take it to the text lvl (which is why I think Ao Shin is taking so long), Hes a machine and a dragon, I kinda feel like hes not burny enough. I think if you were trying to make him more different from Rumble (and i feel he already is) then he needs more FIYA, not fire, thats lame, FIYA. I think id be cool if his E - Terror Drive in danger zone left a wall of flame (enemy champs would still be able to walk through, but at the expense of a burn, or just extra damage) in his wake that persist (for say 3 sec, or not). I mean that evokes terror in me, if you got behind me and did that to the side, id have to face you or the burning wall to my back. Thats terror. I also feel that his ult is also missing out on the burny dragon aspect, but this is an ultimate, so what the next level of fire? Well if you watch one piece, logic will tell you that its Magma, wat ifs his ult stays the same exept if it misses an enemy champ, it creates a field on magma, also think about what Ebonmaw could do if he were standing in the lava field. He needs moar burnierness. Think about it.  These are just suggestions you dont gotta do them at all, just think about it.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2014-11-18T03:28:28.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good idea on the fire trail.

Enemies who stand in the AOE take damage per second.
