I can definitely understand why they'd be apprehensive of making it much stronger than it is now.\n\nto be honest maybe the best solution is instead of trying to buff sightstone for supports, try and make it more of a jungler item. Make it were sightstone can be upgraded with machete and some other item like cloth armor. \n\nThey could even make machete a requirement of sightstone or make machete upgrades all have some ward function to it. Then they Riot can make regular wards cheaper so green wards will cost between 40 and 60 G instead of 75 and this can allow supports to still ward but use there early game money elsewhere. Which since this is where supports are really impactful I think it's a fair compromise. Sightstone will probably have to give a reduced amount of wards, (they only hold 2 or 3 wards instead of 4 or something) but I think it can be a good trade.\n\nAs for how the machete items can be changed, I believe they don't even have to be changed to place wards like a sightstone to get more vision or help with map based objectives. They can make machete upgrades effect different jungle camps differently. So a machete with a sightstone might not have good direct stats but when you smite different jungle camps they will give different or stronger or varied jungle buffs depending on what type of machete type and enchantment you have. So I sightstone machete might make killing scuttle crab more rewarding.\n\nAnother way that sightstone can be changed is at level 16 or 18 sightstone can be fused with the trinket for differnt effects so that supports can go as they are now and then have a better trinket slot later in the game. Riot can even make sightstone somewhat like ROD where you have to have sightstone for a certain period of time and be a certain level before then they can be fused and trinket can then give some different effects or stats or as mentioned just simple be fused into one item in the trinket slot. This will mean that solo lanes won't be pushed to buy the sightstone for the upgraded trinket because who will dump all there money in an item that won't give them effective stats until later in the game. if someone is going to dump 800 gold in something most people would rather dump it into a tear and get a better stronger item out of it. The time limit and level limit will prevent solo laners from abusing the item. The side is that supports can go about as they usually do. The time limit and level limit comes late  enough that they can buy mobi boots or some other items before sightstone and still get the stats as long as they buy the item within the first 12 or 15 minutes of the game and then sightstone will give supports a bit of a boost in power and utility when it's finally upgraded and it the item fuses with trinket it will also even free an item slot. This can open the way for different sightstone's that cost around the same but upgrade into different items. \n\nThe great thing is that with some tweaks to sightstones junglers and supports can get the item and it won't give to much vision and be beneficial to both roles. This can give junglers more utility power and possibly help with map based plays at the cost of some direct stats which junglers are pretty strong right now so that can be afforded especially since supports in the current meta tend to roam around the map and help with ganks as well.\n\nAnother option would be to heavily buff the summoner teleport but make it where if you have the summoner teleport you cannot buy machete upgrades (to keep junglers from going tp smite) and then you can make some sightstone paths that give plenty of stats and have the same restriction if you have TP and smite (and if you don't want junglers using sightstone make smite prevent the ability of buying sightstone) This can allow for supports to build sightstone without being abused the only thing that would be needed would probably be something to help marksmen while also keeping marksmen from building sightstone from these buffs and this could range from buffing heal and barrier to direct base stat upgrades to buffing ad items or creating a really efficient Dorans item that appeals to marksmen but also restricts people who buy the dorans item from buying sightstone.\n\nTo be honest I don't think this applies to only sightstone but I think many items should give different stats and scaling to different champions and allow or restrict the further purchase of different items. For instance if you can't buy item X unless you have item Y and Z and if you have item X Y or Z you can't but item A or B and then different champions will have different restrictions on what items they can buy and different items that can be used together. Then buffing or nerfing a champion will be as simple as changing the numbers or scaling a certain champion gets with an item. Even if not for all champions you can make several champions that might even have different spell abilities and different power spikes depending on what items they buy or what order they level there spell abilities.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"jjookkeerr","date":"2015-09-21T04:39:10.957+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"supports diversity is going to be looked at on preseason? right now i feel like tanky supports are dominating the bot lane and jana suffered nerfs because of it. is a bit frustrating that supports with ap scaling cant build ap and are forced to build tank","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-09-21T05:36:46.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Well shit.....\n\nhttp://i.memeful.com/memes/ROJWDqM.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"ADepressedLeona","date":"2015-09-21T12:39:32.490+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BeatzBoyFTW,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ydueyEpB,comment-id=00010003,timestamp=2015-09-21T05:36:46.094+0000)\n>\n> Well shit.....\n> \n> http://i.memeful.com/memes/ROJWDqM.jpg\n\nWhen did he go away exactly?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Silven","date":"2015-09-22T14:59:12.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm rooting for stuff like \"Emerald Sightstone\" and \"Sapphire Sightstone\".

Honestly at this point, if your entire team hasn't upgraded their trinkets at lvl 12 at most, you're pretty much free to yell at them for not doing so. Warding should never have been a single person's job, and a support's best place is at the very center of it's team, where he can put all his skills to use. Not risking getting caught out warding dragon because he's the only one who can.\n\nSightstone needs to be deleted for this game to reach vision balance; take vision out of the gold equation, and expand it into a system of it's own.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2015-09-21T19:52:15.059+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would really like it if at level 9 Sightstone could recharge like the totem does.

Supp mages that are doing well can delay an ADC's farming until they're irrelevant to the game even when left alone for a good while.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Delling","date":"2015-09-23T16:57:25.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with tying SS to a summoner spell is there is NO uniquely support summoner spell. Designing the jungle experience around the expectation that the Jungler will take Smite and then loading Smite up with a huge amount of utility that makes it rival other summoner spells works because you can then be reasonably sure that the Jungler will take Smite, just as you could have been reasonably sure that the Jungler will take Smite beforehand. Ie- it hasn't changed the presumption that the Jungler has Smite.\n\nMost supports take either Heal + Flash or Exhaust+Flash but some do take Ignite+Flash. On that last one, why? _and this is really important:_ well, because some ADCs take Heal+Flash in order to have safer laning.\n\nWell, we can't tie SS to Flash because then anyone could/would take it (depending on the extent of the buffs). Can't tie it to Heal without potentially facing cases where the ADC takes it. Our best bet therefore is Exhaust, but as noted, there's no guarantee that supports will take Exhaust so it would just be more shoehorning supports into their box. \n\nOne option would be to create a support summoner spell but this has two problems 1) the CV/Exhaust-problem: we could tie SS to CV/Exhaust but we'd just be forcing supports to take CV... something they haven't done in ages... or mandating that they take Exhaust further reducing supports available options and 2) any sufficiently high utility Summoner Spell for supports would be tempting to other roles (just look at Heal and ADCs).\n\nI think the \"tied to summoner spell\" route is fundamentally the wrong direction to take for supports. \n\nIt's arguable that Sightstone should just be removed from the game, as an outdated relic from the time when it was the support alone's duty to ward, and the vision trinkets should just be buffed instead. \n\nThe only healthy outcome I could see for giving Sightstone more upgrade paths would be something like letting Sightstone build from either Ruby or Tome and its final form having a meaningful passive (possibly as an enchantment). But the problem there is that it's difficult to make \"lump of AP\" work as well as \"lump of HP\" because a couple hundred HP go a lot further than 20-40 AP (especially with the utility scaling on supports)... (Lump of HP with an AP zit on the side... [well...](https://janaiblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/100506.jpg))\n\nOh, and for the love of God, Don't. Put. CDR. On.
