It's not like mana where you need to prevent yourself from going oom, and it's not about fury, where you (usually) wanna get it maxed asap. It's all about keeping as close to that sweetspot as possible, with either extreme (none, and max) being detrimental.\n\nSo what about a character that litterally employs heat in it's kit? Something like no heat has some kind of penalty associated with \"heating up\" (think reduced range on spells or whatnot) and overheat being a two edged sword (increased dmg but possible a significant health cost?) But if you can maintain your heat in that \"sweetspot\" then you are rewarded more thoroughly than just \"oh, yer playin well, so no penalties for you\"\n\nMaybe incorporate a \"primed\" zone where essentially the next spell cast while within this small zone is almost like a mini karma mantra type of thing.\n\nBut I dunno, I'm just throwing stuff at the wall and seein what sticks.

Ebonmaw is a dive-heavy fighter who scales off AD, relies more on auto-attacks to do the bulk of his damage, and synergizes really well with \"Wombo Combo\" Champions like Orianna due to his ultimate.\n\nLike Rumble, he does build Heat by using abilities, but instead of his abilities gaining damage boosts or potency boosts while in the Danger Zone, his abilities get bonus effects while in Danger Zone. This means if you're not heated up, you miss out on significant parts of your kit.\n\nLastly, while Rumble gets bonus magic damage on-hit when Overheating, Ebonmaw gets a nasty immolation effect while Overheating, but is both silenced and loses some innate bonus AR/MR.\n\nDetails on it are through the link above, but here it is again: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/RMnR5Jth-ebonmaw-the-terror-of-zaun\n\nMaybe you could give it a glance? I'd love to see good old Ebonmaw get a new place in League after Vilemaw kicked him out of The Twisted Treeline.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Espy Psyche","date":"2014-11-27T13:48:06.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I designed a concept for a tanky support that used heat almost two years ago. Her passive was something akin to a Sunfire Cape. When she was in the Danger Zone (50-99), she gained bonus damage on the passive but could still use her abilities. If she overheated, she gained even more bonus damage on the passive than in Danger Zone but was unable to cast until she cooled back down. Her ultimate completely changed everything if she had it ready. When she used it, it gave a major boost to her team and took her instantly to 100 Heat, but made her immune to silences for the duration of the ult. This meant that she buffed her team.\n\nThe kit was something like this:\n\nPassive -- Burning Spirit: Reshira emits an aura that deals a % of her max health every second to nearby enemies. This increases when she has between 50 and 100 Heat. If she hits 100 Heat, she is silenced for 5 seconds while she cools down but the passive increases further.\n\nQ -- Straight line, piercing, medium range, low cooldown, low damage skillshot that generates 20 Heat. Targets hit become sources of Reshira's passive for 2 seconds, hitting their friends for Reshira's base Burning Spirit damage.\n\nW -- Summons an untargetable bird at very long range that emits Burning Spirit for 2 seconds and generates 20 Heat. When the bird expires, it dives the nearest enemy champion and applies a long duration snare.\n\nE -- Casts a shield on an allied unit that absorbs an amount of damage. While the shield holds, the ally emits Burning Spirit.\n\nR -- Emits an aura that causes herself and all allies to deal bonus magic damage on hit and on spell hit for a duration. Instantly raises Reshira to 100 heat and prevents her from losing Heat, but makes her immune to Silence effects. Once the ability expires, Reshira overheats and is silenced until she cools back down.\n\nI had numbers and everything, but I feel adding them detracts from the design for this specific topic. Besides, CertainlyT and the other champion designers don't do the numbers, the balance team does.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Totalwanabe","date":"2014-11-26T00:25:27.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why not as long it has an interesting kit.","replies":[]}]}
