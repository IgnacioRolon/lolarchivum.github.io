Cracks rent the earth,\" said old Khaldun, his crag-featured face lit by firelight. \"It was into one of these fissures that a young man ventured. He found an opening; the entrance to a tomb, hidden for the Jackal knows how long. The man had little ones to feed and a wife to please, and so he ventured in, lured by opportunity.\"\r\n\r\nAdults and children alike crowded in close to hear the old storyteller's words. They were all weary - they had traveled far that day, and the Shuriman sun had been unrelenting - but Khaldun's tales were a rare treat. They drew their cloaks tight around their shoulders against the chill of the night and leaned in.\r\n\r\n\"The air was cool in the tomb, a merciful relief from the scorching heat outside. The young man lit a torch. Its light made shadows dance before him. He stepped cautiously, wary of traps. He was poor, but he was no fool.\r\n\r\n\"The walls inside were smooth obsidian and carved with ancient writings and images. He could not read - he was a simple man - but he studied the images.\r\n\r\n\"He saw a boy prince, sitting cross-legged upon a sun disk borne by a team of servants, a beaming smile upon his face. Chests of coins and riches were piled before him, the offerings of strangely garbed, bowing emissaries.\r\n\r\n\"He saw other carvings, again showing the smiling prince, this time walking among his people. Their heads were pressed to the ground before him. Stylized rays of sunshine radiated from the boy's crown.\r\n\r\n\"Before one of these images was a small, gold statue. It alone was worth more than he could have hoped to earn in ten lifetimes. The young man took it, slipping it into his satchel.\r\n\r\n\"He did not intend to linger. He knew it would not be long before others came upon this place. When they did, he wanted to be gone. Greed makes fools of even the greatest men, and he knew that others would willingly spill his blood to claim that golden statue - and the other riches that were surely further in. Avarice was not one of the young man's faults, however. He felt no need to delve further. The other treasures hidden here were someone else's to claim.\r\n\r\n\"He looked upon one last image before he left the tomb. It showed the boy prince dead, lying upon a bier. Those closest to him were wailing... but further back, people were celebrating. Had the boy prince been beloved, or had he been a tyrant? There was no way of knowing.\r\n\r\n\"That was when he heard it: a sound in the darkness that made his skin crawl.\r\n\r\n\"He looked around, wide eyed, holding his torch up before him. Nothing.\r\n\r\n\"'Who's there?' he said. Silence was his only answer.\r\n\r\n\"The young man shook his head. 'It is just the wind, you fool,' he thought. 'Nothing but the wind.'\r\n\r\n\"Then he heard it again, more distinctly this time. A child was crying in the darkness further into the tomb.\r\n\r\n\"Heard anywhere else, his paternal instinct would have been to go to the sound. But here, in the darkness of a funereal tomb?\r\n\r\n\"He wanted to run... but he did not. The sobbing touched his heart. It was filled with such misery and grief.\r\n\r\n\"Was it possible there was another entrance to this tomb? Had a young boy found his way down here and become lost?\r\n\r\n\"Torch held high, he crept forward. The weeping continued, echoing faintly through the gloom.\r\n\r\n\"A wide chamber opened before him, its floor black and highly reflective. Golden artifacts and jewel-inlaid walls glinted within. Gingerly, he entered the room.\r\n\r\n\"He stepped back sharply as his heel sent ripples spreading out across the floor. Water. The floor was not made of reflective obsidian - it was covered in water.\r\n\r\n\"Kneeling, he scooped a handful of it to his lips. He spat it out immediately. It was salt water! Here, in the heart of Shurima, a thousand leagues from the nearest sea!\r\n\r\n\"He heard the sound of the boy weeping once more, closer now.\r\n\r\n\"Holding his torch before him, the young man glimpsed a shape at the edge of its light. It appeared to be the child, sitting with his back to the man.\r\n\r\n\"Carefully, he stepped into the room. The water upon the floor was not deep. The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end, and fear clutched at his chest, yet he did not turn to run.\r\n\r\n\"'Are you lost?' he asked, as he stepped closer. 'How did you get here?'\r\n\r\n\"The shadowed figure did not turn... but he did speak.\r\n\r\n\"'I... I don't remember,' he said. The sound swam around the young man, echoing off the walls. The boy spoke in an old dialect. His words were strange... but understandable. 'I don't remember who I am.'\r\n\r\n\"'Be calm, child,' said the man. 'All will be well.'\r\n\r\n\"He stepped closer, and the figure resolved itself before him. His eyes widened.\r\n\r\n\"The shape before him was a god-statue carved in onyx, nothing more. It was not the source of the crying, nor of the child's voice.\r\n\r\n\"That was when a small, dry hand grabbed him.\"\r\n\r\nThe youngest of the listeners gasped, his eyes wide. The other children laughed in false bravado. Old Khaldun smiled, a golden tooth glinting in the firelight. Then, he continued.\r\n\r\n\"The young man looked down. The linen-wrapped corpse of the tiny prince stood beside the man. Dull, ghostly light emanated from the deathly boy's eye sockets, though his entire face was bound in burial wrappings. The corpse-child held the man's hand.\r\n\r\n\"'Will you be my friend?' the boy asked, his voice muffled by linen.\r\n\r\n\"The young man lurched backward, breaking free of the child's grasp. The young man looked down at his arm in horror; his hand was shriveling, turning black and withered. The wasting touch then began to climb up his arm.\r\n\r\n\"He turned and ran. In his shock and haste, he dropped his lantern. It hissed as it fell into the lake of tears, and darkness descended. Still, he could just make out the glow of daylight up ahead. He ran toward it, scrambling desperately, even as the wasting death crept up his arm towards his heart.\r\n\r\n\"At any moment, he expected to feel the deathly boy's grasp upon him... but did not. After what felt like an eternity, but could only have been a matter of heartbeats, he burst from the darkness into the desert heat once more.\r\n\r\n\"'I'm sorry,' echoed a mournful voice from the gloom behind him. 'I didn’t mean to.'\r\n\r\n\"And thus, the Tomb of Amumu was unearthed,\" said old Khaldun, \"and the deathly child released into the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"But everyone knows he isn't real!\" cried one of the children, the oldest of them, after a moment of silence.\r\n\r\n\"Amumu is real!\" said the youngest. \"He's wandering the land trying to find a friend!\"\r\n\r\n\"He's real, but he isn't a boy,\" said another. \"He's a yordle!\"\r\n\r\nKhaldun laughed, and pushed himself to his feet with the aid of a gnarled walking stick.\r\n\r\n\"I am old, and we have far to travel tomorrow,\" he said. \"It is past time I was abed.\"\r\n\r\nHis audience began to dissipate, smiling and talking in low, familial voices, but one child did not move. She stared at Khaldun, unblinking.\r\n\r\n\"Grandfather,\" she said. \"How did you lose your arm?\"\r\n\r\nOld Khaldun looked down at the empty sleeve pinned at his shoulder, then flashed the girl a grin.\r\n\r\n\"Goodnight, little one,\" he said with a wink.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-12-18T02:05:02.194+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":3,"body":"might be the first lore redo i actually really like (especially as he could still be a yordle), though it still doesn´t offer any reasoning for giving up on the league (and it doesn´t offer much more intel on mumu than the original lore, but it adds a little more to shurima).","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2014-12-18T04:39:17.491+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> but it adds a little more to shurima).\n\nThis is becoming an increasingly apparent trend; champion stories reveal less about them and more about the world. \n\nRegarding Amumu's lore, they give us a vague idea of what the Sad Mummy is about - he cries, he is cursed, he was once royalty - while establishing more of Shurima's culture.

At least this way it's at least examining the personalities of 2 champions (that we give the faintest crap about compared to *some guy who narrates*) and trying to extrapolate upon that.\n\nShurima was developed? How so? We knew they had merchants and caravans thanks to Rek'sai, we know that there are an indigenous people of Shurima, we know that they need to exist through some sort of structure possibly tribes and the like since the royalty fell centuries prior and with the resurgence of Azir they'll be unified (I'm thinking, hoping there's an '*or else*' here) under him, and so on and so on.\n\nSo what does this short story of Amumu's bring that we didn't know before?

Here is some information on mummification: \n\n> We know nothing about the funerals of ordinary people, but the decoration in Old Kingdom tomb chapels tells us a little about the funerals of nobles. The Pyramid Texts and the layouts of royal mortuary temples give us some idea about rituals surrounding the death of the king. Although there were changes to this ritual over the next two thousand years, the changes were surprisingly minor. Evidence from the New Kingdom and Late Period suggest that the rituals that had once accompanied only kings and nobles later were performed for small landowners and craftsmen. How were the masses, the farmers, taken to their eternal rest? We do not know, but the Middle Kingdom text, The Dispute of a Man with his Ba, offers a sad image of the resting place of the very poor.\n> \n> Those who built in granite, who erected halls in excellent tombs…their offering stones are desolate, as if they were the dead who died on the riverbank for lack of a survivor.\n\nSource: [The ROM ](http://www.rom.on.ca/en/education/online-activities/ancient-egypt/mummification)\n\nOr if you want me to be more specific:\n\n> Who Was Mummified\n> \n> After death, the pharaohs of Egypt usually were mummified and buried in elaborate tombs. Members of the nobility and officials also often received the same treatment, and occasionally, common people. However, the process was an expensive one, beyond the means of many.\n> \n> For religious reasons, some animals were also mummified. The sacred bulls from the early dynasties had their own cemetery at Sakkara. Baboons, cats, birds, and crocodiles, which also had great religious significance, were sometimes mummified, especially in the later dynasties.\n\nSource: [Smithsonian Encyclopedia](http://www.si.edu/Encyclopedia_SI/nmnh/mummies.htm)\n\nWith the elaborate tomb design, the hieroglyphics drawn, the sun motif, the Egyptian themes and the general depiction of what the walls depicted, chances were that Amumu was of some sort of royalty or nobility. Commoners who could afford it were the rarity, and with how Riot tends to go with pop culture more than anything, pharaohs are the most commonly believed to have been mummified via the embalming process, or at least royalty.\n\nIt was established he was royalty for 5+ years by the mere fact that he is a mummy that had his own tomb rather than be surrounded by multiple mummies or even being mummified by the desert sands as most early mummification was done by. I did not need the confirmation of royalty via a short story, I needed characterization to be made.\n\nNo characterization was given to us about Amumu, in fact we know more about old Khaldun and his growth as a character than Amumu's. \n\nThis is as sad as Amumu.\n\nDon't use Wikipedia if you don't know how to research and cite the sources that Wikipedia itself uses. You'd be surprised how much is summarized.\n\n4) If he's not sure he's a mummy, or undead, then he's going to find out very promptly. It's not the change went by me, it's that it's so insignificant that it doesn't matter because he will find out. What would be more interesting in the story would be Amumu's realization that he's a walking shambling corpse and we are privy to his realization of *that*. This is another really simple venue that could have been explored but was not. We already have the background information on Amumu, why not expand on the character himself?\n\n5) That is a bad explanation for the lone fact that then his passive should be causing DoT for the idea of a curse that causes *rot*, but that is also what his Tantrum does, isn't it, doing DoT over time? His Ultimate is also Curse of the Sad Mummy, and he wraps you in bandages. Is he trying to hug you or trying to mummify you, I'm not sure.\n\nThis is not interesting because I don't see any new information I could not infer from before. This is confirmation of what his curse does, yes, but it could have been handled a million different ways. I can even write a short story for the board as an example if you wish.\n\n6) We know about the same amount since not one modicum is concrete information and it is all speculation. They could've stretched this \"bio\" out three times longer, and it still would not have told us anything about Amumu or Shurima that we don't already know. The fact that  people were happy and sad when he died. which, by the way, carving that in the tomb is like carving \"well, people either loved him or hated him!\" as an epitaph on a tombstone is absurd and a huge stretch in logic for why whoever lovingly created this resting place for him would do so aside from being able to enable heavy-handed narration.\n\nI will in fact say we do not know more about his former life because of all the evidence I've brought to the table, along with the fact that his old lore was: \n\n> Perhaps one of the oddest champions in the League of Legends is the yordle known as Amumu. His life before joining the League remains unknown to all - especially Amumu. All he remembers is that he woke up alone inside a pyramid within the Shurima Desert. He was wrapped in mummy wrappings and he could not feel his heart beat. Furthermore, he felt a deep sadness that he could not entirely explain; he knew he was missing his parents, though he could not remember who they were. Dropping to his knees, Amumu wept into his bandages. No matter what he did, it seemed he could just never stop his tears or sadness.

Go to the old lore forums and fanfiction forums and look up my name, nothing to hide there from me. I have speculated a *gross* amount.\n\nThis path that was taken for Amumu is utter nonsense when you could have taken a multitude of other routes in order to focus on Amumu, and create speculation and develop said character and have interactions with other important characters (aka League Champions) rather than some dusty old mop that will be forgotten about because they are not even a secondary or tertiary character, they're not even the Chorus, they're just \"Some Guy\".\n\nWhat I want to know about Amumu is development, a push past the prologue, a push past the setup, I want to see Amumu's thoughts, I want to see what his fragmented memories are, I want to be introduced to the true depth of despair he felt when he awoke as a corpse alone in a tomb with all of his loved ones nothing more than shadows and dust. I want to know what was evoked in Amumu when he first met Annie, and how did the two become friends if his touch causes rot. I want to know more than what I already knew about the champion, I want the focus of the story to be on the champion itself rather than focusing on an arbitrary character who will not have anything more to say, except that Amumu's been wandering for years and he's a legend, and because of that he's in the game called ~~League~~ of Legends (Ohhhh I get it!). I want to know why Amumu during the Shurima event was an associated champion of Shurima lumped in with Ezreal rather than a direct player and main character of Shurima like Azir, Nasus, Skarner, Rammus and Sivir. I want to know why we are made to speculate about Amumu's past meanwhile Karthus was completely rewritten because he was too mysterious and too much speculation was had and was needed to be clarified, but we're allowed to speculate about Evelynn, Elise, Amumu and the like. I want there to be more information than a prologue that is never expanded upon. \n\nIn other words, I want a story, not a bunch of lifeless words retelling me information I already knew.\n\nThat is what I want.","replies":[{"poster":"Trylobyte","date":"2014-12-19T03:42:39.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Grand Viper,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=lxqPbXrE,comment-id=000d000100000000,timestamp=2014-12-19T03:33:58.504+0000)\n>\n> More Text\n\nWhile I agree that I'd love to see these things, remember that a short story encompassing all those elements, done justice, would be a good length - I'd equate it to a comic book, if you want to add pictures and such.

It develops NPC characters we'll never hear of again. It tells us a bunch of stuff we already know about the world. It leaves questions that will never be answered (how can we see a follow-up to the Freljord Event at this pace, if we still haven't seen anything to that degree for Demacia, Noxus, Bandle City, The Void, Piltover, Zaun, etc. etc. etc.?). It throws out old worldbuilding and character development/characterization in favor of \"re-establishing\" characters and locations as empty archetypes and building hype for champ releases. It relegates a handful of champions to villains that must be defeated by huge armies and a rag-tag team of champions, and creates extravagant events that players/summoners will never have a part in. It reduces champion interaction to a staggering degree, due to geographical boundaries and more--why would Galio and Skarner, for example, have any reason to meet or interact (outside of maybe some contrived \"WE GOTTA STOP XERATH\" scenario)? It completely separates the story of the game from the game itself.\n\nThe New Lore does a lot of things, but developing champions/giving us insight to them on the level of the old bios and judgments is not one of them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Onegarion","date":"2014-12-18T07:30:55.611+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"It could be why some of them where sad while others rejoiced after the prince was dead.

It takes powerful people to execute damnatio memoriae, after all.  \n> \n> You're putting a lot of effort into your research but not a lot into speculation on why this situation could be different.\n\nYou really want to go this path?\n\nVery well.\n\nIf he was disliked by only a specific group of people, chances were they were the more powerful ones who could afford to damn his memory and erase every trace of his tangible existence with ease. If it was not them, then they'd be caring a lot more for how the prince is depicted in death.\n\nYou are confusing tangible history and intangible history. You are saying that maybe 1 person showed up to the tomb, but that doesn't mean the gravestone will necessarily read, \"Here lies John Smith, Glad he's a corpse that I can spit on\", it will just say \"John Smith. 1903-1945\". It won't say \"John Smith: Sometimes an Alright Guy but Could be a Dick\". \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause that is incredibly farfetched. So much is taken from Egyptian mythology, so much is lifted from it to the point that they're saying \"By the Jackal!\" and  a lot of it tends to be the more pop culture aspects of it.\n\nYou want speculation as to why the tomb painters and the tomb engravers would show two conflicting stories? Because they were incredibly drunk while doing so. There's my speculation. You want actual speculation? It makes no logical sense, it only serves to confuse us and elicit more wonder as to whether he was beloved or not through a hamfisted manner when it could have been addressed with Amumu having his entire memory erased because of said enemies, the walls scratched out, the last relic that he owned was a gold statue of him and his family that old Khaldun steals in his greedy youth and Amumu is forever robbed of it. Gold wasn't readily found, gold is an often image seen for rich people, you could do *a lot* to create the speculation.\n\nThere's not much to speculate when it is done in such a hamfisted and poor manner. What can you speculate?\n\n\"He may have been good, he may have been bad.\"\n\nWhy does that matter when Amumu isn't a main player of Shurima, established by Riot in the Shuriman event and has the same level of importance to Shurima as Ezreal does? Or maybe that was an intentional lie to pull the wool over player's eyes so the revelation can be that much more a secret, just like Skarner defending the unknown thing of unknown. Maybe he is related to Azir in some distant way, but pre-Xerath Ascension or Post-Xerath Ascension? This is better speculation. This is done because of the sun motif, this is done not because of the confusion of whether or not he may have been liked or hated. The speculation lies elsewhere, not in whether he was good or bad, which I think is a really shoddy way of storytelling and narrative.\n\nWhat I *wonder* because of the depictions is whether or not he has any relation to the royal family, aka Azir's lineage, any knowledge of Nasus, of Renekton, of Xerath, maybe a distant cousin who were the reason why the bloodline of Azir was continued because the God Emperor of Shurima's immediate family (Wife to children) were all killed by Xerath.\n\nThat is where my speculation lies, that is where it *should* lie and because of this, it does not frankly *matter* how the boy prince was viewed in all honesty. It creates a red herring that bears so little weight that it's just awkward to put in there.\n\nAs for my citations, I'm citing my sources so I don't sound like I talk out of my ass when I do bring them up, because I don't want to be ill-perceived in my responses on the information I provide. My personality is however debatable you want it to be.\n\nThat is my speculation.","replies":[]}]}]}
