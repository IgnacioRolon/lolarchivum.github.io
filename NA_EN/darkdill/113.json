I've played multiple seasons and if I pay decent attention to a player's decision-making and positioning I can make a reasonable call as to if they are inting or having a bad game. Ex: the adc who has 5 deaths but positions correctly and knows when to engage/chase to follow up her/his team's engage was having a bad game. The adc who has 5 deaths and is sitting on the frontline vs a fed enemy vi and nautilus in range of all their cc when we are about to 5v5 is inting. That or they are boosted -- which is equally bad. So really, it comes down to decision-making and positioning. Do you adjust your play to STOP the feeding, or do you repeat the same bone-headed easily-corrected \"mistake\" 8 times in a row despite your teammate(s) telling you (politely the first 3 times -- then getting more rude about it) how to easily correct your \"mistake\" so you don't feed more. Like an 0/3/0 twitch shoving in a 2/0/1 draven to his tower 2v2 -- you are just inviting them to kill you again -- and their jungler to join in on the snowball. Miss a few cs, farm under your tower and catch back up in levels and items; then try your luck 2v2 again if you want. Don't turn that 2/0/1 draven into a 10/1/4 draven in laning phase and ruin any chance your 4/2/6 mid and 3/0/4 top had of carrying your team to a win. If you just have the patience, they will get you fed in teamfights. If you don't, you just make it so they can't carry and you are even further behind.

You're so far behind that you don't contribute much, even to a 5 v 5.\n\nI'd say at this point, the best strategy is to solo push lanes/split push, probably even use TP to return to lane and not to join team fights and here's why.\n\n1. If the enemy team devotes someone to kill you, so what? You're not worth any gold to them at all, and it creates a 4 v 4 for the rest of your team, AKA a fair situation instead of an unbalanced one where it's a 5 v 5 but you're so behind that's it's really a 4 v 5 even with you there.\n2. As an AD champ, you can actually take objectives fairly quickly if left alone. This could make up for your bad game putting your team in a 4 v 5 if the enemy team doesn't devote resources to you and groups instead.\n3.  If you realize you're useless in a teamfight, TP can be used to gain strategic advantages. Say you go into a lane by yourself and get killed....again....well if TP is up, you can just go right back there and finish pushing lane/taking that tower. You've bought time for your team, and a possible way to win later. There's also the last ditch solo nexus kill, should that opportunity present itself.\n4. Since you're probably losing to the most fed person on their team, who will probably peel off to 1 v 1 you, it won't take their whole team to kill you, meaning you can take advantage of this and not give up assist gold like you would be if you died to that same person in a team fight.\n\nThat's just a few thoughts, granted, not going 0/8 is ideal, but lemons, lemonade etc. I'd rather have someone atone for a bad game by being as annoying to the enemy team as they can, and in this specific situation that's one way to do it, as opposed to simply being present for 5 v 5s in which you'll get insta-deleted. I've spectated games where a situation very similar to this has happened, and one I can remember the team with the player who's K/D/A looked like someone was seriously intentionally feeding actually won, _because_ they did this. Sure they had a bad game, but the enemy team was too stupid to deal with the macro gameplay this created. You can have a bad game and be useless, or you can have a bad game and still win, if you and your teammates realize how you can still be useful when you literally can't win a fight.\n\nJust saying, I'd feel better if the \"bad player\" did this rather than just say \"I'm having a bad game, sorry guys.\"","replies":[{"poster":"AninLegions777","date":"2017-01-11T03:59:13.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">This won't be a problem if those playing bad apologized and tried to **play better**\n\nWhat you said was in the first sentence of my reply.

I don't know how that guy thinks ignoring macro-objectives leads to wins though.\n\nThe thing that sucks is that often the \"bad player\" who does use this strategy still gets flamed by their own team the whole time, like, their teammates aren't smart enough to realize that it might be the only way they can still impact the game and make the appropriate adjustments. \n\nLike I said I was spectating a game on Twitch that my friend was playing when something like this happened. He was flaming the player who was split pushing but I told him \"no dude, that's the only thing that player can do at this point, it doesn't matter if he dies.\" They won the game, arguably because their WORST player carried them. Granted, this was low ELO, it probably doesn't work like that later on, still, if these players want to climb they need to be less close-minded about how to actually win.

Even the best of us, but I just think there should be a certain expectation when someone is sporting a certain border.\n\nBoosted animals everywhere...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Covert Ops Gnar","date":"2017-01-10T06:14:55.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They only have a bad game in my game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shifue Draven","date":"2017-01-10T06:06:02.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do honestly i know people have bad games and i am fine with this as we all will. However this is a difference between a bad game and doing what the veigar did in my last game of the night facing oriana. He kept rushing her and chasing her down the lane and fed her to hell and back i ganked her after she got 1 kill trying to open him a path and he just kept stupidly rushing her and got destroyed. Which then she lead her team to win as she was at 8-2 but the 14 min mark and we could not team fight because of her aoe. We held out for a while but veigar ham stringed us even more by wandering around and getting caught out so it really ended the game.\n\nI did not bash him or flame him but i did tell him to play safe please cause if she gets to far ahead i can't kill her and that is what happened.","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2017-01-10T05:39:59.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree, this happens alot.\nbut heres the thing, as people start to know the champions combos,tip etc. people will under stand \"having a bad day\"\nand the higher you climb the less people do this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-01-10T05:25:53.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only assume people are assholes if they flame in chat or otherwise start raging about losing and throwing a general fit.

Someone might be legitimately tired, having a bad day, etc. Yet it's more often their gameplay decisions that seal their fate rather than some random wheel of fortune. I see a lot of players go for hail Mary long shots and try to set up complicated, orchestrated combos, only to rage when they don't work out, feeding into their desperation. Not taking a drake that is freely available, scoring an ace and not snowballing that into a Baron or 2 dead towers, but instead backing to get HP and buying items...those are the kinds of things that lose games. Being 0/4/0 at 6 minutes isn't game over, it's the decisions you make with the information you have available that determines the outcome from that point onward.\n\nSure, bad games happen. If you recognize your game isn't going well, the best course of action is to look at **your** decisions, and how you can change the working strategy that clearly isn't producing. You may not be able to do anything about an opponent that is simply better than you, but you can at least delay them, prevent roams, soak up opposing team resources, do whatever you can.\n\nIf you're having a bad game, you can still look at how you can fit your performance into a strategy that will mesh with your team to get a victory. You might be the ugly duckling on the scoreboard, but a win is a win at the end of it all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2017-01-10T05:22:57.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like to look at my team in op.gg before the game and if I see they generally do well I give them the benefit of the doubt. If their laner is mastery 6 or 7 I won't say anything. If they're nice, they can be the worst bronze 5 player to exist and I'll keep my mouth shut. But every now and then I'll get an ADC who just... just... will not right click? Like, go and run into every Blitz/Thresh Q. I will save you and turn it. Think you're invincible, positioning is hard, go be our frontline. We'll win the teamfight. But if you won't attack the minions or the enemy, I have to assume you just suck ass at the game? That's from my support standpoint. When I jungle and gank, you'll see sometimes that the laners just will not attack the enemy. At all. And so when you have to leave, usually via flash when the enemy realizes it's actually just a 1v1 against someone with less gold, the laner will go in and die. \n\nPeople do have bad games but honestly, a lot of the time, people are just.... bad. \n\nThe real issue stems from what happens after you realize your teammate is a potato. Because it's fine that they suck ass. It's frustrating, but a lot of people suck ass at the game. Just don't flame em.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aspects1","date":"2017-01-10T05:09:56.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but is it lag or \"lag\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoleBilon","date":"2017-01-10T02:05:34.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea i mostly do , i never blame my teammate for going 0/5 shit happens maybe he got ganked , maybe he is tilted w/e \n\n\n\nbut you know what sucks , when this fucker is trying hard to NOT get carried, you give him advices he responds with flame. you want to lane swap him bot from top to give him security of a tower he refuses. You ping incoming ganks he does not pay attention. \nI had a game with toplane nasus. he went 0/11/0 i dont mind the score he wasnt inting he was just bad. But fuck him , when he was 0/5 and like 40-50 cs down with nearly 0 stacks we told him to abort the mission of building triforce because his powerspike will be too late and its not optimal. we told him to build some hp and resistances to survive lane and dont die more as well as tank in TF. He did not respond build tri force ( he had it build at 21 minutes XD without boots) you know what he did after ? he started building tiamat .... we lost he was the sole reason we lost \n\n\nYou know how its called what he did  ? inting , he refused to communicate , refused to take advices , and basically 1v9 carried enemy team.\n\nConclusion: yea there are situations where people have bad game , but if you do dont be shy and ask for help/advice from your team. Dont try to carry while being 0/4 it does not work , try to be rellevant or at least let your team carry.","replies":[]}]}
