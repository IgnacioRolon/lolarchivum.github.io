The missile speed was actually put in so you could see how many hits you got on Q and then choose whether or not to heal an ally before they reached you (because they heal more when you're at lower health) as a small optimization. Also, having them move too fast would disrupt a lot of the clarity of the enemy seeing whether or not they were hit and where Soraka's healing is coming from. We could possibly speed them up some, but I'm not sure if that's the place I really would want to buff Soraka. Right now I'm primarily looking at her E cooldown (possibly raising it), her W range (possible increasing it) and her Q cast paradigm (changing it to fixed travel time instead of variable depending on distance. this would be a nerf at close range but a buff at far ranges and will also increase how understandable/usable the spell is for a number of players).\n\nAll of this is tentative though, but those are the things I'm looking at primarily.

And since, as a support, you have to buy the sightstone as early as possible, and seeing that sightstone gives you health but no health regen to compensate, it puts you in the situation where you sacrifice a lot of health without regaining it quickly enough.\nI think (but I might be wrong) that giving her a health ratio either on her heal (to give the extra loss purpose) or on her self-heal (to compensate the loss) could help her with this itemization issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earl of March","date":"2014-10-28T00:07:57.806+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Vesh,\n\nHaving played about 35 games as support Soraka post-rework, I just want to throw my 2rp into the ring.  \n\nWhen evaluating a champion's kit, you obviously know very well that \"fun\" is not comparable to \"damage,\" \"mana cost,\" \"cooldown duration,\" or any of the other values that dictate a champion's overall power.  I assume that's a big part of why you worked on Soraka's new kit - she's substantially more *enjoyable* to play following this rework.  Even if, as you say, Soraka might not need any of the aforementioned changes in terms of her in-game strength (perhaps you are already happy with her new pick/win rates), I do think that she would massively benefit from another increase to her \"fun\" levels. \n\nHaving to move in close to an allied champion in order to transfer your health to the target creates FAR more interesting game mechanics than the previous Soraka's kit - but proves frustrating and feels anti-fun in certain circumstances.  For example, I've often found that moving up to heal the frontline can actually be a greater risk than potential reward in that you can easily end up dying without accomplishing much at all, leaving your backline without a support.  In Soraka's current form, the famous line displayed on the supercomputer's screen in John Badham's 1983 film, *WarGames,*  sometimes proves true: \"the only winning move is not to play.\"\n\nTherefore, I strongly feel that you should internally test increasing the range on Soraka's W with nerfs to other areas of her kit in order to try to strike a balance between the increased range and the strength of heal.  Obviously changes to range are difficult to balance in relation to other areas of a kit (like in Lucian's rework, where the reduction of his AA range was answered with too many buffs) - but I would be hard-pressed to think of a design reason to obstruct making a champion more fun to play as; because if we're not having fun, why are we playing League of Legends?\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nBest,\n\nEarl","replies":[{"poster":"Vesh","date":"2014-10-28T07:45:13.095+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Earl! \n\nIn development I had to walk a very fine line with the W range to get the accessibility I wanted for the character while preserving functionality.

For laning purposes, her W range is good.  For teamfights, it's abysmal and suicidal.  If gapclosers were less common then 50 range would be a big deal, but that's not the case; 500 range with no peels, no CC, no tankiness, no escape is still suicide.  Teams peel for the ADC, not the support.\n\nI don't know, I don't have an answer.  IMO W could use a range buff because Soraka is way too fragile to have her main gameplay mechanic at such a short range, however increasing the range just returns her to the \"unfun passive healbot\" status she once had.\n\nPersonally I think you should have made her heal be more flexible, like the travel time on Starcall or Xerath's/Vi's charging Q.  Short range heals would work as they do now, whereas long range heals would increase the cooldown and cause more self-damage.\n\n>(nothing more frustrating than a safe healer). \n\nI disagree actually, there are plenty of more frustrating things in this game than a fragile healing champ that kills itself.

Yeah, a safe healer is extremely unfun to play, but she's a support that the current meta is *very* disapproving of: she is neither an engage support or a disengage support. Her CC is very weak and easy to dodge, and she herself is quite squishy (and is discouraged from building health). Healing is the *only* thing she provides to the team, and since you guys are doing a great job at making her healing involve danger and interaction with the enemy, it means that Soraka requires a lot of skill that doesn't really correlate with her impact on the game.\n\nFrom what I've been playing, Soraka excels when her team is self-sufficient. This means that her ADC needs to be safe and/or self-peeling (Ezreal, Caitlyn, maybe Jinx), and the other players need to be able to engage/disengage on their own. If these (extremely rare) conditions are met, Soraka shines brightly, being able to keep her entire team alive throughout an entire teamfight and easily pushing her team towards a great advantage.\n\nHowever, if these conditions are not met (because most people love to pick very squishy and unsafe champions that require a lot of support babysitting), Soraka's effectiveness compared to other supports falls drastically. She has virtually no peel, engage or pick potential, she can't heal people who are so squishy that they die in one hit, and she can't deal with high-damage, dive-heavy comps. She also struggles when her entire team is made of squishies (Riven top, Yi jungle, Lucian ADC and Zed mid, for example, your typical soloqueue comp) and she can't figure out who is the highest priority target to heal.\n\nTo be honest, I feel Soraka needs the W range buff, but she cannot afford any more nerfs. In fact, I'd say that 50 units of W casting, while very welcome, will not solve any of the above problems. She needs to be so good at what she does that she can actually compete with supports that offer heavy CC on top of utility, such as Morgana, Nami, Sona, Thresh, Janna and Leona. If you guys don't want to give her reliable hard CC or tankiness, that's fine, but she definitely needs more than what she already has in order to be a viable competitive pick. While the other supports I mentioned fit into any teamcomp, the fact that Soraka needs a specific teamcomp tailored after her indicates that she's not in a strong place right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fashion Mage","date":"2014-10-28T23:21:49.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> We might have pushed too far here, and another 50 range might do wonders while still keeping her vulnerable.

She also has poor wave clear until late game, she is easily countered by morel which gives the enemies more CDR along with stopping Soraka from doing her job. Why buff equinox? Because the enemy is just fine with walking over the supposely choke point at will for the given 2-3 seconds to actually strangle them to the ground. Q is just fine where it is, if it receives a buff she will become far too OP. Q gives a slow, healing and apply's item passive at a safe distance!\n\nIn my opinion, just decrease the time given to strangle on e. And CLARITY.

For instance, with the new Dragon granting increasing buffs, Soraka is naturally more powerful because she allows certain junglers to take dragon extremely early with her heals.\n\nStrangely enough i think Raka is in a pretty good status, minus some small blips here or there. Q's variable time length REALLY helps when i want to protect my carry at close range, and over time i've gotten used to the timing differences. Hitting it feels great at all levels, and really cements her power in counter engages. The slow part of her long ranged Q i feel is justified by the amount of harass she can consistantly do from such a far range. It creates some really interesting zoning potential that I've really enjoyed getting used to.\n\nI also completely understand the rationale behind the healing projectiles too. If i hit multiple targets with my Q i can get some pretty crazy amounts of hp back, and working around the travel times helps me optimize my healing, while also giving me much needed areas of weakness for when enemies come after me (Which they should given my shiny new importance as a pain in the ass healer) If Raka is too easily able to regain her Hp then she wont die, which needs to happen since she's so important now. a larger healing Radius would be quite nice though, since it can be outright oppressive at times when my teammates are always barely out of range since i need to be forearm deep in their healthpool to get them back to fighting stance. Again of course it can't be raised much since she needs to be vulnerable while healing.\n\nEquinox is really strong, but its already long Cd makes it super punishing if you miss it, especially since its soooo hard to get the root off in any practical situation, and is one of the bigger areas i feel raka has problems. Mobile carries get out of its range and straight to killing me or my carry with hardly any delay, and only really feel the pain when i have allies to keep them in the circle.\n\nIn regards to things i think new raka really suffers from i'd say she's a little too dependant on itemization to get catches (Long range Qs are nearly impossible to hit sweet spots on purpose, so i get FQC or Rylais to improve my catch chances) and that her passive has some unintended problems in revealing information to her enemies.\n\nOn occasion my jungler is low hp and fighting like golems or something. I randomly get my speed boost in a direction, which enemies can readily see to know that not only is someone near me, but that they're ripe for the killing. Since its a straight line, they also get a damn good sense of what direction and where my teammate may be, when otherwise they'd have no knowledge of it whatsoever.

As someone else mentioned, this is particularly troublesome in the jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Can","date":"2014-10-27T07:43:24.703+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"do the same for vlad ;^)","replies":[{"poster":"Joe Dredd","date":"2014-10-27T18:01:12.637+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> do the same for vlad ;^)\n\nFuck that shit","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"How Do You Meta","date":"2014-10-27T20:48:16.416+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her mana costs are also so high that I have to build a tear/chalice or both early on just to not go oom after one star call, equinox, and heal, ugh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"apuig","date":"2014-10-28T15:29:15.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if she gains a substantial speed bonus for every dead ally so she can run out of teamfights...in the current meta soraka, when the team is behind, ends up 0/15/X and the likes.

Placement of Equinox is key in teamfights, but the amount of sustain she offers the team is bananas. Likewise she can actually do a surprising amount of damage both in lane and in teamfights. Long range too!\n  -Cross map Cock-blocks\n  -HpS that Jesus wishes he had\n  -Brilliant counter-engage\n  -Throws bananas of destiny\n\nIn regards to the topic at hand though, i feel that it could be nice, but i think the current projectile speed is justified do to the amount of hp you can get back with it. Just the other day I managed to hit three people who were standing a little too close to each other, immediately regained about 60% of my max hp. Tbh i'm almost afraid of Soraka being buffed in this state, because she's already so powerful, and it would likely just lead to nerfs if she became popular. I think she's in a good state right now, She lacks alot of the playmaking skills and reliable cc other supports have, but she epitomizes the healer paradigm, and is one of the first supports that should almost be prioritized before the carries due to her sustain in prolonged fights.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2014-10-28T17:55:30.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may be late to the party and slightly off topic, but I feel that it's very hard to build Soraka in a satisfying way now. I never feel that my items are doing much good now. Building resistances on a back line support, building health with max health costs, building regen with most regen items coming with health, AP on an already very squishy champ...just feels bad and unintuitive. I think she's also one of the few champs that can't cast a spell at a certain amount of health, which is very frustrating if you've been managing your mana but healing your teammates regularly. Not being able to heal a teammate while having plenty of mana is bleh to me. \"Heal me!\" \"Can't, I'm OOH.\" \"OOH?\" \"Out of health.\"\nOther healing supports feel much better to build on due to their range and utility (Sona has healing boosted by target's missing health AND a shield) and Nami has harass and heal and speedboost all in one, or tankiness and CC (Alistar, Taric (that self heal is quite nice)). Builds on them make more sense without being punishing. They may not have sheer amount of healing Soraka has (healing someone so much is quite satisfying), but I don't feel scared to play them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheStormTroopers","date":"2014-10-28T16:39:25.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ill mainly be repeating what everyone else says by this point. The passive is nice but I hate seeing the arrow when I'm still half the map away from the target. I do not know the window to have the arrow and when the speed buff is given. The idea behind making the arrow red when in that range is nice, maybe more of a scaling color change from yellow to red as it shift towards red your speed increases. Her Q is nice kind of obnoxious at range being it takes longer to land but I'm okay with that. The heal from it should have a flat time to reach her though, trying to run away when enemies autos are hitting before the health is received is frustrating. Her W is not a very fun skill to have. I agree with the idea of her using her own health to heal others but  10% is excessive when you don't have very much to begin with. The range is so small when even trying to get to a team member during a fight may end up in their death. There needs to be some good if the range is going to be limited to heavily. The E I barely touch the thing since its massive CD and little good unless they have a Katairina jumping you.
