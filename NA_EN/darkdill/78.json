While that&#039;s good, there was a different update I had in mind:\n\n>At levels 11 or higher, Strut is no longer removed by minion damage.\n\nMiss Fortune would make a great split-pusher if she didn&#039;t lose her MS bonus to some pervert ranged minion every time she tried to push. It&#039;s a real peeve of mine that she can&#039;t compete with Sivir at split-pushing because minions can knock out her passive.\n\nWas this considered for Miss Fortune and found to be OP somehow?\n\n**EDIT**: Also, concerning that MF can get her passive back from using her W, it needs to also prevent her from losing it for a short duration like Teemo. Otherwise that bonus speed is worthless when you're being attacked.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-07-07T19:07:27.374+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they added this change in indirectly, though I might be reading it wrong. They said the passive only drops to \"direct, non-periodic damage\", which they said means shields will prevent her passive from dropping.

In a way it's not quite what you're looking for, but it can sort of function the same way.","replies":[{"poster":"gatchi","date":"2015-07-07T19:37:12.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if this also means Ignites wont drop it either.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-07-07T20:17:09.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I was wondering about that too; from the looks of it, ignite and other DoTs like poisons and stuff will drop it, since they're periodic sources of damage?

Well mainly so you could run a counter sustain lane and trade effectively against a sona/raka/taric or to deal with a vlad/swain/voli another reason was so you could get way ahead of your lane opponent by not having to buy boots till mid/late or ever for that matter. \n\nThe rework did nothing to address her scaling damage, her inability to 1v1 other adcs, the total lack of damage on her ult, or the fact that they made make it rain a 1 point skill and forced you to rely on the RNG of double up.\n\nSo now, you have a slightly better passive, no healing mitigation in lane, a \"make it rain\" that feels a little better in lane but has a shorter duration on the slow which is neither good nor bad since it just switches the instance of when its good to use vs when it was good to use before, and more damage on your Q that does next to nothing for a 1v1 and relies on RNG in a team fight as to what target it hits......\n\nThis rework does nothing but give her some extra semi random damage and takes away one of the primary things that made her unique and in return all she gets is some extra positioning and chase/kite ability, both of which she was already really good at and some cool new animations.\n\n\nDouble up sucks, that skill is what needed to be reworked, the fact that you can sucker punch some poor kid for 1/3 of their hp who doesn't really understand how it works or the fact it does retarded damage every once in awhile when your opponent is standing at a nice angle in lane or that its great to get some extra CS in a team fight when it randomly flies off and hits a minion that is on the opposite side of the lane that a team fight is taking place in does not merit keeping the ability. If anything changing it to work like a mini graves ult or having it bounce off the firs thing it hits then go in straight line so it becomes a matter of proper aiming rather than the game deciding that this time its going to hit the enemy champion but the next time it bounces off to the side like a fiddle E is not really that great on an adc.\n\n \nBut whatever, it's fun to go fast right? Least she's still awesome on dominion? Nice to be able to RNG a big dmg hit from long range every few tries no matter how you try to make it work? Guess it is kinda cool to build frozen gauntlet on her and create 2 slow fields? \n\nI dunno I was hoping like most people, that her AP scaling would get removed in favor of getting some actual abilities and having a Q that was not gimped in a 1v1 and only 60% useful in team fights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sungold","date":"2015-07-08T00:02:33.816+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"no she was not fine and this is still on pbe let's just wait and for more updates","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Goodzela","date":"2015-07-07T19:39:40.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice\n{{champion:21}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-07-07T19:37:05.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could see MF being potentially strong with the right team around her. Her Strut being able to stay up so long as she is shielded is pretty huge since she can move incredibly fast with it. Put her with Janna and Lulu or Orianna, a Bloodthirster, you're going to have an ADC who is going to have kiting potential just below Lucian and Kalista's level, but far more team utility with AOE slow and damage ultimate in the early/mid game.\n\nShe's essentially going to have a conditional personal mini Sivir ultimate to use for herself. \n\nCouple that with her W active, if in the off chance she loses her shield and subsequently the strut, she can reshield quickly, then activate W to bring the strut back for continuous movement. \n\nI'm looking forward to trying it as she's already an effective lane bully, this is only going to help her mid to late game out. It looks like she'll be a strong split pusher and early/mid game team fighter. \n\nI'm not crazy about the fact they took out her grevious wounds though, I'd really doubt it would make her oppressive in the lane, but we'll wait and see.","replies":[]}]}
