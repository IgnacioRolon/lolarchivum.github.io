It is a more subtle form of discrimination where one upholds the biased opinion and is only inhibited from displaying them due to social pressure. This is, at its core, a consequence of one not willing to examine the context when people are calling out discrimination.\n\nIn other words, it is the act of painting a stereotype and then calling it a \"'carbon-copy\" that is racist. I do not believe that people would be offended if they were given a truly fair treatment. \n\nTo give an illustration, consider the recent Oscar \"Asian Accountant\" scandal. It would be like saying \"oh, when we give an accurate portrayal of Asians, we gets called racist. Therefore all portrayal of Asians must be bad\".\n\n**Further Readings**\nSaid, Edward. \"Orientalism\" (1978)\nDouglas, Mary. \"Purity and danger: An analysis of concepts of pollution and taboo\" (1966), 2003 edition","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CoffeeDave","date":"2016-04-18T02:42:58.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't remember anyone saying anything about the Tauren from WoW.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2016-04-18T05:25:52.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It helps that the Tauren are humanoid cows instead of humans.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2016-04-18T02:51:04.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:77}} i think is the closest we have so far","replies":[]},{"poster":"Voidrey","date":"2016-04-18T02:00:45.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a pretty interesting idea, i'd imagine they would be located at either the Fyrone Flats or the Voodoo Lands","replies":[]},{"poster":"Goatfish","date":"2016-04-17T18:34:56.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2016-04-17T18:40:19.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woad refers to the Celts or Scottish, not Native Americans.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talos of Altmora","date":"2016-04-17T18:23:01.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as it's not offensive, then sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-04-17T18:15:20.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on whether they can pull it off well enough.
