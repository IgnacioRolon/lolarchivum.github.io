Lets call them...Order and Chaos. Then we have a champion who switches stances between abilities that utilize Order (Defensive, CC related abilities) and abilities that use Chaos (Aggressive, highly mobile abilities.) Whenever an ability consumes Chaos, it generates an equal amount of Order for the other stance to use, and visa versa. Simple enough for any player to pick up and immediately understand, but deep enough to allow for a variety of playstyles. Simple yet deep is the penultimate goal of design.","replies":[{"poster":"CubedJustice","date":"2015-04-06T03:31:01.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with a bar like the one you described is that it would influence a hit and run tactic, which would suck to play against.

I'm imagining it as a sort of Irelia for Order and Zed for Chaos. Rather than explaining deeper I'll just vaguely run over the idea I have.\n\nMain form is order because of its defensive stats or whatever. It's good at keeping you alive. When you run out of Order you need to go for damage so you switch to Chaos for mobility and damage, get the damage off, and switch back to Order in order (lel) to stay alive long enough for a second or third round of Chaos in order to be successful.\n\nWhile in Chaos, your Chaos bar should be automatically depleting over time (filling up your Order). This should start 2 seconds after changing form and is stopped by damaging enemy champions. This is to prevent the player from HAVING to all in the enemy champion(s) to regain Order (lel yet again) BUT isn't necessary. It all depends on how healthy the kit is. My understanding being that it'll be like Rengar where you can't stack a resource without damaging something. And while I suppose one could go into the jungle for a Raptor buffet I like the idea of waiting out the Order form in order to strike the Chaos form. Thinking back on this after writing ahead I think that both bars should be depleting and, upon reaching 0, should force a transformation.\n\nChampion has 0 MR / Armor\n\nOrder: Brand level mobility. MR/Armor is doubled. Gain 1 Order Stack (idk) on damaging an enemy with an ability or auto attack. This stack grants armor/mr per stack. Low stickiness and no real ranged abilities, but I'd like to see something ala a mini Janna ult that could be used to keep order via peeling for someone (including yourself). Could even have a short delay for added counterplay.\n\nChaos: Lucian level mobility. Walks to charge up ala Statikk Shyv and then can cast the ability. Very sticky but in a grab-release fashion. I'd like to think that champions should be able to \"get away\" from this \"cat\" of sorts chasing them down via some sort of trickery or quick reflexes. Any champion should be able to do this. Perhaps whenever one is damaged by Chaos they're given a short burst of movement speed or are launched in a direction that they can choose by quickly clicking (or by default simply ala Condemn if no player action is taken). Don't much care for this iteration, though. I DO like that it CREATES Chaos in fights. By adding Chaos to fights you make things more wild by more or less throwing enemies around (albeit wherever they want to go).\n\nIdk. It's very rough and I think I could figure out a proper kit with enough time. Woke up at 5:30am to mice though so glorious traps have been set and I'm still very tired. Adrenaline's wearing off.\n\nEdit: Just had a thought: What if this is instead made to be a sort of anti-dive champion. Like she/he just curls up to the ADC and pushes enemies away by \"pouncing\" on them a lot. Similar to Alistar but.. actually that sounds pretty bad. Nevermind.

Certain skills (destruction skills) consume destruction and gather vitality while vitality skills do the opposite (consume vitality and produce destruction). The aura doesn't kick into effect until the bar fills either way. At which point, the character glows briefly and the bar turns shiny. Remember that this is ONE bar, not two bars.\n\nOnce the bar turns shiny, the respective aura takes place along with the skill buffs. A fully charged destruction meter grants 100% crit on certain attacks as well as 100% crit on destruction skills. A fully charged vitality meter grants massively reduced CDs and mana costs on vitality skills. After the meter is charged fully, that aura can no longer be gathered until it's fully depleted.\n\nIf you use a destruction skill while the destruction meter is charging, it depletes it slightly (but the skill isn't buffed, as the meter didn't fill all the way)\n\nI don't think I explained it very well, so I'll put it in a bullet point form:\n- Mechanic known as WoTS takes the form of a special resource bar\n- There is one bar\n-  It can be filled with Destruction or Vitality\n-  Destruction skills charge vitality and consume destruction. Vitality does opposite.\n-  Once the bar is filled, a special buff is granted based on what aura it's charged with. The bar also glows, and that aura can no longer be gathered until the bar is fully depleted (Ex: If I charged destruction all the way and consumed a bit, vitality wouldn't charge the destruction bar until I consumed all of it).\n-  Destruction grants 100% crit on certain attacks and destruction skills, vitality grants massively reduced CD and mana costs on vitality skills\n- If a destruction skill is used while the destruction bar is in the process of charging, it depletes slightly but the skill isn't buffed.\n\nIn Elsword, it does offer a lot of fun strategy, as a large part of mastering the character is knowing when and how to charge each aura effectively.\n\nI realize that the effects of the bar in Elsword might (or would) be insane in LoL, I'm just putting them here for reference.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IllumanatiObama","date":"2015-04-06T18:45:02.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/U9cU4lgw-changes-to-aatroxs-w-ability-casts-and-basic-attacks-charge-up-w-passive\n\nHey, Meddler, I know this out of context with the thread but what would you think of these changes on Aatrox?

I think fury/energy is the best combo that i can think of where being out of combat for a short time resets both. While in combat your fury builds up while your energy gets expended.\n\nIf your missing energy is more than twice the fury you've generated then you can't cast abilities, but your AA do more damage, consuming some fury. Conversely if your fury is more than twice your missing energy then your AA deal reduced damage but your abilities get empowered, returning some energy. This way you can't play as a purely AD auto-attacker or a purely AP caster because then your two resources would become imbalanced. The depth comes from this resource management and choosing if you want empowered AA or empowered abilities at the expense of the other giving the champion higher burst, or higher dps. The nice thing is that the champion would not be able to have both at any given time, keeping them from becoming stupid OP as teamfights go on, while remaining strong either bursting with abilities or dot over the course of the teamfight. \n\nThe ideal play would be to keep these two resources in balance and/or briefly prioritize one over the other. \n\nThoughts?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-04-06T16:27:49.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about a different bar for different forms?
