Control of Drake doesn't secure you the game, it just increases your chances. You can still throw very easily, which is the case a good 60% of the time, believe it or not. And my point on the plant is pointless in this debate since I wasn't even mentioning the plant, I was mentioning RNG as a whole. I view RNG as very healthy if kept to a low level of benefit.

It's got a lot of strong sentiment in it that's valuable feedback. It's pretty light on discussion from in game experience with plants though (few actual PBE testers commenting), so it’s not a complete picture. \n\nAs with the other pre-season changes on the PBE plants are a work in progress. We’ve got some changes coming this week that should address a number of issues that have become apparent since the last set of changes (which occured just before PBE last week). Key details on those below. We’re also working on some backup plans for other possible issues that have been raised. For those sort of cases we want to have follow up plans ready in case they’re needed, but don’t want to make changes before things have been validated in game. Summary of those below too. \n\nThe biggest concern about plants themselves we've seen expressed overall is that they're random and that randomness has no place in a competitive game. Can fully understand the concern there, given randomness can make for pretty miserable experiences in game at the expense of player skill. We don’t think randomness is automatically a bad thing in a competitive setting though. We see it as more a tool that, if used in the right way, can create good tests of skill and emergent play or, if used badly, can nullify skill and create a ‘that was bullshit’ feeling. Examples of what we feel falls into each of those two categories:\n\n.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n.\n\n** Controlled Randomness in LoL at present we think is good for the game: **\n\n\n* Elemental Dragons\n\n\nHeavily telegraphed, rewards that support different strategies and counter them, system creates healthy game to game variety of experience. Equally available to both teams. \n\n\n* Kindred passive on enemy jungle camps\n\n\nCreates a series of risk/reward trade offs for the Kindred player that they’re free to engage with or not. Enemies can choose to try and counter or not. \n\n\n*  Scuttle crab’s exact location \n\n\nYou know roughly where Scuttle will be, and what the reward will be, but not the exact location it’ll be before getting there (assuming it’s up in the first place). Again, also equally available to both teams - it's a fair system, rather than one that biases in one direction or the other. \n\n\n* Draven axe landing location \n\nThere's some randomness to where an axe could land forcing an adaptive responsive. Possible locations are from a limited pool and, when appropriate are effectively non random (e.g. when chasing)\n\n.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n.\n\n** Randomness in LoL we think is or was bad for the game: **\n\n\n* Low % crit rates (higher % crit rates are also heavily debated, though a less clear argument)\n\n\nSmall amounts of crit (runes in particular) have a small chance to skew a lane pretty strongly without any engaging gameplay. Crit’s much less problematic once champions have a moderate amount of it (becomes consistent ish), though even then there are arguments it should be removed. Avoiding getting into details of that since that’s a different topic and this is already a long post already. Should talk more about it sometime though, especially since it’s a subject we need a better consensus on internally too. \n\n\nRegarding crit runes, we’ll be removing the ability to start the game with crit when we do work on runes (hopefully sometime next year)\n\n\n* Old Phage\n\n\nChance to slow on hit (mini, unreliable Frozen Mallet for anyone that didn’t play back then). Sometimes really lethal, sometimes completely ineffective. Did have some counterplay (e.g. only flash if the slow procs), overall though too much a case of randomness deciding situations rather than creating decisions. \n\n\n\n\n\n   \n.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n.\n\n** Next iteration base off feedback from PBE testers and internal playtesting: **\n\n\n\n\n* Fewer Blast Cone locations \n\n\nWe’ve been testing a pretty wide variety of Blast Cone locations recently, especially compared to early iterations of plants which only had a few. Conclusion there’s that some of those locations are good fits, others feel more abusive than interesting though and the large number of possible spawn points makes it hard to predict likely Blast Cone locations resulting in a more random than intended result. \n\n\n* Limit of 2 Blast Cones per quadrant \n\n\nWhen it happens 3 Blast Cones in a single jungle quadrant has been resulting in too much Blast Cone chaining, given the proximity between them that creates. Chained Blast Cones are much harder to respond to and the second use seems to be less deliberate by the user as well.\n\n\n* Seedling time to 60s (from 30s)\n\n\nIncreasing telegraph time on upcoming plants to improve ability to plan around their presence. \n\n\n* Reduced overall plant spawn rates \n\n\nPlant frequency has been too high in the version of the system currently on PBE, resulting in more frequent interactions than intended and therefore a greater overall impact on the game than desired. We’ll be reducing frequency of plant spawn a bit as a result.\n\n\n* Visual Polish \n\n\nOn the art side there’s also still some stuff yet to come (minimap icons that are clear but less dominant, icons for individual plants when clicked on, etc)\n\n\n.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n.\n\n** Other concerns we're tracking and preparing follow up changes if needed: **\n\n\n* Ranged versus melee discrepancy\n\n\nWe haven’t seen it demonstrated yet, but it’s definitely possible plants will be too advantageous for ranged champs over melee. Fallback if needed’s to make them operate like Thresh lantern where it’s proximity to plant the allows interaction, not basic attack. \n\n\n* Randomness deciding outcomes, \n\n\nWe want randomness to create a range of situations where player decisions and execution can then decide the outcome. If randomness is instead deciding situations however we’ll then want to add additional telegraphing, both to spawn times and locations until players are able to recall possible plant locations and play around the possibility of them being up in an informed manner.\n\n\n* Plant interactions still too frequent\n\n\nUpcoming changes might still leave plants too influential to the game and place too high an interaction burdern on players, junglers especially. Response there would be to continue to adjust spawn rate, maximum number possible per quadrant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApologies for the wall of text, lot to cover. I’ve to run off to a thing now, I’ll be back later though to post a bit more.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2016-10-25T00:04:55.652+0000","up_votes":59,"down_votes":4,"body":"See, the main problem is that the playerbase doesn't trust Riot to pull them if they flop even after all the changes. \n\nThere seems to be a heavy emphasis on \"Sunken cost fallacy\" when it comes to many of the decisions Riot makes.

If you look at a game like CSGO, sometimes players will try to jumpshoot over a wall for example. The accuracy is really random in this case but it's a risk taken by the player. He will jump knowing that he will probably not hit but still takes the risk. That's a good RNG mechanic for me because it's based on what the player chooses to do. If you look at crits in League, it works the same way. You state that low % crit is a problem. I don't think it is. The player trades his normal output damage for a small chance to hit a crit. That's a trade the player is willing to take. He's taking a risk by trading an AD rune for a crit rune. If he does not hit his crit, his rune choices did not help him in any way. The same way a CS player takes a risk when he jumpshoots and if he misses, he puts himself in a bad position.\n\nWhat you call good randomness in League like elemental dragons are not, in my opinion, in a game like League. It takes out the decision away from the player. If you cannot choose the drake spawn, you just have to deal with it. The variance between games is too great for me to make this game a good environment for competition.

We don't need useless plants.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zelorxon","date":"2016-10-24T12:19:45.167+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":8,"body":"Hey riot, just a quick brainstorming:\n-Nobody wants the plants in the jungle\n-Revert yorick's W and E changes, i want to cast my W outside range (because people haven't figured out yorick has to pick ghost since he deals damage as long as he's in range and this helps to set up those sick Ws) and i want to use my E on caster minions to push the wave faster, also i don't remember if you changed ult too but i'd like to have that change reverted too, if you did any, i want an intelligent being to assist my fights, not a hehexd running it down lane especially if i haven't attacked creeps yet\n-I GOT IT, YOU HATE SHYVANA, plese stop cucking her\n-I know that you guys at riot are la creme of bronze-gold-silver-plat, but, with your jungle changes to \"promote unique playstyles and jungle diversity\" you are missing the fact that this way you'll force the usual 6 champions pool in jungle and against a player that has played at least 2 games in jungle he will just ward it and screw over and over the enemy jungler since your paths are not predictable as fuck, they're FORCED, the same monotonous clear until it's late game enough that it doesn't actually matter, i know you want to \"promote cooperation\" by forcing the junglers in a shitty spot, but this won't be cooperation, this will be poverty, also i know you have been purposefully done stupid changes over 6 years just to fix them to enable a feeling of \"hey this game is never the same!\", not really, there have been like a dozen of patches that i actually liked and i wasn't forced to play around them since when i started playing (ashe was mid back then)\n-I noticed and i appreciate how you made almost every champion viable this season, but for the next season i'm afraid we'll fall back again into the \"aoe tanks and eternal sustainers\" in the jungle, and they'll become farming supports (nothing wrong with them, but it'd like to keep lulu, ori, ivern, nunu and karma to this role) like they used to be when junglers were forced to buy the most cheap tank items or just sacrifice everything for gold (I KNOW you want to \"promote choices in the jungle\", these aren't choices, this is a blackmail)\n\naaand for now i think, i'm done...\nas soon as i get new ideas i'll share the insight of this scrub noob right here\nsalutations!","replies":[{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2016-10-24T13:33:23.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why does Riot hate Shyvana?","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-10-24T14:46:32.961+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's kinda stat checky?
