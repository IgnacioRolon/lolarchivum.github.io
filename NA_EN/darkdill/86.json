Obviously, they have been more or less successful at that (I've certainly read quite a bit about the Shurima event, and the Freljord event).

(And unlikely doesn't mean never.)\n\nI.e. - completely spitballing here (thus totally hypothetical), I could imagine an event that visited the beautiful continent of Ionia, featuring Karma and Ahri independently trying to locate a recently activated magical artifact, before either Bard kicks off, or it is taken and used for evil.  Ahri for the sake of nature (and because she could use it to bargain for help with her condition), and Karma for her people (and the temptation to use it to defend them).  Seeing those two personalities interact (one totally selfless - the other just discovering morality) could be really interesting.  THIS IS JUST A RANDOM EXAMPLE WITH NO BASIS IN FACT OR EVEN RUMOR.  \n\n(Sorry for going on like that - but you know how it could go if I'm not careful.)\n\nI also wouldn't necessarily feel that events are the only time a champion could get more development.

My evening's not bad, though I think I may have just gotten in over my head and I've not eaten dinner yet.  You know how it can go.\n\nPersonal opinion on the Chapter#1s?  I think that it's easy to schedule writing a chapter 1 for a new champion that has absolutely nothing - but that it's harder to decide that a champion needs a chapter 2 by a certain date.  It seems a lower priority, especially compared to new champs, champ reworks, and other urgent schedule hogs.  It just keeps getting knocked off the priority top spot by anything else.\n\nI think that the outcry has yes, finally, been heard by the right people (it had been heard by lots of people before, ofc) and the beast that is Riot is paying attention to how threadbare that part of its wardrobe has been.  How fast it can move to fix it?  I don't know.  As you know, it can't be an overnight fix with just one wave of a hand, or one piece of written lore - it will have to be a shift accompanied by multiple examples.  So, in a lot of ways - no, it can't move fast enough to meet the demands of players - because it wasn't fixed years ago.  It's impossible to move fast enough to fix that.  I think it can move fast enough to _start _fixing things and make improvements - but for some players they have already decided it's too little too late.  Which is fair - each player makes that decision for themselves.\n\nHmmmmm.  My choice for chapter 2... That's a tough one for me.  I've got a 1 in 125/126 of picking the one you might agree with me on :)  For me, I think I'd like to see a continuation of Sona or Kalista.  Sona because she's got some places she probably needs to visit to learn more about herself.  Kalista because it'd be good to learn about her pre-Shadow Isles, and even learn about all of Runeterra through the souls and personalities that she bargains with.

I want to see where Morgana/Kayle go without the IoW to be a stand-in for their conflict back home. Jaredan made a few soft promises about keeping them otherworldly and not pigeon-holing them into a known place of Runeterra.... With that being said, as history has shown for most of us, I am very anxious and nervous to see what happens with my favorite characters. The problem with retcons is that everybody suddenly realizes how precarious their relationship with their favorite champions are. At a moment's notice, what you loved about your champion can be removed arbitrarily, and that sucks.\n\nThanks for diving into some of those questions. I know I'm not the only one who believes this but, it's nice to have a Rioter (yourself) who seems to be able to sit on the fence and have both a Red perspective, and a player perspective. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a Rioter who validates the anger and frustration that the community has, and publicly vocalize it as you do. I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate that, it reminds me of Riot's early days when the devs were players first, and devs second.\n\nOnto some less heavy stuff... So chapter 2's essentially get bumped off the list of priorities in lieu of releasing champion-related content? I don't mean to sound cyncical, and mayhaps I'm just misunderstanding what you wrote (which is fair, the flipside being mayhaps you didn't write what you meant) but, are you suggesting that Riot prioritizes lore related to releases over that of story continuation? Isn't this exactly what the lore fans have feared for ages, which is that \"If it isn't selling something, the lore isn't going to be written.\"? That seems like a pretty shitty structure for a team that should be prioritizing the universe's IP over sales or hype...\n\nI wish Jaredan+Co. (seriously I have to write +Co. because so few of them actually come out except for the champion AMAs...) would do a post-mortem on Narrative's shortcomings in the past few years. Obviously Jaredan was not at the helm, and not responsible for some of the earlier fuck-ups but it would be interesting to hear their thoughts on where this first went awry, and how they would have done it better.\n\n\nI think we're all nervous for this reveal like you've pointed out in a previous post. Riot and the fans are looking at this next event with bated breath. If it flops, I may be a bit early with this but, I think that will be the absolute end of the dedicated lore fanatics... I'm genuinely afraid if that comes to fruition.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-06-25T05:35:39.130+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Starlighte,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=ldbzJF3U,comment-id=000000000000000100000001,timestamp=2015-06-25T05:19:53.615+0000)\n> \n> Onto some less heavy stuff...

It's not a complete champion unless it has some art, some effects, a gameplay kit, and a bit of personality and lore.  (I say a bit, because those 2 sentence lores aren't kidding anyone - they're not the long lores written by the narrative team and waiting for the tech fix, but if it's not in your hands, what do you care?)\n\nBut if I champion has reasonable art, it doesn't get scheduled for a VU.  If a champion isn't too unbalanced, then it doesn't get a buff or a nerf (or a rework).  If it has even the faintest hint of a background, then it doesn't bump those other things off the list to fix a game-breaking lore issue.\n\nWe could argue that some of those lores or lore changes do indeed break the game for people - but that's not as objectively clear as saying \"This champ's win rate is 70% - it NEEDS a nerf!\"\n\nIt's not that it was selling something, it's that new champs have nothing at all - so they get priority.\n\nRemember, too - this is my opinion as to why these things happened.  Don't go claiming that this is the 100% unvarnished truth of the matter.  I may be missing context on any number of things.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-06-25T12:30:37.899+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=ldbzJF3U,comment-id=0000000000000001000000010000,timestamp=2015-06-25T05:35:39.130+0000)\n>\n>\n> It's not that it was selling something, it's that new champs have nothing at all - so they get priority.\n> \n> \n\nThank you for talking on the boards Bio.

One of the additional reasons could be that new champs have nothing at all.\n\nFor example, if the _only_ motivating factor was selling something, then wouldn't skins be the biggest target for stories and narrative?  They, after all, cannot be earned exclusively through play (barring events or kind teammates).  Instead it is new champs that have, in the past, got the majority of attention - champs that you can unlock with IP.  I'm not saying that Riot is a bunch of money-hating angels - just that if money was our _sole_ motivator, I think there'd be some differences. :)\n\nSo yes - we are selling new champs, and new champs have gotten the attention - but I believe there's at least one more factor involved in the decisions in the past - and there may be more factors that I don't even know about.  \n\n> I think this is one of the major problems.

They've said as recently as September of last year (when they scrapped Lifetime RP rewards) that they don't want players to feel compelled to buy RP for any reason.  Yet, this latest event hypocritically destroys that notion.\n\nOk, so here's how I see the Pool Party event (and I was in chat rooms and 5-man premades all weekend, trying to help get those points, too!)  \n\n**Personal opinions below:**\n\nRioters are generally competitive by nature - they play League of Legends, an intrinsicly competitive game.  So when they came up with the list of goals - sure, they very likely had a list showing the typical play patterns of players over a window like that.  They'll have set some of the targets to be easy gimmies - things that, even if no-one knew about the event, would be 'earned'.  Then they'd have set some to be interesting goals - ones that, if anyone knew about the event, but didn't much change their play patterns over, that we'd get, but it'd be a close thing.\n\nBut now the competitive element kicks in.  Players (Rioters) who are _that_ competitive, hate the idea that there are only \"Good try!\" medals.  I strongly suspect that they looked at the number of people playing 5-man groups, and estimated an amount that that could increase by, if the community really went all out.  I ALSO think that they looked at the amount of RP out there already sat in people's accounts, and estimated how many people might try and give the event a nudge with some of that spare RP.\n\nThose estimates look like they were wrong.  Did you know, within Riot, we got an email encouraging us to get out there and play more 5-man premade games?  I was already doing so, but internally we were trying to hit that goal too.\n\nI honestly don't think the goal was to have players who are less financially flush throw down money they can't spare to get us to that stretch goal.  I think it was hoping that the people who have some RP lying around (or those fortunate and more financially flush players who maybe wanted to send a friend a skin, but kept forgetting) would think this was a good time to pull that trigger.  I think they thought that there are lots of people who play League and that if enough played in 5-man premades worldwide, we'd get there with _great effort_!\n\nDidn't happen.  \n\nMaybe it couldn't happen and the numbers were wrong.  The goal is never to make players feel bad about playing League, or for spending RP - so if that's what happened, then there'll be a lot of red faces over on that team right now.\n\nMaybe you want a consolation prize - but I don't think that's going to happen.  That would be the \"Good try!\" medal I was talking about earlier, and that would cheapen the efforts that people DID put in over the event.  I never want people to sit there, saying \"What?!  I played over a dozen 5-man premades that weekend, and it didn't mean anything!

I think that they thought that a tiny percentage chance of success could be an exciting challenge!  I think that percentage was clearly smaller than we, as players, liked.

NaKyle also said that they had to \"responsibly\" offer bigger rewards when gifting became a thing.\n\nSince no one at Riot has come out and clarified what this really means, I have taken it to mean that the event team had to recover potential lost revenue if the players did reach level 6 and get the free champ and skin.  Therefore, RP purchases and spending (on other people) needed to grow to reach that ultimate goal.\n\nSince the goal was not met, Riot gets to keep all that money anyways (win-win for you guys, lose-lose for us players).\n \n> Those estimates look like they were wrong.

The goal is never to make players feel bad about playing League, or for spending RP - so if that's what happened, then there'll be a lot of red faces over on that team right now.\n\nWe don't know that for sure.  Maybe they're happy there weren't too many bugs with the system and aren't embarrassed about having set an impossible goal.  We don't know for sure because no one outside the writer of the event has said anything, and even then he is only giving the tired cliches of \"we messed up the tuning\" and \"we're learning so we can do better next time.\"\n\nIf they made a mistake with their estimates and made a goal that was impossible to reach without excessive RP purchases, intentionally or not, then they should come forward and admit it.\n\n > Maybe you want a consolation prize - but I don't think that's going to happen.

What I'm asking for is that someone involved in the _planning of the event_, not the promotion, to step forward and explain their reasoning behind putting these goals where they did.  Maybe an AMA, but I suspect it would be a very hostile situation for all involved.\n\nSimply put, if the PP Mundo goal was _possible_ through higher than average gameplay, they can demonstrate that it was reachable, and we just didn't play enough to reach it, I'd be okay with that.  However, intentionally or otherwise, if the effort to reach Level 6 _required_ higher than normal RP purchasing and gifting (which goes against what buying RP is for), then I'd like to see Hippalus and his crew _admit_ that.\n \n> I suspect their mistake was making a list of goals that had a top-tier result that would have required herculean premade-team effort across all regions.  I'm talking Guinness Book Of Records level of effort.  We, the players, got Olympian silver.

There is a huge difference between \"we lost because we didn't try hard enough,\" and \"we're lucky we got silver because the organizers shot us in the foot milliseconds before the race started.\"\n\nAnd while the lower tiered goals are nice and the community should be proud of reaching them, that's of little consolation to those among us who feel that the top prize was not possible beyond a huge change in spending habits.\n \n> I can pretty much guarantee, however, that they'll think very very hard about where to set the targets next time round.\n\nAnother Riot cliche?  \"We'll do better next time!\"  Heard that so many times from Riot, it means little to nothing anymore. \n \n> Hang on, let me do a tl;dr because I want to make sure I've addressed your points.\n> **I don't think it was set up to guarantee a fail - I think it was set up to ALMOST CERTAINLY fail.**\n\nWhat's the realistic difference?  Are we talking about a miniscule percentile chance (less than 1%) versus no chance at all?\n\n>**I think that they thought that a tiny percentage chance of success could be an exciting challenge!  I think that percentage was clearly smaller than we, as players, liked.  They'll be looking at the numbers and the feedback reeeeal carefully now.**\n\nAnd I believe that the chance of success was far less than was actually possible and the only people who can clarify this difference in opinions will never talk to the actual player base (the millions not employed by Riot) about their intentions and reasoning.\n\nAll the feedback is fine, but I'm afraid that the lessons they learn will be closer to \"let's tell the players they need to buy and spend RP to reach the top goal\" rather than \"let's make sure the goal is reachable without making players spend money.\"\n\nAddendum:  I was under the impression that requiring RP purchases was something Riot frowned upon, especially considering how plans for Lifetime RP rewards were scrapped because too many within Riot didn't want players pressured into buying RP.  Now, less than a year later, Riot created a community event where RP purchasing is required to reach the top goal.

It says that it was supposed to encourage gifting and encourage playing with premade teams.  I suspect you'll say I'm splitting hairs or being disingenuous, but for every gift given at the end of match screen, only 4 more matches needed to be won by a premade, somewhere on the planet.  I keep thinking that we could have done it with just a LOT of games.\n\n> \"[–]RiotHippalus 123 points 4 days ago \nYou're partly right. We do know how much people normally play and gift and we set up the event to give a couple rewards just for doing that, and bigger rewards **if players increased their playing and/or gifting**. We had to guess at how players would respond and we set it up so that greater effort would yield greater rewards, including a couple of **stretch goals that were tough to reach**.\nThe goals of the event are to 1) get the community to pull together to earn rewards, 2) increase playing with friends, 3) increase gifting, and 4) learn the pros and cons of these types of events to help decide if we want to do more of them and, if so, what are the most important things to improve next time.\"\n\n..\n> _Who_ sent the email?

It was sent by someone with the title eCommerce Manager.  It was sent out to encourage Rioters to join chatrooms and get into premades and help earn points with players.  So it wasn't (as you suspected) sent out on day 0.  \n\nAlso, I've known a lot of game devs who miss emails - but this one was sent to the biggest riot email list - every single Rioter on the planet is supposed to be on that list.  Admittedly, in the grand scheme of number of players, Rioters are a teeny tiny drop in the ocean, but I at least can hold my head up and say I tried to help.\n\n> This is where I disagree.

If there's THAT much spare RP lying around in the League world, then **the eCommerce team should be working on making cool stuff for us to spend that RP on** rather than requiring gifting to reach a goal that would otherwise be impossible through gameplay alone.\n\n(Emphasis mine)  ABSOLUTELY AGREE.  That would be the best option by far!  Figuring out new things to spend RP on is a really delicate thing, though - needs to feel worthwhile and valuable, without breaking the gameplay.\n\n> For what it's worth, this analogy is really awful.  There is a huge difference between \"we lost because we didn't try hard enough,\" and \"we're lucky we got silver because the organizers shot us in the foot milliseconds before the race started.\"\n\nMy analogies can often stink - I admit that.  Sorry.  What I meant was that we didn't lose - we got almost all the rewards.  I know it doesn't feel like that to you, and that's a problem on our side.  \n\nI also realize that this conversation can't really go anywhere, because it's just you and I stating what we believe with the information that we both have.  I don't know if it's feasible for the eCommerce team to come forwards with hard numbers on players, premades before the event and premades during the event - it's possible that's considered proprietary information that could confer a competitive edge.  I honestly don't know.  We don't usually publish player numbers.\n\nI will promise you, right now, that I will send an email to the eCommerce manager who sent the email and ask him if there's anything that can be done to provide better clarity on the achievability of the final goal.

It could definitely use some tweaking, I agree :)  Not my best work.  Having a new game mode or item associated with an event is always a big deal, of course - and I think I'd be wary of having something specific to bringing a particular champ to a game.  Simply because if no-one brought Ahri or Karma, does the game break down?  What if two people both want to play Ahri?  I wouldn't want to bring extra drama to the pick phase of League!\n\nOf course, you could (if we had lots of time and money) theme the two sides of a map - one for Ahri and one for Karma.  Start a game blue side?  Then you fight for Karma!  Actually - scrap that - it doesn't really make you feel like you're fighting FOR or with someone, if you get randomly assigned their side.  Hrm.  I suspect I'd want to put more thought into it (and get other designer input) to create an event that didn't just feel random - and ideally one that made me feel like I was really interacting with something uniquely Ionian!

Or does Riot even view anything they've done as a mistake?

How could we incorporate the key elements of Trundle’s personality into this new narrative? What we came to was an approach that preserved what we felt were key elements of Trundle’s personality, but with a fresh new identity that built him into the story of the Freljord and provided huge opportunities for storytelling in the future. \n\nThis doesn't sound like a great start to fit a champion into the new lore to me. He got a new character to fit the story, preserving naught but a couple of key elements of the old character that would fit with the new character.\n\n***\n\n**All this being the case, of course I think big changes are being done flippantly and without care.**\n\nI'm not convinced Riot has learned anything relevant yet.
