Freesia also gains a shield that absorbs up to 60/70/80 (+0.2 AP) damage for each enemy Champion hit, and lasts up to 6 seconds.\n\n>_Maximum shield strength: 300/350/400 (+1.0 AP)_\n\n>If Freesia last used Spirit Samba on an allied unit, Grand Finale will knock back all enemies struck. If Freesia last used Spirit Samba on an enemy unit, Grand Finale will vacuum in all enemies struck.\n\nThe idea of this is that Freesia is constantly darting between allied and enemy Champions, and using this she can select between either a pushback or a vacuum with her ultimate (but not both at the same time). This can lead to some awesome plays, or terrible terrible mistakes, separating &quot;good from great&quot; players.\n\nBut would such an ultimate be too packed?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-03-09T05:49:37.350+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vacuums risk creating extreme differences between average case and best case scenarios when paired with other champions. There's still a need to balance noticeably around the best case synergies though, so they can be pretty problematic both in terms of balance and in terms of how they warp team comps. We tend to be pretty cautious of them as a result.\n\nPolarity kits (if A do X otherwise if B do -X) can be really punishing on the player. In most situations the cost of failure is that you don't do the thing you're trying to do (skillshot misses for example) or you get a less optimal result (only hit one person with an Amumu ult instead of the team). With a polarity approach however failure means you get the exact opposite of the result you were trying for. That is a way to increase a character's skill ceiling, it also makes their skill floor a lot more difficult too however. It's often not a great way to give a kit more potential for mastery compared to other options as a result (assuming a goal of easy to learn/hard to master of course, if that's not a principle being used it's a different story).","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2016-03-09T06:38:03.895+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ahh, I see. Even if there was an indicator over your head telling you which direction the ult will send your opponents, it'd probably be too high-difficulty to be fun?\n\nGuess I'll need to consider other ultimates.

At that point though you're just giving one champion their choice of two extremely powerful effects and even then there's some potential for really punishing failure as outlined.\n\nI'd start by answering the question of why, in gameplay terms (not thematics), a high mobility support would be a good idea, besides just novelty. That should offer some principles to assess ult options by.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2016-03-09T07:33:28.822+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Novelty is one thing, but it also enables the creation of extremely mobile compositions that can just completely outmaneuver slower enemies, without leaving a slow support behind to get ripped apart by a chaser.\n\nEver had a moment where your ADC is Ezreal, Corki or Lucian, and they go over a wall and leave you behind? They go too far ahead of you, and then die and blame you on the context of \"keep up, dammit!\" when you couldn't possibly keep up as, say, Soraka or Janna (without using Flash). Braum can sorta get around this, but doesn't also zip around like Lee Sin in a ward network.\n\nAdditionally, in my design, a high-mobility support would be short-ranged and lacking poke, requiring more decisive action on behalf of the player. You wouldn't be able to just sit back and do nothing against someone like Sona or Nami, who would otherwise poke you to death, but engaging at the wrong time can mean death. Unique disadvantages, but it would also enable unique strengths.\n\nMost importantly, a highly-mobile support hasn't really been done yet (supports with haste effects don't count). It'd be totally new to the lineup, and would open up some very distinct playstyles.\n\nWhether or not those are good enough reasons is probably something you'd know more about.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot mEMurr","date":"2016-03-10T20:51:24.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My argument against a high mobility support would be to ask about its underlying function. Generally, high, continual mobility is tied to assassins who need to get close or someone like Lee to set up ganks. Their strategic decision is when to commit and aim for a kill. What's the play pattern for a support who has multiple dashes and how does it add to the game? Simply dashing in and out to do damage without much room for retaliation (like a Leblanc) could make for a pretty toxic lane. If there's a reasonable timeframe for opponents to retaliate and your support is squishy, then a lot of your success is based on your opponents messing up rather than you making the right choices. \n\nIn addition, you do have short ranged support champions like Leona and Thresh who have a gap closer and have to time when to go all in. They have the dynamic of all-in or get poked down. \n\nI would also argue that mobile ADCs going over a wall is often an edge case. I feel like this only happens a couple of times a game with these champions, which means it wouldn't be a core part of the identity. In addition, these ADCs are dicks if they then yell at you :P\n\nFinally, I think extreme mobility champions increase the skill discrepancy between ELOs. It makes for greater balancing difficulties while potentially resulting in an underpowered champion for a large amount of the userbase.\n\nI think there's some really cool thematic ideas here, but I also think there should be some more consideration for the people playing against your champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ULTRAF0RCE","date":"2016-03-10T02:08:56.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally kind of like the idea but, perhaps the champ could do some kind of escape like ability to help their ally however not in a way similar to tahm, maybe more like a thresh w where you are able to help a teammate change their position in a less safe but faster way then Tahm but also maybe with more of a focus on helping to start a fight or bring a champ into the fight instead of keeping them away from the fight. It could work as a replacement for the q as if you want to have a true focus on the idea of a mobile support, Whatever the decision I find her very intersting, though just a tip\n\n\nTo me personally one of the champions who feels the most nimble is Jinx after getting a kill in the middle of a team fight, she doesn't gain cc immunity or even any form of dash but if the movement speed is a massive boost and the animation is good you can feel nimble and fast without having to actually rely on dash or blinks, The new Quinn also gives off this feeling in that your ult a level 16 makes you feel crazy fast but if you get hit by minions even though you only go down to the normal movement speed for quinn you feel slow because of how its communicated to you.\n\n\nBest of Luck{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hi Im Gilphi v2","date":"2016-03-09T14:57:21.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"its a horrible and bad idea","replies":[{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2016-03-09T18:13:53.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-03-10T17:05:38.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saying it's bad is fine (everyone is entitled to their opinion), but at least give some sort of reason for it.

Here's Freesia's new ultimate!\n>**Show-Stealer Salsa**\nFreesia dashes to target enemy Champion (550 range) and steals 20/25/30% (+1% per 50 AP) of the target's attack damage and ability power for 6 seconds. Freesia can then recast this ability within 3 seconds to dash to target allied Champion and transfer the stats she stole to her target, increasing their stats for 6 seconds. If Freesia does not transfer the stats within 3 seconds, they are lost.\n\n>All stat modifiers decay over their respective duration. The stats given to your ally are equal to the amounts you initially stole.\n\nShe needed a good reason to be picked, and now she's got one really good one. If you're expecting the enemy team to be banking their offense on one character, or an enemy player gets out of control, just use Show-Stealer Salsa and you have the opportunity to turn your enemy's offense into a strength for one of your teammates. But it's not a given deal; you first have to dash onto that enemy and then get away from them within a short time limit, all while the enemy is trying to slaughter you.
