Rather, we need to go back and re-assess what the value of a good death recap is. We don't want to go the combat log route; raw information is rarely actionable. Likewise, I'm not entirely clear on how the existing implementation is useful outside of letting you know how much magic or physical damage you took. We'll probably update it at some point in the future once we knock out some competing UI features, but if we do, expect more of a redesign.","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2014-07-18T08:48:38.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"You admit their are bugs in the program and your attitude towards this is \"It MAY NOT BE WORTH IT\" \n\nReally?

It's not--in the example of restoring a property, AND in the case of fixing the death recap code, C is actually EASIER than B.\n\nRather, the functional resourcing difference between B and C is that there's a lot of other pieces too, like Game Design, UX Design, Visual Design, etc. I also see several arguments around \"why haven't we fixed X or Y other issue\". Some bugs are easy, others are not. The Shen problem, for example, I believe *just* got a fix internally by one of our awesome gameplay engineers--and from what I understand, that one was really, really hard. There's a lot that goes into how easy a bug is to fix, and how high on the priorities it is to address it. Obviously we'd want to fix every bug ever, but that's unrealistic given the amount of content we have and are constantly adding.\n\n* How much player pain does the bug cause? The scale goes from inconvenience to making the game unplayable.\n* How easy is the bug to reproduce? As with the Shen issue, if the bug only occurs 1/100 games and has no known reproduction steps, then tracking it becomes much more difficult.\n* How deep is the cause? Fixing a small issue can have far-reaching consequences, like breaking something that's seemingly unrelated--such as a dependency ON the bug because another developer assumed the bug was intended functionality.\n* How much time will the bug need to be fixed? My team (clarity) has two game engineers--losing one to a sprint of bug fixing can be disastrous for our release timelines if it means our other team members get hamstrung.\n\nIn the case of death recap, it's a combination of low player pain (the accuracy of individual damage numbers isn't important in providing actionable information!), poor understanding of reproduction (why does it sometimes say the Dominion aura does damage? No one knows!), a VERY deep root cause, and VERY lengthy fix times.

It is their job to fix bugs like this, yes, but the sheer amount of code that must be sifted through is daunting.  the old rengar triple q bug (going back in time a bit) could have been caused by the aa animation, the q animation, the code making the q function, or some weird code that came out of hydra.  shifting through that, finding the bug, and fixing it takes a really long time, which rengar players around the world would be really mad at riot for leaving their champion disabled for that much time (i'm guessing a few days here, but that's just a blind guess).  edit:  using the same numbers as below, this would stop just over 2.1 million people per day from playing the champion that they wanted to.  \n\nthe other option would be to not notify the community about said bug.  for the sake of simple math, let's say that 10% of rengar players know about the bug and are exploiting it in their games (taking a high estimate here).  27 million people log onto lol each day (source: http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/01/27/riots-league-of-legends-reveals-astonishing-27-million-daily-players-67-million-monthly/ ), and let's say that on average each person plays 2 games (again, to make the math easier) when they log on.  rengar has been picked in an average of 16.04% of games (from 6/24-7/17, source: http://www.lolking.net/champions/rengar#statistics ) so [(27,000,000 games/day / 2 games/person) *.1604 rengars/game * .1 bug exploits/rengar] = roughly 217 thousand people affected by this bug, or 8% of the playerbase every day, assuming i did my math right (this is also a high estimate).  in the grand scheme of things, this is not very much, especially when a lot of those games are unranked.  \n\nThis second option is much more appealing, since it allows the community to continue having fun with the champion, while only affecting a small amount of the players.  At least, that's how I have reasoned it, with quite a few assumptions as noted above.  Another note to consider is that the % of games that rengar is used in is skewed by a huge jump in popularity due to him being free to play for the last 3 days of the graph (7/15-7/17).  Also none of these numbers reflect how much rengar was banned in normal draft or ranked, as those games are simply \"he wasnt picked\" games.\n\nTo your last comment about white knighting for them, i'm probably guilty of that, but I can see your point too.  Using my logic above, why not fix the death recap bugs?  it affects almost 100% of players!  yes it does, that much nobody can really argue (other than to say not 100% of players use death recap, but ignoring that), but the point Les Nomerables was making is that it's not as game-breaking of a bug as the infinite death yorik bug (where he'd die under his ult, and instantly be revived with 1 hp, be killed, be revived, be killed, etc thousands of times over a few minutes).  Would it be much more convenient for everyone if it (death recap) was fixed?  yes.  but riot has prioritized other fixes or new content above this one, under the assumption that those fixes and content will affect gameplay and overall experience more.\n\n\nsorry about the super long post!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ptarlorr","date":"2014-07-19T01:06:19.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for not being a silly person.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SlashStriker","date":"2014-07-18T22:27:27.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would like to know when i die the\ntotal amount magic damage taken and\ntotal amount physical damage taken\nthe current death recap doesnt do this job very well","replies":[]},{"poster":"Funster","date":"2014-07-18T14:49:28.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was gonna say something along those lines. I typically only use death recap after 5v5 teamfights just to get a general idea of the balance of incoming AD/AP damage so I can better judge which defensive items to grab. Simplifying it in to just raw damage numbers would be pretty sweet. I don't really care what did damage to me (I saw it in the fight, since I was there and all) but a simpler sum of all the damages would be nice (and probably less buggy!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"exec3","date":"2014-07-18T09:23:06.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the few things that Dawngate has done well is its death recap.

Okay, good. Now go make a list of the things that need to be improved about Champions, Itemization, the Client, and the Patcher in order of priority. Now, look to see where \"buggy death recap\" ranks on that list and tell me whether that's really where Riot should prioritize allocating their resources. Pretty damn far down the list, right?\n\nAlso, the Death Recap is the one place you don't want information overload. The Match History rework was great, but we don't need much information in a death recap. Death Timers are short, and you should be buying items and planning your next move during this time. Anything more than Spells that hit you, and the damage they dealt is unnecessary clutter. Now what would be interesting is an automatically generated 5-10 second clip preceding your death that would allow you to view the mistakes you made that led to your death. That's likely pretty hard to put in though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"tamorrak","date":"2014-07-19T04:06:42.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To the people complaining in this thread about the fix not being immediate, please try to remember a few things. First: things take time, getting grouchy over it isn't going to make it move any faster, and even though Riot promises an upcoming fix that fix may take a long time to make it functional with the rest of the game. Second: Manpower is limited. Yes Riot is popular but that doesn't mean that they have an infinite amount of programmers and game-designers to fix every problem all at once. For those not following me that means that there may not be people to immediately work on a fix. In short be patient and let Riot do their thing, because if they say it isn't happening I doubt pouting over it is going to do any good","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cerbearus","date":"2014-07-18T16:55:06.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is odd when Garen uses Mystic shot on you for 800 true damage...","replies":[]},{"poster":"cshakes","date":"2014-07-18T10:55:56.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I'd like would be a sort of bar chart. Say, you're killed by a Vayne, and a Janna gets an assist. The \"Killer/Assist\" bar at the top with the champion name and icon would be the same, but there would be three vertical bars, one each for true, physical and magic damage received from said champion. The bars would be divided by ability. So, Vayne's \"true damage\" bar would just show \"basic attack\" (or, even better \"Silver Bolts\"), and her \"physical damage\" bar would show, say, \"basic attack\", \"Tumble\", \"Condemn\" and \"Blade of the Ruined King\". For any skills that applied CC, it'd say that you received CC - eg. \"Condemn - X damage. Stun.\" \"Howling Gale - Y damage. Knocked airborne.\" and \"Zephyr - Z damage. 28% slow.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnowFall","date":"2014-07-18T09:23:06.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suggest a short replay after every death with slo-mo effect when you're about to die, that could really solve a lot of misunderstandings; also you press any key if u wish to end replay\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Lexer","date":"2014-07-18T00:28:19.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.
