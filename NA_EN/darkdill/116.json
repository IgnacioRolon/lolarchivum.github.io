But change happens because if it didn&#039;t, things would be fucking boring!\r\n\r\nYou know what else is boring? Ryze on live right now. You just faceroll the keyboard without even aiming and hope the target dies before you do. That is freaking LAME. Ryze presently is my least-liked mage because he&#039;s got absolutely no finesse to him.\r\n\r\nAnd you know what else? If you&#039;d check his statistics right now, he&#039;s ABSOLUTE CRAP!\r\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Ryze\r\n\r\nRyze definitely needs to be updated. Maybe this update will work. Maybe it won&#039;t. But he won&#039;t get any better if he just stays the way he is.","replies":[{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2015-04-09T23:41:35.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its not that change is bad.\n\nIts that _biased, badly planned change is bad_.\n\nHeck, even the bonus CDR is crap! 30% is unnecesary when FH has 20% CDR. The person making this rework has never played Ryze.\n\nAlso, Q a nerfshot and W less snare duration? What is exactly the point of this? More mobility biased changes. Another point and click cc THAT IS NECESSARY TO DEAL WITH HYPERMOBILE CHAMPIONS, **GONE**.\n\nLess scaling on everything, too.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-10T01:05:59.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why still building FH when you can get 40% of CD without items ¬¬\n\nThe same to Spirit Visage he don't need CD items now...\n\nNow you build oriented in AP, mana and move spd items to catch and kite safely, the E now its a more spammable skill, the Q have more Range, you can't harrash across minions but cost less mana, so you can farm more safety, his W snare its 1.1s at level 1 (the actual is 0.75s at level 1) so its this skill that max to the end. his R have less CD in later levels, no more cd items, so welcome to the fasty thunder smurf!!!\n\n{{champion:13}} : {{item:3040}} {{item:3027}}  {{item:3800}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3026}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-04-09T22:57:57.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Forum rule 0: People will complain.
