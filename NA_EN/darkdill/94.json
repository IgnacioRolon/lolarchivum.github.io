You have to remember that cinematics are often only a _piece_ of the story we tell when a champion is released, and that sometimes a piece is all we want you to have because that can actually show you who a champ is _better_. Follow me down this path...\n\nSo take a look at a champion like Jhin. He was really really hard to deal with. How do you show players how completely messed up that guy is? Well... that's the thing... to Jhin, the horrifying parts of life are beautiful. So we wanted to show that. We wanted to abstract death for players in the same way that he abstracts it for himself. We made something enigmatic, beautiful, but just a little bit eerie.\n\nWhile A New Dawn is flipping awesome, I don't think it's tremendously compelling from a narrative point of view. It's just a really _really_ cool fight.\n\nNow personally, I would really like to see longer, more breathy narrative cinematics with all of that awesome depth of story and action I'm hungry for. Maybe someday, maybe not. But we're always going to work as hard as we can to make sure when something drops, it's a compelling piece of art.

The last 3 cinematic fights had exactly 0 of my favorite champions. You can still enjoy them for what they are and maybe enjoy one characters interpretation enough to like the champ.

But I figure if the side you're trying to cater to are as you put it \"assclowns\" they're probably not worth catering to. \n\nThough I would say, while I do really like the LoL fight cinematics they could have taken steps to alleviate this problem. A more diverse selection of champs for instance. There's no need for Katarina to be in every single one. \n\nWould it shut up everyone who is demanding the next release has to have X? No, of course. But showing them that they're going to keep pushing for more champs so everyone can theoretically get there day in the limelight could help.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nazzadan","date":"2016-05-02T22:41:35.576+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh I don't want/care about single champion cinematics fleshing out characters.

Maybe if the champ teasers were longer to the point we actually did get some story or lore to them, but currently they've been 30 seconds that may have 1 line in it just to make people guess. That just doesn't satisfy like a 5 minute show of our champs dueling it out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2016-05-02T17:44:25.227+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"More lore significant cinematics, less non-lore significant cinematics.","replies":[{"poster":"ArdoreAurorale","date":"2016-05-03T16:21:12.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tesla Effect,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=A1E4a0Ao,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-05-02T17:44:25.227+0000)\n>\n> More lore significant cinematics, less non-lore significant cinematics.\n\nyes, but  they must be longer","replies":[]}]}]}
