But it would have to apply to farm and only as an aura.  Something like:\n\n\nPassive: Aura: Thief - When an opponent kills a minion/monster while you are within X units of the unit that is killed, the opponent gains 3/5/10 less gold and you gain the corresponding amount of gold.  This can only occur once every 6 seconds.\n\nThis would force you to stay in range to get boned, and would only make a small difference early game when farm is important, increasing late game where farm is less critical.  Also giving it a CD prevents it from becoming too powerful.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-04-24T03:18:21.262+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing about gold theft is that it's never EVER fun for the victim.

This would cause some interesting gameplay during the laning phase while preventing the gold loss from 100% guaranteeing that the enemy get's set far behind in gold.

In most PnP games, the thief is the one who is probably going to get screwed over first when things go wrong largely for reasons that wouldn't work in a moba.  To be fair, a lot of thief-like ideas are in the game in champs like shaco, talon, and bard.\n\n Here some ideas I'd like to see, but not all could be doable on the same champ.\n\n1.  Passive that lets me find and disable traps... like teemos.  Sadly we don't have enough traps for this to be valid.  Maybe we need a shop item that lets you drop traps.  It could also let you find other team's wards and repurpose them for your own team.  Stealing wards from the other team would be interesting.\n2.  A passive that grants me gold whenever someone on the other team nearby gets it.  Not a direct steal, but an indirect one.\n3.  A back stab like shaco that also works if there are other allies are close to your target.  Sort of like a support DD.\n4.  A stealth mechanic like twitch, rengar, etc.\n5.  Maybe a skill to set traps or disarm enemy towers for 10 seconds.\n6.  A team escape skill, like bard's E... or a selfish one, depending on how evil you want to go it could snare your team and give you a boost of speed and armor.\n7.  A support style champ with added damage.  Thieves aren't frontliners and in other games, they are assassins at best, utility champs at worst (scouts, traps guy, locks guy, etc).  That makes them hard to directly put in LOL.  Also there's nothing to steal unlike DOTA2.  \n8.  A skill that grants you gold whenever you damage another champ with it (but not stealing from him) or an AA.  \n9.  An AoE skill that inflicts blind and silence... thieves are sometimes the party's charismatic player who handles diplomacy, this would be one option for that sort of thing in game.  Maybe make it like Bard's R but lets everyone in it move.  It could cost gold to activate.\n10.  Since thieves are untrustworthy, maybe a champ could get GP whenever an ally gains gold (he steals it) or an ally champ dies.","replies":[{"poster":"iamleburk","date":"2015-04-25T03:25:42.353+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"for your number 1.... what if we gave him a way to spot wards?
