That can really suck since tanks are expected to take the brunt of enemy CC's when they engage, and jungle tanks are **expected** to take Mobility Boots to enable more ganks.\n\nCouple that with me never seeing enemy Leona players ever go Mercury's Treads, and I have to ask if you're even supposed to get CC reduction as a tank at all. Sure, you can ignore it as Alistar, but not as Amumu, Galio, or Leona. If you're CC'd when you're supposed to activate your defensive buff, you'll probably die before you come out of the chain stuns/disables.\n\nJust curious. It feels like Riot flat-out hates the Tenacity stat as a whole, and never keeps options available for long (besides Mercury's and Zephyr).","replies":[{"poster":"futuresight23","date":"2015-02-28T02:16:49.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The loss of Tenacity from the tank jungle enchant is probably more of big loss to bruisers building tank (Olaf, Aatrox, Elise) than tanks themselves who either shouldn't be the target of CC or deal with it better than most champs.  If CC is a huge concern, Merc treads are still available for that purpose.\n\nYes I know Olaf's ult makes him immune to CC.  It does have a cooldown though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-28T01:50:05.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know why they took out some of the hp AND the tenacity part. Aren't tanks struggling enough? And then they nerf nautilus to compensate I guess?","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2015-02-28T02:08:51.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like you guys missed the \"25% bonus health part\" so with the item alone that's an extra 87.5 health. Not to mention they buffed tank wave clear with the Cinder item. SO lets add more health items. Randuin's Omen = 125 extra health plus the 87.5 = 212.5. Add in a Warmongs and you're up to 412.5 bonus health. And a banshee's totals it up to 525 extra health. That's an extra Randuins amount of worth. \n\n And the so called \"nerf\" ain't a nerf. Naut's shield was always to force other champs to waste time disabling it, or else they take the damage. He also has a 4 second cd slow/damage that's almost spammable. That's more damage that Naut brings to his \"Go in and soak it all up while they panic.\" Bringing him more Aoe damage than tank it and kinda be there.\n\nIn terms of Tenacity, if the other team is smart, they'll not waste their cc on you, and focus the squishies. IF they're bad, and do waste their cc on ya, that only makes the rest of your team safer, which is a tank's job.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-02-28T02:00:24.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they want Tenacity to be a niche optional thing that you buy against a CC heavy team.  I don't think they want it to be on any core item.  It should be a decision to get it, not a bonus you get for doing what you were going to do anyway.","replies":[]}]}
