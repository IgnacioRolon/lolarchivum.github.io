Against minions, it leads to Irelia's laning becoming obnoxious in that you can't easily push her out. In team fights, though, it absolutely sucks because its damage will always be negated by armor, even if the armor is low. Irelia's don't tend to build Last Whisper either, since it doesn't work well on her.\r\n\r\nBut every time I bring the topic up on Reddit or here, Irelia purists are quick to attack me for suggesting any change. So I'd like to hear your opinion on the matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-02-24T07:31:45.633+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm of mixed opinion on Irelia's ultimate.\n\nOne on hand: \n\n* It's an ability that's sometimes just spammed without interesting decisions\n* It sometimes just gets used for boring lane sustain, which is usually a pretty unsatisfying use for an ult with a noticeable CD\n* It splits its satisfaction between multiple casts and then again between damage and healing so doesn't feel good relative to its power\n* There are arguably cooler things that could be done with telekinetic blade warrior (biggest mark against it in my mind)\n\nHaving said that:\n\n* It does reward smart positioning and lining up of shots, whether against minions or champions. Well used ults give a lot more benefit than mediocre ones\n* Its multicast nature helps support Sheen/Triforce proc weaving, which for many people's a key part of Irelia play\n* A number of people do enjoy it, so while it doesn't hit the mark for me it does deliver for some people and does so without being terrible for game health\n\nOverall I feel there's an opportunity to do something cooler, with more interesting decisions. Can't see us changing it in the short to medium term though, there's other stuff that's much higher value we could be working on instead and personal feeling is that Irelia's in an ok spot.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-02-24T07:34:18.942+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> * There are arguably cooler things that could be done with telekinetic blade warrior **(biggest mark against it in my mind)**\n\nAgreed, please add more awesome.\n\n> Overall I feel there's an opportunity to do something cooler, with more interesting decisions.

I would have assumed the opposite with him being really bad against mobile ranged mages that he can't deny/kill in lane and who go on to outscale him.\n\nPS: Rework irelia e already. It's gimmicky and the thing that makes her low counterplay. She needs to be some kind of fighter-sassin low counterplay bullshit to be viable against the ranged tops given the current state of melee/ranged laning but in a perfect world that would get fixed instead of just letting her be stupid to counter other stupid stuff. At least make it physical or something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-02-24T15:54:39.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hnvV7bkG,comment-id=000200010000,timestamp=2015-02-24T10:03:59.705+0000)\n>\n> I'm guessing by \"Renekton Q change\" you mean changing it work off targets hit rather than damage dealt? \n\nPrecisely.

I'm thinking the over all CD would be 15 seconds or somewhere in that ballpark, but you still get the 4 casts. Then balance them around being a \"spammable skillshot that gives some sustain\". \n\nI think that would help push the whole \"Ima telekenetic blade warrior\" thing she has going, and at the same time alow for a cooler ultimate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-02-24T09:57:44.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Overall I feel there's an opportunity to do something cooler,\n\nGlad to see Riot has this attitude about fun and cool things about champions.

I care less about her identity and more about her play style.\n\nSay that amumu were to change from a tank to an assassin that gives it's life to take an enemy with him. While the wording might seem dark that would fit a lonely mummy identity better then attack me I'm the hard engage tank.

It can clear waves if she's behind, and it's pretty low CD. It's also very useful for proccing her sheen with every single use. And if you want to combo correctly in lane, use your ultimate to get enemy minions low to get a free jump reset on them.\n\nSome champions have other abilities that are so strong or synergize so well each other that one ability can be generally weak. In this case, Irelia's Q, W, and E are very strong abilities, most notably her W, so her ultimate being even stronger would not be fun for the dudes at top lane. Similarly to Veigar's E being such a powerful ability yet the rest of his kit is subpar.

The healing is just a nice thing for being able to deal wiht champs like Darius a little better when things are not going well.\n\nIt is however not something that is a focal point of the ability or Irelia's kit. Heck I would take the passive 10/14/18/22/26 on EVERY hit healing that was cut in half when not active over the healing on Irelia's ult any day but that was too over whelming.\n\nAs for the ability yes it can be used for wave clearing but that is just a option which does remove a lot of Irelia fighting potential. It does actually fit with what seems to be Irelia's play style concept of being better off when in a worse spot (see her passive as well as her stun only being on higher health targets) If used right it does allow for making what seems like a bad fight winnable. Say hitting the enemy champ and 4 minions in a duel with it to heal more.\n\nIt might just be that I am one of the few who was still playing Irelia in season 3 but I really don't want to see her kit drastically changed.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-02-24T08:24:08.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the healing wasn't supposed to be a real part of the ability, it wouldn't have been added on in the first place.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2015-02-24T07:30:18.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Three things:\n\nA.
