Now instead of a % chance of one big strike she has consistently higher DPS. How is that not de-randomizing critical hits?\n\n> They arent removing critical hit because champions like [yasuo] and [tryn] passives also is built for it.\n\nNo one is saying they are doing it RIGHT NOW. There have been complaints forever about the random nature of crits and how RNG takes much skill out of the game. That someone with an IE can beat someone with IE and PD just out of pure luck should not happen. OP is speculating that MAYBE Riot is testing ways to use crit chance differently and de-randomize it better. Champs like Yasuo and Tryn could easily be tuned to fit the new system.\n\nAgain, I doubt removing critical hits is in the near future, but perhaps it is a project for next season and Ashe is the first test to see how it could work. They have removed other mechanics before in this game such as dodge and weapon passives. I don't see why this is so out of the realm of possibility just because two champs have passives that would require minor tweaks.","replies":[{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2015-04-28T21:19:37.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":25,"body":"my god, Ashe ISNT the first test you guys are delusional lol.

WE UNDERSTAND HOW HER PASSIVE WORKS. \n\nPlease explain to me how her passive is tied to critical hits when she CAN'T CRITICALLY HIT. If she can't critically hit how is her passive tied to critical hits other than saying she can't get one? Her bonus damage is based on crit CHANCE, but she can't critically hit ever. HOWEVER, her crit chance doesn't give her random spikes in damage, it gives her consistently higher PERCENTAGE BASED DAMAGE INCREASE. \n\nYou may not think Riot is going to remove crit. That's fine. But at least admit that IF they were going to remove crits this is one way they could do it without changing things too much. I will try to spell it out for you:\n\n1. Ashe cannot crit. Ever. Even with 100% crit chance she will not critically hit.\n\n2. Ashe's damage is increased based on crit CHANCE. Therefore, instead of one arrow dealing a shit ton of damage randomly, all her arrows will do more damage but none will do a shit ton more.\n\n3. Over time and given the same crit chance Ashe's DPS will be equal to any other adc's.\n\n4. In a 1v1 fight with just auto attacks, given the same items and runes and masteries, two Ashe's should tie. They should kill each other at the same time because their bonus damage is a set amount. However, in a 1v1 with Ashe and any other adc the winner will depend completely on luck. \n\n5. Winning a fight based solely on luck is generally frowned upon in this game as strategy and skill should be the difference between winning and losing, not a random dice roll.\n\n6. Dodge, another luck-based mechanic, was removed for the same reason.\n\n7. Name another luck-based mechanic in this game other than crit and crit chance. Also, give me a reason (other than Yasuo and Tryn passives) why crit and crit chance is necessary.\n\n8. IF Riot was going to remove crit chance to make the game less luck-based, THIS is one way to do it. ADC's will still get a percentage increase in damage, but it will be consistent rather than random. If it makes it easier to understand, they will likely call \"crit chance\" something else completely. Off the top of my head they could call it \"weapon mastery.\" If you get 50% \"weapon mastery\" each auto is 50% stronger. \n\n9. Again, no one is saying this is happening RIGHT NOW. Maybe I am missing your point other than \"I don't think they will remove crit because crit exists.\" Assume Riot DOES want to get rid of crit, please admit this is one way they could do that. Given that, why are you so sure they DON'T want to get rid of the last random aspect of this game.

What it doesn't take into consideration is that Ashe doesn't crit, but **she still does consistent bonus damage based on crit chance**\n\nWith your math, a champ deals 200 damage without a crit, 400 with it. Let's say they deal this damage at 50% chance. Let's also assume, for the ease of math, that they are attacking at 1.0 attack speed, or 1 attack per second. Using math, we can determine that over 4 attacks you will deal **AN AVERAGE OF** 2 critical hits and 2 non-critical hits, totalling 400 + 400 + 200 + 200 = 1200 total damage over 4 hits **ON AVERAGE**. \n\nNow, let's say Ashe deals the exact same base damage, but is using her new critical hit system: with 50% crit chance, **Ashe will deal a bonus consistent 50% damage.** This means that instead of dealing 200 base damage without crits, or 400 damage with one by chance, she will instead deal 300 damage consistently (200 + 100[50% of 200] = 300). This means that over the course of 4 attacks, Ashe is ALWAYS dealing 1200 damage (300 x 4). Rather than an average, it is a constant. \n\nThe difference here is that Ashe will ALWAYS and consistently deal 1200 damage over those 4 hits, whereas in the current crit system, 4 hits could yield anywhere between 800 damage (with 0 crits landed) or 1600 damage (all hits land critically). It's about the difference between dealing damage consistently or dealing damage randomly. The idea is that, over time, the amounts balance due to how CHANCE works over consistent damage, and how math dictates that averages will occur.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2015-04-28T22:04:05.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"@8.

I understand it. I will try to explain this more clearly.\n\nFor quite a while, the community has wanted to rework the crit system to remove the RNG, and[ Riot recently weighed in on a discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/qgP5fbUQ-as-an-adc-main-crit-needs-to-be-removed) about completely reworking the crit system by derandomizing the crit system. To sum it up very quickly, crit is an essential DPS steroid but the RNG on crit is annoying, so we'd like to get rid of the RNG while having crit serve the same role. The proposal is that crit would be reworked to give the exact same dps, but without any RNG. So, if I have 1% crit chance, I'd have 1% increased autoattack DPS (do you see how that is exactly the same as Ashe's X% crit = X% bonus damage?). This same system could be used to get exactly the same DPS for all crit-using champions (Yasuo, GP, whoever). If you don't see how, I can post some math proving this. Only Trynd would have a bit of weirdness, given that he has a non-damage effect that activates specifically on crit, but even that is an easily solved problem.\n\nSo, what we're saying is that Ashe's passive looks exactly like what we would expect a derandomized crit system to look like, and we're asking if Riot is using Ashe's passive as a test for potentially reworking crit in the future so that all crit for all champions would function like it does for Ashe (without the reliance on the slow). It looks like that is what they are doing.\n\nDoes that make more sense?","replies":[{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2015-04-28T21:16:44.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":14,"body":"You aren't getting it lol.

So then where is ashe's passive going to get bonus damage percentage if it required Critical hit chance percentages to be converted? And before removing critical hit they have to rework champions that are tied to building Crit items like {{champion:157}} and {{champion:23}}, because guess what? they also have passives that are tied to critical hit.

The entire idea of the crit rework is changing crit items so that there is no more crit chance, and what was previously crit chance would be autoattack %damage increase (again, this is exactly the same dps, without randomess). She would have crit that works like everyone else's, or to be more accurate, items would be reworked so that all crit works exactly like hers does.

A new system that gives the exact same expected dps but without the RNG would give him exactly the same damage, applied in exactly the same way.

That's why they would have a test with a champion who has a derandomized crit system. Testing to secure data seems like an appropriate step.\n\n> ashe isnt an example of \"derandomizing\"\n\nYes, she is. This is not debatable. She has a kit that lets her function in exactly the way a derandomized crit system would work. She has a derandomized crit system. You can argue that this doesn't mean that Riot is testing derandomized crit systems for potentially replacing the current crit system, but she absolutely has derandomized crit.\n\nTwo questions, to make sure we are on the same page. Do you understand that the derandomized crit system we are talking about would be reworking items to remove crit chance and replace it with a % autoattack damage increase, and do you understand/agree that this new system would not change expected DPS for any champion?

Well, maybe small changes for Trynd, but Yasuo actually wouldn't need any changes. Yasuo builds crit not because he benefits in any significant way from RNG, but because it is an extremely effective steroid for him. In fact, given that his Q crits, he gets high crit values, and he gets high attack speed, he actually has very low potential variance. He also doesn't do crit-fishing in lane because the shield is so much more important in determining if you can or can't fight.

If I have 100 AD, 10% crit chance, and I attack 10 times, I expect to do 9 hits for 100 damage, and one hit for 200 damage, which is 1,100 damage, which is a 10% increase in damage over the 1,000 I would do if I had no crit chance. So, we agree that it is a 10% autoattack However, I won't always get this damage, because critical strike is random.\n\nAre we good so far? Yes? Alright. So, imagine if I didn't have 10% crit chance, but instead I had 10% increased autoattack damage. Well, let's take a look. If we had 100 AD, 10% bonus damage, and 10 attacks, we would do 110 damage per attack, which would be 1,100 damage after 10 attacks. Do you see how this is exactly the same damage that we got when we had 10% crit chance? **The only dps difference between bonus damage and crit, literally the only difference, is that bonus damage can't vary with RNG. Otherwise, they produce exactly the same damage.**\n\nSo, now that we have established that bonus damage gives exactly the same damage that we expect from crit. We would change items so that crit chance would be completely. Instead of PD giving you 35% critical chance, you would get 35% bonus damage. It's exactly the same expected damage, but without randomness. We could do this to every single item and champion. I personally don't think there would be any problems changing it all today, but Riot obviously would want to test it first, which is where Ashe and her \"crit chance = bonus damage\" passive comes into play.\n\nAnd the most important part? THIS IS EXACTLY HOW ASHE IS GOING TO WORK! It's literally exactly the same, except that would be for every champion instead of just her.\n\nSo, right now, does that make sense? I'm looking for a yes or no answer here, hopefully with some explanation if the answer is no. Please give one.\n\n>Ashe isnt \"derandomizing\" critical hit because she cant crit. She does bonus damage based on how much critical chance you have.\n\nWhich is exactly what the proposal is. Rework crit items so that all crit chance is replaced with bonus damage. The reason we call it derandomizing crit is because it gives exactly the same dps steroid as crit, without the randomess. Yes, it's not technically crit, but we call it that just because we don't have a better name right now. You see how Ashe gets bonus damage from all of her crit chance items? We'd have it so that all items just gave bonus damage instead of crit chance to begin with. That's why I say that all crit would work like Ashe's.\n\n>They wouldn't give her a passive that is tied to crit if she was a stepping stop for its removal.\n\nWhy not? They need a good test, and there is another part of her passive so she wouldn't be without one if they just changed all crit to work like her bonus damage. They can change something about her in the future if she's lacking after that. Why couldn't this be a test?\n\n>I dont think you understand Crit, the RNG is tied to critical hit. you require the RNG to determine when you get a Critical hit. thats why you get critical hit chance items. 80% critical chance gives you a higher chance for the RNG to determine a critical hit on a target.\n\nI understand that perfectly. What have I said that implies differently to you? Quote me, explain yourself and I'll try to explain myself better. Do you want me to explain how Yasuo isn't reliant on the RNG, just the dps steroid? I can prove this mathematically, if you want. Seriously, just ask, and I'll prove that we wouldn't have to change a single thing about him.\n\nSo, I'm going to ask the questions I asked earlier again. Please answer them, because they are fundamental to this discussion. Do you understand that the derandomized crit system we are talking about would be reworking items to remove crit chance and replace it with a % autoattack damage increase, and do you understand/agree that this new system would not change expected DPS for any champion? If you don't answer these questions, I'm not continuing this discussion with you. I feel like I'm repeating myself at this point, and I'm not going to do that again unless I know you're making some effort to understand me.","replies":[{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2015-04-28T22:27:01.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"ive said all this already, Critcal hit is tied to the RNG. RNG determines when you crit. Thats why you get items like I E to give you a 20% chance to crit. which means the RNG is more likely to give you a crit.  And you keep saying yasuo isnt reliant on RNG when he is reliant on CRITS which is reliant on RNG. how is that hard to understand lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-04-28T22:32:25.948+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">Critcal hit is tied to the RNG.\n\nBut we can get exactly the same DPS without RNG by turning all crit chance on items into % bonus autoattack damage instead. This keeps it exactly the same as a DPS steriod, without any randomness. Yasuo needs the damage from crits, but he could use a bonus damage system just as well, so he isn't really reliant on the RNG, just the damage. If IE gave 20% bonus autoattack damage and his passive doubled the increase of % autoattack damage, he'd play exactly the same way and be exactly as strong. Once again, I can prove this with math if you want. That's the crit derandomization idea summed up.\n\nThe RNG from crit is not necessary to this game. The dps steriod crit gives is. We can have that dps steroid without the RNG, and we can easily change everything to fit the non-RNG model because the DPS is exactly the same.","replies":[{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2015-04-28T22:45:31.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"you are so inconsistent with your argument man and you still dont seem to be grasping what RNG is used for. you cant get the same damage from bonus damage vs damage the RNG determines.

Then, Ashe shows up using the most common idea for such a system would work. That inspires a little hope that they might be looking at a better system.\n\n>Riot is perfectly capable of testing ideas without the live servers.\n\nThey are capable. Doesn't mean they wouldn't choose to. That's why we asked. We actually got an answer too. The systems team is not actively looking to rework crit, and they did not have an imput on this passive being added to Ashe, but they are observing her and taking data to see if some of their theoretical negatives to non-RNG crit are actually valid concerns.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-04-28T21:09:45.233+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CatSith,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KWbANxMr,comment-id=000600000000,timestamp=2015-04-28T20:49:57.354+0000)\n>\n> her passive isn't derandomizing her critical chance, its replacing it. Having crit increases her bonus damage towards slowed targets X% crit chance = X% bonus damage. Are you reading the passive?\n\nYou are being kind of dense. The language used in this thread to date might not be overly clear but that's because the Ashe passive is a common concept for a crit rework. It removes the RNG of crit chance by removing it and replacing it with a consistent direct substitute. The concept is exactly as with Ashe's passive - a certain amount of crit chance would instead become a certain percentage of AA damage amp. Infinity Edge would replace its crit strike chance with a % AA amp, for example.\n\nIt's called a \"crit chance rework\" because while it removes crit chance, it serves as the direct replacement.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Celeste Benal","date":"2015-04-28T21:12:42.398+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they were to make this the norm for all champs, they would have to redesign Ashe again because her passive would be... nothing.
