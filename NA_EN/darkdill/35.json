In that case 3 players lose 5 LP, while the 2 leavers lose 65LP (20 of theirs + 3 times 15LP). Obviously, the numbers would need adjustments for flex queue as there can be more than 2 people premade.\n\nGames surrendered like these after losing the possibility of remake would then give the enemy team LP based on how much the leavers lost.

It's your Riot given right to not click yes when surrender is initiated. And it's the other player's Riot given right to be able to say Yes also. And your example to surrender by being down 1 kill with no objectives down is pointless. That's not when surrender is useful. But when the kill count is 1/20 and you're getting outplayed at every turn, sometimes it's nice to have the opportunity to bow out and admit defeat.
