There's some tension there for some champions as to whether or not they should take it, with their team's composition and how they expect the game to go major factors in whether or not it's worth them picking it up. That's something we think's valuable, since it offers a game understanding check that doesn't have a constant right answer, unlike many other item options.

Not a different abyssal, something entirely independent.  Are our gameplay options A) have no MR and die or B) be forced to take a suboptimal item? \n\nYou could argue that mages can build {{item:3026}} , but AD Champions are allowed {{item:3155}}, which fits seamlessly into almost any AD champion's build.  Why should one class be forced to build class neutral items and forsake their progression when other classes have multiple options that fit right in there? {{item:3156}} {{item:3139}} \n\nThere has also been no MR + mana item since banshee's veil.  This rework seemed like an optimal time to introduce an item that could help both siege mages and mana tanks. {{champion:27}} {{champion:53}}. \n\nWhy are you guys being so light on items for the mage rework?  AD Champs got 3 new items (4 if you count both LWs) and a number of items reworked into viability.  For mages you're giving 2 items and taking 2 away ({{item:3174}} {{item:3152}} ).   It doesn't really feel like their itemization is being refreshed like the juggernaut/adc reworks accomplished.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2016-05-03T21:40:55.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically?
