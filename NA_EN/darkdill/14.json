Lets also not forget about exhaust and heal being important in the equation as well. \n\nAlso, your second point...Ashe doesn't have a fantastic teamfighting utility...it's relatively weak considering her ult is very dodgeable and at blank range the stun isnt too powerful nor is the damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Anarchomagus","date":"2014-08-14T19:08:30.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i am explicitly ruling out supports because in our theoretical scenario of a 2v2 lane, the two supports have equal capabilities (because we're comparing ADCs here). the only way their presence can make a difference is if the opposing ADC is implicitly empowered by the presence of an ally (disregarding anything that ally actually does), and afaik there is as of yet no such ADC. effectively the supports 'cancel eachother out'.\n\ni'm not sure how you can argue that ashe's utility is in any way sub-par; she has access to the longest CC in the game (at 3.5 seconds) at global range, and an incredibly reliable ranged perma-slow. her long range vision granting ability and huge aoe slow are gravy. the only comparable ADC is varus, who has even weaker self peel. ashe may not be mobile, but she can put a crystal arrow into your face at close range where the size of the hitbox makes it unlikely to miss, and her permaslow makes approaching difficult without strong gap closers.","replies":[{"poster":"Phoneixflare","date":"2014-08-14T19:22:51.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't just rule out supports because this isnt a 1v1 game it's a 5v5 or 3v3 game so you should always take into account other players, their skill level mechanically and their understanding of the other player's skill level alongside effective collaboration between teammates. Supports do not cancel each other out because each have strengths and weaknesses with different adc's like that's such a huge portion of botlane and I don't see how you can rule that out for any reason. For example, leona/graves versus ashe/morg. Ashe walks up in your scenario to harass, leona walks up and flash stuns ashe, blocking an incoming volley and allowing graves to get into position to land a huge buckshot, forcing ashe to either flash or die if she continues this fight considering leona's exhaust is still up. This is assuming they aren't fighting at tower. At level 2, morgana will likely have black shield, meaning that Ashe can more safely harass with her focus shot, but that's still not guaranteed because leona's damage alongside sunlight in conjunction with grave's autos and abilities might pop the shield so it's not effective at stopping the cc, again, ashe has to flash. She doesn't have enough options when trading except right click and try to hit a volley. She has no chasing potential if an opponent is outside her attack range and volley range meaning she has to flash just to GET a kill pre-6. I mean there are so many weak aspects to Ashe even when paired with a great support like thresh and morg. I have never even lost lane to an Ashe. Ever.\n\nYou need to consider all factors when making statements like \"ashe is guaranteed to have a trade go in her favor\" because that ISNT true which is what I was saying. \n\nAlso compare Varus's ultimate to Ashe's: Ashe's hits one target(only one gets stunned at least) whereas Varus's can at least affect an entire team(I've seen it happen and seen it win games) also Varus's ultimate SCALES OFF OF AD. Also, the range where Ashe's ultimate reaches 3.5 seconds is rather huge and at that point she isnt actually in the fight thus she isnt really teamfighting so much as sending an arrow across the map to give assistance or get an assist on a kill...she's not really present in the fight at that range(unless idk she has teleport?)","replies":[{"poster":"Anarchomagus","date":"2014-08-14T21:52:11.000+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"look, i'm well aware that bot lane is 2v2. but there's no point in taking that to account because the supports you choose for each carry is totally arbitrary and are matchup altering in themselves. so if we try to make an example of a realistic bot lane and say that maybe ashe is supported by thresh and vayne is supported by morgana; and that matchup would quite likely swing in vayne's favor. **but that tells us nothing about the relative power of ashe and vayne, because we're introducing another variable that is skewing results heavily.** if we switch the supports so that now ashe is with morg and vayne is with thresh, then suddenly ashe is coming out on top! \n\nbut that's totally meaningless, because not only is every matchup different, but every team is different, and every player is different. but the key here is that **any outside circumstance that can favor vayne could also favor ashe.** \"but what if the ashe player is teamed with bronzes, or what if she has a mordekaiser support, or what if she spontaneously bursts into flames at 5 minutes?\" none of that actually matters, because any of those things are equally likely to happen to the vayne player. \n\nthere is a discussion to be had about how different AD carries synergize with different supports or deal with certain enemy supports, and it does pertain to whether ashe is balanced or not, but i'm not interested in even giving an opinion on that conversation. yes, ashe might be weak right now or she might not, *but i have no idea and i dont intend to make any claims on that front.* i simply offered an analysis of potential carry burst damage at level 1, 'on-paper'.\n\ni'd also like to invite you to take a look at varus's wiki page here: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Varus\nhis ult has no AD scaling, and is very different from ashe's because ashe's ult has unlimited range. global anything is *powerful*, cc even more so. to dismiss that offhand as somehow not significant is just silly.","replies":[{"poster":"ThokPwnage","date":"2014-08-15T07:16:00.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"giving one thresh and the other morgana is meaningless because that changes the balance since they're not equal, but if they both have the same support...
