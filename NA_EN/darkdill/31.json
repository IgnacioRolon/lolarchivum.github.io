In no way should a **jab** be of the same range as a **throwing projectile**. Him being energy based is no fine reason either as he has the shortest ptojectile range of all the energy-based champs and other tanks like {{champion:36}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:59}}. Buffing the range will buff both his offensive and defensive capabilities because the current range overextends him.\n\nI find 550 units reasonable. Also I'd like him throw a **Kunai** instead of his sword because him magically regaining a sword is retarded when he can have a hundred small kunais strapped to his body. (with missle speed increased to 2000) :P","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-07-26T01:48:16.775+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Matching thematics with gameplay is something we put a lot of effort into, there are times though where we need to prioritize balance over lighter thematic expectations.

I must know though, will **zero** waveclear remain a bold weakness of shen in his gameplay update? He isn't the split pusher he once was so maybe something small like Vopal Blade dealing reduced damage to enemy units it hits while in route of the initial target... Something like {{champion:236}}'s Q?\n\n100% postive Feint will reimagined. It could really benefit from a passive. Not sure what you will do with the synergy feint and ki strike share. Here's an Idea why not remove the damage from shadow dash (since shadow dash is on a long cooldown and the damage is mediocre) and make it plain CC like {{champion:45}}'s **Event Horizon** or {{champion:122}}'s **Apprehend** and move this power to the new Feint in the form of dps or to Vorpal Blade as hybrid AP and AD scalings. The reduced energy and cooldown per rank is reason enough to put points in shadow, maybe lower the taunt at lvl and the duration increased per rank. I do agree he is in a good spot right now, even seeing play in the **LCS** I just think he kinda struggles at his job.\n\nI know visuals are not in your department but in terms of visuals increasing the appeal of his walk/attack animations, recall and ability vfx's really make the summoner feel at home with said champion (afterall that's why we buy skins), I just hope you guys put some much needed work into his visuals like {{champion:41}}.

I think this would be fun, unique and very thematic for our Tanky-Ninja. You wouldn't have to make his model look too tanky if his tankability is dodge and parry, in some mmo's every class is equipped with a guard... Some stronger than others (finesse and skill in combat are traits of a martial artist, being able to parry a basic attack proves both finesses and skill)\n\nI hope you mean your not buffing his offensive power? I am ok with it as of the ki strike buff. However, in the world of tanks, I find his defensive power very lackluster. I'm tired of seeing (damage reducs, meat shields, unearthly regeneration, beefed up resistances) on tank champions. {{champion:201}} brought some unique and fun to the world of tanking.\n\nI think a very thematic change would be to make him dodge all auto attacks from taunted champ. Think about it, taunting enrages people... and when yoir enraged you fight sloppy, making it easier for the challenger to avoid your attacks. The old shadow dash reduced damage from the enemy's basic attack by 50% in a 1.5 second window. It did not do much, my one gives him small outplay potential. I'd gladly remove the damage for compensation on this buff.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Crowe Stalker","date":"2015-07-26T01:50:08.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this isn't related to the thread Meddler, but do you see {{champion:50}} as in a good spot right now?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-07-26T02:05:16.757+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Overall yes.

Having a thrown weapon have the same range as a long spear stab or sword thrust is that sort of case (by contrast if Caitlyn, as a sniper, had a really low attack range that'd be a pretty significant disconnect). \n> \n> As far as Shen goes we think he's in a pretty effective spot right now and don't currently have any plans to add more power to him. It's also very likely his Q will be replaced or very heavily modified in his gameplay update (we'd like to give him a more interesting combat pattern for laning/1v1s and changing the Q will be a significant part of that).\n\nWon't removing his only offensive ability for defensive one remove a lot of his effectiveness? If you guys like where he is power wise, you have to realise that removing his main (only) damage source will probably put him not a good spot. He'll just be a utility tank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2015-07-26T14:59:12.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bA3LxAyA,comment-id=000200010000,timestamp=2015-07-26T01:48:16.775+0000)\n>\n>  (by contrast if Caitlyn, as a sniper, had a really low attack range that'd be a pretty significant disconnect). \n> \n\nIf you were going to make it more thematically matching wouldn't Caitlyn need to have like a 5 second reload time between shots or like every 4 shots?
