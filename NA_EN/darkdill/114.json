Sure, an Infinity Edge is mandatory on all ADCs (except Vayne), but since Sivir has such bad AS scaling and does more of her damage with her Q and W (which are CDR-centric), it feels like Sivir would do more good with Lucidity Boots and Essence Reaver than Berserker's and Bloodthirster.\n\nTo put it in perspective, 40% CDR on Sivir lets her ult every 48 seconds. That is a TON of mobility for split-pushing, engages/disengages, objective control, etc. Add on how frequently she's able to use Spell Shield and Boomerang Blade, and you can see plenty of neat advantages over your typical auto-attack spamming builds.\n\nBut whenever I see Sivir in pro games, nope. They stick to the standard ADC builds when Sivir is out-performed in them by other ADCs (i.e. Lucian, Tristana). Kinda disappointing.\n\nMy 2 cents.","replies":[{"poster":"Talamare","date":"2014-12-30T07:36:51.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"CDR on Sivir?

The AOE also helps with her waveclear early on so that she doesn't have to burn Q to 1 shot minion waves, but that's less important.\n\nI do agree that PD may be a better buy than shiv if they go through with those PBE changes to the items.  I don't think they're good changes because it increases RNG on IE vs IE duels but that's for a different thread/discussion I guess.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2014-12-30T20:35:01.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I really wanted an ADC designed to burst someone down in seconds, I'd take Vayne, not Sivir.
