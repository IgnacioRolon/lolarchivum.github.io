Nasus is already incredibly difficult to escape from thanks to his slow being massive, which means that if you don't have a long ranged dash, slow resistance, or a way to cleanse his slow, you are dead. Nasus already has incredible dueling potential. Him having a Grounded debuff would make him broken.\n\nI was thinking if {{champion:82}} could get it on his ultimate, though. He is already pretty immobile, a way to counter mobility would help him a lot. It would also help him have a little more utility for his team during a teamfight.
