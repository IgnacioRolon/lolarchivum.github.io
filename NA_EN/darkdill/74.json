Besides, he&#039;s slated for a VGU, AFAIK.\r\n\r\nGul&#039;dan is one of my favorites right now in Heroes of the Storm because of his high damage, but also because his Life Tap mechanic is so unique for a MOBA. You don&#039;t regenerate mana normally, but pay a portion of your health to recover it. I imagine this wouldn&#039;t be doable in the exact same way in League due to the tech limitations (D key is reserved for Summoner Spells, for one), but it&#039;d be cool to have Warlock mechanics in LoL.\r\n\r\nNot to mention that Runeterra could always use a Chaos Mage.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-06-16T20:43:27.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i always thought karthus as the stereotype warlock of league","replies":[]},{"poster":"BabyNaix","date":"2017-06-16T19:53:02.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vlad?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkdemon653","date":"2017-06-16T19:38:26.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiddlesticks\n\nBut yeah, I don't think Riot wants to make a champion focused on DoTs.
