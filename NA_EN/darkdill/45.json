Force enemies to attack the tank. Since you're tough enough to take the hits, you just stand there while everyone whales on whoever you taunted.\n2. Force enemies to attack someone who is squishy. This is still a debuff - at best, they get to attack someone they already wanted to attack - but it encourages the taunter to move, leading the angry mob around instead of standing still to get beaten up. Since it's not as crippling as being forced to attack the tank, you could afford to have the effect last longer than on a tank.\n3. Force *allied and neutral* creeps to attack an *enemy*. This does a number of things: it pulls the lane and makes it easier to last hit, since your minions are too busy attacking the enemy champion to attack the enemy creeps, it makes it easier to zone the enemy since getting close enough to kill your creeps means they will get attacked, and it can potentially ruin somebody's day if they're close enough for a jungle camp or two to join in.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-04-22T18:47:09.764+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ForPortal,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EIQbRI8Y,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2015-04-22T09:23:06.585+0000)\n>\n\n> 2.
