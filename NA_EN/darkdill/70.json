If the project succeeds, you both get paid. If it fails, neither of you do. Your partner slaps you in the face and refuses to help on the project. You proceed to be the bigger man and make the project succeed anyway. You and your partner both get paid. Then you go to your boss and get your partner fired, so he can't screw up anybody else's project again.\n\nActually, it's not even this bad, \n\n>The System really is lacking once it comes to verbal abuse\n\nWhy do you feel this way? I think I've seen a marked decline in verbal abusers since the chat restrictions system was implemented.\n\n>marking leavers as the wrong party in all cases doesn´t really benefit anyone but the flamers in the first place from my perspective..\n\nIt benefits the other people in the game, who aren't flamers and aren't leavers.\n\nIt's *very* rare that you get 4 flamers and 1 leaver (unless it's a toxic 4-man premade). If you're in a game, and one of your teammates is abusing another teammate of yours, does it make you feel better when the abused teammate leaves? No, because now you have a flamer AND it's a 4v5. And more than likely, that flamer turns around and starts raging at someone else, maybe you.\n\nYou're also making it seem like there's only one wrong party. This isn't the case. **The flamer is the wrong party.** I believe that the leaver is a different party, who is also wrong.\n\n>and as the not leaving abused person has to continue that game he doesn´t want to play in silence it´s likely he just gets frustrated and turns toxic his own in the next game - so things only spiral downwards.\n\n1.

And muting someone doesn´t make the problem go away....it´s not making the flamer any nicer just because you don´t see his chat anymore, he won´t learn a thing and you still will feel abused and unwillling to play a game with that guy - but as you´re kinda forced to play it your motivation goes downhill and there´s just nothing uplifitng that gets offered from the game...so there´s a lot more negative impact on the guy that got abused than there is for the flamer - him being maybe banned in some uncertain future really doesn´t help with your game, mood and motivation being ruined. \n\nBeing the bigger/better man doesn´t mean that you silently take the hits and carry on - it means that you stand up for yourself and others in need.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-08-05T15:42:50.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Well, for me everyone that just stands by and leaves a flamer be without saying a word to calm the situation down/defend/back up the victim of the flame is not really better than the flamer him/herself.\n\nI wouldn't say that.

You're right about that. **Muting is a temporary measure designed to make that game more enjoyable for you. *It is not a solution for toxicity.*** \n\nWhat *will* help him learn is when you report him after, and he gets chat restrictions or bans. There are actually two kinds of toxic players:\n\n- Players who know they are toxic, and don't want to change.\n  - These players just need to get banned. They don't belong in our community.\n\n\n- Players who don't know they are toxic.\n  - These players are usually swept up in the heat of the moment.\n    - They're not going to listen to you, and they're not going to change their behavior *right then.* You need to let them know they're being toxic *when they calm down.*\n  - When these players receive chat restrictions or bans, that's a wake-up call.\n  - These players realize they're toxic, and work to stop\n    - This is why 70% of players who receive chat bans stop being toxic.\n\n- (There's kind of a 3rd, players who know they are toxic and want to change, but these tend to stop being toxic pretty quickly, so I'm not going to worry about them.)\n\n>you still will feel abused and unwillling to play a game with that guy -snip-\n\nI've found that when someone is raging at me, one of two things happens:\n\n1. They say something toxic, or even borderline toxic, even if it's not directed at me, and **I mute them right away.**\n  - I might get a little annoyed, but I forget about it pretty quickly and still have a fun game.\n2. They say something toxic, and I don't mute them. **They keep being toxic for a long time before I finally mute them.**\n  - Now, when I mute them, I am still thinking about how toxic they were, and it ruins the game for me.\n \n> Being the bigger/better man doesn´t mean that you silently take the hits and carry on - it means that you stand up for yourself and others in need.\n\nSo what, I should start a fistfight in the office?

Remember, there are also 3 other people on the project with you, who are going to keep working on it whatever you do. The guy who slapped you is perfectly capable of working on the project with you, as long as you don't see each other in person (that is, he's capable of playing with you as long as he can't talk to you). After the slap, your options are:\n\n- Slap him back (flame him back)\n- Quit the project (afk)\n- Keep working on the project and let him keep slapping you, then report him to your boss (keep playing without muting him, then report him)\n- Go to a different room, where he can't hit you, finish the project, then report him to your boss (mute him, then report him at the end)\n\nAmongst these options I think the last one is clearly the best. If there's another option that exists in league that I haven't included here, let me know, but I just fail to see what you could do that would be more correct, morally/ethically.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-08-05T20:40:02.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The problem is that if you take the analogy this far, it stops being able to translate into league, because in League, there is no option to report the player in-game.\n\nSo...maybe that is the problem to begin with?

But in SoloQ, these are people who you'll probably never see again. You can't solve their toxicity in-game; you have to look at ways to tackle toxicity at a system-wide issue. You can, however, use the mute button to make a more enjoyable experience for yourself, in game. If you want to look at it from another perspective, use the mute button so that flamers won't get you mad, and turn you into a flamer. I'd encourage you to consider using it more.\n\nI also think it's important to reduce toxicity in league, so the mute button isn't needed.
