To him, it just looks like an anime character. So I&#039;ve been looking around at new artworks for female thieves, and found this.\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/zZj7rGU\r\n\r\nNow I need an opinion: Do I stick with the first one and just try to explain design changes in my concept topic, or dump it and take the second one?","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-07-08T08:12:14.587+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Yousosmart, remember that my opinion is just that of one person! But I feel like you deserve a bit more of an explanation.\n\nWhen I think of a thief the following visuals come to mind:\nInconspicuous: A thief who is trying to steal something will be doing everything they can to remain unnoticed/unrecognised - muted colours, cloak/hood, covered face, no bright eye-catching punch colours, soft shoes do muffle footsteps, no armour that would make sound when moving.\nOccupation focused: A character that identifies as a thief (as opposed to someone who just happens to steals things) would have two primary modes; Planning and Executing. During planning a thief might look very different to a thief executing a theft but even then they would need visual indicators to show they're hatching a brilliant scheme. During a theft everything about them should show their intention - easily accessible tools for break in, a place to secret treasures once stolen, weapons or escape tools in case they get caught, items for distraction.\nNecessity Driven: Whenever I think of thief characters from stories they are most often depicted and driven by necessity. If they could just barge in the front door and take what they need then they would just do that but for whatever reason they can't and so they must find another way. They are often stories about overcoming a more powerful force by using wit and skill. This practicality and utilitarianism often extends to their appearance.\n\nHaving said all that, if you're designing a champion then the artwork you're using is fine because it's just there to give people a launching point from which their imagination can build upon.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-07-08T23:01:57.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice. It'll definitely help me flesh out Severa more.\n\nI have the following ideas on appearance changes using the first picture as a reference.\n>- Outfit should be in navy/dark blue instead of bright blue; white accents should instead be black or gray\n- Metal breastplates should be replaced with dark leather; gauntlet should be a darker metal or replaced with dark leather\n- Outfit includes a hood, but Severa usually has it off\n- Different hair color; preference would be black\n- Include knife belts around waist or thighs, and a few more pouches for small items\n\nDoesn't hurt if she shows some skin, IMO. If anything, being fully clothed in leather and showing off nothing would be too vanilla.\n\nAs for her style, Severa's actually the kind of thief who is reckless and arrogant, but so enormously skilled that she could rob someone blind in broad daylight when he's surrounded by guards. She's the kind of rogue who uses speed, tricks, handy items (such as caltrops, smoke bombs, and a magical gem that lets her create illusions of herself), and charm (at times) to get her prize. She's kinda the \"dashing rogue\" type, if said dashing rogue were a cool chick.\n\nI'm primarily using Sly Cooper as a reference point for Severa's style and methods, as Sly doesn't fit your typical stealthy burglar. However, in terms of attitude, she'd be a bit more like Sonic the Hedgehog: cocky and fun-loving, but when things get serious, so does she.\n\nLastly, there's the bit you mentioned on being driven by necessity. For Severa, it's a bit of yes-and-no towards necessity. She actually steals because **A)** it's the family business, **B)** she needs to prove herself to the rest of her guild, and **C)** it's downright fun! She's not short of money, or she could just steal when she wants something, but sometimes she just wants to take something that's well-guarded for a challenge. But lastly, she wants to make her dear daddy proud of her, and live up to her family's legacy of being made of master thieves.\n\nAs I've said before, everything above is subject to change.

An ultimate that takes a few seconds to activate and gets interrupted by taking damage, but then stealths you for a decently long duration; any ability casts you do during the stealth won't actually cast, but will instead set up a 'marker' for the cast, up to 2/3 times. Activate the ult again, then have the thief appear at each of the marked locations in a flash of smoke, cast her spell, then vanish again only to appear at the next spot.\n\nSorry for going slightly off-topic; I'm no artist and visual design isn't my strength, but sometimes things will catch my imagination and I'll end up thinking of gameplay mechanics. My basic thought was of a thief setting up a plan, then performing her heist flawlessly. An ult that you have to think about. If you set it up badly, you end up ulting thin air. But if you predict where the enemy is going to be in 10 seconds' time, you can set up a one-person killing field of traps, knives and bullets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArcticSirius","date":"2015-07-08T10:38:59.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually have been building an idea for a thief that I hope you (and/or other rioters) might like.

I don't really get the thief vibe from either of those pictures. The first one just says generic anime character and the second one kind of reminds me of a forest ranger. To me talon has a much stronger theif vibe than both of those. I think rito would have to be very careful their thief didn't look like talon.\n\nI think if I were going for a thief in the runeterra world It'd have to be a yordle, they're small and light on their feet, quick and cunning.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheXtractor","date":"2015-07-08T11:02:35.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try looking for 'rogue' artworks I think you will get a better thief-feeling when using that keyword","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Proxy I","date":"2015-07-07T22:34:54.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When i hear thief i think someone that is in a dark color and hooded. someone you cant recognize. but maybe theres that one thing thats a give away to who it is.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-07-07T22:43:28.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be the first thing people think of, but I honestly think that angle might be too vanilla.
