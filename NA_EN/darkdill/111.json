If he did, he'd have been turned into a monster like Kassadin and probably would not have been able to escape the Void because he has a weak will (unlike Kassadin). He was driven insane because of his hyper-sensitive subconscious which allowed him to hear the voices that came from beyond the realms of Runeterra (since he was born a seer). It's not described in detail in his bio but I remember reading a short story written by one of the writers 2-3 years ago (I forgot who it was...)  which described how the voices of the Void tugged at his subconscious, tortured him and eventually drove him insane. It was posted only on the forums. I don't remember its title unfortunately.\n\nI also got one detail wrong. Just re-read his bio and remembered that he went mad *before* going to Icathia. So, he *probably* went to the League to corrupt some Summoners before summoning Kog'Maw and Cho'Gath.\n\nHe went full crazy because those voices annoyed the hell out of him, which is why I think he's not evil for the sake of being evil. He's a puppet to the Void.\n\nEDIT: I *think* that the writer was called Skribbles. Don't know if he's still at Riot though.
