So make his voice sound more humanoid and calmer with 0 stacks.  And when he's maxed on stacks, maybe not have him speak, just have him bark or growl?  I feel that'd really drive home the effect of him losing his humanity and sanity as you build up stacks.","replies":[{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2014-05-29T07:00:39.504+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a really cool idea!

Everyone in video game development and their mothers have no qualms about sneaking \"Do a barrel roll\" into their games, which is from the very same Star Fox 64. In fact, your company has ALREADY DONE SO with Corki and Gragas! People get that reference. They'll get \"Can't let you do that, fox\" if you put it into your game, too. I am all for adding this line. It's a less common but more fresh poke at the same game that's always been memorable for its dialogue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"4est Tree","date":"2014-05-13T00:11:48.898+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"you underestimate the amount of people who had an N64 zenon.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-05-13T00:21:12.685+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never owned one, and I would get it (emulators FTW).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mansana","date":"2014-05-29T17:51:24.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it works better with Soraka.

Sad thing is, is that the Starfox franchise is dieing out, I don't think people will understand the reference unless you are a die hard nintendo fan who grew up with starfox and just so happens to play league.
