However, there&#039;s another one I&#039;d like to ask.\n\nWould it be possible for there to be any sort of faction or Champion that is largely influenced by Voodoo? I ask because DotA2, Warcraft, and Diablo all have Voodoo characters, but League so far doesn&#039;t.\n\nIs there something about Voodoo that Riot finds \"too controversial\" or \"too icky\"? Or could we eventually see some sort of Champion who flings evil spirits and curses at their enemies?\n\n**EDIT**: To address Bio's comment, there's no need for it to be 100% Voodoo. It just needs to make you think \"Voodoo-esque\", if you will.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-09-02T11:53:45.946+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Here's the thing about Voodoo and Vodun; they're complete religions.

Voodoo/Vodun's not nearly as binary a thing as \"spirit's be with ya\" as much as that is essentially the thing you think about when considering Voodoo.

Doing Voodoo _well_ would require, imo, crafting a plethora of loa/vodun and building up an entirely new society/culture who's way of life is focused around said loa.\n\nSo basically making a Voodoo champion/faction isn't as simple as saying \"Go with the whole spooky spirits angle and we're done!\" especially from a story stand point.

In a world without those religions, those positions and archetypes don't make sense.\n\nNow, that's not to say that there aren't things in League already that have been influenced by these things (we are products of our cultures, after all) but just wholesale inclusion into the main body of League canon would be a bit odd.\n\nI will add, though, that Annie has a 'doll' that contains the spirit of a terrifying, burning, bear spirit.

Annie has always been very visually distict(good) in a way that makes her look completely disconnected from everything else(bad).\n\nBut...if Voodoo is a thing in Runeterra and Tibbers is a mojo she made, suddenly she makes her own sort of sense and this fixes a very big problem in an intuitive way.  This does require the Voodoo Lands to get more voodoo, and I think we can do that.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-09-02T23:27:22.452+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing is for me is the concept of Annie is totally solid; incredibly talented mage who's still a child, tames a bear that she keeps as a pet through magical means, but her clothes are weird. Annie weird real world clothing that makes no sense for her to wear in ANY context. She's essentially wearing a school uniform.\n\nOn the Mojo thing; Mojo's more related to having a sort of spell or magic on hand in a container of sorts, be it a bag or amulet or what have you (as far as I know). It'd be kinda weird but also kinda cool imo to have Runeterran Voodoo have Mojo being the enthralling of an animal and having them as a guardian of sorts. \n\n(Disclaimer: Mojo is a part of Hoodoo, not Voodoo. I know that's weird but they're actually quite distinct from each other; Voodoo's closer to Vodun-the origin of these things than Hoodoo is.)\n\nWith all this in mind though I feel like people would have a fit if they all of a sudden changed both Annie's apparel and made her a Runeterran voodoo practitioner.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-09-02T23:30:00.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe it's Piltover fashion?","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-09-02T23:34:56.997+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"She's likely never been outside of the Voodoo Lands in the new canon, so I doubt it.

If we change anything about her adorable little girl appearance, she'll lose most of her character.\n\nThe way I see it the best way to connect Annie to the rest of the world is through Tibbers, and I see two ways of doing this: Tibbers looks like he comes from somewhere, or Tibbers looks like he was made somewhere.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-09-03T04:20:31.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's more or less what I was trying to do.

Centuries ago, these people were wiped out by an invading army, despite how fiercely they resisted, and despite the efforts of a powerful shaman who led them.\n\n>On the eve when they would become extinct, the shaman performed a ritual to a powerful, but evil god (whom I'll call Gobomba for this) to smite the invaders, knowing that invoking the dark god's wrath would certainly spell the end of their people. During the ritual, the shaman is killed, but this ends up stirring the evil god Gobomba, who unleashes a terrible curse upon the invaders, utterly annihilating them via a magical plague. This plague, however, also killed those who had summoned him, leaving no survivors.\n\n>Centuries later, an expedition into the Kumungu Jungle finds the dark god, Gobomba, now corporealized inside a large wooden idol. They disturb the dark god, angering him and bringing forth a terrible threat upon Valoran.\n\nThat's just a rough draft, but do you think it could work?","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-09-03T05:32:27.409+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yousosmart,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=rUawaKaY,comment-id=000100010002,timestamp=2015-09-03T04:20:07.332+0000)\n>\n> I guess.

Something could be done that evokes similar emotions to those of an outsider's view on voodoo.
