Another very small potential improvements : make the chimes spawn on minutes instead of 50 seconds. Simply make an extra chimes once in a while to compensate.\n\nI found if I control where I am and take a step back when the chimes spawn, I make much less chimes spawn on the wrong side of the map by myself. The only problem is, I'd need to memorize exactly every multiple of 50 seconds to do it reliably, which seem to me like a very elitist thing to do.

Note I am NOT a ranked player, and this may partially be my fault.\n\n1. He does extremely little damage, even by support standards. While Cosmic Binding does decent poke at the very beginning of the game, by mid game his only offensive spell is essentially null. His meeps also seem to offer little in the way of help beyond very early game, and the low range of his attacks and Q make defending a marksman or himself hard to do without being outpoked. He also has the worst waveclear I've seen on a support (which I've used Zz'rot Portal to help compensate for), even other supports have some form of area damage or natural damage resistance. It makes defending especially hard.\n\n2. His ultimate is infuriating to use. Almost any time I've used it I've had someone complain. I've accidentally defended enemies from friendly ultimates, frozen teammates while they were chasing, protected enemies during tower dives (I saw a Lucian jump into one before we dove the tower, it was pretty smart of him), or just simply saw the fight go on as if nothing happened. It seems like there are extremely few situations where it can really be used to your team's benefit, as it effects EVERYONE in a way that requires tight and singular judgement to make effectively (as in a certain item that only affects you personally). This is probably my fault, but it's still hard to judge when you can't predict everyone's movements carefully.\n\n3. He seems to have little presence in teamfights. It may be telling that he's suggested to build full tank despite not having defensive scalings, consistent damage, or any very close-range utilities like true tanks do. I spend most teamfights baiting and skirting around the fight and using Cosmic Binding to trap enemies, or just dying immediately. I also seem to perform just as well (sometimes good, sometimes awful) no matter what I build. I won a game going tanky AD debuffer, seem to have middling success with full AP, and do iffy with tanky builds. His only scalings are extremely low, so maybe something that would suggest a build path would be good for him.\n\n4. As mentioned above, there seems to be no truly good build for him besides Boots of Mobility. I've tried items like Black Cleaver and Wit's End in one game, Rabadon's in another, and Frozen Heart in another, but have the same success with him. This may not be a weakness, it may be, but I would appreciate a definite build path or set of build paths for him.\n\n5. It can be difficult to collect chimes when you're losing. It's hard to come back from a losing game with him when the enemy team is scouring your jungle with Bard, and I've noticed that when I win, it's because the rest of my team is doing well and when I lose, I'm going 0/13/4 or somesuch stats. Also, when you have an aggressive lane against you, Bard can't collect chimes and needs to stay by the marksman, so he can't collect chimes and help the other lanes, and a cycle of defeat happens and the entire game goes down.\n\n6. I don't know why he has the ultimate he does. I associate this character with high mobility and helping everyone on the team, and usually ultimates fit a character's theme. Bard's ultimate on the other hand, STOPS everything it touches and has a lot of potential to trap your own teammates. I think a mobility-based ultimate would suit him much better, either one that rushes Bard across a large distance (maybe like Pantheon's, but not dealing damage) would help him roam more safely or save losing teammates, or one that gives a huge speed boost to his allies would help him. A fun idea would be to have Bard jump a long distance and simultaneously slow enemies and speed up allies like Karma can. It would encourage a specific build (tanky) and fit his wandering and intervention theme more.\n\nAll in all, I think it's his hodgepodge design that's the problem, not necessarily raw power (though it may be an issue). It makes him difficult to build and really help teammates in a way that feels like a support. I'm sorry for not having suggestions for changes to make, but this is what I experience a lot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wilderwolf","date":"2015-04-15T01:22:12.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just really want his \"5 more chimes needed, 4 more chimes needed, etc.\" icon to show you what the next effect he'll gain will be when you hover over it instead of having to hover over his passive icon and looking at the very bottom of the wall of text to see it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Trent","date":"2015-04-15T00:47:00.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bard is the roaming sup that gets out roamed by every other support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GuiltyGecko","date":"2015-04-14T16:56:05.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to be careful with bard buffs.

For example:\n\nGeneral: The change on PBE where his auto attack range was increased to 550 was nice. Why was that taken away? Many champions that depend on ranged auto attacks have at least standard or higher. Zyra, Lulu, and Sona are good examples.\n\nPassive: You already suggested what I was going to suggest for chimes, so this is fine.\n\nQ: Q is just really slow.

IDK what to give E that's different from what it already gains from ranking up.

Reduce damage dealt by enemies and reduce damage taken by allies, for example (the double whammy from hitting both sides of the same fight could be pretty darn strong -- maybe not \"rumble ult is here, do you REALLY want to stay and fight on it?\", but it's not necessarily crazy for it to have that level of influence even though it deals 0 damage by itself).\n\nAlso, seeing Apollo's comment below, a much simpler suggestion is that R rank could just significantly increase the spawn rate of chimes, because chimes already strengthen meeps and help Bard in other ways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Apollocliptic","date":"2015-04-14T17:21:24.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"very true about the R thing, I figured it out only recently that there's no real reason to level it, I thought that if leveling R increased the spawn rate of Meeps, (while leveling E increased the spawn rate of chimes) passively, it'd give more incentive to level them, depending on the game you're having. \n\nThe other buffs, as much as they might help, would be too much too soon.
