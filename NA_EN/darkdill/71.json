I'd say that aspect of her kit needs a QoL adjustment.\n\nI could see doing 3 other things to her Q to make it relevant though:\n\n1. Q also slows attack speed while someone is debuffed.  That'd make her a better dualist against another ADC, but I'm afraid that'd also give her too much more power leading to the nerfs I talked about.\n2. Q lowers dash/flash distance.  That'd make her a counter to league of dashes and make her relevant in a way that works for her.  Still worried about it'd requiring nerfs.\n3.  Q increases her attack range as well.  If it puts her into cait/kog/twitch range while on that'd be interesting for the ashe player.  Either rush a ER (not many would) or you'd have to pick times to trade at range.\n\nStill, none of these suggestion make me happy as *they'd screw with her power budget.*  If you look at her kit, I don't think she has much room for more power while remaining healthy.

Fighters and assassins are supposed to catch and kill marksmen 1v1, unless they have a nearby ally or turret to save them.

Peel reliance is intentional.  Their main assets are farming very easily and safely, taking objectives quickly, dealing full damage to buildings, not being as limited by CDs/resources as other classes, and being able to contribute while hiding behind the rest of their team.

It's just attacking and moving.\n\n-----\n\nThe biggest thing I feel like pointing out is the strengths of Ashe's kit vs. a typical assassin/fighter jungler though:\n\nRange, AOE, and CC get exponentially better in team-fighters the more allies you have nearby. AoE should be self-explanatory, Ziggs and Lux in ARAM is a solid case for range, and a 1 second stun when 5 people are nearby is considerably more potent than a 1 second stun when Janna's all by herself.\n\nAshe is a massive asset in team-fights even if she's not getting credit for killing everything. She can literally do Malphite's job without ever putting herself in harms way, bringing massive initiation and siege potential, as well as essentially bringing a tank/support's utility to the table.\n\n---\n\nYour typical fighter/assassin jungler though? Melee range, single-target, only noteworthy CC is from Smite. Horrible team-fighter. \n\nHowever,they're generally fast - and when your mobility is designed so you've got a 50/50 shot at surviving a ~500 range dive with just enough HP to kill an enemy when ~4 opponents take off ~25% of your HP in an instant, diving onto a lone target when they take off ~25% of your HP is a very different scenario.\n\n----\n\nAnyways - team fight potential and dueling potential are usually counter-balanced.\n\nLoL isn't a 1v1 fest for balance as the end-game is blowing up the Nexus, which probably favors won team-fights over strings of duels.\n\nAshe plane sucks when she's by herself because she can still easily win games when she uses allies and teams to really push her kit to the next level.\nShe's actually sat in a ~52% monthly win-rate for multiple years in a row.\n\nYou just kind of need to accept you're never doing anything by yourself when playing Ashe, because outside of a few edge cases everyone else is a better duelist.

They had to give every melee champion a dash or they would be completely worthless as ashe sat their permakiting and laughing at them.
