I mean really, its so fun to just press the magic button and make everyone cry in tears that they can't kill you. Especially against {{champion:77}}, since when was the last time I ever saw that champion, the beginning of last season? I'm so happy that we can have an endless cycle of CC is countered by mobility, so therefore you need even more cc to counter they're mobility. I just love how {{champion:238}}  doesn't actually take skill in comparison to a mage like {{champion:45}}, since there's no room to give a champion like that power {{champion:238}}  therefore becomes EASIER! HAH! Isn't that just great?\r\nAlright so if it wasn't obvious, I'm being entirely sarcastic. I think its ridiculous that Riot hasn't perfected they're already existing champions and just goes on to make more that are seemingly clones of previous ones. Think {{champion:429}} to {{champion:110}}, if that's what you call original then I applaud you on your fucking huge ego. *Claps...... Then scratches his eyes out.*\r\nCould you take a break for a few months without releasing a new champion and fix the problems with the old ones? Oh yeah I remember there was a time a couple of you Rioters said you actually thought Mercial Crucible was what kept {{champion:22}} and {{champion:110}} from being good picks, and I'm still not sure if that's what you believe. I just wish you could communicate with us and ask us \"Why are assassins on the rise?\" So we can answer that by saying: \"You nerfed everything that wasn't broken.\" Or: \"Why are utility champions never picked over SUPER SAFE champions?\" Then: \"Because there isn't itemization that benefits from utility, but there is pure itemization built for bursty mobile champions.\" What if there actually was an item that scaled with utility and granted burst based on that alone?\r\nSome people out there might think: \"But utility gives power to your teammates, not only yourself! You can't make it even POSSIBLE for them to come up to the same level of mobile champions!\"\r\nBut then you should think, isn't mobility helping your team out? \"Oh sh-\" Yeah, not dying is op; Being able to go in, and burst people down before they can do any damage to that 150 health Mundo is apparently op. It shouldn't surprise anyone if some players built BorK and Last Wisper on they're second and third items just so that they could instantly kill the jungle, top laner, and support.

Do you even know why Zed is overpowered? Let me say what your problem is \"Zed used his FULL combo on me and I died as a squishy mage\" oh lordy, Name a mage who's full combo DOESN'T insta kill people? In case you don't know why Zed is a problem let me explain. Thanks to the mana problems (Which will be fixed, I know it) non mana reliant champions became dominant, Obviously this means Zed, Akali, Kat etc are going to rise. This is to be expected, The problem is, Zed has more shit in his kit then he actually needs, He doesn't need the extra attack speed to combo someone, so they took that away so he can't split push like a monster as easily now. They have said they have more tweaks for him, hence why I tell people to quit bitching about the one thing they have done which will soon follow with more. Another problem with Zed is he has a decent escape, which really can easily be solved by lowered the range his Shadows can go, As a jungle main, Zed is doomed the second I see him waste his W. \n\n2. Riot has not done this before, and another thread stating this idea has been brought up and a Riot member flat out said this would be horribly inefficient use of resources. But thank you, I am sure anyone who disagrees with you must surely be brainless, wouldn't want you to explain yourself, I mean whats the point in trying to share any information that I would be too stupid to understand (Sarcasm)\n\n3. Oh jesus this one, I think you need to research more about my rank, Where it shows I got to bronze 1 from promos and then didn't play anymore ranked the entire season other then to climb from bronze 3 to 1 (When LP decline was a thing still) in 1 afternoon, Nothing to do with \"Being stuck in a low division\" when rank is nothing more then a worthless label. Yes her ability to tunnel is for that, I was talking about her ults purpose, for just that, what is the actual point when a teleport is literally better in every single way, Again. In case you can't comprehend this, because you seem to think I am too stupid for you, I am talking about her ult. Her tunneling is good, her ult is -not good- it serves no purpose at all. Her CC is 1 conditional knockup, and a brief slow thats a skillshot, Not heavy enough CC to justify being a full tank, Her scalings are being ripped nerfed down, and she is losing her ability to even be a fighter, she serves NO purpose other then to be flashy. \n\n4. ... Kalista has terrible damage. This is widely accepted. Except by you which means nothing to me. Cait having a high range doesn't mean Kalista isn't complete bs to the rest of the ADC's or nearly every champion in the game so I don't get what your argument means. \"Oh cait outranges her early on\"  so what? I don't know why you just told me how her mobility works, I am pretty sure it was understood that I know how it works. And yes, Burn that flash then she hops back again, now you have no flash and she is still hopping back. No champion should be considered not bm or balanced based on whether they need multiple people to take them down, Yes getting a Leona or Thresh to grab her and CC her while you murder her can work, but that doesn't mean she isn't a problem. You also seem to forget that unlike her jumping after every auto attack, those items, and abilities have actual cooldowns, and much better uses then to mabe catch one person, who can nullify even those with enough attack speed.\n\n5. Wha? I never said all Rek Sai (A she by the way not he) had mobility, I said she has no real purpose, and her ult is a sucky version of teleport, and I never said Kalista was overpowered I said she is bullshit. As in, Toxic, Anti fun, The profanity you scream when you can't chase her or get away from her, because of a retarded hop.\n\n\"Not to mention Ashe has her ult with amazing CC potential (q/w), but Sivir has great reach with her Q.

Your going to still use that ranked crap, 99% of all games I have played on league for the last 2 years have been everything except ranked. I go against platinums and golds in normals, I have played with diamond elo friends, and gotten my ass kicked and sometimes kicked theirs. Whether its them having a low MMR or me having a high one I don't care because your rank doesn't define experience at all. I don't understand your Sivir comment, I was saying the 2 ADC's I play (Ashe and Sivir) are completely and easily capable of destroying her in lane with ease by any competent player.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MetalGearTeemu","date":"2015-01-26T08:44:53.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Narasimha,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Jy6akIb0,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-25T06:23:06.890+0000)\n> \n> I'm sorry to break your bubble, but you're just trying to fish for upvotes now.
