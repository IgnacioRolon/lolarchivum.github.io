It&#039;s like if it&#039;s a video game, there&#039;s a lesbian couple, but if it&#039;s a tv show, it&#039;s a man on man couple. You guys notice that? I&#039;m not too sure if it&#039;s because most gamers, not including mobile games, are male, meaning it&#039;s a lot easier for a straight dude to accept a lesbian relationship or if it&#039;s just a big coincidence. I think the same kind of logic can be applied to tv shows like Riverdale, where the gay character is usually a dude instead of a chick because most of the viewers are straight females that are more down with that than two females doing it. Just my thoughts and I&#039;d love to hear other&#039;s thoughts. Obviously this doesn&#039;t apply to games like fallout where all of the romantic npcs are bisexual... but at the same time, the only out of your control characters that were gay in fallout 4 were lesbian. Feels like a whole group is being left out lol. This thought has always been on my mind, but I just decided to bring it up now because of Neeko. Like the closest thing we have is Varus. Varus isn&#039;t gay, he&#039;s the darkin, but the two dudes being controlled by him were in a serious bromance that could be seen as gay, but imo, just looked like a bromance. \n\nIf y&#039;all didn&#039;t know, there were hints towards fiora being lesbo too. So how come we get 2 lesbos before 1 gay boy. Statistically speaking, around 3% of the population is gay (source: https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Gates-How-Many-People-LGBT-Apr-2011.pdf). We got 142 champions. If we do the math at least 2-3 more champs could be gay, statistically speaking, from earth. Being gay is probably 10000x more acceptable on runeterra, because we haven&#039;t really seen or heard of it not being lore wise, so these numbers could be bigger. \n\nMy vote is for Garen. He would break the annoying steryotype of all gay dudes being kinda girly. Media likes to make gay men look that way for some reason. We also all watch drag race, do our make up and have AMAZING fashion taste obviously.\n\nAlso the source that I gave is kinda outdated but I kinda expect the number has gone up by now from 3% to maybe 4 or 5%\n\nFound up Kai and Valmar, the two dudes trapped inside Varus were called in a romantic relationship in some random video, but at the same time, Kai and Valmar aren't the champion so my point still stands for at least 3 more champs to be gay.
