I submitted a ticket and the blitzcrank bot took my side, restored my old email and I got my account back. Not an hour later it happened again. I have already submitted another ticket but this time it isn’t getting a response. Is my email compromised? Should I change it to a different email? Can I get a human to talk to? When I try to use the “I want a human” option on the email it doesn’t do anything, just brings up my ticket again. Can you riot employees take my phone number and not let anyone change the info to my account without a verification code sent to my phone or anything else like that? I need help with this, I have put 3 to 4 years and a lot of money into this account ","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-02T00:01:46.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If someone was able to change your password again after recently getting your account recovered, there's a really good chance they have access to your personal email as well. I'd be sure to change that email password too when you can just to be extra safe!!\n\nAbout the tickets, poor Blitzcrank does his best but still malfunctions every once and awhile. He's trying so hard sometimes lol xD! \n\nIf it's still not getting to an agent, hit that request a human button and then make sure to type something and submit that reply. That should get the job done. If not, send me your ticket number and I'll make sure it gets to and agent personally ^_^!","replies":[]}]}
