I play on the lowest specs available dont have many problems with it. Don't really need high graphics. \r\n\r\nIve been using an hp pavilion amd a6 4400\r\nIt has 8 gb ram installed says 512mb memory on my video card in the hardware area on the amd manager. Online it shows them at 2gb. However i dont think that's what i have clearly shows 512mb on video memory. \r\n\r\n i purchased a\r\n\r\nHP 15-bw071nr - 15.6\" - A9 9420 - 4 GB RAM - 1 TB HDD - US\r\nCPU AMD A9 9420 / 3 GHz\r\nMax Turbo Speed 3.6 GHz\r\nNumber of Cores Dual-Core\r\nAUDIO &amp; VIDEO\r\nGraphics Processor AMD Radeon R5\r\nTotal Available Graphics Memory 2118 MB\r\n\r\nnot sure if anybody can help  but i feel like its an upgrade. my pc tells me its 512 mb memory. Which i find cringe worthy compared to the 2gb which the specs for my new purchase boasts.( Even that's trash but it's what i can afford) \r\nI don't want to jump to conclusions just because i see bigger numbers on things i don't understand. Ty to whomever took the time out of thier busy day to read, and or respond to this. You are appreciated!! Much love. Hope to see you guys on the rift with my new machine without any hang ups.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-06T21:58:20.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My best guess is that the amd manager is talking about 512 *dedicated* video ram which is a little different from what your pc has for ram overall. I'd say it's safe to assume that you have 2 gb sticks for ram if that's what you purchased.","replies":[{"poster":"ZealHozi","date":"2017-12-06T22:30:30.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ram in my old pc is 8gb i installed it myself.

[**Recommended specs**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752654) call for something around Nvidia GeForce 8800 or AMD Radeon HD 5670.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
