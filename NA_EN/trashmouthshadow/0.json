Its tone gives the piece a somewhat ethereal feel in the beginning with the D + A chord being pumped. and then, after the Cello solo, the &quot;Dramatic part&quot; after where the D+A and F+D Chord comes in, now that part I just love. To me, it sounds like Lamb and Wolf are chasing down their prey, and on the final Chord of the &quot;Chord Spam&quot; as I call it, is the part where wolf strikes the killing blow to his prey. But overall, this piece has me tipping my hat to you sir. But just one question, waht was the key you wrote this piece in? I suspected it was D minor, until I saw the Ab, (confused) But all jokes aside, Phenomenal, Ethereal, Dramatic, Ominous. These are the words I would describe your piece, sir.\r\nBut all jokes aside, there is something I would like to tell you, Ed the Conqueror. My music Teacher has this thing where all of his students vote a select few  students to go into a concert with the teacher, and apparently, I got the top amount of votes. Immediately, I had the top amount of votes. So my teacher asked me what piece I wanted to learn, and three guesses as to the first piece that popped up in my head.\r\n{{champion:203}} &#039;s piece!\r\nIn two months, I will be performing your piece, live in front of about 1000 people in a theater.\r\nI was wondering if there was any way I could direct send this video to you, because the entire thing will be recorded.\r\nAnd it would mean the world to me if you could give me some tips about playing the piece, (dynamics, finger placements for running, etc.)\r\nI&#039;m really nervous, but excited.\r\nKindred is one of my favorite characters to play as because their entire aesthetic is something to marvel at as well as the playstyle.\r\nAnyways, thank you for your time for even reading this. and for your time.\r\n&quot;Beauty fades. That, is why it is beautiful.&quot;\r\nthis is my usual build: \r\n{{item:1412}}  {{item:3006}}  {{item:3078}}  {{item:3153}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3022}}  (Depending on enemy team :P )\r\n-SpectraNocturnal\r\nPS If anyone can tag Mr. Conqueror to this that&#039;d be great :P","replies":[{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2016-01-14T00:26:00.225+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nI saw SpectraNocturnal's post and will get back to him soon. \n\nGotta run to a recording session, but really psyched to be reading this!\n\nEd the Conqueror","replies":[{"poster":"TrashMouthShadow","date":"2016-01-17T02:40:55.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do I get that feedback now...?","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashMouthShadow","date":"2016-01-14T23:51:24.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, Mr. Conqueror and I anticipate your reply :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thera Tears","date":"2016-01-13T11:03:37.737+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like his music too\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/eb-music/mapping-out-the-human-heart?in=eb-music/sets/music-for-film-1#t=0:02\n\nand wow you'll be performing in front of that many people? break a leg :)","replies":[{"poster":"TrashMouthShadow","date":"2016-01-13T20:57:15.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a bunch <3 do me a favor and spread the word and hopefully Ed himself will hear about this? :)","replies":[{"poster":"Thera Tears","date":"2016-01-13T23:35:59.645+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SpectraNocturnal,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=5skqFOb5,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-01-13T20:57:15.301+0000)\n>\n> Thanks a bunch <3 do me a favor and spread the word and hopefully Ed himself will hear about this? :)\n\numm...\n\nwould it make more sense to leave him a message on his website?\n\nhttp://www.eb-music.net/contact/","replies":[{"poster":"TrashMouthShadow","date":"2016-01-14T00:00:00.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dang didn't know about that thank you so much","replies":[{"poster":"Thera Tears","date":"2016-01-14T00:03:25.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SpectraNocturnal,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=5skqFOb5,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-01-14T00:00:00.635+0000)\n>\n> Dang didn't know about that thank you so much\n\nDon't get your hopes up :(\nRiot Games employees are not exactly PR people\nmost the PR work is {{summoner:11}} ing young people","replies":[{"poster":"TrashMouthShadow","date":"2016-01-14T00:05:31.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"welp, can't hurt to try...","replies":[{"poster":"Thera Tears","date":"2016-01-14T00:14:59.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SpectraNocturnal,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=5skqFOb5,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-01-14T00:05:31.602+0000)\n>\n> welp, can't hurt to try...\n\n\numm if it doesn't work out try this, you are a customer\n\ne-mail icna_support@tencent.com\n\ntelling them what you told everyone\n\n\nI'm pretty sleepy right now and my blood sugar is at funny level going to sleep good luck","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
