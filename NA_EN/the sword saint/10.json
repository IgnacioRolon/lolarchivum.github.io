The real motive always seems to be, 'I wanted that lane/champion and someone else locked it in first'.\n\nIf you're actually legitimately more concerned about strategist a team comp, then you'd be happy to have one or two people lock in fast so you have something to base your discussion off of and can finish it faster. If jungle yi and midlane zed are already locked in, you have a place to start - you should probably look for some tanky ap champions for top and support with heavy cc and you can probably get away with someone like ezreal who is safe but does less damage since you already have two big ad threats. If noone locked in, you would have a lot more options for every player - but that would also take much longer to figure out what team to build, instead of having a place to start based on who locked in already.\n\nBut again, if you see people lock in and get annoyed at them instead of working around their picks, it means that you probably just wanted to play something that you can't anymore if you ALSO have some 'ideal meta' that you're striving for.\n\nPeople are still going to go into blind pick determined to play a specific champion (especially with the existence of mastery points). They are going to pick the champ they wanted and calmly discuss with you the fact that they aren't going to change their pick. You can whine and scream and argue and threaten all you want, but when it comes down to it you have no ground to stand on. You don't have the right to force anyone into a lane or pick their champ for them - just as you don't have the right to choose their runes/masteries/item build. Riot will not in fact back you up on this.\n\nDon't even try to bring up 'not communicating'. They will communicate that they are going to pick the champ they want. Just because you have a specific meta team comp in mind AND refuse to be the one to fill to make the team comp you want happen, doesn't mean that the other person 'didn't communicate'. It means you have didn't like what they had to say and got all pissy.\n\nIt's real simple: you either care more about playing a specific champ and lane then you care about the team comp you want or vice versa. If you care more about the team, you fill and shut up about the insta locker. If you care more about the champ, then you lock in your champ too. Just don't whine that you can't have literally everything work out they way you personally wanted to.\n","replies":[]}
