Maybe you got camped, maybe you had a bad lane, maybe you fucked up, maybe you picked something silly and fun blind into someone going super tryhard fotm nonsense, whatever. Sometimes this shit happens and it can be really really infuriating. \r\n\r\nDon&#039;t be the guy who gangs up on the one having a rough time in all chat with the enemy team. That&#039;s such a scummy thing to do. If someone goes 0/8  as a melee blind picked into a darius and got camped, just let them surrender if the rest of the team is also behind. You attitude of &#039;never give up, never surrender&#039; in a blind pick normal doesn&#039;t make you some cool anime character, it makes you an ass. If you must hold everyone else hostage to your own personal code of never surrendering even in an extremely painful crushing defeat, have the decency not to talk shit about the people who already don&#039;t want to be here just because they&#039;re off afk farming or something because they could not be less interested in you making your epic normal game hero stand.","replies":[]}
