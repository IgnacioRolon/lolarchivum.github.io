LCS strategies don't work in low elo, and low elo strategies don't work in LCS. So if they skillset that a person uses to be successful in say platinum or diamond mostly revolve around higher level strategies as opposed to raw mechanics and punishing mistakes, they will have a harder time trying to carry low elo where those strategies just aren't effective.\n\nIt's not just a league thing. If you're playing poker, you have to play differently vs an experienced player than against a novice. You can potentially read an experienced player because they have logic and plans behind their actions. Since you and the opponent both understand the odds and are making decisions based on calculation and knowing your enemy, you can make more informed decisions and you alter your play to take advantage of subtleties. A novice really does't understand the difference between good and bad hands, or when it makes sense to bet or call or fold. They don't take relevant data from one hand to the next. The strategies that are effective against an experienced player are not effective against a novice because the novice is immune to bluffs and manipulation and calculation by virtue of ignorance.\n\nOfc an experienced poker player can crush a novice, but they have to adjust the way they play since the higher level tactics are both ineffective and inefficient. The same goes for league. You have to play against the enemies you're facing that game and take into account the teammates you have that game. Know thyself and know thy enemy and all that.\n\nNo, the take away is that the strategies that work in gold+ are designed to fight skilled players, and rely on everyone on the team having a certain baseline skill and knowledge of the game.\n\nThese strategies fall apart in low elo games because unskilled players don't know how to capitalize on high elo strategy's. A higher elo strategy executed successfully will FORCE a SMALL and TEMPORARY advantage that can be exploited QUICKLY to build a lead and eventually break into the enemy base and win. These strategies work will in a skilled vs skill environment because skilled players don't make as many mistakes as unskilled players.\n\nHowever, low skilled players make mistakes constantly. They make them so often that high elo strategies designed to force an temporary advantage are INEFFICIENT. Trying to do a complicated rotation to bait and pick an enemy off so you can siege a tower 5v4 is good in high elo because without forcing the enemy into making a mistake, they won't make one with enough frequency to reliably close a game out. In low elo, 3 guys have been caught farming a side lane or chased someone into an ambush in the time you were taking to set up a guaranteed catch from a rotation. Which means even if you consistently pull of higher level plays, you can easily end up falling behind as a team due to the team death match / lack of map awareness of the rest of the players.\n\nSo you have to adapt. You have to play the game on their level. If you have high elo mechanics, accept that its a team death match and be better at it then the other players so that you end up winning more games on average.","replies":[{"poster":"Dediguise","date":"2015-09-09T09:21:11.288+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"there's a broader issue here. This means that players who have High ELO potential are stuck in lower tiers not just because of bad teams, but because they have adjusted their playstyle to their ELO. It means that once they do advance they have to unlearn many of the highrisk high reward plays that define low tiers. Which results in them dragging down players on their level etc etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-09-09T13:35:25.469+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not quite that simple. You can still climb fairly easily just by having solid fundamentals. You can make it to Gold just by CSing well even if you're otherwise trash at this game.

If you were in silver you would see, the skill differentials are gigantic in silver. Riot forces players to play at the very least hundreds of games to get into the skill level they could be put in much faster with a better system. A system that, btw, should be VERY easy to create. This game is ruined by the fact that people who don't play all day every day have to play with people of much less skill level just because Riot refuses to create a decent and sensible advancement/skill based league system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WarlockLaw","date":"2015-09-09T19:52:24.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All the low elo games I remember/have seen are bloodbaths.

They dictate the flow of the game by using their mechanical skill to draw a massive amount of pressure to themselves and this works because they know that the harder they make it on themselves (as long as they can handle it), the easier it makes it for the rest of the team.\n\nDoublelift would push botlane to the nexus in like the first 10 minutes of the game, just out trading people so hard they had to go base or die and pushing nonstop. He gained a significant level advantage this way (levels are equal to a lot of gold in stats) and so much cs that whenever he came back to lane he would powerspike so hard that noone could deal with him. Now, part of why he could push THAT HARD that early was that he was duo botlane with another pro as support, but the idea as a whole is sound. If you can carefully balance pushing as hard as you can with not dying to ganks, you can warp the game's flow in your teams favor.","replies":[{"poster":"Hotlin3 Fling","date":"2015-09-09T23:28:25.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why old proxy singed was broken","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-09-09T06:26:25.113+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which is why smurf always pick snowbally assassins and singlehandedly stomp the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Egillion","date":"2015-09-09T09:01:35.352+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lower elo strategies are basically a constant blood bath where retards die every other minute after respawning lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Carnage","date":"2015-09-09T08:14:21.656+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is so true its sad{{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2015-09-09T07:24:45.989+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"And this is why I'm quickly starting to regret ever becoming a support main.
