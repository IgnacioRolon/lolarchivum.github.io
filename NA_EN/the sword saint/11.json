This is because rivens base 90% cdr includes her flash, which is therefor always up and can be combined with just a single 2000 range q to zip right past all potential defenders\n* By taking your hand off the mouse and using it to mash rivens ability keys with two hands, you can double her damage. this is why she&#039;s known as the &#039;no skill faceroll&#039; champ of legend\n* Riven's passive is that every time she gets a spell, she gets five sheen procs on her spells instead of autoattacks so every spell deals 250-500 extra damage after the first.\n* Riven main's ban their counters and nothing else in draft, therefor unlike other champions Riven never faces a counter lane.\n* When Riven is a selected champion, the enemy team is disabled from buying armor items in the store, especially if they are a top laner.\n* Riven leaves roughly half of her games. The best strategy is often to just not lose long enough for her to afk.\n* At one time, red elixers could be bought at level 1. No riven ever lost a game during this time.\n* All riven players religiously watch boxbox streaming because occasionally they get the rare opportunity to see a mysterious super hot girl who is cosplaying as riven and plays just as well as boxbox, but is totally a girl and not boxbox\n* Riven has a hidden passive that draws the attention of the enemy jungler whenever she is losing lane, allowing her to farm two champions at once in order to catch back up\n* Even when losing lane hard and down many levels and cs, one kill can put riven back in the game. This is because unlike other champions riven gains 100x normal xp and 3000g on champion kill\n* Unlike other champions, Riven actually has fans and a playerbase. This is a weakness, as riven is unable to have anyone speak in her defence without the statement being dismissed as 'defending their waifu' and thus logically completely invalid regardless of the players ranking or personal knowledge on the matter\n*Unlike other champions, riven players can buy items from the shop, most notably she can get free lifesteal to even out her lack of innate sustain and hp regen (by buying items that gives lifesteal and sustain like hydra and potions). She can even get free revives (by buying ga), free %hp damage (by buying botrk), free tankiness (by buying tank items), free cdr (by buying cdr items), free armor pen (by buying armor pen items) and free movespeed (by buying boots). Looking at it this way, riven truly has no weaknesses because unlike other champions, she can buy items to exaggerate her strengths or reduce her weaknesses.\n* All Riot employees are Riven (Zed, Vayne, Lee Sin and Thresh) mains which is why she is immune to being nerfed\n* Some people might argue that Riven's purely AD scaling abilities robs your team of a tank. This is grossly untrue, her E gives her (permanent) bonus HP and as the Cinderhulk meta showed us, HP is the only tanky stat you will ever need.\n* Playing Riven takes all mental capacities of any living person, that is why Riven mains dunno how to play any other champion but their apm is 100 times higher than average human.\n\nShare your own riven facts here and I may add them to the list.","replies":[{"poster":"MarkedOfKane","date":"2015-08-27T20:33:42.392+0000","up_votes":135,"down_votes":2,"body":"If a Riven main is on your team, you lose the game.

The AD scaling *is* odd, I guess. I mean, you could argue about Janna's shield, since she can shield herself *or* allies and even turrets if she wants, giving them a decent AD steroid with a small AP scaling.\n\nAnd the dash/shield doesn't have a 2 second cooldown, it has 10-6 seconds. If you build cooldown reduction (which you should as Riven), that's a 6 seconds max to barely more than 3 seconds. Since I'm not a Riven main, it could use a higher cooldown but it's not two seconds (that belongs to Vayne, who gets an aa steroid instead of a shield). At least the shield lasts 1.5 seconds, only long enough for a trade or a clutch save, but other shields tend to last longer like Naut's 10 second shield or Janna's 5 second. \n\nOther champions have ways to heal themselves outside of lifesteal, and Riven's passive is hardly unique for proc'ing lifesteal. Lifesteal is proc'd by abilities modified by on-hit effects or abilities that modify autoattacks. I'm not sure Sheen lifesteals, but I believe Riven's passive counts as an ability autoattack modifier. \n\nSo to answer your entire question altogether, the answer is no. No other champion has that combination of three variables, because Riven is her own champion. Can Riven's kit heal her own teammates? Can Riven point and click cc at range like Lissandra? Does she have a global skillshot that can get a kill from across the map? Apples and oranges dude.\n\n\"some quote that tries to mock different opinions\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-08-27T19:27:35.325+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riven's passive is that every time she gets a spell, she gets five sheen procs on her spells instead of autoattacks so every spell deals 250-500 extra damage after the first.","replies":[{"poster":"The Sword Saint","date":"2015-08-27T19:33:10.129+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't know that, I'll add it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Adrian Umbra","date":"2015-08-27T19:19:39.552+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":4,"body":"Riven was designed by CertainlyT, just like Zed, Irelia, Urgot, Volibear, Elise, Skarner's rework, and Blitzcrank.\n\nThat's why she's so broken, obviously.","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2015-08-27T20:09:20.549+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Adrian Umbra,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Q0vNxKZj,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-08-27T19:19:39.552+0000)\n>\n> Riven was designed by CertainlyT, just like Zed, Irelia, Urgot, Volibear, Elise, Skarner's rework, and Blitzcrank.\n> \n> That's why she's so broken, obviously.\n\nUrgot and Blitzcrank?!?
