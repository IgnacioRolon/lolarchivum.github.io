Yes, the matchmaking system tries to force you to have a 50% winratio (if you play enough). But it doesn't do this by matching you with worse teams, it does it by matching you with better/worse players in both teams.\nIf you have a G1 MMR and win 10 games in a row in one day then the system thinks you play on P4 level. Therefore it will match you with players who average P4 in both teams. But seeing how form depends on the day and you may have simply had a super great day but are unable to play at P4 niveau. \nThat means on the next day when you play at G1 niveau again it's very likely that you lose a few games so that your MMR drops from P4-G1.\n\nBut seeing how most people tend to seek faults in their teammates rather then themselves they get the impression that not them, but their teams got worse.

If you win a bunch of games in a row, your MMR becomes higher than the average MMR in your current division, so the system will either place you with better players altogether, or make you the highest MMR player on your team more often. \n\nSome people don't realize what that means in terms of their own climb/improvement as a player. There's a big difference between being the middle MMR on your team and being the highest. They tend to look at it like oh I'm the best player on my team, even the game, I deserved to win, and not understand that yes that's the system's actual intention before the match started and you need to grind out more wins than you currently do AFTER a win streak if you want to climb.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2017-01-13T04:10:25.790+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"haha dude im serious.

They have all but admitted it to me when I have emailed support.  What I used to do was just log out until win day.  I would not play because I cared about my ranking.  \n\nWhat's upsetting is that, I don't get to play.   \n\nWhat bothers me most though....is that it's intentional.  for all my work, I cannot carry 4 people that hard.  At least not these 4.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaryelle","date":"2017-01-13T01:57:38.342+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think it's intentional, but an oversight. Something in their system adjusts too much at one time where you are matched with or against a 'worse' or 'better' team depending on your win/loss streak. It's intended so that everyone gets a ~50% win rate, but it's implemented the wrong way as many can see with the 'win streaks' and 'lose streaks' being so obvious at times.","replies":[]}]}]}
