I know they started a discord report server [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/xkRfEHZs-discord-moderation) and you can also report them in the victory/defeat screen. Otherwise the last resource i can think of is what your using now, posting a problem and then wait for riot to respond asking for more detailed information.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moooose3","date":"2017-04-08T03:30:30.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean sure that's inappropriate behavior, but not sure if you can call one line of text bullying.
