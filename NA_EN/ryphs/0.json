I want you to try something relatively easy to see if it helps at all, try updating your DNS settings to 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 and test that in a practice/custom game. Let me know if that helps your connection at all!","replies":[{"poster":"Ryphs","date":"2018-01-23T23:08:37.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"appreciate the advice! I actually have been testing with google's DNS server back and fourth and it seems to be slightly better.\n\nFor context, my input seems to be slightly delayed, maybe only half a fraction of a second, but as we know that's still the difference between life and death every game. additionally every ~10 minutes i'll completely freeze up for a few seconds (while I can see everything happening around me.) my ping and fps remain completely fine... never really had an issue like this. last time I was having problems with wiring, but I've had it replaced just a couple of months ago, I'd be amazed if the internet's wiring is busted again. it was perfectly fine after I rewired though. sorry, rambling.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-24T01:05:36.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm those issues do actually sound like the problems you'd see when having issues with a lot of packet loss, so that might be the cause after all. If you don't mind, reach out to your ISP just to make sure they aren't having any known problems again. It might not be related to *your* network, but one of the stops your connection takes on it's way to our servers (similar to the wiring problem).","replies":[]}]}]}]}
