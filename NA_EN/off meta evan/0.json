The one Kha I played with was way, way ahead, and I was still able to fight him reasonably as the adc. I think he was 7/1 and I was 3/1 or something. I am happy, in general, with the way things turned out. While it's likely that any given champ is a little strong or a little weak, it seems to me like the goals of having counterplay to assassins have hit the mark.","replies":[{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-11-10T19:51:29.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Plat Kha main, he is actually weaker than he was.
