Disagree?\r\n\r\nIs he still a good pick to ban?   What do you think?\r\n\r\nI haven't seen him banned as much recently and people are even saying specifically NOT to ban him.\r\n\r\nAhri was \"nerfed\" and she's stronger than she's been in a long time...?

Twice today (technically yesterday as it is past mignight here) I have gotten overleveled because the enemy team left top lane after feeding me. Fizz top works a lot better than fizz mid as top usually has little to no poke. Once Fizz gets this fed, stack magic resist until late game or you will get destroyed. However, it is very rare for this to happen as I have a unique way of sitting through poke and then recalling and tping back and diving right on them with ignite and getting a kill. It works wonders mid too. His ult allows me to simply kill someone again and be 2/0 by level 6 if everything goes well. Still, his Q does no damage even with Lich Bane so just try to avoid his E and his Ez-Doge R and you should be fine against him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-02-01T05:28:27.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically if you counter any of the current six top bans, yes, he can be on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-02-01T05:03:39.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you plan on playing an immobile mage mid, then he's worth banning. While he can't 100-0 people without pressing R until he's got a Lichbane and a Rabadon's, he can very easily make an immobile mid with their flash down cry as soon as he has a Sheen and his R. A quick R, then E at them, W+Q and they're usually dead unless they're stacking magic resist. Done it a number of times to Cass, Brand, and even smashed a few Yasuos.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talamare","date":"2015-02-01T04:46:21.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally feel he is off the ban list for now","replies":[]}]}
