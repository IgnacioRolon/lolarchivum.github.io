Most seems pretty good, some i think might be a bit too strong (Talon&#039;s E on certain terrain).  And then i got to Zed and became very very concerned.  For those who don&#039;t know he know gets a new ability on his ultimate where he gets a % of the targets AD if he kills them, this is a permanent bonus to his physical damage.  I worry that this could lead to a trend where Zed&#039;s suicide again the ADC and every kills nets them 15-30 AD.   I&#039;m scared that we are going to see Zed&#039;s with only 3 end items, but still rocking 300+ AD  (Why bother building damage if i stack a chunk everytime someone dies?)\r\n\r\nNow i will admit i don&#039;t have all the info.  Don&#039;t know if the ability doesn&#039;t stack if you kill the same target.  Don&#039;t know what % of the AD he gets.  What i am really curious about is what the exact requirements are.  Does Zed have to kill you with Death Mark&#039;s delayed damage?  Does he just have to kill you while the ability is active?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-11-03T06:33:13.876+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed only gets bonus AD from the highest AD target he's killed while they've been affected by his ult.

This has been discussed and clarified several times.\n\nThe damage does not stack, and in order to get the AD, you have to kill your target with your ult, NOTHING ELSE. You know the shuriken that pops up above someone's head when they will die to Zeds ult? Yeah, you need that, and then need the ult to pop and kill them in order to get the AD bonus.\n\nAlso, the AD bonus does not scale with your opponent as they get more AD. If you killed the ADC when they had only 100 AD, then your ult will be based off of that 100 AD until you kill them again when they have more AD, or kill someone else with more than 100 AD.\n\nGet what I'm saying?","replies":[]}]}
