ADC&#039;s can no longer critically strike, but in exchange they average between 500-750 Attack Damage, with ability ratios scaled to account for the new numbers (can&#039;t have someone firing a line nuke and clearing the whole wave just off that).

Hell i can almost stand the idea of 4 items giving 50% crit, high chance to do it each attack BUT equal chance you will not get it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-29T05:23:16.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imagine Jhin, attacking as fast as Vayne.","replies":[]}]}
