Also it is very possible to burn through your wards much quicker.  5-6 mins assumes 1 ward out at a time.  If you have to ward 2-3 places at once (like say multiple chock points) you need to base closer to once ever 1.5-3 mins and spend about 20-30 second getting back to your teammates.

Since you have 4 wards on a completed support item, you shouldn't be using all of them at once. The reason they took away buying wards from the shop and put this effect on support items is because supports would be 20/30 minutes into a game with only their support item, health potions, and vision wards since warding was always forced onto the support. Currently if you want good vision then everyone has to be warding. They should reduce the cooldown on the warding totem and increase the duration of wards again though because early game vision us so bad and you can get oracle lens and duskblade so early in the game currently.
