From a gameplay perspective I think she doesn't really feel like a sniper. Jhin has a lot of things I think Caitlyn needs; long skillshots, slow attack speed, more tactical traps, etc. So I'm not sure in which direction Riot could take her to still differentiate her from Jhin.\n\n{{champion:117}} Her visual effects and color palette need some serious work. She is producing a lot of visual noise with almost every ability, and her palette clashes with itself (just look at that shield). I can't really say what bothers me about her gameplay, it just feels weird to me.\n\n{{champion:40}} Since she isn't a human air mage anymore, but a spirit, I feel like there are a lot of interesting possibilities for a new look. Her gameplay feels pretty linear. Shield your adc, slow whoever approaches you, throw a Q in there and ult if somebody gets too close. Her Q is her only skillshot which leaves little room for counterplay or skill expresssion, other than positioning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BLIGHTBRINGER","date":"2018-04-13T11:31:54.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:110}} - His lore changes don't really match him being a mad killer tormenting his foes before closing in on the kill (his Q is the only ability in the game that fits his lore). His kit other than W and R don't feel impactful, E and Q won't be dealing any damage on their own because everyone builds on-hit on him making Q and E only be used for Blight stacks. He is in general one of the weaker of the (2 Darkins {{champion:141}} {{champion:266}}). Aatrox is going to get teased next week and I can already tell that he's going to be awesome. Varus will be the only Darkin Champion left forgotten. \n\n* I would want to get rid of the power from his W and spread it equally across his kit so his abilities actually felt equally impactful as his W is now.\n\n* I would like to see a more unique, interesting passive other than an attack speed steroid.\n\n>***\n\n{{champion:32}} - I don't know where to start with Amumu. His Visuals are really in need of an update on particular, there was an image online that showed someone's visual update for him ( https://us.v-cdn.net/5021068/uploads/editor/zw/6k4o3jrib6vq.png ). \n\n* I think his kit is fine the way it is but maybe change his E most of all because it doesn't really add up to the rest of his kit. \n\n* Maybe move the damage reducement from physical attacks to his W when it's active.\n\n>***\n\n{{champion:56}} - He is described to be a Demonic Wraith. What I find weird about Nocturne visually is why he needs blades attached to his hands. When Wraiths commonly use their hands to slash through anything since their hands/fingers are as sharp as blades (example: https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/lotc-creature-index/images/a/a4/Wraith.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150826225640 ). There is this visual that I saw online that perfectly sums up what Nocturne is supposed to look like ( https://www.artstation.com/artwork/mKgN1 ). All of Nocturne's abilities don't feel unique or interesting, his ult is the only unique ability and it's the only impactful ability he has.\n\n* So it would be nice to see a complete VGU for Nocturne, but leaving his Ult the way it is.","replies":[{"poster":"Honeydew Zekling","date":"2018-04-13T15:28:45.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree with your comments on Nocturne. He was one of the first champs I picked up years back. I thought he was really cool and loved his ult. In the current state of the game, is Q,W, and E all feel really lack luster. I love that they are giving him some tiny buffs but he really does need an update.\n\nHis E takes quite awhile to go off and only really works well with completely isolated champs with low mobility. It works better with his ult and Q but it makes him feel slow and clunky.\n\nHis W help's for those 1v1 skirmishes and rewards you with more attack speed if you pull it off. It's not bad but really doesn't feel like it fits Noc. It really feels like a way to allow him to ult successfully without being instantly 100/0'd when he jumps to someone. Would love to see something more nightmare-y/wraith-like.\n\nHis Q also makes him feel clunky. It's not that fast moving. It give's you a little more attack damage when you're on it (boring) and allows you to move a little faster to chase enemies (also boring).\n\nHis spells feel clunky and all centered around his ult. While his ult is really cool and I love it, I wish his other THREE SPELLS felt more in line with his character. I mean, why doesn't he have invis/camo?

Plus he's HIDEOUS, absolutely, irrevocably hideous, and not in the \"unknowable HP Lovecraft monster\" hideous. He's hideous in the \"this looks like a child's drawing that was modeled for the SNES or N64\" way. He needs modernization to make him look formidable, and less like a joke.\n\nFiddlesticks has a mass of random abilities crammed  together that somehow work, but his overall cohesion is non-existent. He could definitely use some polishing and some refining, and something to give his kit some uniqueness and synergy. I personally like the part of the passive where he becomes still after a set period (it has GREAT prospects for a VGU, to give him an actual scarecrow look when stationary), but I think the bonuses he gains from moving again could use some boosting and could be altered to fit a new kit. \n\nMordekaiser is supposed to be an AP bruiser, but requires health to do abilities - something that conflicts deeply with his design as he's got very little in terms of recovery in his kit. Furthermore, I don't think sacrificing HP really makes sense on an demi-lich* like Mordekaiser, since he's a soul in a suit of armor with untold necromantic powers. I think Morde needs to be mana based, and his kit needs more impressive abilities to give us the feeling that he's an actual undead warlord necromancer who steals souls and thirsts for conquest. I think if he gets a VGU, his Q should be the only thing that stays, as it's kinda unique to him, but everything else should go.\n\n\n*A Demi-lich is a D&D lich who has transcended regular lichdom and has removed their soul from their body, and their spirit now travels about, usually from plane to plane. While their soul is removed from their body, their body decays, leaving behind the skeleton, which typically acts as their phylactery - this is almost exactly what Mordekaiser is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustaNewb","date":"2018-04-13T13:56:53.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:86}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:90}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-04-13T13:51:54.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:82}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:62}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Step Sis Lux","date":"2018-04-13T13:12:45.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:105}}  Basiclly 0 counterplay, he needs full rework\n{{champion:24}}  Stupid beta champion without any changes\n{{champion:113}}  Give me back my old gurl","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2018-04-13T11:56:14.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For some reason, people always omit {{champion:54}} from rework discussions.
