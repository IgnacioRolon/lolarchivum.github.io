It is quite entertaining, and the track they put together for it is perfect for the skin. The question I wanted to pose is; will the song in the video be posted to the [LeagueofLegends Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/leagueoflegends)? I also notice you guys have yet to post the music for Azir and Sion's login screens; are these coming to the Soundcloud soon?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Eno","date":"2014-10-14T15:57:50.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll look into the Dunkmaster Darius video music - hang tight!\n\nAs for Azir and Sion, they'll be coming soon. The music team has been working on overdrive to get ready for Worlds. You can probably expect to see them in a couple weeks.\n\nSorry for the delay!","replies":[{"poster":"Hexterity","date":"2014-11-06T17:35:38.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On a related note (and apologies for the long-delayed addition to this; I just found it!), will the files on soundcloud in wav format be made available in mp3 format, as well? Specifically, I noticed the Spirit Guard Udyr and all the songs from the 2014 World Championship are that way - and converting them on my end seems to deteriorate them, some. Thanks for your time!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jakethenight","date":"2014-10-14T17:13:14.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response Eno!
