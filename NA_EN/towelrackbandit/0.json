Now whenever I press spacebar it holds onto me for a fraction of a second and then goes back to being unlocked. Is there anyway to fix this or am I just boned?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-03T22:57:34.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The camera should focus on you as long as you hold your spacebar down.  There might be an issue with the keyboard that's releasing the key.  Would you be able to swap to another keyboard as a way to rule out this possibility?","replies":[{"poster":"TowelRackBandit","date":"2016-08-03T23:01:12.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me try that real quick","replies":[{"poster":"TowelRackBandit","date":"2016-08-03T23:55:39.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems to be working now.
