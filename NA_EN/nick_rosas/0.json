Her Passive does not show a notification on the tool bar or on the champion how many times she has auto attacked for her to deal more damage. For example, Vayne's W silver bolts mark the enemies and shows the rings under the champion, letting Vayne know how many times she needs to auto attack to complete the damage. As for Diana, I know it shows when the next auto attack will deal more damage, but that also needs to have a timer. A timer shown on the toolbar. A notification.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-01-15T20:29:57.607+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do agree that she needs a timer at least for the tool bar.
