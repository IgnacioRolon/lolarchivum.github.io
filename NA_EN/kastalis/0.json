Sure could send a img of that, but that's nothing new here, all of you seen that already. Error showed up today, 2 days ago game worked perfectly fine. What I already tryed:\r\n- Dissabling firewall\r\n- Restarting router\r\n- Restarting network\r\n- Restarting pc\r\n- Using hextech repair tool\r\n\r\nI got kicked out from ranked game, after that I decided only to try it out on normal games, but already have to wait damn 20 minutes for every single one of them, witch furthermore prolong any testing possible ways to fix it. At this point, I believe it's server sided, since no changes were made past those  days. Pc off fof a whole weekend, and no one else had any chance to use it. \r\n\r\nAny ideas or at least a way to undo that 20 waiting time? Kind of hurts to be punished for server issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-26T22:23:27.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, you always want to do troubleshooting in custom or practice games where you won't get punished further for disconnections. There haven't been any widespread EUNE server issues today, so it's most likely your network was having problems getting a solid connection or something was getting in the way of your connection before it could hit our servers. \n\nFirst I'd try updating your port forwarding and DNS settings to get a clearer signal. You can follow those steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) if you aren't familiar with how to set those options up. I'd also try using an ethernet cord if this happens often, as wired is almost always stronger and more reliable than wireless. If those steps aren't helping shoot me a quick traceroute to the EUNE servers at  31.186.224.42 so I can get a look at what's going on.","replies":[]}]}
