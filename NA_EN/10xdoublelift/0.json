I don't want to see her there, either. Unless, of course, it's norms and people are queuing with a full group of friends and simply having fun 'doing stuff'. My friends and I used to do that all the time. Queue as 5 in norms and do random stuff, like Melee bot, ranged (non adc) junglers and Mage top. It was fun because of the random factor combined with friends.\n\nBut, yeah, in an actual game of 'I want to win and that's my focus', then yes, Camille should not be going bot lane.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rockm Sockm","date":"2016-12-11T08:49:13.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like any fun laner, especially top, she will be nerfed until she can only jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Packun Flower","date":"2016-12-11T06:57:13.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She can jungle though.
