I log back in to duo with my friend and i get a 20 min dodge timer, which seems pretty unfair. I would understand if i dodged but it was the clients fault not mine and i get penalized? Seems like this should be looked at for future players going through a client bug. Its happened to me before, its rare but anytime i go through this i get a dodge timer and it sucks :/\r\nShouldn't there be a way for riot to see after i send bug report that i didnt dodge?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-26T00:03:40.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the client run into files that are missing or weren't updated properly, the game won't be able to run. Since the client isn't constantly scanning for damaged files (this would take up far too much processing power from your pc), the client can't anticipate having problems. Let your client repair, and make sure you've got a solid connection, preferably ethernet when you're patching.","replies":[]}]}
