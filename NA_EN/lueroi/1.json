I use to be able to play league in between like from like high 80's fps to low 60's so there is still something the riot needs to figure out but thats the best way to cope with it for now.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-19T00:20:59.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad you were able to find something that works for the time being! V-sync isn't something that we usually suggest right off the bat since usually fps issues involve drivers as well, but definite props for trying to help out your fellow players ^_^","replies":[]}]}
