You're punished for _what you said_, not why you said it. If you broke the rules, you deserve the punishment, regardless of what any other player in the match said.\n\n> ...or even better. See that I was truly out of line, and realize my behavior needs to change.\n\nYou should be able to see that your behavior was out of line in reading your chat logs. What you're doing is trying to apply _your own_ standards to your punishment, and your standards do not align with Riot's. The rules do not change depending on other people's behavior.\n\n> **Context Matters when punishing people for \"Toxic Behaviour\"**\n\nContext does _not_ matter. It doesn't matter if other people were flaming you first, or if other people were worse - _whether or not you broke the rules_ is what matters.\n\nIf you want to discuss your punishment, copy and paste the chat logs you were provided in the reform card, and we can peer-review it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IVSakenz","date":"2020-02-11T23:58:50.006+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I am curious why there is such a large portion of people that actually believe this.. that breaking the rules is ok because someone else did something you do not like.\n\nIn what part of the world does this actually apply?","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2020-02-12T00:26:12.254+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because they feel shame for being punished, which is the point of a punishment.

It's not a \"I'm going to judge and punish 1 player in that game\" system, but instead, it's a system that punishes based on consistency x severity.  Meaning you can get punished for 1 game of extreme toxicity or many games of mild toxicity.  \n\nTo put it in order words, think of the system like a health bar (or tension meter) in music games. When you hit the note at an off beat,  your tension meter  increases. When you completely miss a note, the meter increases by alot. When you hit the note at good timings, it reduces the meter. \n\nRiot's behavior system works the same way, as in we all have a toxicity meter attached to our accounts. When players are mildly toxic, it goes up a tad. When people use hate speech, it pretty much fills up the meter. of course, clean games reduce the meter. \n\nIt is possible for playerA to get punished and playerB not to, even though playerB was waaayyyyy more toxic . Let's say playerA started the game with the toxicity meter at 95% and playerB's at 35%. Ingame, playerB said some pretty nasty shit and playerA responds with some minor shit as well. After the game, playerA gains 10% toxicity and playerB gains 50%. Now playerA is at 105% toxicity and gets punished, whereas playerB is at 85%, and not punished in that specific game, even though playerB was found to be 5x more toxic than playerA in that game. \n\nThe logs of other people don't matter because everyone has a different behavioral history. Every reported person will have the game reviewed independantly from others and the review score accumulated into their individual behavioral history.","replies":[{"poster":"RayleighTT","date":"2020-02-12T11:11:56.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"but in reality , you get punished for 3 games even if you swear...","replies":[{"poster":"Modi","date":"2020-02-12T13:42:09.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RayleighTT,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=N7VQ4ojf,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2020-02-12T11:11:56.702+0000)\n>\n> but in reality , you get punished for 3 games even if you swear...\n\nI sweetie in there games last night, when I fucked up I said \"fuck\" in chat.
