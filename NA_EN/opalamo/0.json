This is a prime reason as to why all disconnections are treated equally and why we cannot modify or remove penalties on your account for any reason.\n\nIf you can give me more details around how you're disconnecting or crashing from matches, we can work together to resolve this so penalties are less likely to be added to your account.","replies":[{"poster":"The Doctor Is In","date":"2016-12-19T23:49:43.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so riot based a whole system off of people getting mad when someone leaves. oh please people forget about the game like 2 games after they click report, cry in the baby box after the game then they go on to live their life as normal. anyone taking a game so seriously that they hold a grudge due to someone having an inconvenience in their life should probably not play games. If someone leaves and gets a leaver que i don't see why riot shouldn't be able to remove it given valid reason. Justice is blind unless you are from riot then justice is one sided.\n\nSeriously tho implement an appeal system for this type of stuff {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-10-25T00:08:00.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, good.
