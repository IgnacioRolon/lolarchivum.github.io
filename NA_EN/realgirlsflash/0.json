What the actual F#$@? What since does that make. Hard to have fun in a game that pushes you backwards.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-22T17:31:35.063+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I'm not seeing anything out of the ordinary.  It looks like there's been a series of losses, and your account went down to 0 LP.  The next loss demoted you down with 75 LP on the demoted division.  More info can be found on our[ ranked games guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ), but matchmaking determined a demotion in this case.  You're close to getting back into a series, though, good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"RealGirlsFlash","date":"2017-09-23T23:24:56.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WTF POROCLES! i MOST CERTAINLY DO NOT..... Nah I'm kidding. Thank you for actually responding to a complaint. I did not see 0lp on the last ranked game more than likely and will have to grind back. Thanks for the luck, but next time, just brush me off with some RP!!! {{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[]}]}]}
