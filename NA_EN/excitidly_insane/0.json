I start roaming and try my best to assist with my ult and general harass in skirmishes and try and pop back to lane to farm, but I just don&#039;t seem to be able to farm quickly. Especially after my first ult upgrade, it seems to take ages to get the second one and by that time we are either crushingly ahead or failing miserably.\n\nSo if any Pirates out there can give me a few tips to keep my farm up, it&#039;d be a great help.\n\nEDIT: What do y'all start? I seem to be ok with either of these 4:\n\n  Sapphire + 3 pots. What I usually do if unsure about lane, more Q's, more gold.\n  Cull + pot. Only if I know I will handle my lane well, such as vs Darius. Good for Bankplank, bad for mana.\n Boots + 4 pots; sometimes. Perhaps vs a Gnar or Jayce.\n Flask, which I haven't tried. I feel that Sapphire + 3 pots is just as good and makes it easier to get an early sheen.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-02-21T22:43:02.626+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't roam when I play him.  Just keep farming, ult lanes that need help. If your lane roams, make them over commit and follow with an ultimate and teleport.  I do make a note to get to objectives early and setup a few early barrels, though.  \n\nEven then, if the other team is going for dragon and your top laner goes down. Make it very clear to your team you're not coming and just go for the farm and the turret. Definitely a good trade if you're playing Gangplank.","replies":[{"poster":"charcharmunro","date":"2016-02-21T22:51:08.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Singed, Nasus, Tryndamere and Gangplank all kinda share that mentality of \"Look, I have a lane to farm.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Excitidly Insane","date":"2016-02-21T23:24:11.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a pimp stick fanatic so anything with Q is always fun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Excitidly Insane","date":"2016-02-21T23:19:14.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just did this in a game, got all 3 ults in around 35 minutes.\n\nThanks :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2016-02-21T23:26:28.666+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you get the first upgrade, you don't need to worry about the rest.

I could be wrong, I did pick it up once but it didn't seem to add that much as I get around 35% cdr from runes and other items anyway so a couple of milliseconds off Q didn't do much.\n\nThe mana regen was nice but with Q being your only mana expenditure come mid-late game it's unnecessary unless your lane is being sieged for about 5 minutes at which point the pool might run dry.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"l Helios l","date":"2016-02-22T15:07:53.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You function as a secondary ADC, and you're a split pushing god, so that's what you ought to be doing most of the time. If your team desparately needs you, then grouping isn't bad.\n\nOnce you hit your Tri-force + a bf, you should be able to use sheen empowered Q + E to kill the casters. Once you have Reaver, you should be able to kill the melee minions as well. \n\nSapphire is good if the lane won't be fought a lot and farming/poking for gold is your goal. Corrupting pot is good if you need the better sustain. It also functions as your solid defensive start. \n\nNever do cull. I just hate the item and you don't really want to put yourself at a risk that early for extra gold, which you already get.\n\nAlways do 0/12/18. Really solid, 10 gold + GOTU every time you Q an enemy laner.\n\nUlt upgrades are as follows: Increase fire rate one -> raise morale -> D's Daughter. DD is very inconsistent in terms of the damage it can provide. Raise morale's utility is amazing. The one that increases your fire rate of the ult offers the highest increase in damage so that's always number one.\n\nAs GP, if you fall behind you know you've done something wrong. You naturally get ahead just by being GP, so you don't need to feel stressed to get kills and such. Just hard farm whatever you can to get ahead as fast as possible, then evaluate what you need to be doing, teamfighting or split-pushing. That decision making applies for all champions tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"Excitidly Insane","date":"2016-02-22T22:47:06.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I do like to run Thunderlords, but I'll give that setup a try.\n\nFire at Will is always the first upgrade I go for.\n\nI do like the cull greed, but the mana man, no mana.
