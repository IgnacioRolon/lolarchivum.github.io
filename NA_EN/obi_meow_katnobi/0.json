This is a huge leap from my usual 30. Has anyone else ever had this problem before? Or am I just going insane here?","replies":[{"poster":"Craazyface","date":"2017-10-25T12:54:08.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are not alone. It's anything you watch on the Roosterteeth website. I figured it was just their video service that caused it because I can watch the same videos on Youtube with barely a change in my ping. Nice to know I am not alone on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Obi Meow Katnobi","date":"2017-10-25T13:36:55.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, glad I am not alone in this.

Using a VPN like haste can also cause you some delays as well, and in this case your routing might have changed to take a long time to reach your service.","replies":[{"poster":"Obi Meow Katnobi","date":"2017-10-27T21:08:30.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is there even without using Haste.\n\nI just assume the video player on the website just has issues with league.","replies":[]}]}]}
