Luckily, we’ve broken a few systems in our day, too. So we specifically built Honor so potential exploits like this give you (and your friend) literally no benefit.\"\r\n\r\nJust want to make sure. Does this mean that when playing with a 5 man team that Honor essentially becomes non-existent?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-30T02:50:43.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll still be able to get Honor and rank up by playing with 5-man premade teams, it will just happen at a slower pace. Part of that Honor FAQ also states:\n\n> If I vote for my teammates does that contribute to my Honor levels?\n> \n> Yes, but you’ll need a little help. A whole team gets a slight bonus to their honor level if every teammate votes. Just like the game, you win or lose as a team.\n\nTrust me, we're not trying to make you play solo in order to rank up Honor, we just don't want people to abuse the system to rank up quickly. You'll still be getting Honor 'exp' by having premades honor you, just slower than if random players honored you. The end goal is that you'll rank up at the same pace by playing with friends or rando's!","replies":[]}]}
