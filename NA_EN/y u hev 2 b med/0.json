The problem is duos will always do their own thing and break team continuity, I'm so tired of losing games because duos just start soft inting or something because they get mad and refuse to play the game properly. Just get rid of duo'ing in solo queue, it serves no purpose other than a crutch for bad players to think they are good. Duo are always kda players, and enemy duo is always smurfs.

Like if you want to play with friends there are already 4 other modes you could play with them and one \"competitive\" mode for them.

I think there'd be a lot less friction if there was a queue where all ten players were solo, a queue where each team had a duo and a trio, and a queue where each team had a full five. And of course that doesn't leave a way for exactly four friends to play LoL together without finding a fifth friend, but to that I would say that LoL is a 5v5 game.\n\nAnyway, it's too bad that reality has to get in the way. :&lt;","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GFREEMEN","date":"2020-02-26T20:42:02.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"100%\n\nIt also is the #1 reason for Boosting.
