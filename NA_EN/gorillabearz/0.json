I&rsquo;ve been playing League since season 3, and have been maining Aatrox since he was released (not on this account, permabanned lel). The VO is fantastic, people just don&rsquo;t like change. The abilities and overall kit look incredible. His model is a serious upgrade from his old one. All of the people complaining about the VO, abilities, model, etc. are just salty that change is coming. Don&rsquo;t give in, there is a huge majority who are not vocal about how happy they are with the work you&rsquo;ve done. Just release him as is with number tweaks that may need to take place, and people will fall in love with the champion. Thanks for the great job you&rsquo;ve done with Aatrox","replies":[]}
