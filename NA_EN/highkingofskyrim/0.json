I remember board discussions like &#039;Riot is so lazy they only release boring skins that have another color&#039; and now this is actually an announced feature?!? \r\nAre there really players paying money on this?\r\n\r\nAlso i don&#039;t really like the idea of playing versus oddly colored champs... Some of these Chroma &#039;skins&#039; look REALLY dumb. And compared to Heartseeker Varus or the Pink Taric they are not funny.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-29T16:34:25.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey lolipop10000, \n\nOne of the biggest goals with chroma packs was to create another option for players when it comes to cosmetic content. Some players simply want a different color for a skin they like (or the base), rather than all of the bells and whistles that something like a legendary skin would come with. \n\nI've seen quite a few chromas used in game, so I'd say there are definitely players who enjoy the content. \n\nWhen we decide on a new chroma pack, we do consider gameplay and clarity, which is why something like black Zac wouldn't be something we'd put into the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2015-06-29T16:53:54.768+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have more luck than me then^^\n\nFor the time the first chroma hit live, unlike new skin, I still never saw one of them in my game (was thinking yesterday than maybe the whole chroma stuff not linked to mastary was a brake for the player base)\n\nGlad for you you saw some, that prove your work wasn't in vain ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"HighKingOfSkyrim","date":"2015-07-02T07:59:45.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the answer... also i take back my complaint... i was in a bit of senseless (minor) rage about something that does not really matter.
