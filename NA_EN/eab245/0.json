[GAMEPLAY]","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Riot,\r\n\r\nI think Ive uncovered a bug within Lissandra&#039;s ult. i have the video to show but Im not quite sure how to post it here. basically upon entry of the ult which states once activated on Lissandra herself she becomes untargetable and invincible but she still dying in the middle of her ult. Now in my video i popped the ult before all the slowing effect spanned out so i thought maybe she has to fully be in the ult to be invincible? If im able to post the video id like you guys to decide. Please get back to me as soon as possible. Illl try and upload screenshots.\r\n\r\n1. I get cut off so in a ditch effort I ult to do as much dmg possible.\r\n2.  in the middle of me ulting i get snared by a maokai and damaged by a nid spear and a zed w (i believe)\r\n3. watching the cocoon take full form a jhin 4th shot hits me directly and I die. slowing effect animation has gone completely through at this point   \r\n\r\nP.S I have the video of the situation but it looks like I can only email via zip drive. Would that suffice? \r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nEab245","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-08-15T20:22:58.398+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A video of such a bug happening would be really useful, we've seen players mention that sort of behavior with Liss ult but I'm not aware of a demonstrated case that hasn't turned out to be a misclick on another nearby target. Expected behavior is that Liss is invulnerable/untargetable instantly, so if you're seeing the ult spread/the ult's on CD, it's cast on her and she dies during that period then that certainly sounds like a bug. \n\nA video uploaded to a website would be the way to go in terms of being able to share the clip.","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-08-15T20:32:43.339+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Meddler,\n\nAny QGT today ?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-08-16T21:26:37.617+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Late response - no, just one this week on Friday. Trying out getting the posts translated into some other languages, see if it's worth doing that regularly or not. That means writing them earlier though, rather than just before posting them, so the stuff I had that would have gone into the one from early this week's getting translated now instead. Should be back to twice a week next week.","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-08-16T22:31:12.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty for the reply","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Eab245","date":"2017-08-15T20:34:37.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"upon closer inspection you were correct i ulted the maokai. I still think the ult is bugged however the was in instance i ulted myself in river and i still died in ult but this was several games ago. If i capture it again I will post it here.\n\nThanks for the response","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-08-16T21:28:18.907+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update, would love to see it if you do capture a case that's a self ult with death during it.\n\nUseability's not perfect on the ult which does lead to the 'I though I ulted myself' cases cropping up. If you're not using self cast (Alt+R by default) that can help a help with avoiding miscasts. If you are having Self or Smart cast on can also be problematic with this spell, so would just use regular smart cast if so.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-08-16T21:42:31.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't tried it out, but could it be that Lissandra had a DoT on her? IIRC DoTs (cass' venom, Malzahar's E, Darius' passive) aren't suspended during untargettability (fizz E, alpha strike), and can kill you. Not sure if it's true for stasis and Liss' ult too, though\n\nThough it seems quite different than what TO describes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chr√Østmas Eve","date":"2017-08-16T21:29:42.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Meddler, please could you have a look at karma in more depth. I loved playing karma, but with a 44% win rate mid and 45% support she just gets shoved to the side from supports such as Janna and sona, who can do what she does way better. She was reworked due to low popularity and I have a feeling like this is happening again. Please could you just have another look at karma for her damage and shields, as her shield is quit forgotten now.","replies":[]}]}
