My ping stays at a constant around 63-65 most of the time, however every minute or so the game just freezes for maybe 2-3 seconds, after that the ping is around 220 and then falls back down to 65. My first thought was that there was something wrong with my internet but my roommate has been playing league with no issues whatsoever. I've already tried re-installing league and not really sure what to do from here, just wondered if anyone had a similar experience and were able to change it","replies":[{"poster":"Punography","date":"2016-09-24T19:56:31.696+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here, the game just freezes on me and inputs are delayed every minute or so ever since I updated the game yesterday.","replies":[{"poster":"Level 0 Magikarp","date":"2016-09-24T20:10:48.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Puno510,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=kvJMh2Rx,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2016-09-24T19:56:31.696+0000)\n>\n> Same here, the game just freezes on me and inputs are delayed every minute or so ever since I updated the game yesterday.\n\nI'm having the same problem with delayed inputs... it delays for 1-2 seconds once in a while and causes me to walk straight into enemies or let kills get away.
