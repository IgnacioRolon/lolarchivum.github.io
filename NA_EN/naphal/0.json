I also started a bit late this season, because during preseason I got bored of the game because if a game is not competitive or has no reason for me to be playing I get bored, and don't try, so I started playing CS:GO, and got back into league a little while after the new season started, I never lost my love for the game though I still watched streams and videos, I'm weird. I also only play ranked games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zelgoth0002","date":"2016-04-26T23:04:10.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You said you were only 70 games in this season?
