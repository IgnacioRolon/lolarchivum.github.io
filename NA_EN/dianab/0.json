When I came back I still had over 400 ms and after giving it a few minutes it didn't change.  So I had to restart my computer entirely to see if that would fix it.  It did not.  When our game ended I got a warning for leaving the game and had to type \"I Agree\" to never do it again.  I'm guessing if this happens to me again I would get a ban? Is there a way to appeal this warning since leaving the game was beyond my control?  It was either try to fix the problem, afk at shop, or feed.  I felt like the best thing I could do for my team was the first.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-09T01:16:59.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to try and talk to someone about the circumstances of that warning, you're more than welcome to shoot us a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and open that discussion up!
