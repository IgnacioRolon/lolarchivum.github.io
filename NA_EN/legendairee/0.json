This preseason has been so crazy toxic that I&#039;ve actually started resorting to submitting tickets to support because of multiple death threats, racism, hate speech, and just constant abuse. \r\n\r\nI  understand most people expect to win when you get to the top 10% of the game, but seriously, most of you these plat players need to chill out. I have a better understanding of the game than I believe most do at platinum in terms of map rotation, securing objevtives and overall play; especially since I am a jungler, the most macro level position. When I try to give pointers or teach others, its often met with backlash and toxicity. No ones perfect, but jeez, take a chill pill. Our society is so coddled that no one can take constructive criticism anymore, otherwise, I&#039;m some how personally attacking you. Maybe this is why NA is looked down upon so much, absolute toxicity and trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-11-19T21:11:25.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Two things:\n\n* If you get downvoted, ignore it. It's probably just the asshats you're addressing, and (given that they're asshats) their opinion in most matters is 1) garbage and 2) irrelevant.\n* On that note, you're addressing asshats. Stahp it. The people you're referring to are on the extreme end of the spectrum when it comes to toxicity. You're trying to advise people who only through years of practice can get to their current level of stupidity when communicating with others. You're not going to change their behavior. Consider how they think. Do complete jackasses listen to reason? No. ARE these people complete jackasses who spam death threats over bad games? Clearly. You're trying to advise people who don't take advice. Find something better to do with your time and let the ban system sort this crap out.","replies":[{"poster":"MilfHuntUnitXJ9","date":"2015-11-19T21:13:13.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"says the one with the extremely unfunny name.
