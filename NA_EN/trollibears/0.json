Up to the login screen is fine but once I get into the pregame screen everything starts to lag and the response becomes really slow. It takes around 2 seconds for the game to respond to my actions. It also makes my whole computer process slow. My taskbar also keep flickering. I tried turning of the Xbox record option in settings and it still doesn't work. Can someone help me ?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T18:30:28.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's hard to say if you're experiencing fps issues or lag spikes based on the description provided here.
