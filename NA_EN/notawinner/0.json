I&#039;m looking at some pros to get tips and tricks (As she is one of the only mids I can decently play) And it seems like all of them focus almost solely on her assassin-like side\r\n\r\nAlso, I&#039;m not talking about LCS and stuff play, I just mean Diamond above kinda stuff. Granted she doesn&#039;t have the aoe cc of say, Syndra or Talyia but she seems like a much safer pick then most of them, all while being to output similar damage as safe ranges.\r\n\r\nIs there just an issue i&#039;m not seeing with her that prevents this, or? If you have any opinions about the matter, please comment","replies":[]}
