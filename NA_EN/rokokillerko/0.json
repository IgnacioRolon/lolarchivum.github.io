This can happen if your drivers, game files, or even hardware is acting up.  I don't recommend queuing up to games for now until this is fixed up.  In the meantime, run through the steps in our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to troubleshoot and test it out in a custom game to make sure everything is squared away.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"RokoKillerKo","date":"2017-12-15T17:37:03.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And The Ban Can You Unban Me I Didnt do any thing to get ban","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-15T17:41:17.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, getting a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) as a result sucks but we aren't able to remove it.  :(  Even though it wasn't intentional, the system treats all leaves equally because it still causes other players a negative experience too.  Your best bet is to resolve the crashing issue and play to complete the required games.","replies":[{"poster":"RokoKillerKo","date":"2017-12-15T17:53:30.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok Thanks","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
