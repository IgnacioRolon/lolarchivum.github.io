I know we all change sometime, and I know you will still be around, but I will miss who you were. You gave me clarity in times of panic. You were so fast. You found a way, always, to get me where I needed to go. \r\n\r\nYou, with the perfect fencer muscles accentuated by a dyed streak of rebellion, were gorgeously made. \r\n\r\nThey said you were broken, but I embraced that. I took what was broken and made it whole, as you did for me. When things looked grim, I picked you. And you carried me further than I have ever gone before. \r\n\r\nLike that first time, when the head mistress outfit was on sale for Halloween, the very same outfit that we ended with. \r\n\r\nYou may have had your quirks, but I loved your strong arrogance. It showed that whenever you got low, you picked yourself right back up again. Anything coming your way, you would brush off and send right back. \r\n\r\nYou were my flower. My friend. My favorite.\r\n\r\nAn artist with style, with words, with pretty pictures. So in control. So talented. So disciplined. I will never find another like you. \r\nI felt as one with you. Both with sharp blades. Both with sharp minds. \r\n\r\nBut it went beyond that. Few people knew the fun we would share. Remember the Princess Bride? Remember stealing those precious dragons? \r\nTogether, our accomplishments were incredible, winning silver, fighting off our fears with but a sash. \r\n\r\nWe devoured our demons. We emerged from the jungle together to put our tragedies behind us and only victory ahead. Even faced with terrible odds, you were my sword that would see us through. \r\n\r\nAnd on our last day together, we reached that pinnacle moment that everyone in such a relationship seeks, one that comes rarely when playing out of your league. I will never forget you and the fun we shared.\r\n\r\nI know that you will find a greater potential in the hands of another, and I wish you well. Perhaps one day we will press the play button again. \r\nTo my first true main, Fiora Laurent, the Grand Duelist, thank you for being my worthy opponent.","replies":[{"poster":"True Lizard","date":"2015-08-06T07:54:35.534+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3070}} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmErRm-vApI {{item:3070}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Autolocked","date":"2015-08-07T02:10:28.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSz16ngdsG0e\n{{item:3070}} {{champion:114}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"xNitori","date":"2015-08-07T01:59:12.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Goodbye, old Fiora... your old ult will be sorely missed. {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shocky","date":"2015-08-06T14:33:24.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I took what was broken and made it whole\", haha!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drac28","date":"2015-08-06T09:01:41.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:121}}  Consume... and adapt.. {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-08-06T08:43:02.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:121}} \n\n#Change... is good.","replies":[]}]}
