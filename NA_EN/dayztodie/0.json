Every-time I re-patch uninstall and reinstall only after the re-patch can I play the game. But the moment I close the game when I go to play league it only pulls up the \"Launch\" screen. I click \"Launch\" and nothing happens. I have restarted my computer like I said before uninstalled and reinstalled and re-patched but nothing seems to keep the process running smoothly would love some help!\r\n\r\n{{champion:412}} {{champion:164}} ~ Dayz","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-16T16:56:53.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you used the hextech repair tool, were you previously using the hextech repair tool?  The tool may currently only work with the legacy client, so in this case a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends)may be necessary.  \n\nAlso, if your launch button is not working then you could also have a security issue blocking the client from launching.  I suggest using the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide as well just to make sure your settings are allowing access.
