It is just that Dorans Ring is still a good starting item for her, that some AP from Glyphs and Natural Talent are still beneficial for her and that Gunblade is the best lifesteal item for her imo. Because her E has a high base damage, this spell gives her save waveclear even without much AP. Because of that I can understand to nerf the base damage. But I would like to be able to get the save waveclear back, if I sacrifice some AD for it, and I think AD builds are the thing you really want to nerf.\n\nSafe waveclear is the only thing AP MF has compared to AD MF. Without that AP MF would be nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"BoundaryBreaker","date":"2016-01-10T03:27:54.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't quite think it's 1200% XD.

MFs ult has a 1200% AD ratio at Level 3. 75% AD ratio per wave, 16 waves. It has a 360% AP ratio too, but 1200% AD is better. \n\nAnd the scaling can be increased with critical strikes: If you have 100% crit and IE, it has actually an AD ratio of 1560% AD (and 468% AP)","replies":[{"poster":"BoundaryBreaker","date":"2016-01-10T04:44:28.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, didn't think of the multiple waves factor. So essentially she has the -potential- for that kind of thing. \nBut in essence the ratio is still 75% just with MANY occasions of damage, each with crit potential. \nAll this put together makes it seem as though the scaling is 1200%(+) (I don't put crit and AD in the same scaling here personally, they're separate, if very closely related stats). Each of these instances of damage are separately occurring though, so each one is individually affected by mitigation factors (armor, flat damage reduction, {{item:3143}} , armor pen, etc.) This makes it almost a necessity to hit most, if not all, of the waves to truly do massive damage (unless you get full build, then almost anything is boned XD).  If someone is smart they'll do whatever they can to avoid as many occasions of damage from the ult as possible. Admittedly this is made next to impossible by the team comp she is intended to be played in as-per rework direction/intention.\n\nThat's just my way of looking at it though. I can see and understand how and why you would see it the way you do, most certainly. And it is fairly obvious that AP MF is far weaker than AD just by numbers alone (Although {{item:3151}}, {{item:3285}}, and{{item:3116}} seem like they'd deal some pretty stupid DoT if used well, in addition to TLD), your initial pointwith this is still very, very much valid.

And it is fairly obvious that AP MF is far weaker than AD just by numbers alone \n\nAP has one advantage especially in mid lane or in modes like ARAM. It is difficult for Adcs to farm against Mages. If they walk in AA range of a minion, the Mage can hit them easily with long range abilitys. But AP MF has one of the best ranged waveclear abilitys in the game. She can just kill the minions faster than the opponent, so the opponent has to concentrate on farm, while MF can poke him. AP MF is a really strong lane bully.\n\nWhat did change in the preseason?\n\nIn Season 5 MFs Ult had only an AP scaling of 180% and a low AD scaling, that did magic damage. But the physical base damage was higher. If you wanted a strong ult, AP and Armor penetration were the best stats. AP was ofc the best stat for her E. Her Q was perfect for Sheen, because of the 1.7 s CD with 40% CDR.\n\nMy favorite build was:\n- Dorans Ring\n- Nashors Tooth/Morellonomicon\n- CDR-boots\n- Liandries Torment\n- Trinity Force\n- Last Whisper\n- Gunblade/Botrk/Bloodthirster\n\nIn the preseason some things changed:\n\nHer E range was increased by 200 and Her ult AP ratio was doubled to 360%. On the other hand her ult base damage was lowered and her base AD was gutted. Therefore she got her love tap passive, which scales really well with AD. And her ult was given a crazy 1200% AD ratio.\n\nIt was not a big change for AP MF, but AD MF was just buffed into the sky. At the same time AD itemization for CDR was buffed too. The only nerf was the base AD nerf, which gutted her synergy with Triforce too.\n\nNow my favourite build was:\n- Dorans Ring\n- Essence Reaver\n- Swiftness boots\n- Infinity Edge\n- Triforce/Lich bane\n- Gunblade\n- Defensive Item\n\nSome early AP from runes, masteries and Dorans is still the best for dominating the mid lane, but AD is just more worth afterwards.\n\nIf the E base damage is nerfed, but an AP ratio compensation is given, there could even be a better reason again to buy some more AP.\n\nBut without a compensation I think AP MF is just getting pointless, what would be sad because she was great hybrid champion. Actually a champion where a hybrid build was better than pure AP and pure AD.\n\n> (Although {{item:3151}}, {{item:3285}}, and{{item:3116}} seem like they'd deal some pretty stupid DoT if used well, in addition to TLD)\n\nE slows anyway so Rylais is not really needed.","replies":[{"poster":"BoundaryBreaker","date":"2016-01-10T05:40:59.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, all points make sense.

Straight up, AP Miss Fortune players who are so set on being \"different\" and \"unique\" are literally the worst. Plus AP MF isn't even fun. They're worse than the people who play cheesy shit like AD Malzahar or Devourer Ekko (especially in ranked) and you can bet that they'll downvote this comment too because they can't stand to see an opinion that's in opposition to their own skewed perspectives.
