Queue times aren't that long, and every once in a while, I switch to it as well, just like every other gametype. You're describing your opinion, not the trends.\n\nSO WHAT if people wouldn't spam OfA as much if it stuck around? They don't spam regular 5s as much as they spam OfA. Heck, the reason they spam special game-modes so much is not because \"it's SO FREAKIN' GOOD but would only be so for a short time\" but because, \"it's gonna be gone soon, gotta get in as much as possible now.\"\n\nI don't need 5 second queue times to enjoy OfA, and I don't need an incentive to play it nonstop to enjoy it every few days on a regular basis. And if every few days isn't good enough, then by that logic, none of the other queues are good enough either. Heck, why are we even playing League then? I don't know!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shonjl","date":"2015-10-24T03:42:05.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True but at the same time, there is other mobas that keep specials like these as customs, why can't Riot, being one of the most profitable gaming companies can't afford to just throw all the game modes into customs?
