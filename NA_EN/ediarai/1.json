I&#039;m really questioning the fairness of this and would like some clarification as to whether this will be allowed or not. If many teams do this, then the ban phase is pretty much screwed over save for champs that are just outright broken. People get their mains in their actual roles, and it goes from tournament draft with 5 bans each to PBE draft.","replies":[{"poster":"Xaafira","date":"2018-04-13T19:57:02.698+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, your opponents won't see the roles you select.
