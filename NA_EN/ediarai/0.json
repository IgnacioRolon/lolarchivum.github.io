So recently, my game has been crashing and lagging out at random times, but when it does, it would repeat for several games before finally getting better.\r\n\r\nCase 1: I head into a game, and instead of going to loading screen, it says that the connection failed and tells me to retry, but then the entire LoL client is disconnected, and I can't even log back in. Keep note that EVERYTHING ELSE is working perfectly fine, from battle.net to youtube.\r\n\r\nCase 2: I head into a game, and instead of going to loading screen, I get a bugsplat that takes 25+ minutes to fix. I attempted to relog at first, but it was still in the bugsplat first and I had to wait it out, never making it back to my game in time.\r\n\r\nCase 3: I'm in a game, but everything freezes and I'm reconnecting. Keep in mind that while this is happening, I'M STILL AT MY NORMAL PING, which is 30-50. After I finally reconnect after about 5-10 minutes, since I tried and failed to reconnect 2-3 times before finally getting back into the game. This situation in particular always repeats for 2-3 games afterwards.\r\n\r\nThese three cases are the only ones that I've experienced so far, but they are reoccurring, and never stop for good. Because of these situations, I was placed in lower priority queue for games, being forced to wait 20 minutes before each game, for something that WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT. This has been extremely frustrating and I hope that Riot comes up with a fix soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-09T19:10:32.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you've got a series of issues that's piling on top of each other, so when one thing works fine the other isn't.  Your PC is definitely having some issues which is frustrating for sure, and I'd like to help!  To start, these bugsplats can happen as a result of bad game files or drivers failing to load the game properly.  Go through our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to get that fixed up.\n\nThe disconnections could either be an unstable connection or hardware problem that's having trouble communicating with the game server.  You'll want to run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot that.\n\nGetting the [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) penalty is not something we can remove, because even if it's unintentional they still cause other players a negative experience too.  Try out those guides and test it out in a custom game.  It's really important to get all this fixed to prevent anymore penalties.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Ediarai","date":"2017-02-09T19:35:51.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not exactly ongoing, as in it's not happening currently. It's really sporadic, and the last time it happened was a few days ago. I don't really know how I should be going about solving this problem because I won't know if I have fixed the problem completely, since it is possible that while playing custom games, it just doesn't happen. After this, when I think it's fine, it could happen again. Do you have any advice?\n\nI completely understand that the leaverbuser penalty is pretty fair in the sense that my connection problems ruined other players' games. It's just really frustrating for me.","replies":[{"poster":"randomeplayer123","date":"2017-05-12T15:54:57.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I keep having the game crash and go back to a previous patch super annoying.
