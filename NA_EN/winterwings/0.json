Way too often I've had to avoid fights because while I wouldn't personally lose the the trade, my ADC would. \n\nStoneborn on the other hand means you have to be smarter about your own health, but can turn around trades where your ADC would have normally lost.\n\nFor example, I won a Leona/Ezreal vs Draven/Thresh because the constant CC made it possible for Ez to constantly sustain throughout the fight. Sure I took a bit more damage than I would have usually, but nothing game-changing as I wasn't focused (and shouldn't be), whereas I've seen many fights where my ADC's survival was solely due to Stoneborn.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Winterwings","date":"2017-03-08T14:27:37.202+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't work on yourself, the tooltip for it explicitly states \n\"Your crowd control effects brand enemy champions with a earthen rune for 4 seconds.\n**_OTHER_** ally champions who attack branded enemies heal for 5 + 2.5% of your maximum health over 2 seconds (halved if you are ranged).\"\n\nSo no, you yourself don't gain any benefits from attacking a branded enemy (Otherwise this would just end up being a support's Grasp of the Undying) but your other allies do heal off of it... \n\nAbout the \"halved if you are ranged part\"... would be nice to know which part of it is halved exactly... \nMy guess it's the \"5 + 2.5 % of your maximum health\" that is halved for ranged champions, since it doesn't seem like the duration of the heal over time on allies is shorter for ranged users that apply this effect.","replies":[{"poster":"madcosmonaut","date":"2017-03-08T23:55:45.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah we can read too, the question was if the \"+increased healing and shielding\" from above listed items increase the healing part of the keystone. also its the healing numbers that are halved not the duration (duration wouldn't make any sense).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2017-03-08T14:29:48.805+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I haven't tested it, but I assume that the healing doesn't get increased by those items.
