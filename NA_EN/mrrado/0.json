I think I'd like playing with that.\"  So a lot of people did and it was fine and cool and fun.  Project Yasuo wasn't even on sale for a full week either if I'm recalling correctly - more like 3 or 4 days.  Not a ton of time.\n\nBut let's also dial this all back even longer - to the original \"card borders\", when the owners of legacy skins who got them when they first came out would get exclusive borders.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/pDTn7uY.jpg\n\nSee Sona's border? That wasn't announced on release, that wasn't a plan, that was an afterthought.  A \"Hey, you've had this skin since before we retired it, we don't mind showing your early patronage\" deal.  And that was pretty dang cool.  Nobody afterward felt slighted because they weren't the originals - they didn't get the skin right when it came out, and that was on them. It was just a cool thing.  And I'll be that before those skins were retired, they went on sale once or twice in their lifetime - anybody coulda gotten them then at a reduced price and _still_ gotten the border.\n\nSo jump to now with the project skins - Yasuo came out first, cool skin, wanted it, got it.  Whether it was full or reduced price isn't too important, honestly - it's early patronage. It's an early, \"Before this became a thing I was in it for the shiggles.\"  While you're giving chance for bot new and old players to grab some exclusive content - woooooooooo - the fact is you're shafting the old players with this choice.  You've given nothing back to the old owners who grabbed the skin before there was ever an event.\n\nLike, look at Project Yasuo's splash art - compared to these new skins, it looks dated already.  In fact, look in game at their animations - his **in-game** even looks lesser comparatively.  And don't even get me started on the graphical issues that he still has (hello sheathe facing the wrong way, hello sword sticking out of sheathe at an awkward angle, hello sword being **gone** sometimes on a Q).  And now there's not even anything to go along with his skin to pretty it up a bit?  The fact is: the skin just looks like it's worth far less now with those new skins to compare it to.  But no, it's the same price.  It's stayed the same price.  People have payed 1350 for it, and some are probably going, \"Well, while it looks nice, I do also play those other champs and they look way, way, way better.\" And now you've added additional \"collector's\" value to these new ones - you're just piling on how shafted people were getting the original Project skin.  And it's not unfair to new buyers just because some people only payed 975 for the skin and got a border - they did it way, way, way back.  They were smart or lucky - choose one.  Neither of those are a punishment to those who'd have to pay full price for the skin - it's a reward to older players for having made the decision.  The borders before weren't a punishment to new players for never getting the skin before they were retired - it was a reward for owning them back then.  It was a reward saying, \"Hey, we've been releasing some better skins lately, but you stuck with us during the period where they were a little less lustrous - here's a little thank you for that.\"  And what's wrong with that?\n\nYou don't have to give Project Yasuo a First Strike border, but you really absolutely should give us _some_thing for having owned him since before this - otherwise not only is the skin just uglier, but it's considerably less worth the cost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GhostOfShrimpmas","date":"2015-08-28T22:48:38.375+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sorry, what?

It'd be unfair that Yasuo players get a loading screen for 975 RP, when loading screens for the new PROJECT skins can only be obtained by paying full price.*\n\nWe realize that it's not something that everyone agrees with, and that is certainly one of the takeaways from this. \n\n> As for Vi King Vi the reason I stated he has only led to toxicity is the fact that he should be reading the comments and considering the viewpoints of the other people in this thread. \n\nI think some people are firmly grounded in some areas, and that's fine. I don't think his comments were malicious, or attacked anyone. Regardless of his stance, there was a lot of good conversation around PROJECT: Yasuo not having a loading screen border. \n\nAs always, thanks for taking the time to leave feedback on the boards and discuss these kinds of topics/issues with us. :]","replies":[{"poster":"ODedonlife","date":"2015-09-09T00:42:47.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the feedback and just as a final note I would like to bring up Aamano's & LooksLikeYoda suggestion since I found it a very plausible solution to the entire issue of the initial sales price.\n\nAamano-\n> my idea was that, a kind of store option like Chroma packs could be available during First Strike week\n> \n> playing 375 RP for the playercard symbol on the Yasuo skin\n> --it wouldnt be necessarily fair for people who paid the full price for it, but as mentioned above the cost would be for collector's value\n\nLooksLikeYoda-\n> Like a 375 RP border in the shop for like a week together with the other project skins will be nice.

He is the first project skin and the people who bought him when he first came out, would get nothing.\n\nIf it was possible, I would suggest giving a special boarder for those who bought PROJECT: Yasuo within the first week of his release. Not for those who are just now buying the skin. It's a limited edition deal for a reason .\n\nThey did this because there is a ton of them and they are all really expensive, so they have created an incentive for people to want to buy them full price instead of wait for them to be on sale or not buy them at all. \nHence why Project minions are something you can get, and the special loading in animation. \n\nMost people aren't going to be interested in buying them unless they come in a bundle that's just a bit cheaper then full price. As the comments below wrote in the link you posted.\n\nPeople willing or able to buy them full price, right at release, deserve something extra and limited. This wasn't an option for people who bought PROJECT: Yasuo to start and I don't feel like they should just make an exception for new players buying an older skin.\n\nEDIT: I just made a comment, including the point that Yasuo's skin was released at the discount price. So it really isn't fair to just give those who got the skin for cheaper, a boarder that is meant to be a prize for buying the skins at full price.
