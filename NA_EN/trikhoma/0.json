As your first step I recommend disabling the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which was auto-enabled with the update and causing some of these problems.  If the issue persists, give our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) a go to make sure your drivers and hardware are tuned up to game.  Hopefully that will solve your specific issue!","replies":[{"poster":"Trikhoma","date":"2016-10-07T06:26:22.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you Porocles for your prompt response. That method worked for me as far as unlocking it from 60, it hit 200 fps but is unstable, shooting around from 100-200 fps.. Game play and experience is worlds better though from 60fps.  If you have any suggestions to get the fps stabilized I would appreciate it!\n\nThanks again!\n\nTrikhoma","replies":[]}]}]}
