We are talking about a player who played for at least 3 seasons and managed to get to gold, so he obviously knows the basics.\n\nI'm not saying \"I'm not wrong because I'm right\", I'm stating facts here based on a simple game knowledge. I've been playing since 2011, so I hope I know what I am talking about. I don't see any proof from anyone who would prove me wrong. How is it possible to die almost every minute and do it \"by accident\" or due to \"bad day\"??? Seriously, please, give me the answer to that question. Unless OP has serious mental issues (which I doubt as he can construct sentences and obviously managed to register to play), it's just not possible. There's nothing that would hint he was actually trying to prevent dying. On the contrary, there's plenty of proof he was just dying over, and over, and over.

How would that work? Because when I would show you an example, you'd just assume it's intentional again. To everything I could possibly present you, you can just go \"nu-uh, that's not true!\".\n\nAnd that's exactly the way you are arguing right now. Your entire point hinges upon it being impossible to play this badly without it being intentional, and you are just repeating that point over and over again. But repeating the same thing over and over again doesn't make it a fact.\n\nOr the short version: Just because you don't believe something doesn't make it less plausible.\n\nAlso regarding this:\n>Also, what \"less information\" are you talking about?\n\nChat. Previous game performances. Statistical analysis of previous game performances based on various different variables. The full replay. Pretty much most of the things that are important to beyond reasonable doubt prove that the feeding was intentional.\nI mean, you are saying that there's nothing that would hint that he was actually trying to prevent dying, but the only parts of the replay you have are the parts where he does die.

By accident?\n\nCan you tell me, how do you behave when you get 0/5 for instance? Can you try to describe here?

No. But I would say that you were consistently making a really bad decision to challenge a player who is 3 and 4 levels ahead of you in a 1v1. That is pretty much suicide, so the argument could be made. \n\nIn this situation, there are three things that you can do. \n\n* Have your teammates help you kill the opponent by ganging up on them.\n* Group with your teammates and apply pressure elsewhere. \n* Stall the game so their level and gold lead is less substantial. \n \nWhat I find most interesting is that the latter portion of your video is completely devoid of your teammates. Sure, your jungler was not helping in the beginning, but nobody else seems interested in helping you deal with this Lee Sin. That tells me that most likely they elected to not go with my first option, and were probably looking for the second option. \n\nYou also didn't include the mini map in your video so I can't even tell what the situation of the macro game looked like. I would imagine that there was probably something you should have been doing with your team in order to salvage the game. \n\nEven if your plan was to stall, you can't really do so by dueling. Again, he is much stronger than you, and while you did a decent job of out playing him *at times*, he was ultimately too strong for you to fight. Aside from that, trying to stall as Yasuo against Lee Sin is already a poor decision. \n\n*** \n\nI personally would not have reported you for this, but once again, I am sure that there is more to the story for this game, as well as probably some other games that we are not able to see here.","replies":[{"poster":"mvmlego","date":"2017-01-18T14:37:58.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with your post 100%.
