I played her on the PBE and the new passive along with her W buffs add for some really interesting positioning in teamfights. During landing phase, if you sit in the brush, your passive lets your ADC be much more slippery. Great for ganks too. Positioning is now much more important than before.","replies":[{"poster":"Zmuecat","date":"2015-02-25T03:19:46.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say it's a nerf.

Support Janna rarely ever uses her W and rushes mobility boots anyway, so she will be largely impacted by this change. It is /definitely/ a nerf, especially to Janna at level 1-3. She effectively won't be able to get /any/ movement speed bonus until she gets a point in W, which is not normally something Janna maxes or gets first. It's also a nerf for whenever Janna shoots W, as all her bonus speed has been shoved into her W passive (she's losing a massive amount of speed if she ever decides to slow you).\n\nThis is probably not the correct change if Riot wants to nerf Janna - a better change would be a nerf to her shield ratios (either the AD or the shield itself) or to increase the CD on her E. I don't know why Riot has been nerfing W and Q over and over. They must really not like AP Janna.","replies":[{"poster":"Sailor Mint","date":"2015-02-24T23:05:10.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No more movement speed to allies in chase scenarios.

If Janna catches you, she's going to Q you and the rest of the team will be able to pick you off anyway. I don't really think we'll notice a big difference in Janna and her team's chance potential.","replies":[{"poster":"AnomalousChimera","date":"2015-02-25T02:30:27.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Janna shouldn't be leading the charge unless your opponents are really bad.

You're not allowed to engage until her Q is on CD. But you're still guaranteed to die if her jungler shows up because you can't outrun them, simply because Janna is standing around. That case alone seems enough to justify the nerf.","replies":[]}]}
