If I'm being verbally assaulted, why can't I retaliate? Jesus fucking christ with the censorship riot. Some idiot flames me hard as hell for no reason, STARTS INTING MY RANKED GAME, ending up 1/8, and I go on to hard carry the game and take us to a win, you're going to take away my ranked rewards because I typed 6 or 7 lines saying \"fuck you asshole, you're an idiotic child\"?????\r\n\r\nIt aggravates me so much to think that I could eventually get banned for defending myself like this, losing all of the money (about $250) that I've given you because of this bullshit.\r\n\r\nThis coming on the heels of \"eternals\" lmao.

That doesn’t mean I’m contradicting myself by choosing to retaliate instead of muting. The report button should be for things that are actually not okay, like racial slurs. Of course it’s all subjective, I’m just voicing a disagreement with the way riot has chosen to handle this subjective issue.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-08-16T01:01:28.132+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The report thing is for *any* behavior that violates the rules.\n\nMuting is furthermore as you say a good way for *one player* to get out of communicating with jerks.

That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it. If this misbehavior happened in chat (including emotes or ping) and they don't respond positively to a _single, courteous, constructive request to focus on the game_, your best option is to mute that player. Submit a report after the match. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by asking them to keep it down and then notifying library staff and moving to another area.\n\n_Do not respond with misbehavior of your own!_ If you do that, your teammates may mute and report _you_, and those reports would be valid. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it. I'm sure you're familiar with the \"s/he started it\" trope, where two children get into an argument or fight and then try to claim innocence of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didn't instigate it. As any parent, teacher, or other supervisor of children will tell you, that excuse doesn't fly. When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem. Making faces at him or shouting at him has never been a good way to get him to stop, and it makes you just as guilty of that as he.\n\nRiot doesn't care who started it. Someone else's misbehavior does not justify your own.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> * Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n> * Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nYour opinion of the rules is of zero relevance. When a cop stops you for going 40 in a 25 zone, you can claim \"I think the limit should be 45 here\" all you want. You're still getting a ticket. If a librarian asks you to keep your voice down while you use the facilities, shouting that libraries should be loud will simply get you escorted out. If you go to a friend's house who insists that you remove your shoes while you're in their home, \"that's a stupid rule and I do what I want\" will lose you a friend. If you are using someone else's services, facilities, equipment, etc., you abide by their rules or you deal with the consequences. If you think the rules should change, that is a completely different conversation (and I wouldn't give a plugged nickel for your chances at convincing Riot to change their rules to allow behavior like yours).\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024051193-Understanding-Different-Ban-Types-FAQs):\n\n> We work with the overall community and within our own company guidelines to identify what disruptive behavior is and what the consequences for those behaviors should be. We understand that it can be difficult to know where the line is, which is why we provide chat logs and we have a few tiers in the ban process in order to allow for you to learn and grow.\n\nYou are certainly allowed to defend yourself from toxic chat, which is accomplished by muting. This is a 100% effective method. Flaming back is a 0% effective method that also constitutes unacceptable behavior and thus opens you up to reports and punishments. Read about this in more detail [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/Pqc6PJUE-players-who-flame-back-in-self-defense-dont-understand-the-meaning-of-those-words).\n\nYou have a right to free speech, guaranteed by the government. However, so does everyone else. This right only protects you from the governnment, which is restricted from passing laws that infringe on your right to free speech, assembly, and so on. It doesn't force other private entities, such as Riot Games, to provide you with a platform and compel everyone to listen to you. We all have the right not only to speak freely, but also to not listen if we so choose. When Riot restricts your chat privileges (not a right - a privilege), they are choosing not to listen to what you have to say, and choosing not to transmit it to other players. If a theater employee asks you to quiet down during a movie, or a friend tells you not to swear at their house, or a newspaper rejects your submission, they are not infringing on your right to free speech. They are exercising their own.\n\nDid you find something in Riot's store [allowing you to break the ToS](https://i.imgur.com/AvDSnZF.png)? No, because such a service is not offered. Regardless of how much money you spend, you are required to follow the same rules as everyone else. If the IFS determines that you've been validly reported in violation of those rules, you'll be punished according to those rules. If you wanted to avoid a punishment, you should've followed the rules.","replies":[{"poster":"Bubble Troublè","date":"2019-08-16T04:26:02.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Thanks for the dissertation buddy!\n\nI do in fact already understand all of those concepts and don't need them explained to me!\n\nI'm getting the notion (from about 7 different things you said) that you think I'm asking for my punishment to be revoked, when that is not at all what I'm doing.\n\nI'm not sure if you're aware -- It is possible to discuss whether or not a law should be a law. \"I didn't break the law\" is just not what I said at all, but that's certainly what you wrote a 6 paragraph essay in response to (although you probably just ctrl+v'd it)\n\nYou made a few fine points though about dad threatening to turn the car around because I'm retaliating to my brother's weird faces or whatever.
