She can miss every Q and still kite me because of phase rush and R threat, if you dodge her R (Looking back) it still slows a significant amount allowing her to kite easily, Miasma is basically undodgeable and they removed the range limitation last patch which was the only saving grace for melee champions. \r\n\r\nThe WORST PART OF ALL OF THIS is that she MASSIVELY OUTSCALES despite being a potent lane bully, her passive allows for her unique ability to take 6 non boots items which is even worse than most outscaling champions.

I dont mind starting defensive items but starting spectres cowl on a bruiser is an insta ff\n\n\n1. Darius is very specifically designed so that he still has a way to do damage no matter what he builds early. This is why Noxian Might exists. If you run damage, you wont consistently live long enough to proc it, but it gives Darius the fallback patter of building tanky and focusing on getting full bleed for the massive steroid. This is also why Darius' Q scales with total AD; the damage will keep scaling no matter what you build because every champion gains AD per level. Mind you, Darius' AD per level is also really fucking high.\n2. Darius has the highest lvl 1 base health regen in the game along with the 6th highest per level (.95, while the 5 highest champions are tied for 2nd because they have .05 more than him), so he usually gets more regen from cowl than any other champion save for Vi, making it EXTREMELY strong on him against any AP DPS. If you rush this item and combine it with Second Wind and Doran's Shield, it is incredibly hard to harass a smart Darius out of lane. The fact that Cass will be constantly spamming Twin Fang means that Darius will perpetually be having massive health regen with this setup. Combine that with smart usage of Q and it shouldn't be completely impossible for your health bar to outlast her mana bar if she is committed to trying to poke you.\n3. You can buy armor for the ADC later, why would you need to tank the ADC during the laning phase when they spend it on the literal opposite side of the map? Even then, Spectre's Cowl gives the same amount of Health as Trinity Force, so TF wont make you last longer against ADs than cowl.\n4. Mana is a useful, but not an absolutely critical stat for Darius. His mana costs are kinda low unless you spam. Just be smarter about resource management for the first 1200 gold or take biscuits\n5. Darius flat out does not need CDR. Aside from his E, his cooldowns are fairly low If you're regularly taking advantage of CDR on him, it's no wonder you're running out of mana.\n6. Attack speed is also a good but not absolutely vital stat.\n7. One of the key advantages of juggernauts is the amount of build flexibility they have. They will never be truly squishy, and never truly do zero damage no matter what you build early. If you are rushing damage on them every game, you're doing it wrong. Darius is the closest thing to an exception to that rule because he is the only Juggernaut with Zero defensive steroid as he relies on healing from his Q to emulate it. That makes it even more important that you buy tanky items when the situation calls for it.\n\nOn the note of the last point; for almost every bruiser in the game you should usually start going tanky if you're in a losing matchup or are getting beat in lane. Staying committed to damage will just make you feed harder. Complaining about having to rush a tank item on a bruiser is just indicative of a shitty attitude. Especially when bruiser players get the luxury of having more build flexibility than any other champion in the game. The fact that you even have the option of using every other classes items and are complaining about it ought to be something tank and assassin mains shit on.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SweedishGunner","date":"2019-09-09T10:31:46.556+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly she's a pain in the ass to deal with mid lane too.

If a Cassiopeia just spams her Twin Fangs without poison debuff applied first, she will literally tickle you - seriously, the damage of it is on par with her auto attack - whilst simultaneously chugging through her mana. She can kite very effectively, but that is literally only due to the fact that she gains ms when she lands her Q, so um if she misses every single one, then there is no way you can't catch up to her...At all. Phase Rush is not sufficient to kite somebody to kill them solely through using Twin Fangs on non-poisoned targets because Phase Rush only lasts for 3 seconds and has a 15 second cd. \n\nAs for the Miasma change. You do realize, for most top laners, it was a buff right? They removed the minimum range on it but also reduced the maximum range, so now many top laners have a better chance at jumping on her since she can't land a max range Miasma.   I don't think you have any clue what you're talking about; in this meta, a Miasma with a minimum range would be utterly useless against majority of champions. \n\nCassiopeia's Comet build was also recently nerfed due to allowing her to be a lane bully. As you can imagine, she's much less so now. Obviously she'll be able to bully melee champions purely out of having a ranged advantage early on. \n\nI don't disagree that a well-played Cassiopeia is hard to deal with as a melee (non-assassin) champion, but implying that any random Cass can destroy any top laner is pure bs. Also, saying that she can just spam her abilities and doesn't need to land anything for her Twin Fangs quite frankly just shows you have no clue what you're talking about. \n\nCassiopeia is one of the easier ranged champs to deal with as a melee top since she has no gap closers and can actually be ganked. You want actual cancer to deal with? Try to play against Tristana. Dash onto her? She Ws away and kites you. Use another gapcloser to get onto her? She presses R and knocks you half a lane away but can still auto you and kite you because of her passive. Can't even gank her effectively most times because her W covers half of the lane. In addition, God knows why she has a needless reset mechanic on her W. And guess what? She doesn't even need to land anything to deal damage since she's AD. Only downside to her which is also somewhat an advantage is the fact that she has free aoe. Also scales really hard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"King Livid","date":"2019-09-10T16:44:01.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've only played against Cass as {{champion:122}} twice but it wasn't so bad.
