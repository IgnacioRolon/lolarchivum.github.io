But so far they've been unsuccessful.\n\nATM, Top kench is manageable, but still cancer.  Support kench is pretty atrocious though.  Which is sad, because I enjoy playing him.\n\nThere's really no reason for the champion to do as much damage as he does.  He offers so much safety through his kit, that's more than enough for support.  I mean look at Janna -- champ does virtually no damage (unless you build her for it, but you have to sacrifice a lot of your utility/safety for your team to do so) and is still one of the better supports in bot lane.  She's got a lot of great stuff -- slow, knockup, shields, pushback, heals.... that's enough.  That's all ya need to be a good support champ.\n\nKench has a ton of utility.  He has a slow, he has a uh.... eat?  Root?  Stun?  Whatever you wanna call it.  He has the whole \"You can't kill my carry\" thing goin on.  He has the tandem TF ult.  He's a good champion!  He's a good support!  He doesn't need all this damage in his kit!  He really hardly needs ANY damage in his kit, for how much he already brings to the table!\n\nI say revert all these silly nonsense nerfs and reworks they've done to try to balance this champ from being cancer in the top lane -- and real simple, just tone his damage WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY down.  He's not there to do damage.  That's not his job.  If he wants kill pressure he can take ignite, just like all the other utility-based supports.\n\nThere's no reason to keep iterating on this in the way they have been -- its nonsense.  The problem is very easy to fix, they just don't want to completely kill top lane Kench because they think its interesting.  Which I guess it --could-- be.\n\nBut I just don't see how you could possibly balance this champion efficiently for both roles with his kit.  Almost seems like it would be less of a headache to pick one and kill the other.\n\nPersonally, I'd prefer him as a low damage, high utility, tanky support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2019-08-12T04:49:36.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top lane he's doing fine. Just depends on the match-up now. He averages over 51% atm. \n\nSupport he's pretty garbage atm, though. But he offers something no other champion does, barring kalista for her support. Pro play will always value that, and Riot's still trying to mitigate his horrible W design in pro play.","replies":[]}]}
