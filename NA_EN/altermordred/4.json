So you aren't canceling that animation just cutting it a bit short.\n\nSecondly animation cancel is the act of preforming a technique without playing the requisite animation.  You literally skip the animation, but still activate the effects of the technique.  Usually done by overriding the longer and/or locked animation with a shorter and/or mobile one.\n\nEDIT- Also animation canceling isn't used to skip \"unnecessary animations\" its used to skip lengthy animations that (in the fighting games where it started) were risky to pull off because they gave your opponent too much opportunity to retaliate.  Especially if you missed.  That shouldn't be a thing in League.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-09-13T00:37:01.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I did.\n\nYour canceling a lock out on movement with orb walking. Each locked out fractions of a second on moment adds up, if throwing out multiple non walked autos results in losing the ability to put up damage your disadvantaged. Its a core mechanic for melee and ranged champions.  The exact value varies off how bad animation lag after damage is not all champions are equal here.\n\nDo you need me to show you a video comparing orb walking vs standing still with a attack command to show the massive impact it makes on some ones ability to kite/chase?  I feel that's unnecessary, it should be visible in games with {{champion:22}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:222}}  {{champion:18}} \n\nWatch orb walking videos, its about \"animation canceling\" the lag animation for your autos. Your welcome to make up a new term for it but even how you chose to define the mechanic shows you understand it cancels animations. \n\n> \n> the bit of animation that gets skipped\n>  just cutting it a bit short\n> All you are doing is skipping the unnecessary (according to the code) recovery phase animation\n\nWhich leads me to your attempt to re-define the term.\n> Secondly animation cancel is the act of preforming a technique without playing the requisite animation\n\nWell Riven plays the animations still, her animation canceling is about cutting out the animation lock out, its in a very literally sense the exact same thing your doing with orb walking.  You remove fractions of a second off by interrupting lock out. Riven can do this multiple ways, but most champions with an AA modifier has the ability to cancel animation lock out of many animations.\n\nWhy is it done? To get rid of animation lag on her abilitys. That's it. The animations do become more clustered but they still exist, she's starting a dash, the Ki blast blasts out, her Sword enhances and grows larger.  The animation lock outs are removed, the ability effects and animations are not invisible.  Hit R, Buff applys, interrupt the remaining lock out animation with a command.  Q has been used for mobility, interrupt the remaining animation.\n\nAt no point is the impact of her animation canceling making the animations not show up visibly, if you need her to stand still in lock out to realize what skill she uses, that on you.  Kiburst, R1 R2 Q1-3 and Dash all have very clear indications of what's being used if your paying attention.  If you don't, that's not the champions fault but yours.","replies":[{"poster":"Kazekiba","date":"2019-09-16T17:34:58.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kai Guy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XHgYJxfE,comment-id=0000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-09-13T00:37:01.356+0000)\n>\n> I did.\n> \n> Your canceling a lock out on movement with orb walking.\n\nLeague doesn't have Orb walking, so you can stop reading there. \nYeah you can kite and Attack move but you ... can't Orb walk.

The point of my post was that its actually impossible for riven to tank that many tower shots without you being afk even with triumph. Like riven after getting hit by the tower would only have 90 hp if she was full hp meaning all you had to do was hit ONE ABILITY.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Artorias1","date":"2019-09-11T18:02:58.280+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":5,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"boricCentaur1","date":"2019-09-11T20:23:51.306+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok and?

You always have to maintain your distance from her and her cancerous 4 short dashes. One slight error and an experienced Riven player will just sit on you until you're dead. I know how powerless you feel afterwards and it's hella justified because she has one of the strongest snowball in all League.\n\nHowever, advanced animation cancels (3 or 4 spells in a very very short period of time) are sometimes hard to pull off and in very rare cases are worth pulling off. However these cancels are something that you need to learn to expect from Riven players as you improve in your ranked queue. Hope my tips will help you in your further matches!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-09-11T12:33:38.156+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":10,"body":"Riven can't activate 4 spells at once, unless you're counting ignite.\n\nAnd 4 tower shots?

Let's say she has her phage too.
