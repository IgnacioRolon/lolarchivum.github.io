However, regardless of intention, a disconnection negatively impacts *everyone* in the match. This is a big reason why disconnections are all treated equally and why leaverbuster penalties cannot be modified for any reason.\n\nI'd definitely recommend updating your display driver to the most **recent and stable** one available. Additionally, you may want to run Windows updates and install the Directx 9c package [here.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34429) Let me know if those steps resolved your issue.","replies":[{"poster":"StevenJrh","date":"2016-11-06T23:41:25.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't get my point.., the system fail \" leavebuster \" it need so major update with the tech we have now days. making ppl lose time over your program not working correctly.
