Sometimes you&#039;re paired up with a challenger, or sometimes you just unintentionally feed. People get beyond tilted when someone does poorly in normals and I don&#039;t understand. I sometimes don&#039;t want to play to avoid getting banned from all the rage and reports for doing poorly in norms. I use my mains, do my best in ranked sure, but at least let me do bad in normals unintentionally. \r\n\r\nOne of the good implementations that riot has done is the honor system. I think having a good state of mind, grants people to honor your prestige in the end. \r\n\r\nIs there something else we can implement to avoid toxicity especially in normals? If I wanted a bunch of 13 year olds yelling at my old ass for playing like a pleb, I&#039;ll go and play ranked. At least let me enjoy the game in normals somehow. \r\n\r\nIdeas to fix Normals:\r\n1. Remove chat completely in normals\r\n-You might say, oh but just mute people? Sometimes you don&#039;t decide to do that because if the feature is there, you rather give it a shot. When the rage happens as well, it is a slow development of rage, and you don&#039;t see it coming tbh; when ti does come, it just hurts.\r\n2. Replace chat with voice chat instead? I want to see if a kid can really be that mean via there voice boxes and not their devil fingers. \r\n\r\nIf you have any ideas to fix normals as well, please let me know.","replies":[]}
