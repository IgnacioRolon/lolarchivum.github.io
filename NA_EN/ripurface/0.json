And I do think i&#039;ve made some decent improvements. However, I just got banned for 2 games that, upon reading them over again, are really quite mild. In fact, the worst thing I can see that I said was &quot;this team is garbage&quot; and I proceeded to state why in a factual manner. It wasn&#039;t over the top. It wasn&#039;t using excessive amounts of language. It wasn&#039;t all caps raged. It wasn&#039;t attacking the player as a person. It wasn&#039;t threatening violence. It was simply stating that the team was bad and the game was over. It is not toxic to be critical of your team, especially when its warranted. and I said it one time when I was trying to start a surrender, which inherently effects our chances of winning the game. If the team is bad, youre chances of having a comeback are slim. Just end it. Stating this is not toxic. \r\n\r\nTo break it down, in game 1 I&#039;m critical of my veigar support. I asked him in the lobby not to go veigar support and he gave me a whole spiel about how it works well and he was on a hot streak with it. I had pick order on him and openly said I was planning on going AP harass bot lane. He says its fine and I cave and let him try it without making a fuss...because I&#039;m honestly trying not to be as toxic. We get in lane and he starts his harass where he &quot;accidentally&quot; takes my cs even though he promised not to and ends up giving away first blood by walking under their turret at level 2 and getting caught. I don&#039;t get negative. I b, we get back to lane and play it more safe except that veigar is constantly spamming his stun and has nothing for peel since his other 3 moves are pure damage. They get to the point where they are able to walk right up to us and kill us without much resistance. Go back to lane and ask the jungler for help. our lane is 0-3-0 at this point and if we don&#039;t get help, we are going to start feeding hard. Stating a fact. Not threatening to feed. Not directly accusing their veigar. Hell, I even said please. Still no ganks. I&#039;m trying to aa farm as not to push while veigar is literally standing under tower. Jungle gank. we die under tower. Veigar is helpless this whole time. At this point I tell him that veigar is just about worthless bot lane. Not HIM, but the champoin veigar itself. I then proceed to back up my statements as to why I think so and ask him to stay in the meta. This is not toxic. At this point our lane is something like 0-5 or 0-6, our mid is 0-4, and our top and jungle are not carrying by any marginal kill or cs count. Tower is lost. I group up to push midlane and fight it out and ask team to end it. Team refuses to group and we continue to die (yeah. surprise. get no help and keep dying. who would have thought). GP tells me to get out of mid and starts bming me when he&#039;s doing just as bad. I say no, I&#039;m gonna keep pushing because its literally all I&#039;m good for right now, and it turns out thats where 100% of my kill participation came from. They get mad that my score is garbage even though  I had a troll support and 0 ganks, and report me. Once again, for the situation that was sucky all around, what I said was quite mild and highly merited. \r\n\r\nI dont&#039; even know why I&#039;m being reported in game 2. The worst thing I said was telling jg to learn to do their job. She was literally intentionally trolling by not ganking because I flashed in to get a kill in my own lane after mid had roamed and obviously was not going to get it with his brand burn. He was toxic the whole game and left me to duel and defend top lane when riven was spamming q and pushing constantly. easy gank. easy lane. and she didn&#039;t come once. This isn&#039;t reportable and I&#039;m not saying that it is, but it is a dick move. So my team keeps telling me to group up and I say not until I get a gank. I&#039;ll keep going top and dueling. Once again, not reportable. Shyv ends up being toxic all game, admitting that she didn&#039;t care if we lost and that she didn&#039;t care if she was toxic because she had other accounts. All this and the worst thing I said was &quot;learn to do your job jg.&quot; That is not toxic in the slightest. |\r\n\r\nOverall, I was critical of my team at times and for good reason. But I never lost my cool. Never all caps raged. Never threatened anyone. Never used lots of profanity. And whenever I was critical of someone I backed it up with facts. This is not warranting of a ban. \r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nRipUrFace: what did you start veigar?\r\nRipUrFace: I refuse to be pessimistic. our ganks will be good. come soo nplease\r\nRipUrFace: hey rengar. what abou those ganks I asked for 3 levels ago? we are getting fuking creamed down here. come or its a feed fest.\r\nRipUrFace: btw, your veigar support is terrible. don&#039;t do it again. you tried. you failed. stick to the meta.\r\nRipUrFace: see? you have 0 peel. you have terrible poke. you scale hard with items. just play lux support next time. veigar is worthless b\r\nRipUrFace: yeah, i&#039;m just going mid and pushing. this team is garbage. veigar watches me die from tower at full hp. 0 ganks. mid feeds.\r\nRipUrFace: i&#039;m just going to keep pushing mid.

You were calling the Veigar worthless and that he should stick to the meta when he went 1/4/0 and you went 0/11/3 with AP support item Nasus bot lane instead of adc?\n\nI took a look at the Viegar's match history. Out of his 8 last games that he played as Viegar support, he only lost one game. It was with you.\n\nOut of your 4 games where you played \"ADC but actually Nasus AP support items\", you lost 3.\n\nI think you need to re-evaluate which of you needs to stick to the meta.","replies":[{"poster":"RipUrFace","date":"2017-01-25T01:20:54.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"First off, there is no rule at all against report calling and I did report both of them. They deserved it.  So your point is null there. \n\nSecondly, in the first game I the only insult I say is that the team is garbage...myself included! Saying a champ is worthless bot lane is **not toxic**! Its stating a fact. You could say the same thing about taking a LOT of champions bot to the support role. And, let me reiterate that I backed it up as to WHY the champion was a worthless bot. One long cooldown, difficult to to land cc. No peel. Bad poke. Hardcale with items. All reasons why you don't take any champ with those qualities as a support. And its also not toxic or an insult to say I got trolled, because I did. I said veigar wasn't a support in lobby. I asked him not to do it. I explained it was bad for the comp. Yet he does it anyways. And then he literally stands under tower and watches me die, which is why I left lane. Playing an off meta support isn't necessarily trolling. Allowing a teammate to die while you do nothing in a situation where your own safety is not compromised is most certainly trolling. Its not toxic to state the facts. \n\nFinally, your only critique bot lane is that I stayed top lane even though it was a bad idea? Yes, and? Once again, thats not a reportable offense. And you give me a lecture on jungling when... \n1) you obviously don't know how to jungle because I stated that her lane was pushed (lots of room to gank),she was spamming abilites (no escape), and we had lots of kill potential between us. A jungler's job is to assist lanes in need, secure objectives, deny the enemy gold when possible, and try gank lanes with a high probability of getting a kill. My lane literally had all of that. There was no reason not to gank. \n2) I already admitted that its not a reportable offense to not gank my lane. so you can say \"its not your decision\" all you want. It just makes you sound stupid because I **already said that.** And I reported shyv for toxic, not for intent feed or trolling. So your entire second point is null too. \nOverall, going top to farm, even when it will force me to duel an opponent stronger than myself, is not reportable. I never once intent fed. I fought back every time. I last hit as much as possible. I stayed under tower whenever I saw her. I even got a few kills on her. Sorry kid, but just like shyv refusing to gank me, I don't have to play the way you want me to. And guess what? It worked. Shyv eventually caved and ganked. We got a kill and I went to group up...and still got demolished. \n\nAlso, just to correct your language: you can't throw a game from a losing stance so it was impossible of me to \"throw\" when we were already behind. I, however, was actually going even with riven and had a significant gold advantage from my q when I asked shyv to gank. This means that she threw away a huge advantage that would have given us a large lead. THAT is throwing. I threw away nothing. She threw away a great deal. See the difference?","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-01-25T01:42:48.633+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":">First off, there is no rule at all against report calling and I did report both of them. They deserved it. So your point is null there.\n\nReport calling **_is_** against the rules. There is no reason, other than to aggravate the other person, to mention it in chat. It functions completely without it being mentioned at all.\n\nAlong with leaving lane to invade another teammates' lane without their permission.\n\nIn game 2, you were wielding your action to stay top lane like it was a threat. I would consider that pretty damn negative attitude.\n\n>impossible of me to \"throw\" when we were already behind\n\nThat's your own opinion. I consider it throwing when someone does something that puts the team more behind no matter their current situation. And it seems like you were staying top lane intentionally, then using it as a threat to try and get what you wanted. If you thought that staying top lane was the best choice for the team, you would have stayed top lane even after Shyv ganked.","replies":[{"poster":"RipUrFace","date":"2017-01-25T02:14:20.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Please show me where.

Whether or not its been done before is irrelevant. If its not in the rules, its not against the rules, and you shouldn't get banned for it. \n\nSecondly, I don't need permission to go anywhere on the map. Once again, its not against the rules in any sense. in fact, it was the smart move because had I stayed bot lane and only had one tower, I would have certainly died more than going mid. Its called grouping, and it usually occurs once you've lost a tower or 2. \n\nThirdly, it doesn't matter why I stayed top. Once agian, its. not. against. the. rules. Neither is asking for a gank. I don't have to play the way  you want me to. As long as I am actively trying to win the game, which I was, I can stay in my lane for as long as I please. And ironically, I died more grouping than when I was just farming top. My attitude is unimportant so long as it doesn't come out in chat or by me trolling. We established that what I did is technically legal, and that I didn't rage at shyv. Therefore, its not bannable. \n\nFinally, its not a matter of opinion. The definition of throwing a game is \"to lose a game on purpose.\" You cannot intentionally lose a game that you were already losing, because its not your actions that caused you to lose. Someone could literally intent feed and it would not be a throw if you were far enough behind. \n\nIn conclusion, you seem to be missing my entire point here. I'm not looking to be a happy, bright ray of sunshine in the league community. In fact, I highly dislike most people in the community. Theyre not very good at the game, get mad when you call them on their s*** and have no real desire to improve because riot pampers them and bans anyone who is overly critical. I do not want to be that person and, luckily, I don't have to! All I am required to do is follow the summoner's code. I'm not looking to be a nice guy, I'm looking to be technically correct. You may not like it, but you don't have to. Its not your decision. I want to stay on the good side of legal here, and in these 2 examples I believe I am.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-01-25T02:27:30.180+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RipUrFace,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=NjV4Ikwx,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-25T02:14:20.059+0000)\n>\n> Please show me where.

The intention and the threat is.\n\n>Thirdly, it doesn't matter why I stayed top.\n\nYeah, it does.\n\nFor example. If someone goes 0/10/2 because they played poorly, they don't deserve to be punished. If you go 0/10/2 because you were _**trying**_ to play poorly, if that intention is discovered you can be held accountable for it.\n\nSame for your top lane decision, if you made the decision because you felt like it was the best for the team, it would have been fine. But you specifically made the effort to let your teammates know that you were staying top lane because you didn't like that Shyvana didn't gank your lane yet. You were just going to continue to push top and die (you know, instead of playing safe or instead of helping the team).","replies":[{"poster":"RipUrFace","date":"2017-01-25T02:47:34.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"1) No it doesn't. The 2 are not mutually exclusive. In fact, in both cases I gave constructive feedback. I told veigar the reasons why veigar is a bad choice to support and I told shyvana why it would be a good idea to gank my lane. And it doesn't hamper civil discussion either. Being civil to someone is simply being polite. I said I was filing a report. I encouraged others to do the same. Doing so is not impolite when the person in question deserved a report to be filed against them. If you are offended by someone reporting you, that is your problem and should be solved by altering your behavior. You mistake the difference between being offended and intent to offend. As he obviously can't file a report against himself, I don't care what he thought of me asking others to report him. Therefore, I had no intent to offend him. \n\n2) I don't care what YOU consider, I care about the rules. Assuming it isn't against the rules then it doesn't matter what you think: its ok. However, in the instance you gave it WOULD be against the rules because you are actively trying to hurt another member of your team by denying them gold. In my situation, I was not feeding, nor taking anyone else's gold, nor intentionally wasting their time by having them fight camps and stealing it at the last second. I was farming top lane. Regardless of my intent, its not against the code. End of story. \n\n3) no its not. Intent doesn't matter. Its how the intent is manifested. I can think my adc is a dick and ks them every time I get the chance, but doing so is not against the rules. I can be mad at my midlaner and refuse to give her blue all game and, once again, its fine because its not against the rules. \n\n4) True, if you are TRYING to play poorly. However, I was not. There is a huge difference between playing smart, playing dumb, playing well, and playing poorly. There is no rule saying you have to play it safe. When I went top, I tried my best to win every time. There is no rule requiring me to play it safe, so long as I am not actively trying to lose. I was not. There are lots of people who play dumb, and still play well. There are lots of people who play smart, and still play poorly. Any combination of those 4 factors is allowed so long as you do not INTENTIONALLY play poorly. If you play dumb, and also play poorly, but not doing so intentionally, you are still in the clear.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-01-25T03:31:36.944+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":">No it doesn't.

I'm saying that claiming to report someone is neither driving constructive feedback nor facilitating civil discussion.\n\n> I said I was filing a report. I encouraged others to do the same.\n\nWhat does claiming to file a report serve? I've already established that a Riot employee has contradicted your statement that multiple reports are nessessary. Multiple reports are **_un_**nessessary.\n\n>If you are offended by someone reporting you, that is your problem and should be solved by altering your behavior.\n\nThis is like saying, \"If you're offended by someone insulting you over how bad they play, it's your problem and should be solved by playing better\". No, each person is responsible for their own behavior regardless of other people's behavior.\n\n>I don't care what YOU consider, I care about the rules.\n\nI don't care what you ultimately consider to be the rules. You're banned. I'm trying my best to help you understand why I think you were banned. \n\n> Assuming it isn't against the rules then it doesn't matter what you think:\n\nThis statement can be turned directly on it's head and passed back to you. It doesn't matter what you consider to be the rules, if Riot believes you broke the rules your belief amounts to nothing for your account. They intentionally left the Summoner's code vague because there are a million and one ways someone can be an asshole in the game. They don't want people being assholes.\n\nAnd you contradict yourself;\n\n>no its not. Intent doesn't matter. Its how the intent is manifested.\n\nand\n\n>so long as you do not INTENTIONALLY play poorly. \n\nSo which is it? Does intent matter or not?","replies":[{"poster":"RipUrFace","date":"2017-01-25T04:42:26.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"1) If you aren't saying that they aren't mutually exclusive then your point is null. Not everything you say in league has to be constructive. Saying \"hi guys\" isn't constructive. Saying \"I like dogs\" isn't constructive. But its allowed. I can say that I am filing a report and encourage others to do the same without stopping constructive conversation, and while still being civil...which I did. \n\n2) And as I've already told you it DOES serve a purpose. It does not serve a purpose in terms of the numerical flagging of someone to be put before the tribunal. However, it DOES serve a purpose when choosing to ban or not to ban. Someone with an entire team reporting them is a lot more likely to be banned than someone who gets a solo report from someone who he didn't gank. I should know. I do it all the time. \n\n3) No, its nothing like that because I'm not insulting them. Thats like saying \"i'm insulted because you chose to play top lane.\" I performed an action that is completely within what riot permits. Its YOUR choice whether or not to be insulted. In fact, even if I blatantly bm you, its STILL your choice to control how you feel. The only difference is that its against the rules to bm someone and completely within the rules to file a report. \n\n4) I didn't ask for your help and I don't give a flying fuk about it. Youre an unranked kid who plays bots all day. I only care about the summoner's code and an offical riot statement. \n\n5) You didn't turn around anything. I am completely within the rules here. Do you know how the tribunal works? If youre level 30, you get to make the decision on whether to ban or pardon someone. Its not like a rioter is sitting there going through every report. Thats why this section exists. And the person on the other side of the tribunal is probably going just by gut feeling and not by official summoner's code rules. Hell, when I do a couple tribunal cases I will pardon an toxic player 99% of the time so long as they have a good score. Because I don't support the panzylike institution riot has put in place. \n\n6) You must lack basic logic skills because this isn't a contradiction in the slightest. Intent+negative actoin=ban. Its simple. you need both parts. If you perform a negative action without intending to do so (like feeding because youre bad at this game) then its ok. If you perform an action that is not inherently negative while doing so for less than savory reasons (many examples given already), youre still fine. When I went top lane I had no intent to die or play poorly. I knew it was a possibility and told my team to assist me. However, I in now way played poorly or lost any trade on purpose. THAT is where intent comes in. Look at it in binary. You need 1+1=1 for a ban. I was upset with my team (intent) so I went top lane to farm even though it was risky (not inheriently bad). 1+0=0; no ban. Next, I made every effort to play well (no intent), yet I did poorly (bad). 0+1=0. I did nothing contradictory, nor warranting of a ban in the case of my actions. \n\nYet we completely digress from the actual point of the matter: Is calling my team (myself included) garbage when everyone was doing poor and asking to ff at a level of toxic warranting of a 14 day ban? No. I do not believe so.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-01-25T04:53:20.019+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll just answer to just one of the points because it's only becoming a back and forth that can be summarized to I believe you are breaking the rules by showing negative behavior because X, and you do not because Y.

I am completely within the rules here. Do you know how the tribunal works? If youre level 30, you get to make the decision on whether to ban or pardon someone. Its not like a rioter is sitting there going through every report. Thats why this section exists. And the person on the other side of the tribunal is probably going just by gut feeling and not by official summoner&#x27;s code rules. Hell, when I do a couple tribunal cases I will pardon an toxic player 99% of the time so long as they have a good score. Because I don&#x27;t support the panzylike institution riot has put in place. \n\n>... \n\n> Yet we completely digress from the actual point of the matter: Is calling my team (myself included) garbage when everyone was doing poor and asking to ff at a level of toxic warranting of a 14 day ban? No. I do not believe so.\n\nOkay, I just want to step in and clarify something about the punishment system. Under the old Tribunal, you needed to be level 30 and not under any current punishment in order to vote on cases. However, this Tribunal that you are referring to no longer exists, and has not existed for a good number of years now, with one of the big reasons being was that it was far too slow. Riot has since replaced the Tribunal a few times over the years, with the most recent replacement being the Instant Feedback System (IFS), which was implemented a little over a year ago.\n\nSo, to start, the IFS is an automated system, so we as players do not get to vote on whether a certain case is punishable or not. We simply report players we believe are being toxic, and the IFS will determine whether or not they are. Now, I know this sounds like a simple little thing, but the IFS does quite well at it's job.\n\nNow, as far as punishments go, there are currently only 4 tiers of punishment:\n\n1.) 10 game chat restriction\n2.) 25 game chat restriction\n3.) 14 day ban\n4.) Permanent ban\n\nThe way it works is, you start at tier 1 for your first offense, and you advance to the next highest tier for every subsequent offense, **_regardless of how minor the offense may have been._** So you really shouldn't be asking \"Is this worthy this particular punishment?\" but rather \"Is this worthy of a punishment?\" If it is, the the punishment you get is determined by your history with the system. Of course, this doesn't mean that severity isn't a factor. For very severe offenses, the player will completely skip the chat restrictions and be escalated straight to a 14 day or even a permanent ban. \n\nWith your first sentence of the OP, you mention you have had chat restrictions prior to this, and the next tier after those is a 14 day ban, which is what you got here. \n\nNow, I personally do agree with the judgment the IFS made here. I do believe that the chat logs were quite negative and deserved a punishment. I won't go into much detail as I do believe that AeroWaffle has made a decent enough job of pointing out what parts of the chat logs were punishable. Whether you want to believe what you were doing was unacceptable is up to you, though. If you want to talk with a Rioter directly about your punishment, then you will need to submit a support ticket.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-25T16:30:31.774+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RipUrFace,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=NjV4Ikwx,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-25T02:14:20.059+0000)\n>\n> Please show me where. Give me a direct quote from the summoner&#x27;s code\n\nHere it goes:\n\n>  Calling for others to report a player is a punishable offense. It is a form of bullying and as such is against the summoner code. It should always be a personal decision for each player as to whether or not they feel another player warrants a report. In fact, do feel free to tell your team mates that \"report calling\" in itself counts as harassment. Flaming and bullying a player will never help them to improve their game mechanics, communication etc. \n\nhttp://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour-en/EE7d58Pu-dear-riotsome-clarification-please?show=flat&comment=0007","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-25T01:45:38.545+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report calling is considered harassment because one report does the same as nine.
