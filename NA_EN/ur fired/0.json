Your goal should always be to improve, to become a better player. Winning more games is the long-term result of you achieving that goal. But always remember, your goal in every game is to improve even a little bit. If you have discovered one more flaw in your game, one more minor thing to work on, or one more thing you could be just a little better at... then the game was successful for you.\n\nIf you can remember that, you'll be a lot happier playing this game, because you'll start to enjoy every game more since losses won't be as frustrating, leavers won't be getting in your way(since you can still get better in a 4v5) and a game where you do well will still be a crowning accomplishment, even if you lose.","replies":[{"poster":"Mongoose","date":"2014-12-26T05:52:14.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol fuk dat i want my victorious skin i wanna win","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2014-12-26T06:00:42.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pk gts,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=6EyBxR7x,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2014-12-26T05:52:14.133+0000)\n>\n> lol fuk dat i want my victorious skin i wanna win\n\nAnd you'll win more games over time if you improve as a player. If you just 'win games' but never improve, you'll eventually stop getting lucky and fall back down. But take the advice or leave it, it's up to you whether you want to get frustrated and anguished over the game, have no fun, and never actually improve at the game... or whether you'd like to actually enjoy yourself :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ImHerVoice","date":"2014-12-26T00:28:20.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"4 mutes start of game.\nTurn all chat off.\nyw.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sooko","date":"2014-12-25T18:46:03.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trust nothing but your strength. - {{champion:113}}","replies":[]}]}
