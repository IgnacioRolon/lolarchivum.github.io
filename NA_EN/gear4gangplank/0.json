Only for a trash company to &quot;&quot;regret&quot;&quot; it because they want to cave in to sjw&#039;s who are the same type of people  who march in &quot;free the boob&quot; marches.\n\nThis is obviously a decision revolved around money. what the hell are you afraid of? League is arguably one of the most played games in many countries, you really think criticism on one splash art is gonna ruin your company? Have you seen some of your other splash arts??? are you fucking kidding me???.  Im sure you're including {{champion:44}}  as well right??? no no no, that's just too consistent for you.\n\n\nI honestly dont care much about Kai&#039;Sa but seeing a game developing company do shit like that honestly makes me lose all respect for it.
