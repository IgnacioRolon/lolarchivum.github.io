Fusing them should unlock her for you!  Have you restarted your client incase of a connection or sync issue?  If so, show me a screenshot of what's going on.  It's really strange that nothing is happening, and I'd like to take a closer look.  As far as I can see, you should be good to go.","replies":[{"poster":"Soulhealer95","date":"2017-06-15T01:13:37.567+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol the good old, \"Have you tried turning it off and on again,\" did the trick (as it does in 98% of cases), but it was odd.

I sold my Illaoi{{champion:420}} thinking that -285 means I need 285 more essence since nothing else seemed to be working. >< Is it possible to undo that? :O :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nebarska","date":"2017-08-28T23:01:37.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same issue with a Camille Champ Shard.
