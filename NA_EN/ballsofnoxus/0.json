Hope you can help me because this is ruining my entire experience. Btw my ping is 20 ms so it's not just lag.","replies":[{"poster":"Miekster","date":"2016-05-09T22:37:39.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if this will help at all, but I'm curious as to 1.) Your in game settings are set to (resolution, graphic quality, etc) 2.) have you verified that you don't have vsync turned on or an fps cap turned on for the game in it's settings or in your nvidia control panel (nvidia cp will only allow you to force vsync not the fps cap. That is in league it's self).\n\nLag won't really effect fps, so we can eliminate that.  On top of that, league drives most of it's appearance and performance from your CPU, not your GPU.  I, for example, game at 1440p with everything maxed out and 2x GTX 980 Ti gpus and a 5820k @ 4.5 ghz, and I get 500 FPS in some areas and in the high 100's during fights and most wondering around).  Now if I jump on my laptop, with the graphics card turned off and using the integrated graphics in my cpu, I can still get 150+ fps on a 3k monitor.  Point that I'm trying to get to is I don't think it has anything to do with your GTX 970.  And it's very clearly not your CPU as your computer just won't work.\n\nI think we need to just address the software side of things here.  To help trouble shoot it while you wait for true help from riot, I would say do the following in any particular order:\n\nReset all of leagues settings for video.  Then go back in there and set everything to high/very high or whatever you play at and ensure that foreground fps (or however it's worded) isn't checked and neither is the box is waiting for vsync.  Background FPS doesn't really matter, and can actually make things much nicer and easier for you when you're in a game, but alt tabbed out of the game.\n\nI'd also download guru3d's DDU application to completely remove my drivers for my GPU, so that I can do a true clean install of the drivers.  It's just one of those things that it's quick and easy to do, even though it's most likely no the problem, it lets us just make sure.\n\nIf neither of those work, you could always completely uninstall LoL, run some type of cleaning software to ensure all the registry entries, ghost files, or anything left is gone, then redownload and install it, that way it's from a completely clean slate.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-09T23:54:38.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The steps here are really solid and will definitely help narrow down where the root cause is.
