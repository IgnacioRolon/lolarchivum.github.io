He should be red/pinkish. \nHere's my little edit (right side, left is yours):\n\nhttp://i62.tinypic.com/1zw1dz4.png\nI tried to give him colors to match his new splash art. Pinkish skin tone, reddish nose, more visible white paintings(tattoos?) and a special touch on the barrel ^^.\n\nGragas new splash\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CFn2TTbX1ZM/VElkupapioI/AAAAAAAAbWQ/GWJmjMCSSEY/s1600/Gragas_Splash_0.jpg\n\n**UDYR**.

The color adjustments in OP's post look significantly better. I have questioned some of the color choices, myself, and they look unnatural. Morg clearly needed it though I got used to Udyr and forgot about it but it definitely looks better with the edit. Gragas I never really considered, but it does look reasonably better then the odd yellow tint. Even without the splash arts as reasoning... why did Riot's art team add such strange color tints in the first place? I am curious as to the reasoning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vodka SIut","date":"2014-11-09T05:18:32.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Ququroon First i must say, your comment made my day! however, I'd also like to question her wings.
