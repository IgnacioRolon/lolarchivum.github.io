This is my first time posting here, I hope it is the correct section, but anyways, I just got the new Risen fiddlesticks{{champion:9}}  skin and was looking at it in a custom match and noticed that the scythe wasn&#039;t even connected to his hand when he moves to the left. Now, I know this probably happens with a lot of skins, and its very hard to see unless you look closely. But I just thought I might as well post this, and see if it can get changed, if not that is totally fine and it wont affect anything, but I do think if it can be changed to improve the skin and any other fiddle skins, then this could help start that change. Here are a few pictures, Gifs, and a video of the scythe visual bug. \r\n\r\nNormal In Hand (http://gyazo.com/04cb7c0fcabb86d78aeb9ce2fc3d3033)\r\nBugged In Hand after moving to the left (http://gyazo.com/993fc42990446929e13f54c29c9d2e52)\r\nGif (http://gyazo.com/d4b0f6f58f93de71fcbd1d451377f90a)\r\nYouTube Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxNo8tnmGfs)\r\n\r\nYou can clearly see that the scythe goes completley through his hand, I hope this helps and I hope this was in the correct section! \r\n\r\nHave a good day! \r\n\r\n~Linker\r\n\r\nP.S. I love this skin ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-01T05:38:08.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThanks for pointing this out!
