The game was with my friends from high school\r\n2. I reconnected about 3 minutes after power outage\r\n3. We won the game, but now me and my friends cant play together without all suffering from this absurd and undeserving punishment. \r\n4. Players constantly disconnect and reconnect, and a 5 minute mark (if the leaverbuster system works that way) should be appealable, especially if reconnection occurs.\r\n5. I just started a pre semester grind that involves summer classes, a part time job, and pre semester athletics. I dont have the time to wait 10 + additional 30 minute average game time. I mean I do, but considering I link up with my old friends from high school who arent always free, time is scarce. \r\n6. Jimmy Butler on Minnesota is going to be a force!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-30T16:17:06.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'd only get a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) penalty if you have a history of leaving, not just a single unexpected outage.  I know it was out of your control, but the system will treat all leaves equally because it still causes others a negative experience.  You'll have to play through the required games without leaving to remove that lower priority queue.  Not sure about Jimmy Butler, but I hope the rest helps clear things up.  :p","replies":[]}]}
