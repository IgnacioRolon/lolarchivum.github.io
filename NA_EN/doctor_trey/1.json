There's not a lot we can do about your internet going out. Keep in mind that the 5 minutes you were gone was probably a big deciding factor in how the game went overall, and those 4 teammates were stuck trying to hold their own without a 5th member.","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Trey","date":"2017-06-30T03:55:29.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"they were my friends from high school. they could care less. in fact, theyre upset that it happened because now they all have to wait 10 minutes to play with me. I hope your not a riot moderator, because that was the most disrespectful dgaf response of all time. I know the games been out for a long time, but please continue to care for the community.","replies":[]}]}]}
