As a first step, clean your [cache and cookies](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752694-Clearing-Browser-History-and-Cookies) to refresh your browser settings.  Afterwards, login from your specific region's homepage and access the PBE signup page from there.  It should take you to the final step, which is account creation.  You can additionally try as Incognito Mode if you use Chrome.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"AyeYo","date":"2016-08-03T21:17:55.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Porocles, so i tried it and i went into the EUNE pbe register, but it keeps doing the same thing, by saying the server is busy.
