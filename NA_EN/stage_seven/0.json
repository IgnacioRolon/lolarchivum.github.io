Is it really that severe?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my latest match, I decided to play Ryze as middle. Our Yasou, who was new at the time and openly admitted it, decided to head top. During that entire match I kept a calm mind and just decided to enjoy myself. However at the end I was just a tad tilted and said some words that were a bit out there. The chat logs the ban message provided were all misread. Let me take you through them bit by bit.\n\nGame 1\nStage Seven: whoever our jungler is\nStage Seven: pls gank me as much as possible\nStage Seven: i want annie dead\n\n- As an immobile mage, I wanted our jungler to try to help me as much as possible during the laning phase.\n\nStage Seven: yasou...\nStage Seven: cmon..\n\n- Yasou tried to 1v1 the Kha'Zix and failed.\n\nStage Seven: its a khazix\nStage Seven: rip\n\n- He explained he didn't know Kha'Zix could do so much damage. He didn't know he couldn't fight one at level one.\n\nStage Seven: oh wow\nStage Seven: and no\nStage Seven: actually\nStage Seven: yeah no\nStage Seven: take it\nStage Seven: i can fight khazix\nStage Seven: go\nStage Seven: just dont feed annie\nStage Seven: lmao\n\n- Yasou asked if he could take middle lane, originally I said he couldn't but then changed my mind as I realized I could try to take on Kha'Zix. Although the last two lines may have seemed a bit aggressive, they were meant in good fun. NOT as a way to attack him.\n\nStage Seven: thats kinda what happens when you end up feeding a khaizx\n\n- Someone asked why Kha'Zix was so busted.\n\nStage Seven: Nah\nStage Seven: better he feed annie than you\n\n- The enemy Kha'Zix was taunting us, asking if I was \"ready\" to switch lanes. Again, playfully teasing the Yasou.\n\nStage Seven: intresting\n\n- Someone tried to dive me under tower and I stunned them, got a free kill.\n\nStage Seven: yasou..\nStage Seven: what was that...\n\n- Yasou failed miserably at flashing away. I guess this part could be considered harassment in some way?\n\nStage Seven: oh babe pls\nStage Seven: relax\nStage Seven: ecksdee\nStage Seven: lets go bb\nStage Seven: cmon eve..\n\n- I was asking the Evelynn to help me kill the Jarvan but she ran so Jarvan backed off. Sad day. I just waltzed back to top lane.\n\nStage Seven: same\nStage Seven: yasou isnt uh\nStage Seven: ECKSDEE\nStage Seven: lul\nStage Seven: man yasou\nStage Seven: is this your first time?\nStage Seven: i can tell damn\n\n- Yasou died again and I questioned whether or not he was new, I didn't mean this in an aggressive way. It was a genuine question which he responded to with an answer.\n\nStage Seven: lux lets go\n\n- Lux and I were going in for a gank.\n\nStage Seven: Who tf \nStage Seven: Said no\nStage Seven: Which one of these ******** *******\n\n- We were all trying to FF but someone said no, this is the part where I kinda lost my cool and said something a little out there.\n\nStage Seven: i think\nStage Seven: this yasou is secretely\nStage Seven: a lcs player\nStage Seven: And he wants to feed 0/20 and then come back with 100/20\nStage Seven: im ready\nStage Seven: MY BODY IS READY\n\n- Playfully teasing the Yasou once again.\n\nStage Seven: I hate that ******** ******* game tho\nStage Seven: oof\nStage Seven: ecksdee\n\n- End of the match, I got a bit tilted.\n\nI know I probably won't get my account unsuspended but all honesty, I don't even think this Yasou was the one that WAS offended. Everyone else in the team seemed fine except for one player who seemed a bit iffy about it. Everyone was enjoying themselves, it just seemed to be the opposing team who was very aggressive. Kha'Zix contentiously harassing and taunting us, alongside a cocky Nidalee who wouldnt stop threatening to report the Yasou for feeding. I know what I said was very offensive and I just want to formally apologize, I guess. I dont expect sympathy but this is my first ban and I do feel really bad. Especially if Yasou was offended. So if you're reading this pal, soz. I'll take the 14-day ban though. Guess this is more so just me whining and trying to justify my aggression. My buddy told me it was a really bad reason but eh, after rereading it I can see why. \n\n**Take it as you will.**  \n\n{{champion:13}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-26T02:23:49.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can sympathize a with you a bit here tbh. It doesn't seem like you were overly toxic or offensive in that chat, until it came to that one bit \"Stage Seven: I hate that ** * game tho\". Certain things cross the line a bit too much and just simply aren't okay in any context.","replies":[{"poster":"Stage Seven","date":"2017-09-27T21:17:53.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, well I felt a bit bad afterwards but that part was mostly geared towards my distaste towards the Kha'Zix being super cocky in chat. So in all honesty, I don't really regret much of what I said that was towards Kha'Zix but I do feel bad for the Yasou. I really hope he doesnt feel bad. Everyone has bad games and Yasou is not as easy as many make him out to be. Lmfao :p","replies":[]}]}]}
