Whatever happens in that second is lost, but delayed sound effects will play after ping returns to normal.\n\nIt's only been happening today.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-11T21:55:24.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you've having a network issue that's causing you to lag spike, and have input delays.
