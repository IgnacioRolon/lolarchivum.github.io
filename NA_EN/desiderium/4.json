Skins are sometimes held back to be released in tandem with other skins (Pool Party, Project, etc.)\r\n\r\nNow that Riot has said that they&#039;re going to release skins and events without adhering to the timing of their real-world counterparts (I agree with this decision, by the way) does this mean that skins will continue to be delayed for long periods of time to be released in tandem?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-05T22:11:21.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've stated that we've got some stuff planned for Snowdown. In a case like that, yes, skins would be held for that event. There will still be instances where you won't see a champion skin for a bit due to them being a part of an event/group of skins that will be released.","replies":[{"poster":"Desiderium","date":"2015-11-05T22:14:11.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah okay. It's still good though, because now there's only one barrier (other skins being completed) rather than two (other skins being completed and requiring a certain time of the year)","replies":[]}]}]}
