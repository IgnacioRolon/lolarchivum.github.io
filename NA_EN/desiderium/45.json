Unfortunately the player base being splintered by another game mode is probably something they want to avoid, and the huge number of players might just be in part because the game mode is only available 3 weeks or so every year.\n\nIt's a shame, but if it was that big a deal to me I would just hunt for WTF mode games in Dota (does dota 2 have wtf mode yet?) \nTill then I'll just log in to League when URF is available and let it sit for the other 49 weeks a year.","replies":[{"poster":"MidEvilKnight3k","date":"2015-04-08T13:39:05.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I predict that it takes a lot more work to keep URF online than it does for ARAM.

WTF is this nonsense i keep hearing?\n> ITS URF> CHILL THE FUCK OUT BOYZ\n\nI saw one person get flamed during an urf game.  After the game, he asked me if he played well, lol.  I told him it was urf and he shouldn't worry about it.  I also played an urf game where someone flamed me for not banning Zed, lol.  We killed Zed... a lot :D\nBut you know, I've actually been hearing a lot of the opposite. Players seem to be having a lot of fun playing urf and there have been a lot of people trying to get RIOT to make URF all-year round.  I've also been invited to more URF games then other types of games and I've almost always been willing to accept.\nAs much as I love URF, I have to say, I'm glad that RIOT isn't making URF permanent.  I just feel that if URF were permanent, then players would start to take it seriously.  URF should not be taken seriously and we should mercilessly poke fun at anyone who actually does.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rakvir","date":"2015-04-08T01:40:29.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XxxLumberJackxxX,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=oX2AAobw,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-07T22:31:38.234+0000)\n>\n> I've not had anyone harass me during urf.
