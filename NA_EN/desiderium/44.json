We HATE how you're selling them.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":103,"down_votes":14,"body":"We've always wanted chromas. But you guys jumped the gun way too early. I think if you had held back for a little while and ideated on a way for us to earn chromas without RP (or *AT LEAST* get them individually) then I can assure you that you wouldn't be getting *any* negative feedback. Seriously. \n\nWe've all wanted chromas. But inconveniencing your consumers by putting chromas in packs, easily forcing us to pay more RP than we may intend, is just unfair. MAYBE someone can say it's a way to get rid of excess RP - but doesn't the new Skin Boost feature of Aram provide that for us? I can just see no viable justification for the way you're marketing chroma packs.\n\nAgain: WE LOVE CHROMAS. We love that they don't interrupt \"real\" skin development for our favorite champions. We love the designs. We HATE that you're trying to force extra money out of us in the scummiest way possible, especially when you are aware of your competitors and their ways of giving free recolors to their playerbases.\n\n You have released chromas now and will not refund those who have been uninformed. This might be a moot topic, because you most likely don't care about what we have to say about this since you guys seem to be extremely set on making this your latest unfair cash grab. If it really matters to you, though...in our opinion as a community, the pack system needs to go, (individual chromas can stay) IP needs to be considered (RP costs can stay, maybe 260 per chroma?) , and unlock through Mastery needs to be considered.\n\nI know it has been said that other ways of receiving/earning the content would be explored, but now that these have been officially released for RP...it's like I said. I doubt you're going to refund the uninformed, or the \"ooh my favorite champ got something\" people that never check S@20. Not that it's a bad thing to never \"keep up\" but when you take advantage of people like that...it's pretty bad. Unless you're going to be releasing the chromas (I'm withholding on saying \"packs\" in case you wisen up to selling them individually) in different ways in the future, I don't see how this situation can improve at this point. You jumped the gun when you didn't think about other ways to achieve this minor content and you jumped the gun when you made it available for purchase. It's not that we don't love it, because we do...the main, most glaring issue right now, is the Pack system.\n\n***There's nothing wrong with making money. But there's a huge problem with making people spend more than they want for a single product they want.***","replies":[]}
