I thought that, with how easy they are to make, we&#039;d see a couple of packs at a somewhat consistent rate. Does this mean that Riot is taking our feedback and deciding on better ways to let us attain these simple skins? Or has work stopped on the skins?\n\nI don&#039;t think you guys should stop working on chromas. Sure they might not have sold well, but that&#039;s because of the extremely exploitative pack system, not because of the chromas themselves. (Although to be fair, I think a *lot* of us would have preferred a Lucian with a nice deep black outfit rather than the freaking canary yellow...) I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve seen [my other thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/kENjv0HF-riot-listen-we-do-love-chroma-packs-we-hate-how-youre-selling-them) explaining the community&#039;s thoughts on Chromas and the pack system. We do want chromas, it&#039;s just that the pack system is really dissuading a lot of people from spending their money.\n\nOf course, if work hasn&#039;t stopped on chromas, you may ignore the above paragraph. :3 \n\nAlso I think it&#039;s a VERY good idea if you guys would make chromas for underskinned champions like Zac and Zed. A Red post in a thread a few days ago had stated that chromas don&#039;t really count against \"main\" skin releases for a champion. I believe chromas would help tide people over a great deal. \n\nLast thought: Do you plan on making chromas for all bases and skins? Because for example a Classic Zed chroma pack would be a little difficult, but not impossible, to create because his model has many colorable sections and any chroma would have to remain a deep, dark color to complement his mood and spell effects.\n\n On the flip side, Shockblade Zed is *very* easy to Chroma, having only 3 or 4 colorable sections on his model (the robe, armbraces, the armbrace trim, and the little slots on the hips of his robe.) \n\nAt the same time, Full Metal Jayce would be QUITE a challenge to Chroma as it has tons upon tons of different colorable sections, but there are many creative things you could do with the skin (turn him into Master Chief, Samus Aran, Optimus Prime, etc.) whereas his standard skin is very simple to chroma (although it might not be worth it seeing as there is Debonair Jayce, which is just Classic Jayce with a white tuxedo instead of a steampunk tuxedo.)\n\n***BONUS:*** Do you think it's a good idea to release new champions with Chroma Packs of their base skin and release skin?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-16T19:08:14.643+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo! \n\nWe certainly haven't stopped work on chromas!\n\nWe're still looking at feedback and ways we can improve future chromas. For example, which skins would be good candidates for a chroma pack? As we've mentioned before, this is totally new for both you and us! ^-^ \n\nWhile I can't share what we've got planned coming down the line for chromas, I think players will be happy with the results. As always, feedback is welcome and encouraged for chromas, as well as other content coming out. \n\n> BONUS: Do you think it's a good idea to release new champions with Chroma Packs of their base skin and release skin?\n\nThat's a really neat idea, actually! I'm personally a fan of doing chromas for the base because would mean more skins/variety for a new champion. Of course, there's always the worry of a new champion's look changing right before release, but, it's certainly worth bringing up the idea. :]","replies":[{"poster":"DwarvenGiant","date":"2015-05-16T19:30:41.994+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"May I suggest giving default Sion a green Chroma pack?
