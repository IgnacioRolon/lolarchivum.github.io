Just for convenience.\n\nIf we did this, it may be a good idea to replace the Ctrl ping with it, since Ctrl ping was replaced by the combination of the \"Danger\" ping and the \"Missing\" ping. Ctrl ping may still have a *couple* of uses, but they pale in comparison to Danger and Missing, which fill a lot of the current Ctrl ping's purpose. It may take a day or two to get used to using Ctrl for \"Good job\" but I am sure the payoff would be worth it.\n\n***EDIT:*** I'm rather proud of having over 200 upvotes and 3k views in less than a day, but the lack of a Red post despite huge thread exposure and recognition (and the topic of a GJ ping being so easy to talk about) is disconcerting.\n\n***EDIT #2:*** If using the pings in a toxic and sarcastic manner is a large issue, the text can be removed from the pings, leaving behind only a smiling chibi anime Lux picture. Another ping can be made with Ezreal, also anime and chibi, but he'd be frowning instead; again with no text. This would make the pings very ambiguous, and significantly reduce the chances of taking them as an insult as compared to the Question Mark ping that everyone typically uses sarcastically. Seeing a smiling Lux or a frowning Ezreal on top of you if you die in lane can be seen more as emotional support rather than an insult, and thus highly lessens the chances of the ping being taken negatively, *even if the person that used the ping intended negativity.*","replies":[{"poster":"Enosetc","date":"2015-08-17T16:17:00.121+0000","up_votes":72,"down_votes":3,"body":"bruh\n\ndo you know how hard i would spam this on someone after they made a horrible misplay","replies":[{"poster":"Desiderium","date":"2015-08-17T16:18:08.033+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":4,"body":"Don't people already do that with the Question Mark ping?\n\nThat didn't stop Riot from putting it in.\n\nBesides, it's not like people Honor other people sarcastically.\n\nThere's always going to be assholes on the Internet, but that shouldn't prevent you from implementing a feature that encourages positivity.
