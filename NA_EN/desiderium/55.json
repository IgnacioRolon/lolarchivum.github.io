The only thing good about the new BC is the pure stat increases (20% CDR and 400 hp.) It takes 6 hits to make it reach its maximum shred which is still weaker than Last Whisper. It doesn't even get better than Brutalizer until the enemy has TWO HUNDRED armor. Its stat overloads (the cdr and hp) are what's keeping it an \"okay\" item and not a good one.\n\nAD Champs don't have many options for armor pen anymore. Since Brutalizer only builds into 1 item, + Black Cleaver lost flat armor pen, people who stacked multiple Bruts have lost 30 flat armor pen in their end build. \n\nPretty much all we have left to kill squishies with is Last Whisper...which is just a catch-all, medium-effective item. \n\nAssassin builds got ***severely*** nerfed in 5.8. Even discounting the existence of Cinderhulk. Double whammy.","replies":[]}
