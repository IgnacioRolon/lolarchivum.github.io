I just want to state my thoughts to someone who actually seems to know their stuff about balance. I don&#039;t really mind if none of what I&#039;m suggesting is ever going to happen, but I&#039;m going to be very happy if we can just talk about them.\n\nOn release, Zed was one of the most balanced champions Riot ever designed, due to reliance on multiple-angled skillshots and dependence on melee range in addition to extreme squishiness. But over time, Riot has slowed down the flow of his kit, including a stealth-nerf in the \"buff\" that was the increase in his time in his ult&#039;s untargetability, which, in reality, just made him even slower. Let&#039;s list off everything that they slowed down about Zed, not including the already mediocre speed of his Q (which was meant to be that way, to help it be dodgable)\n\n_ **E&#039;s cooldown.** Went from 3 to 4, nearly identical to his Shuriken&#039;s cooldown. Your shurikens are supposed to be something you measure; something you need to be sure to hit before you cast it, due to its slow speed and thin hitbox. So, why does his E, a low-damage melee-range ability, have to have such a lengthy cooldown, on a champion that is built around Energy? Think about it. The intent behind E&#039;s design was to be spammed if you have the energy, and if you&#039;re in range. How much you can spam it is dependent upon your ability to land a double Q, or a double E, to gain your energy back. So, what sense does it make to make it a 4 second cooldown? I guess it&#039;s supposed to try to reduce his split-pushing power, which was extremely strong back in the day. In that case, why not reduce his attack speed instead, and keep the flow and speed and integrity of his kit intact? Oh wait, that is what they did...yet E remains in a nerfed, extremely slow state. Keep this in mind, because you will soon see that Riot has a habit of nerfing things the wrong way with this champion, then nerfing the RIGHT way to get what they were originally after, without undoing the previous wrong nerf. You will see this again when I begin talking about his ult.\n\n_ **W&#039;s projectile speed.** They said that they wanted Zed to think about where he places his shadows, instead of just throwing them willy nilly while making plays. However, all they *really* did was make it nearly impossible to use W to dodge skillshots, which was about 90% of what made the skill so fun to watch and use. I remember the first day I tried playing Zed after the reduction to his W&#039;s speed. I was against a Brand. I could remember always dodging his Pillar of Flame, because he was misplaying and only used it on me whenever I had my shadow up. His bad plays, my good plays. *Not anymore.* Now, I couldn&#039;t dodge his pillar with W unless I happened to have it out somewhere already, which is extremely unreliable, on a champion that isn&#039;t meant to have unreliability except in his Q. I got hit with it *every time* despite the fact that this Brand kept using his Pillar on a target that had his dodgability and mobility open. Except this time...the target didn&#039;t have it open. He didn&#039;t have that ability anymore. Brand was just doing the first thing he thought, with no heed to my ability to dodge or not. His misplaying, my....***inability to make a good play.*** Riot...you know...for people that like to make articles about \"rewarding good play\" you seem pretty hypocritical in your balance changes sometimes. Additionally, this serves to further slow down Zed&#039;s kit, reducing his integrity as a fast, speedy, *reactive* ninja.\n\n_ **Ult and E** Remember when I was talking about E, when I said Riot likes to nerf things the wrong way, then do it the right way, without undoing the wrong nerfs? Here we are again. Not only does the untargetability increase slow his kit and flow down even further, Zed no longer has easy ways to regain his energy after he ults, since the shadow spawns where he ults rather than behind the target. Since his E&#039;s spam is so dependent on his energy upon engaging, and his ability to regain it...why does the cooldown remain in a nerfed state, despite the fact that he no longer has easy ways to get his energy back? Think about it, seriously. It&#039;s to the point where using W to try to get your energy back ends up being a Noob Trap because the energy spent in casting W can give you a net loss in energy regain because of where they moved R&#039;s shadow. Yet, despite this, Riot doesn&#039;t bother to give Zed more depth in choice, because they are under the belief that buffing a cooldown would buff the character overall. No. Zed is such an intricately made champion. With characters like him, sometimes decreasing a cooldown or increasing some numbers will offer more *choice* or more *intricacy* rather than simply making the character more *strong* and that is what Riot fears, preventing them from making changes to this champion that need to happen. \n\n_**Ult and W** When The R-back works it&#039;s extremely annoying for the enemy team and involves no skill aside from just pressing R. Reworking his ult back to the way it used to be will increase his skill cap and risk and reward altogether making Zed a more balanced champion and making him a lot less annoying (Whee I pressed R and escaped WHEE I&#039;M FAKER WHEEEEEEEEE!!!) I miss when escaping with Zed *actually took skill.* Can we please make it that way again by reworking his ult back to the way it used to be? 0.35 second untargetability, Zed reaches the target within that time, Zed appears in front of the target with the shadow appearing behind them. If this change were to occur, the W shadow&#039;s speed would ***HAVE*** to increase, since Zed can&#039;t dodge a skillshot immediately after he ults (since his ult shadow is behind the enemy instead of back where he ulted) so he would need that travel time gone for him to be able to do what he needs to do if he&#039;s played by someone who knows what they&#039;re doing.\n\n_**Q** The change to his Q a long time ago seems good on paper. It&#039;ll do less damage to you if you&#039;re hiding behind minions, right? Well. It&#039;s also going to do less damage if you hit two champions. You do not get rewarded for skillful play. Since the nerf to the pass-through Q damage, I&#039;ve lost a LOT of double kills from well-aimed shurikens. When you guys talk about skill and mastery so much, you don&#039;t seem to want to reward it very much. Here&#039;s what I personally think should happen to Q: Keep it the way it is. HOWEVER. If the first target hit is a *champion,* the shuriken will do 70% damage to other targets it passes through. If it hits a minion first, keep it the way it is now.\n\n_**Ult 1 second nerf** I honestly have nothing to say about this. It was so out of the blue and took away so much reactive play potential from Zed after he ults that it&#039;s appalling that the change went through in the first place. It&#039;s kind of funny now that it&#039;s getting partially reverted when it never should have happened in the first place. Again, I have not much to say about this aside from the fact that it makes you want to cry when you&#039;re artificially unable to dash back to your shadow after you ult and get hit by a random Ezreal ulti that you would have otherwise been able to avoid. Your skills are on par, but you are artificially unable to use them. This is TERRIBLE design.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-12T00:25:59.450+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Tomb of Insomnia,\n\nI read your post and can tell you don't necessarily agree with many of the changes that have been made to Zed since his release. However, I'm not really sure what you'd like to discuss.\n\nYou didn't really ask any questions directly, though, so it's hard to decipher whether you're just trying to vent or if you have a particular question or concern about Zed. It would be really useful to me being able to talk to you if you had a specific question or questions that didn't come off quite so much as \"These are the changes Riot has made to Zed, and none of it makes sense.\" I'm not necessarily a Zed expert, but if there is something specific you'd like to ask, I might be able to help.","replies":[{"poster":"Desiderium","date":"2015-08-12T00:36:08.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks so much for responding.\n\nMy OP wasn't really meant for \"questions\" as much as they were just prefacing what I was planning on talking about, that's all. Think of it as just inviting you to comment on them, really. Like what your thoughts were on his ult being changed into a \"free escape\" tool, and his W shadow's speed reduction taking away so much of the feeling of playing him (and the ability to adequately react to enemy skillshots) and whatnot.\n\nSo, what I said were not so much questions, as just kinda things that were inviting you over to speak about them. If that makes sense.\n\nLike, what you feel, personally, about the changes I listed above since his release. And my suggestions. Do you think that would be a good place to start discussing?","replies":[]}]}]}
