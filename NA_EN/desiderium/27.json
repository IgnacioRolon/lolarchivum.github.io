If we can provide more keystone masteries to champions who need them, we&#039;re going to see less Thunderlord&#039;s. Why? Because Thunderlord&#039;s is the best choice ***FOR PEOPLE THAT DON&#039;T HAVE A CHOICE.***\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t nerf Thunderlord&#039;s. Because a year from now when we have 10 more keystone masteries, it&#039;s going to need buffs. And if we leave it the way it is now, a year from now we&#039;ll say &quot;gosh, remember how dumb people were back in the day when they went for Thunderlord&#039;s?&quot; then someone with a brain will say &quot;nah it&#039;s only because they didn&#039;t have a choice.&quot; Choice is what we need, not nerfs.","replies":[]}
