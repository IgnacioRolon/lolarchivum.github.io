Even though I understand that the decision should hold weight - at least up until the event is over to buy the icons with RP? Is that really a terrible idea? Besides, the sides you took give you free icons anyway. I guess the \"price to pay\" for not picking the other icons the first time is to pay for them with RP. Do you think it's really that disagreeable?","replies":[{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-07-25T04:07:51.081+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"they did mention when you pick that you couldn't get the other one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snow Queen","date":"2015-07-26T10:55:39.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, everyone who has gotten their icons so far have earned them..

(freedom, power, truth)\n\nNot that I'm saying they should be sold after the event. Just wondering why that one was different.\n\nAlso IMO, you should have had to pick a side and stick with it through the whole event. (even though I switched sides) That would have given it more weight. Being able to switch feels kinda..meh, I'm just going with whichever icon I like best for the act, ignoring whichever Lore side I would have picked.\n\nIf I had to pick and stay with it, I probably would have went with TF, he seems smarter and knows more about what's going on (so possibly get more information from his side of the story,) also he's still pretty tough for a 'fancy' fellow, probably not a tough as Graves, but still pretty tough on top of being smart/quick witted/etc.\n\nOverall **really** like the event. Just don't like being able to be a turncoat. Then again, pirate event, maybe giving us the traitor feeling was \"calculated.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cuix","date":"2015-07-25T06:19:26.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's about time some of these decisions are being given proper weight.
