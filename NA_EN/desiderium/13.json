He shouldn't be afraid of a tiny mage with a stick.  He should say \"I'm coming for you, bitch!\" and jump at them, leaving them three options.  Run, die, or be manly enough to actually face Trynd and win without kiting, stuns, knockups and all cowardly BS that weaklings use to run away.  \n> \n> I disagree however, that Olaf should get Trynd's ult.  NO ONE should get Trynd's ult.  It's not a very fun ult for the game.  It's a few seconds of \"I can't lose.  A more acceptable alternative would be a somewhat longer duration ult of reduced damage and/or CC or just having his ult give him a large boost to his auto attacks.  Either in lifesteal or in giving him a bonus to shred tanks or something... making Olaf the guy who charges your front line and just screams and CARVES HIS WAY THROUGH.  Trynd would be the \"stop hiding, you wuss!\" who dives the carry and Olaf would be the guy who screams \"GET OUT OF MY WAY!\" and just carves into any fool brave enough to try and stop him.\n\nI think I'd personally like to see Tryn have to build at least a little less glass cannon, but at the same time, if it were Olaf's exact current ult, it gives him some protection, just not when he would actually use the ult, like currently with Olaf.\n\nI just think Tryn tends to stay a bit too safe once he hits his ult, and he should at least have some tradeoff (like Olaf does, though maybe a bit too much sometimes) for hitting that ult, instead of Tryn currently where he hits ult and does whatever he wants.\n\n\nI also say Olaf could trade with Tryn, because Olaf is just missing something from his kit that pushes him to that good place compared to his okay and decent current spot. As it stands, sure his ult makes him immune to CC, but it also makes it a lot easier to flat out kill him. If he was \"immune\" to death for a few second instead, he might be a bit more of a threat instead of \"here comes olaf, just ignore him or kill him\" in fights. \n\nIf he didn't die when he popped his ult, instead you'd WANT to use CC on him to stop him from getting to the backline, and would make Olaf a bit more well rounded in fights instead of a no mobility melee type assassin almost (not always, but couldn't think of a better way to phrase it).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dcchau","date":"2015-07-13T19:14:30.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why doesn't everyone just judge a Champ by it's win rates, if it's a 50% win rate does that say anything?","replies":[]},{"poster":"On Your Side","date":"2015-07-14T15:10:33.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we're going in this direction, there's a lot more changes to be made such as making Nasus unable to Q turrets.

If Tryndamere wants to take your objective, if he wants to void the fact that you are there trying to defend it, he will. He will get his way and there's nothing you can do about it. You might as well be somewhere else once he ults.","replies":[{"poster":"On Your Side","date":"2015-07-24T01:26:46.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except you know, the exact same thing.
