That means you need to be rewarded for getting past his massive range, massive damage poke that costs almost no mana. When you succeed, why should he still be able to toss it up right in front of your face as if he has no weakness? His Defile is fine as an aggressive self-defense tool, as well as his wall. \n\nThink of it this way. Outside of this minimum range, he has his Lay Waste to poke and heavily damage the enemy. When they manage to pass that barrier and enter Karthus's personal space, they need to be *at an advantage.* Even though they're taking damage from Defile, at least they're not getting hit by Lay Waste. It's not a matter of dodging, either; the fact that he can use his poke+zoning+waveclear+nuke spell *at close range* is the issue. Its very existence is toxic.\n\nLay Waste: When not in Death Defied, Lay Waste has a minimum range of 425 (exactly the same as his E's aoe.) The ability cannot be used at any range below this.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[]}
