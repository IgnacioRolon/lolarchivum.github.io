Non-homing, autotarget projectiles should not deal damage to the target after they dash away from its point of landing. This includes \"champion projectiles\" like Fizz and Jax, and now, Jarvan. If you flash or dash out of their landing area, they shouldn't be able to deal damage to you. It's toxic and aggravating and promotes bad play.\n\n2. Fizz's ult needs to not be considered a damage-over-time effect. Because it's considered damage-over-time, you can't dodge the shark when it comes up using untargetability, promoting bad play and extremely aggravating you when you do make a good play. (Zed ult, Fizz pole, Vlad pool, etc.) The shark shouldn't be there if it's a damage-over-time effect (you take damage after 3 seconds no matter what, similar to Zed ult) instead of a \"In 3 seconds, something hits you\" as it seems to imply. The implications of Fizz's ult do not match its actual functionality. The only way you can understand how to play against this ability is going through the illusion of the shark dealing damage to you, and deal with the burden of knowledge. What makes Zed's ult and Vladimir's ult acceptable is because they are *strictly damage over time* and not implying that *something dodgable comes and hits you.* That is where the problem lies.\n\n3. When you move out of an ability's area of effect, it should not deal damage to you. Riot recently fixed this with Tiamat. If you walk out of range of an enemy using Tiamat, if you were in range when they were casting, you will take no damage when they finish casting if you move out of range. This is a good change, although makes Tiamat extremely useless due to its design, which probably merits a rework of the item, as well as the spells that use this aggravating mechanic: dealing damage to you if you were in the area of initial cast but left it by the time the cast completes. Darius's pull is especially dependent on this unhealthy mechanic. Morde's E, Annie's Incinerate, etc. (Oh, and while we're on the topic of Annie's Incinerate, if you use Zed's ult to dodge its cast, it will stun you while you're untargetable. Fix please?)\n\n4. Abilities that are meant to execute (but not all abilities that simply deal % max health damage) need markers to let you know when you can get the kill. Darius doesn't need one thanks to good design with the true damage, and a bit of rapid eye movement. Chogath has one even though he deals true damage (it just takes a bit of addition, but people don't always have the time for that.) but Garen doesn't have a marker even though he deals magic damage, which is reduced and increased depending on resistance and penetration.\n\n5. This one is probably the most important. On release, Zed was one of the most balanced champions Riot ever designed, due to reliance on multiple-angled skillshots and dependence on melee range in addition to extreme squishiness. In some ways, he even needed buffs. But over time, Riot has slowed down the flow of his kit, including a stealth-nerf in the \"buff\" that was the increase in his time in his ult's untargetability, which, in reality, just made him even slower. Let's list off everything that they slowed down about Zed, not including the already mediocre speed of his Q (which was meant to be that way, to help it be dodgable)\n\n_ **E's cooldown.** Went from 3 to 4, nearly identical to his Shuriken's cooldown. Your shurikens are supposed to be something you measure; something you need to be sure to hit before you cast it, due to its slow speed and thin hitbox. So, why does his E, a low-damage melee-range ability, have to have such a lengthy cooldown, on a champion that is built around Energy? Think about it. The intent behind E's design was to be spammed if you have the energy, and if you're in range. How much you can spam it is dependent upon your ability to land a double Q, or a double E, to gain your energy back. So, what sense does it make to make it a 4 second cooldown? I guess it's supposed to try to reduce his split-pushing power, which was extremely strong back in the day. In that case, why not reduce his attack speed instead, and keep the flow and speed and integrity of his kit intact? Oh wait, that is what they did...yet E remains in a nerfed, extremely slow state. Keep this in mind, because you will soon see that Riot has a habit of nerfing things the wrong way with this champion, then nerfing the RIGHT way to get what they were originally after, without undoing the previous wrong nerf. You will see this again when I begin talking about his ult.\n\n_ **W's projectile speed.** They said that they wanted Zed to think about where he places his shadows, instead of just throwing them willy nilly while making plays. However, all they *really* did was make it nearly impossible to use W to dodge skillshots, which was about 90% of what made the skill so fun to watch and use. I remember the first day I tried playing Zed after the reduction to his W's speed. I was against a Brand. I could remember always dodging his Pillar of Flame, because he was misplaying and only used it on me whenever I had my shadow up. His bad plays, my good plays. *Not anymore.* Now, I couldn't dodge his pillar with W unless I happened to have it out somewhere already, which is extremely unreliable, on a champion that isn't meant to have unreliability except in his Q. I got hit with it *every time* despite the fact that this Brand kept using his Pillar on a target that had his dodgability and mobility open. Except this time...the target didn't have it open. He didn't have that ability anymore. Brand was just doing the first thing he thought, with no heed to my ability to dodge or not. His misplaying, my....***inability to make a good play.*** Riot...you know...for people that like to make articles about \"rewarding good play\" you seem pretty hypocritical in your balance changes sometimes. Additionally, this serves to further slow down Zed's kit, reducing his integrity as a fast, speedy, *reactive* ninja.\n\n_ **Ult.** Remember when I was talking about E, when I said Riot likes to nerf things the wrong way, then do it the right way, without undoing the wrong nerfs? Here we are again. Not only does the untargetability increase slow his kit and flow down even further, Zed no longer has easy ways to regain his energy after he ults, since the shadow spawns where he ults rather than behind the target. Since his E's spam is so dependent on his energy upon engaging, and his ability to regain it...why does the cooldown remain in a nerfed state, despite the fact that he no longer has easy ways to get his energy back? Think about it, seriously. It's to the point where using W to try to get your energy back ends up being a Noob Trap because the energy spent in casting W can give you a net loss in energy regain because of where they moved R's shadow. Yet, despite this, Riot doesn't bother to give Zed more depth in choice, because they are under the belief that buffing a cooldown would buff the character overall. No. Zed is such an intricately made champion. With characters like him, sometimes decreasing a cooldown or increasing some numbers will offer more *choice* or more *intricacy* rather than simply making the character more *strong* and that is what Riot fears, preventing them from making changes to this champion that need to happen.\n\nI don't know how many of these haven't been done due to things like game engine limitations or something (I mean, I guess it could be an excuse, judging from **how long** most of these issues have gone on without being addressed) but that doesn't change the fact that numbers 1 through 4 are extremely aggravating game mechanics that NEED to go.\n\nWhat are your personal opinions about what changes League needs?\n\nEdit: God I hate this forum's formatting.","replies":[]}
