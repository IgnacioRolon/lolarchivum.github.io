This &quot;bug&quot; has been present since Zed&#039;s release, and you&#039;ve only noticed it recently because his shadow is three times slower than it was on release.\n\nYou could try fixing this self-made bug by increasing the shadow speed back to normal.\n\n***DISCLAIMER:*** I am not \"bitching about a nerf to my main\" I am calling out Riot for shitty balancing and \"bug fixing\" and giving them alternate advice on how to fix it.","replies":[]}
