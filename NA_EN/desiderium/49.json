I mean compared to the rest of the game, right now they are OP. But you need to think deeper than that. Why would top lane, the \"island\" of the map, need the objective control of smite? Because the upgrades are just that powerful. They might as well not even have the true damage to monsters part of it. I've watched people win games with top lane CInderhulk without ever remembering to use Smite on....*anything.* Now what if we had new summoner spells that can fulfill all these niches? \r\n\r\nFor red smite - what about a duelist summoner spell? Take a % less damage from and deal % more damage to a certain target. % scales with levels.\r\n\r\nI know the design behind the different smite spells is to give Junglers more strategic choice (Do I save Smite for the coming Dragon fight or do I Smite the enemy during my gank, etc) but the reason why laners are using it is because of the actives, and the reason why the actives are worth it is because we don't have enough summoner spell diversity.\r\n\r\nRiot let me make this clear: It's not that you made a \"mistake\" with the new Smite. In fact, all that has really been exposed is that we don't have enough summoner spells (or useful summoner spells) which you have known for a very long time already but I guess now is when that wound in the game is finally festering. You can only go so long with a part of a game not being fixed or helped in any way until things like this happen. \r\n\r\nOne final note about your \"let's sit and watch for a bit\" plans with Cinderhulk: I like the thought, but you guys need to understand the difference between \"let's wait and watch how people deal with it\" and \"wow this is just blatantly, clearly, and unarguably overpowered and there's no amount of time or adaptation that can fix this.\"","replies":[]}
