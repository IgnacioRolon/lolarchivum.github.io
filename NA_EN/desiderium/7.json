But it&#039;s worth noting that it had 80 instead of 100 because his W requires such a high amount of mana and needs to be used fairly often in order to win the lane as Talon. It is my belief that his ultimate&#039;s mana cost wasn&#039;t standard because of this, in order to keep him a viable champion.\n\nAlso, that&#039;s a rather drastic cooldown increase. Since the nerfs he received a couple years ago to his base values and scaling values, his ultimate hasn&#039;t been a hard hitting spell in the first half of the game. What&#039;s the context behind reducing its availability? \n\nThanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-02-28T05:55:53.096+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":5,"body":"There are a couple of things behind that Talon nerf:\n\n1. We believe assassins are healthiest when a proportion of their burst's gated behind a long CD, particularly if they've got a really reliable kill pattern. By nature of their high target selection and burst assassins tend to have lower tactical counterplay than most other classes, so giving their opponents a window to play with where they're noticeably weaker's important. Talon's certainly not the only assassin with that issue either.\n\n2. We do think Talon is too strong however. He's been on the strong side in solo queue for a really long period of time. We've held off on nerfing him in the past though since his play rate hasn't been that high so he hasn't been an urgent issue. At this point though he's been too strong for long enough we feel it's the appropriate time to act, hence the above nerf aimed at making him a bit healthier as well as cutting a bit of power.\n\n\nLong term we do want to do some more substantial work on Talon. In particular if we do an assassin class update at some point he'd be one of the most likely candidates for moderate sized changes, given he's got a theme with a lot of potential but a kit that does really standard stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"RedCyclone","date":"2016-02-28T06:03:54.201+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":52,"body":"\"We believe assassins are healthiest when a proportion of their burst's gated behind a long CD\"\n\n{{champion:238}} hurhurhurhurhurhur","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2016-02-28T06:07:54.029+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RedCyclone,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7e6GlIXg,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-02-28T06:03:54.201+0000)\n>\n> \"We believe assassins are healthiest when a proportion of their burst's gated behind a long CD\"\n> \n> {{champion:238}} hurhurhurhurhurhur\n\nTalon ult: 75/65/55\nTalon ult post-nerf: 100/80/60\nZed ult: 120/100/80\n\nNothing hypocritical here.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2016-02-28T09:11:40.954+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":25,"body":"Zed's ult makes him UNTARGETABLE and enables him to pull lots of screwy shenanigans in good hands.

His laning is already incredibly weak and he's gated by mana. His ult is his escape as well and there is already counter-play in the form of true sight. Are you ever going to address the fact that his passive is still garbage and his E is nonexistent until late-game aside from being a conditional blink that is on a long cool-down. High win-rate is inflated by the low-pick rate. Most of the players who pick talon are good with him and usually as a counter-pick.\n\nI'm still kind of salty about the insulting .25s SLOW that you replaced his silence with. Please for the love of god take his damage amp (maxed last) his passive and that garbage slow and give him utility. It's frustrating to see you all randomly nerfing champions out of the blue that don't even need it half as bad as Freelora who is still very strong after her nerfs. Max% hp true damage scaling with AD is the worst design I have ever seen bar none.\n\nHe's either useless all game or a god. His E damage amp isn't even noticeable late-game because it's just overkill. The most lack luster part of his entire kit with the exception of his passive which to this day remains one of the least useful for an AD casting assassin. There is a reason Zed is picked over Talon in competitive. \n\nTalon seems to be Riot's red-headed step-child.\n\nFun fact {{champion:55}} ultimate death lotus cool-down is 90/60/45 seconds and she doesn't have to worry about mana at all. Just received buffs. Her laning is also better and she has an escape with a passive that is miles superior, rewarding her for pulling off an assassination.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Edge of Daybreak","date":"2016-02-28T06:22:30.631+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7e6GlIXg,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2016-02-28T06:11:54.587+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, Zed's a good example of this principle.

Her q does more overall dmg and is harder to hit. They may increase the cd on her ult, but it isn't gonna have so much impact that you can just go about your business not caring about her q's and e's. Her q's are relatively easy to dodge if you're laning against her and as long as you have wards around you, it would be difficult to actually get hit by a q in other lanes. As it is, most ppl have the Starguardian skin, which makes her ult immensely easy to dodge if you watch for it, since it starts wider than classic skin and 520-750rp skins. And if you so happen to play against a lux without it, it's just about watching for it and not going to recall in obvious places like under your turret. If you recall under your turret, get killed by her ult, and the blame the champ, you have no one to blame but yourself. That's like asking for a nerf to Ashe cause she executed you with her ult from bot lane cause she accurately guessed you were recalling under your turret. In the end, like any champ, Lux is only strong if you let her be. She has strong counters and most mid champs can kill her easily as long as you don't go about it stupidly. Syndra is often a strong pick, but also, Zed and Talon can shred her and shut her down for the rest of the game relatively easily.\n\nMy point is, Lux isn't gonna be that hurt from the nerfs that are most likely to come. Getting hit by a q is still more than likely going to get you killed even if she does get nerfed cause like every other champ with a bind or hook, she'll either have the dmg or the team to jump on it and kill you. To say she's annoying cause of her poke is ridiculous when her e has less dmg on it than her q and it's a skillshot, not a point and click. Sure, it has a slow built in, but it's easily avoidable if you watch how the player moves around with her and the e has a high mana cost, esp early game. q leaves her exposed as well, she has to step out from behind her minions, leaving her exposed to binds and hooks on your team. I've seen many Lux's get utterly destroyed cause they get shut down by the mid or the mid and jung cause they know how to avoid the binds and e's. Just keep in mind, {{champion:103}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:412}} can all take advantage of that lack of minion cover when a Lux goes to q. Not to mention, like Yousosmart said, ppl can always just get {{item:3102}} to counter the bind, or build some mr to reduce her dmg.

Overall power impact's probably not that high, it's a change we believe appropriate regardless of her power level though so we wanted to put that out first and then assess what else to do with it in place.\n> \n> Lux I suspect we'll also act on soon, I haven't talked to the Live Gameplay team (group that handles balance for champions/items once they've been in the game for more than a few patches) about her in detail recently though, so not 100% certain as to their thinking as to how out of line she is/isn't and what the appropriate things to nerf might be.\n\nIt feels like you guys are making balance decisions based on how much people whine about something rather than how objectively strong said thing is. Lux is top tier and without huge weaknesses but I doubt she's actually OP. Maybe I'm wrong though since several mid champions got nerfed, but one thing I'm definitely not wrong on is that Devourer isn't an OP item. \n\nWhoever thought nerfing this item in the current meta is an intelligent decision needs to be put into an asylum without ever having access to LoL code again. None of the Devourer champions are strong enough to be considered in competitive for any region. To talk about \"diversity\" and then nerf a large class of champions who aren't even visible in top tier play is incredibly hypocritical. Just because people often fail to adapt to Devourer junglers correctly doesn't make them OP. If someone never dodged Xerath skillshots, would Xerath be OP too? \n\nAlso, if Riot really wants to nerf champions that aren't even viable at the highest levels, why nerf the core item which is used on many other champions too? Is Riot going to now buff Aatrox and Nocturne as compensation? I doubt someone clueless enough to think Devourer nerfs make sense even thought that far. Yi and Shyvana are the only good Devourer junglers right now so why ruin the item for everyone else too?\n\nIf they really are problems, nerf those champions or Rageblade - at the very least don't nerf Devourer's maximum damage along with the time it takes to get Sated. It's just such a completely nutty way of going about things. This would be akin to finding that Lucian is too strong and then nerfing IE or Berserker's despite them being core for countless other ADCs. I'm not even saying this to preserve some secret Devourer freelo - I'm avoiding ranked till there's Solo Queue since I think DQ isn't a valid ranking system. So my rambling isn't even selfish; it's just an assessment of the situation. It's driving me mad that people were actually hired to balance the game and come up with ideas this moronic while there are so many other better alternatives even for the questionable goal they have in mind. I hope there is at least one sane person on the Riot balance team. The latest Kog R/Q/W changes gave me some brief hope.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blitzedlegend","date":"2016-02-28T08:14:12.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel as though roots and snares and other cc that stop you from moving but still let you attack should stop the dash but others shouldnt stop it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Elwynn","date":"2016-02-28T21:11:23.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=M00NMAN,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7e6GlIXg,comment-id=00030000000000000001,timestamp=2016-02-28T06:22:30.631+0000)\n>\n> Sorry for going off track but you held off nerfing talon due to pickrate which is perfectly reasonable but well since you are here what's keeping lux and ahri safe because they have over double his pickrate with about the same winrate and I think we can agree that ahri charm nerf was negligible and lux is getting nothing done here.

Hilariously Ahri has a positive winrate against every mid lane champion with a dash post nerf. Wanna know the best part? The champions that counter her hardest are the ones without dashes at all. So once again negligible for the people who aren't stupid aka you and people who think like you. As for the rest of us we will wait for a real nerf as this one was negligible.

It hardly does anything, it adheres to the whole \"empty stats\" with barely any interaction from the player. Sure it's some damage whenever you use W or E, but unless you're paired with a really cc heavy team, it's not going to do much. \n\nI can understand nerfing the CD of the ult, but the mana cost? He's already got mana troubles in lane due to his inability to kill targets pre-6. He's one of the few assassins that is really gated by mana this early. He relies heavily on his W to harass/farm, but with the removal of mana pots, he's pretty helpless in lane unless he gets corrupted potion, which still only takes the edge off because 50 mana isn't even enough for one W. Other assassins can either kill early or aren't gated by mana as heavily. The only reason his play rate is so high right now is because of {{item:3147}} . If you happen to look at the pick rates, both Talon and Zed jumped in popularity when it released. Nerfing Talon's mana costs when he isn't really that great in a spot only makes it so no one picks him again. Zed's got a more stabilized win rate thanks to the fact that he's got such a high pick rate, it balances out. Talon's is a rollercoaster due to his low pick rate, it changes slightly with each patch, and with the various different players that actually decide to play him. Zed can do everything Talon can do but better for the most part: waveclear, safety, last hitting. The only thing Talon can do that Zed can't is more AoE damage because he's got two spells that can do that, while zed mainly has one, while the other weakens dramatically after the first hit. Talon can't buy more mana regen because all mana regen items are AP except for {{item:3508}} which could be viable for him, but he's better off getting more armor penetration or flat damage in order to maximize his damage. Crits would rarely help him win a lane thanks to their RNG nature.\n\nTL;DR Nerfing Talon's mana cost is just going to put him back into obscurity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZLbSwAR23I","date":"2016-02-28T11:56:13.221+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7e6GlIXg,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-02-28T05:55:53.096+0000)\n>\n> There are a couple of things behind that Talon nerf:\n> \n> 1. We believe assassins are healthiest when a proportion of their burst's gated behind a long CD, particularly if they've got a really reliable kill pattern. By nature of their high target selection and burst assassins tend to have lower tactical counterplay than most other classes, so giving their opponents a window to play with where they're noticeably weaker's important. Talon's certainly not the only assassin with that issue either.\n> \n> 2. We do think Talon is too strong however. He's been on the strong side in solo queue for a really long period of time. We've held off on nerfing him in the past though since his play rate hasn't been that high so he hasn't been an urgent issue. At this point though he's been too strong for long enough we feel it's the appropriate time to act, hence the above nerf aimed at making him a bit healthier as well as cutting a bit of power.\n> \n> \n> Long term we do want to do some more substantial work on Talon. In particular if we do an assassin class update at some point he'd be one of the most likely candidates for moderate sized changes, given he's got a theme with a lot of potential but a kit that does really standard stuff.\n\n\nYou're not doing anything to address his abysmal early game, though. Talon is already a very niche pick. Severely harming his only escape tool early just makes his early game worse. I am fine with increasing his R cooldown because honestly, it's ridiculous. However, you need to compensate for that by helping him out in other areas because otherwise he's just a sitting duck in midlane when trying to farm. Maybe reduce the mana cost on his W?","replies":[]}]}]}
